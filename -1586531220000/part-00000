They are one of the feeder teams for the [[India national under-23 football team]] and the senior [[India national football team]].\n\nThis team is for Indian players aged under 19 at the start of the calendar year in which a two-year [[AFC U-19 Championship]] campaign begins, and as such, some players can remain with the squad until the age of 21. As long as they are eligible, players can play for India at any level, making it possible to play for the U19s first, then the senior side, and again back to playing for the U19s. It is also possible to play for one country at youth level and another at senior level (provided the player is eligible).\n\n==History==\n\nAs an Asian U19 team, India competes for the [[AFC U-19 Championship|Asian Championship]], with the finals every even-numbered year, formerly odd-numbered years. There is no Under-19 World Cup, although there is an [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|Under-20 World Cup]]. This team also participate in the [[SAFF U-19 Championship]] which started from 2015 by South Asian Football federation.\n\n===1959\u22121970===\nFor the first four seasons of [[AFC U-19 Championship]], from 1959 to 1962 the Indian team did not enter into the tournament though there was no qualification round. India first participated in the AFC U-19 Championships in [[1963 AFC Youth Championship|1963]] but did not move ahead from the group stage. the first best result came at the [[1966 AFC Youth Championship|1966]] edition where the team entered in the quarter finals with 3 wins against Burma, Japan and Singapore and a defeat by china but in the quarter final they lost to Israel by 4\u22120. In the next edition at [[1967 AFC Youth Championship]] India again entered in the quarter final. First a draw of 1\u22121 against Israel and then defeating Malaysia by 4\u22121 but same as 1966 they again defeated in the quarter final, this time by Indonesia by 2\u22126. In 1968, the team didn't move beyond group stage, and next two edition of 1969 and 1970 India did not enter in the championships.\n\n===1971\u22121979===\nIn [[1971 AFC Youth Championship|1971]], they again reached the quarter final for the third time in AFC championships, but the fate was same as again saw a defeat, now against Japan by 0\u22123. But, after a gap of two more edition, it was [[1974 AFC Youth Championship]], where India seen the golden moment after becoming champions in AFC Under-19 Championships. First in group stage India defeat both Laos and Burma by 1\u22120 and a draw against Hong Kong by 2\u22122. Then entering in the quarter final they defeated Singapore by 1(4)\u22121(1), thus reached semi-finals where defeating Thailand by 2\u22121, for the first time India reached the final of the Championship. But the final was a draw against Iran by 2\u22122 thus jointly awarded both the team as the Champions. In 1975 and 1976 edition India didn't do much well but at [[1977 AFC Youth Championship]] they reached the quarter final but the opponent was Iran, the defending Champion who defeated India by 3\u22120, thus failed to qualify for the first [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA World Youth Championship]] in [[1977 FIFA World Youth Championship|1977]] which later came to be known as FIFA U-20 World Cup and also failed to qualify at the 1979 edition.\n\n===1980\u22122000, the decline===\nThese two decades saw a decline in the performance of the Indian team. Qualification round started from [[1980 AFC Youth Championship]] and India failed to qualify in 6 out of 11 edition of the championships and in rest 5 edition the failed to move beyond the group stage, thus also failed to qualify for the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] as the finalist were only to be qualified for the competition.\n\n===2002\u22122017 Rise and Fall===\nIn [[2002 AFC Youth Championship|2002]], at the [[AFC Youth Championship|AFC U-19 Championship]], India reached the quarter final for the 6th time, by the virtue of third-place qualifiers, but defeated heavily by South Korea, where the Korean found the Indian net 7 times. Next two editions they ended their competition in group stages and next 7 editions from [[2008 AFC U-19 Championship|2008]] to [[2018 AFC U-19 Championship|2018]], India failed to qualify again for the championships and so for the FIFA U20 Worldcup.\n\nIn the meanwhile, [[South Asian Football Federation|SAFF]] started [[SAFF U-19 Championship]] from [[2015 SAFF U-19 Championship|2015]] to develop the youth teams of South Asian countries as they continuously failing to qualify for AFC U-20 championships. In the 2015 inaugural edition, India became runners-up facing a defeat from Nepal through a penalty shoot out. In the next edition in [[2017 SAFF U-18 Championship|2017]], the tournament was a round robin, where India saw two wins against Bhutan and Maldives and two defeats from Bangladesh and Nepal, thus achieved the third place in the tournament.\n\n===2018\u2212Present===\nThe AIFF finally acted and opened their eyes to bring out the team from its misery and started various plans and programmes to tackle to present a pathetic situation. One of the most important steps is international exposure to the youth and under 17 teams.\nIndia's U-20 team was invited to participate in [[L'Alc\u00fadia International Football Tournament|Cotif Tournament]] where clubs and national and autonomous teams participate every year since 1984, held at Valencia, Spain. 2018 Cotif was 35th Anniversary of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=The COTIF lives the presentation of its 35th anniversary|url=http://www.cotifalcudia.com/cotif-vive-la-presentacion-35o-aniversario/|accessdate=9 October 2016|work=Cotifalcudia|date=19 July 2018}}</ref> Though India lost two consecutive matches against Spanish club Murcia then against Mauritania, they managed a draw against a stronger Latin American side of [[Venezuela national under-20 football team|Venezuela]], but on the final group match on 5 August 2018, the Indian side written a piece of history when they defeated the most successful [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|U-20 Worldcup]] winning nation [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina]].

They are one of the feeder teams for the [[India national under-23 football team]] and the senior [[India national football team]].\n\nThis team is for Indian players aged under 19 at the start of the calendar year in which a two-year [[AFC U-19 Championship]] campaign begins, and as such, some players can remain with the squad until the age of 21. As long as they are eligible, players can play for India at any level, making it possible to play for the U19s first, then the senior side, and again back to playing for the U19s. It is also possible to play for one country at youth level and another at senior level (provided the player is eligible).\n\n==History==\n\nAs an Asian U19 team, India competes for the [[AFC U-19 Championship|Asian Championship]], with the finals every even-numbered year, formerly odd-numbered years. There is no Under-19 World Cup, although there is an [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|Under-20 World Cup]]. This team also participate in the [[SAFF U-19 Championship]] which started from 2015 by South Asian Football federation.\n\n===1959\u22121970===\nFor the first four seasons of [[AFC U-19 Championship]], from 1959 to 1962 the Indian team did not enter into the tournament though there was no qualification round. India first participated in the AFC U-19 Championships in [[1963 AFC Youth Championship|1963]] but did not move ahead from the group stage. the first best result came at the [[1966 AFC Youth Championship|1966]] edition where the team entered in the quarter finals with 3 wins against Burma, Japan and Singapore and a defeat by china but in the quarter final they lost to Israel by 4\u22120. In the next edition at [[1967 AFC Youth Championship]] India again entered in the quarter final. First a draw of 1\u22121 against Israel and then defeating Malaysia by 4\u22121 but same as 1966 they again defeated in the quarter final, this time by Indonesia by 2\u22126. In 1968, the team didn't move beyond group stage, and next two edition of 1969 and 1970 India did not enter in the championships.\n\n===1971\u22121979===\nIn [[1971 AFC Youth Championship|1971]], they again reached the quarter final for the third time in AFC championships, but the fate was same as again saw a defeat, now against Japan by 0\u22123. But, after a gap of two more edition, it was [[1974 AFC Youth Championship]], where India seen the golden moment after becoming champions in AFC Under-19 Championships. First in group stage India defeat both Laos and Burma by 1\u22120 and a draw against Hong Kong by 2\u22122. Then entering in the quarter final they defeated Singapore by 1(4)\u22121(1), thus reached semi-finals where defeating Thailand by 2\u22121, for the first time India reached the final of the Championship. But the final was a draw against Iran by 2\u22122 thus jointly awarded both the team as the Champions. In 1975 and 1976 edition India didn't do much well but at [[1977 AFC Youth Championship]] they reached the quarter final but the opponent was Iran, the defending Champion who defeated India by 3\u22120, thus failed to qualify for the first [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA World Youth Championship]] in [[1977 FIFA World Youth Championship|1977]] which later came to be known as FIFA U-20 World Cup and also failed to qualify at the 1979 edition.\n\n===1980\u22122000, the decline===\nThese two decades saw a decline in the performance of the Indian team. Qualification round started from [[1980 AFC Youth Championship]] and India failed to qualify in 6 out of 11 edition of the championships and in rest 5 edition the failed to move beyond the group stage, thus also failed to qualify for the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] as the finalist were only to be qualified for the competition.\n\n===2002\u22122017 Rise and Fall===\nIn [[2002 AFC Youth Championship|2002]], at the [[AFC Youth Championship|AFC U-19 Championship]], India reached the quarter final for the 6th time, by the virtue of third-place qualifiers, but defeated heavily by South Korea, where the Korean found the Indian net 7 times. Next two editions they ended their competition in group stages and next 7 editions from [[2008 AFC U-19 Championship|2008]] to [[2018 AFC U-19 Championship|2018]], India failed to qualify again for the championships and so for the FIFA U20 Worldcup.\n\nIn the meanwhile, [[South Asian Football Federation|SAFF]] started [[SAFF U-19 Championship]] from [[2015 SAFF U-19 Championship|2015]] to develop the youth teams of South Asian countries as they continuously failing to qualify for AFC U-20 championships. In the 2015 inaugural edition, India became runners-up facing a defeat from Nepal through a penalty shoot out. In the next edition in [[2017 SAFF U-18 Championship|2017]], the tournament was a round robin, where India saw two wins against Bhutan and Maldives and two defeats from Bangladesh and Nepal, thus achieved the third place in the tournament.\n\n===2018\u2212Present===\nThe AIFF finally acted and opened their eyes to bring out the team from its misery and started various plans and programmes to tackle to present a pathetic situation. One of the most important steps is international exposure to the youth and under 17 teams.\nIndia's U-20 team was invited to participate in [[L'Alc\u00fadia International Football Tournament|Cotif Tournament]] where clubs and national and autonomous teams participate every year since 1984, held at Valencia, Spain. 2018 Cotif was 35th Anniversary of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=The COTIF lives the presentation of its 35th anniversary|url=http://www.cotifalcudia.com/cotif-vive-la-presentacion-35o-aniversario/|accessdate=9 October 2016|work=Cotifalcudia|date=19 July 2018}}</ref> Though India lost two consecutive matches against Spanish club Murcia then against Mauritania, they managed a draw against a stronger Latin American side of [[Venezuela national under-20 football team|Venezuela]], but on the final group match on 5 August 2018, the Indian side written a piece of history when they defeated the most successful [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|U-20 Worldcup]] winning nation [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina]].

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.\n[[File:William Christopher Macdonald.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]], 4th [[List of McGill University people#List of chancellors|Chancellor of McGill University]], created a Chair in Architecture at McGill in 1896.]]\n\nIn 1896, [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. Three new staff were hired in 1906, and three years later, [[Philip J.

At this time, the principal of McGill, [[Lewis Williams Douglas]], considered phasing out architectural education at the university due to low enrollment; however he faced a great deal of backlash from Turner and several famous architects from Montreal, and eventually abandoned the idea.

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|war]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school. \n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design.

Later that year, the graduate planning program was reorganized by Professor David Farley, which resulted in the establishment of the independent School of Urban Planning on the fourth floor of the [[Macdonald-Harrington Building]].

Macdonald-Harrington was initially named the Macdonald Chemistry Building but was renamed after Bernard Harrington, the building's first chemistry professor. The building is one of the many donations made by [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William Macdonald]] and was designed by Sir Andrew Taylor to accommodate the Departments of Chemistry and Mining in 1896. The building was renovated for architecture and urban planning students by architects [[Arcop]] in 1987.<ref name=CAC />\n\nIn 1989, the PhD in Architecture was introduced as an ''ad hoc'' program. In 1990, Derek Drummond returned for another six years as the School's director, replaced by Professor David Covo in 1996. In 1997, the PhD program was officially approved by the Minister of Education as the first in Canada,<ref name=CanadianArchitect /> and the School had its first PhD graduate, Lily Chi. In 1999, the professional BArch degree was replaced by the new MArchI professional degree, leaving the undergraduate BSc in architecture. Two years later, the School graduated its first class in the MArchI program.<ref name=Highlights /> \n\nIn 2003, philanthropist [[David Azrieli]] endowed an annual lecture at the School, called the [[McGill School of Architecture#Lecture Series|David J.

GASA is known to hold \"Late Night\" events on Thursdays, popular among students from all programs in the School.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engage/overview/faculty-and-school-associations/graduate-faculty-and-school-associations|title=Graduate Faculty and School Associations, Engage McGill|accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS)===\nAs of 2019, the School of Architecture has established a chapter of the [[American Institute of Architecture Students]], an international, non-profit, student-run organization dedicated to providing progressive programs, information and resources on critical issues to architecture students.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.aias.org/chapter/mcgill-university/|title=McGill University, Northeast Quad|publisher=American Institute of Architecture Students/accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Exchange and Study Abroad===\nThe Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture has close ties to several architecture schools across the world and has formal bilateral exchange agreements on a departmental level with seven schools in particular, including [[The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Politecnico di Milano]] in [[Milan]], [[Tongji University]] in [[Shanghai]], [[\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Architecture de Paris-Belleville]], [[:fr:\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Grenoble|\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Grenoble]], [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]] in [[Brussels]] and [[TU Wien]] in [[Vienna]]. These bilateral agreements make it easy for undergraduate architecture students at McGill to go on exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/bscarch_programadvisingandcourseregistration-fall_2018.pdf|title=B.Sc.(Arch.) program and Architecture Exchange Students (New and Returning Students) - STUDENT EXCHANGES|page=5|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nStudents also have the opportunity to spend an exchange semester abroad at any of McGill University's 160+ partner institutions<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/mcgillabroad/mcgill-students-going-abroad/global-learning-opportunities|title=McGill students going abroad|publisher=McGill Abroad, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> as long as they offer architecture exchanges, however these are more difficult to coordinate due to the competitive nature of University-wide exchanges. In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School. In some studios, the ratio can be as high as 8:1, such as is the case for the undergraduate class of 2021.<ref name=Enrollment />\n\n==Lecture series==\nEach year, the School of Architecture presents public lectures, exhibitions and symposia showcasing leading architects and important figures in the field. These lectures are organized by various individuals and organizations affiliated with the School. Lecture Series include lunchtime \"Brown Bag\" lectures organized by the McGill Architecture Students' Association, evening lectures sponsored by local Montreal firms such as Provencher Roy & [[NEUF Architect(e)s]],<ref name=LectureSeries /> and most notably, the annual [[David Azrieli|David J.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.\n[[File:William Christopher Macdonald.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]], 4th [[List of McGill University people#List of chancellors|Chancellor of McGill University]], created a Chair in Architecture at McGill in 1896.]]\n\nIn 1896, [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. Three new staff were hired in 1906, and three years later, [[Philip J. Turner]] joined the faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/nobbs|title=Legacy of Nobbs, History by Norbert Schoenauer|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, [[Ramsay Traquair (architect)|Ramsay Traquair]] became the new director of the School.

[[Arthur Lismer]], a founding member of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], taught this course at the School for over a decade starting in 1941.<ref name=Lismer>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/library/channels/event/exhibition-arthur-lismers-mcgill-sketchbook-240235|title=Exhibition: Arthur Lismer\u2019s McGill Sketchbook|publisher=McGill Library|year=2015|accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1939, Turner succeeded Traquair, who had completed a 26-year tenure as director of the School. At this time, the principal of McGill, [[Lewis Williams Douglas]], considered phasing out architectural education at the university due to low enrollment; however he faced a great deal of backlash from Turner and several famous architects from Montreal, and eventually abandoned the idea.

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|war]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school. \n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design. He and Bland established the first post-graduate architecture and planning program in Canada.

Later that year, the graduate planning program was reorganized by Professor David Farley, which resulted in the establishment of the independent School of Urban Planning on the fourth floor of the [[Macdonald-Harrington Building]]. Over the next decade and a half, the School changed directorship three times, with Professor Norbert Schoenauer heading the School from 1972 until 1975, Professor Derek Drummond from 1975 until 1985 and Professor Bruce Anderson in 1985.<ref name=Highlights /> \n\nIn 1987, the School moved from the Engineering building to the Macdonald-Harrington Building. Macdonald-Harrington was initially named the Macdonald Chemistry Building but was renamed after Bernard Harrington, the building's first chemistry professor. The building is one of the many donations made by [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William Macdonald]] and was designed by Sir Andrew Taylor to accommodate the Departments of Chemistry and Mining in 1896. The building was renovated for architecture and urban planning students by architects [[Arcop]] in 1987.<ref name=CAC />\n\nIn 1989, the PhD in Architecture was introduced as an ''ad hoc'' program. In 1990, Derek Drummond returned for another six years as the School's director, replaced by Professor David Covo in 1996. In 1997, the PhD program was officially approved by the Minister of Education as the first in Canada,<ref name=CanadianArchitect /> and the School had its first PhD graduate, Lily Chi. In 1999, the professional BArch degree was replaced by the new MArchI professional degree, leaving the undergraduate BSc in architecture. Two years later, the School graduated its first class in the MArchI program.<ref name=Highlights /> \n\nIn 2003, philanthropist [[David Azrieli]] endowed an annual lecture at the School, called the [[McGill School of Architecture#Lecture Series|David J.

FARMM is located on the first floor of the Macdonald-Harrington Building, and contains state-of-the-art networking, simulation and imaging, and fabrication infrastructure.<ref name=FARMM />\n\n=== John Bland Canadian Architecture Collection===\nThe [[Canadian Architecture Collection]] (CAC) is one of the [[McGill University Library|McGill Libraries]]' Special Collections, and is a very important resource for architecture and urban planning students. Students and professors at these schools are required to document their work and then give them to the Canadian Architecture Collection for safe-keeping. \n\nThe Collection currently consists of over 157,240 drawings, 25,000 photographs and 11,780 slides, 190 models, 300 maps and 400 metres of papers of 19th- and 20th-century architects in Canada. The largest fond of major Canadian architects is that of [[Moshe Safdie]], who donated his archives to the collection with an ongoing bequest since 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/moshesafdie/history.html|title=The Moshe Safdie Archive|publisher=McGill Library|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> The CAC also includes 770 student papers from the course \"History of Architecture in Canada\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/resources/collection|title=John Bland Canadian Architecture Collection|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Architecture Slide Library===\nThe Architecture Slide Library contains more than 40,000 images, of which nineteenth- and twentieth-century images are the most heavily used. They are stored in Room 310 of the Macdonald-Harrington building, while slides from earlier periods are stored in the Media Centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/resources/slides|title=Architecture Slide Library|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Orson Wheeler Architectural Model Collection===\nThe Orson Wheeler Architectural Model Collection contains over two hundred scale  architectural models of structures from around the world. The models were created between 1940 and 1990 by Orson Wheeler, a sculptor and former professor at McGill's School of Architecture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/resources/model|title=Orson Wheeler Architectural Model Collection|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nA small collection of his works are on display in the front vestibule of the Macdonald-Harrington building.\n\n=== Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art===\nThe Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art is the University's parent library for the Schools of Architecture and Urban Planning, and is located on the upper floor of the Humanities and Social Sciences Library, one of thirteen branches of the McGill Library.\n\nThe library was established through a donation from the family of the late Gordon H. Blackader, one of the first students to study at the School of Architecture whose life was cut short during World War&nbsp;I. The library was renamed the Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art during the 1940s after the family of sculptor [[Dinah Lauterman]] donated in her memory. \n\nThe library contains over 79,000 monographs and journal subscriptions, and has a substantial collection of over 3000 rare books from 1511 to 2009 housed in the [[Rare Books and Special Collections Library]] at McGill. This includes a fine collection of original works by [[G.&nbsp;B. Piranesi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/resources/library|title=Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Centre Canadien Architecture Montreal.JPG|thumb|220px|right|[[Canadian Centre for Architecture]], view of Shaughnessy House.]]\n===Canadian Centre for Architecture===\nStudents are always welcome to visit the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture|Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA)]], which houses one of the largest architectural design collections in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/news/2019/02/the-government-of-canada-supports-the-canadian-centre-for-architecture.html|title=The Government of Canada supports the Canadian Centre for Architecture|publisher=Government of Canada|date=11 February 2019|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> just a 20-minute walk away from the downtown campus.

The society represents all undergraduate students in the School of Architecture, organizes student activities and affairs and acts as a voice for students in issues at McGill.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://mcgill.ca/engineering/students/undergraduate/student-life/student-groups-associations|title=Student Groups & Associations, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref> The ASA is chaired by the President and run by an Executive Council composed of six Vice-President portfolios: Academic, Internal, External, Administration, Finance and Student Life. A student representative from each undergraduate year is also elected to sit on the Council. \n\nPart of the ASA's mandate is to maintain the ASA Supply Store where students can purchase drafting kits as well as the architecture lounge, also known as the \"Cellar\".<ref name=Cellar />\n\n===Graduate Architecture Students' Association (GASA)===\nThe McGill Graduate Architecture Students' Association (GASA) is a student-run society representing all graduate students at the School of Architecture.

These bilateral agreements make it easy for undergraduate architecture students at McGill to go on exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/bscarch_programadvisingandcourseregistration-fall_2018.pdf|title=B.Sc.(Arch.) program and Architecture Exchange Students (New and Returning Students) - STUDENT EXCHANGES|page=5|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nStudents also have the opportunity to spend an exchange semester abroad at any of McGill University's 160+ partner institutions<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/mcgillabroad/mcgill-students-going-abroad/global-learning-opportunities|title=McGill students going abroad|publisher=McGill Abroad, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> as long as they offer architecture exchanges, however these are more difficult to coordinate due to the competitive nature of University-wide exchanges. In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School. In some studios, the ratio can be as high as 8:1, such as is the case for the undergraduate class of 2021.<ref name=Enrollment />\n\n==Lecture series==\nEach year, the School of Architecture presents public lectures, exhibitions and symposia showcasing leading architects and important figures in the field. These lectures are organized by various individuals and organizations affiliated with the School. Lecture Series include lunchtime \"Brown Bag\" lectures organized by the McGill Architecture Students' Association, evening lectures sponsored by local Montreal firms such as Provencher Roy & [[NEUF Architect(e)s]],<ref name=LectureSeries /> and most notably, the annual [[David Azrieli|David J.

She was born on February 16 and is the daughter of Frank Buffay and Lily Buffay. Her birth-mother's name was Phoebe Abbott. She has a twin sister named Ursula Buffay, who is also portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe can speak several languages, including French and Italian. She appeared in each of the show's 236 episodes, from its [[The Pilot (Friends)|premiere]] on September 24, 1994 to its [[The Last One (Friends)|finale]] on May 6, 2004. She is a [[masseuse]] and musician, notable for her offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. She was [[Monica Geller]]'s roommate before [[Rachel Green]], which is how she was introduced to the group. Phoebe is best friends with Monica and Rachel, along with their neighbors, [[Chandler Bing]] and [[Joey Tribbiani]], and also Monica's brother [[Ross Geller]]. She plays a [[Gibson Gospel]] and sings at Central Perk. During the show's [[Friends (season 9)|ninth season]], Phoebe and Joey decide to choose a blind date for each other. Phoebe finds someone for him, but Joey forgets about their deal and doesn't find anyone for her. So a couple of minutes before the date, Joey accidentally finds Mike who agrees to go on a blind date with Phoebe. Mike Hannigan (played by actor [[Paul Rudd]]) and Phoebe begin a romantic relationship. They later get engaged and then marry.\n\nFor her portrayal of Phoebe Buffay, Kudrow received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination and won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], a [[Satellite Award]], and an [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy Award]].\n\n==Role==\nIn the pilot episode, Phoebe is introduced as one of the six original friends, including neighbors [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]] ([[Matt LeBlanc]]) and [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] ([[Matthew Perry]]), former roommate [[Monica Geller|Monica]] ([[Courteney Cox]]), Rachel Green ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), and Monica's brother, [[Ross Geller|Ross]] ([[David Schwimmer]]). She is a musician at their typical meeting place, [[Central Perk]], where she plays guitar and sings self-written songs.

Ursula is also portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe works as a [[Temporary work|temporary]] secretary for Chandler for a brief period of time in \"The One with the Ick Factor\". It is revealed that the woman Phoebe believed was her mother, Lily Buffay, committed suicide when Phoebe was about 14, by means of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].\n\nIn the episode \"The One with Phoebe's Husband\", it is revealed that Phoebe was married to a supposedly gay Canadian [[ice dancer]], Duncan Sullivan, in order to allow him to get a green card, for six years. The two agree to get a [[divorce]] after he comes to the realization that he is, in fact, [[heterosexual]], and wants to marry another woman.

Due in no small part to her extremely traumatic childhood, Phoebe has developed a child-like na\u00efvet\u00e9 in an attempt to shield her from the world's evils. In addition to being a [[vegetarian]] and an avid [[Environmentalism|tree hugger]], she also displays a remarkable lack of experience with the \"darker sides\" of life. In \"The One Where Old Yeller Dies\", it is shown that her deceased mother Lily would always turn off films before anything traumatic would happen, including the death of [[Old Yeller]] or [[Bambi]]'s mother being shot. It is also revealed that she was never told the truth about [[Santa Claus]]. This is made all the more prominent as one of the running jokes during the show is Phoebe's seemingly infinite criminal track record. She repeatedly makes reference to her underworld connections and crimes she committed while living on the streets.\n\nPhoebe is shown to have a very strained relationship with her sister Ursula, who she almost never gets in touch with. Despite multiple efforts to get her crass twin sister (who is one minute older than her) to care about family affairs or other things that concern her, Phoebe nearly always goes home empty-handed and none the wiser. When it is revealed Ursula performs in [[porn]] under Phoebe's name, the latter eventually gets her revenge by cashing in Ursula's pay slips.\n\nVery in tune with her emotions and those of others, Phoebe sometimes serves as a rock to her friends. She especially shows a great deal of maternal instinct towards her younger brother Frank, despite the latter's lack of intelligence.\n\nMuch to the dismay of her friends (especially [[Ross Geller|Ross]]), Phoebe dabbles in [[New Age]] ideas and [[superstition]]s throughout the series. She is convinced she can feel the presence of her dead grandmother in her old apartment, she [[The One with the Cat|senses the spirit of her mother in a lost cat]], [[The One with the Tea Leaves|reads tea leaves]], and dismisses [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution as \"too easy\" in \"The One Where Heckles Dies\".\n\nSimilar to the short-lived Monica/Chandler/Richard love triangle, Phoebe had two serious romantic interests that overlapped with each other at one point during the series. David ([[Hank Azaria]]), known as \"The scientist guy\", has a romance with Phoebe in the [[Friends (season 1)|first season of the series]], but breaks her heart when he decides to leave for [[Minsk]] on a three-year research trip. He makes a few more appearances throughout the series, most notably trying to get back together with her and kissing her when they get interrupted by Phoebe's then-boyfriend Mike ([[Paul Rudd]]). Mike had been introduced to Phoebe in [[Friends (season 9)|the ninth season of the show]], when Joey forgot he was supposed to find Phoebe a double date and decided to shout for a random guy called \"Mike\" in the coffee shop instead. After a whirlwind romance, Phoebe and Mike eventually break up and she briefly reunites with David [[The One in Barbados|in Barbados]]. Mike beats David to the punch, however, and proposes to Phoebe before the latter gets a chance. She rejects David as she realized she was in love with Mike. She also rejects Mike, on the basis that she did not need a proposal from him, but an indication that their relationship was progressing. She ends up [[The One with Phoebe's Wedding|marrying Mike]].\n\n==Jokes and sarcasm==\n\nThis is just a haker in the world.\n\n===Age===\nHer age seemed to have differed throughout the series. In \"The One with the Mugging\", it is implied that Phoebe is older than Ross, seeing as she was fourteen when he was 12. This episode made her possibly the oldest in the group. In \"[[The One with the Jellyfish]]\" (Season 4), Phoebe states that she is twenty-nine, placing her birth in approximately 1968. However, in \"The One Where They're Going to Party,\" (Season 4), Ross states he is also 29, which does not work with the previously mentioned two-year age gap. According to \"The One with Frank Jr.\", Phoebe was born on February 16; however, in Season 9 (\"The One with Phoebe's Birthday Dinner\") Phoebe's birthday is sometime in early November, since they could not make the reservations and the dinner had to be moved back to October 31. In \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\" (Season 7), it is revealed that Phoebe was born a year earlier than she thought, believing she was 30 but was truly 31, which further adds to the inconsistency of her age throughout the show's run. Phoebe also tries on at least one occasion to manipulate the other friends into celebrating her birthday again within months of a previous birthday party.\n\n===\"Regina Phalange\"===\nPhoebe occasionally uses the [[alter ego]] Regina Phalange. The first reference to Regina Phalange is during season 5 following Ross saying \"Rachel\" instead of \"Emily\" at his wedding. She pretends to be \"Doctor Phalange\", Ross's brain doctor, claiming that names are interchangeable in his mind. When the friends go to [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], Phoebe introduces herself to the blackjack dealer as Regina Phalange. When Phoebe, Rachel, and Melissa go out to lunch (The One with Rachel's Big Kiss), and Melissa asks if she was in a sorority, she pretends to be a member of \"Thigh Mega Tampon\", a fictional sorority that was allegedly shut down when Regina Phalange died of alcohol poisoning. She also used her fake name to show Chandler and Monica how easily people lie about their names and to help Chandler with his interviewing skills in season 8 episode 4, when Joey says, \"Hi, I'm Ken Adams\" she replies, \"Regina Phalange\". In the season 10 episode \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\", Phoebe attempts to spare Joey from humiliation by introducing herself as \"R\u00e9gine Philange\" and stating that Joey is speaking an obscure regional dialect from her \"hometown\" of \"[[Est\u00e9e Lauder (businesswoman)|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]\". She immediately switches to French and claims that Joey is her younger brother who is \"un peu retard\u00e9\" (a little slow), and requesting that the casting director humor Joey's French-speaking abilities. The last reference is in the series finale when Phoebe successfully stalls Rachel's plane to Paris by saying there is a problem with the \"left phalange\", causing everyone on the plane to evacuate. The passengers are eventually convinced to return to the plane. When a woman skeptically asks an airport employee if \"the phalange\" was fixed, he replies, \"Yes, the phalange is fixed! As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard, just in case!\"\n\n==Production==\nPhoebe's pregnancy during Season 4 was to account for [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s actual pregnancy.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Kathy Griffin]], [[Jane Lynch]], and [[Megan Mullally]] all auditioned for the role of Phoebe. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her recurring role as Ursula, the waitress in ''[[Mad About You]]''.<ref name=\"BrightFT\">{{Cite video |last = Bright |first = Kevin S. |title = Friends: Final Thoughts |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2036371/ | date = November 15, 2005 |publisher = New Wave Entertainment}}</ref><ref name=\"W209\">{{Cite book |last1 = Wild |first1 = David |authorlink1 = David Wild |year = 2004 |title = Friends ...'Til the End |location = London |publisher = Headline |isbn = 0-7553-1321-6 |page = 209|title-link = Friends 'til the end (book) }}</ref> The characters were connected to make them twin sisters.

She repeatedly makes reference to her underworld connections and crimes she committed while living on the streets.\n\nPhoebe is shown to have a very strained relationship with her sister Ursula, who she almost never gets in touch with. Despite multiple efforts to get her crass twin sister (who is one minute older than her) to care about family affairs or other things that concern her, Phoebe nearly always goes home empty-handed and none the wiser. When it is revealed Ursula performs in [[porn]] under Phoebe's name, the latter eventually gets her revenge by cashing in Ursula's pay slips.\n\nVery in tune with her emotions and those of others, Phoebe sometimes serves as a rock to her friends. She especially shows a great deal of maternal instinct towards her younger brother Frank, despite the latter's lack of intelligence.\n\nMuch to the dismay of her friends (especially [[Ross Geller|Ross]]), Phoebe dabbles in [[New Age]] ideas and [[superstition]]s throughout the series. She is convinced she can feel the presence of her dead grandmother in her old apartment, she [[The One with the Cat|senses the spirit of her mother in a lost cat]], [[The One with the Tea Leaves|reads tea leaves]], and dismisses [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution as \"too easy\" in \"The One Where Heckles Dies\".\n\nSimilar to the short-lived Monica/Chandler/Richard love triangle, Phoebe had two serious romantic interests that overlapped with each other at one point during the series. David ([[Hank Azaria]]), known as \"The scientist guy\", has a romance with Phoebe in the [[Friends (season 1)|first season of the series]], but breaks her heart when he decides to leave for [[Minsk]] on a three-year research trip. He makes a few more appearances throughout the series, most notably trying to get back together with her and kissing her when they get interrupted by Phoebe's then-boyfriend Mike ([[Paul Rudd]]). Mike had been introduced to Phoebe in [[Friends (season 9)|the ninth season of the show]], when Joey forgot he was supposed to find Phoebe a double date and decided to shout for a random guy called \"Mike\" in the coffee shop instead. After a whirlwind romance, Phoebe and Mike eventually break up and she briefly reunites with David [[The One in Barbados|in Barbados]]. Mike beats David to the punch, however, and proposes to Phoebe before the latter gets a chance. She rejects David as she realized she was in love with Mike. She also rejects Mike, on the basis that she did not need a proposal from him, but an indication that their relationship was progressing. She ends up [[The One with Phoebe's Wedding|marrying Mike]].\n\n==Jokes and sarcasm==\n\n===\"Smelly Cat\"===\nThe show's running gag and one of Phoebe's trademark characteristics is her song \"Smelly Cat,\" which she performs at Central Perk. The song is about a cat who is shunned by society because of its foul stench as a result of [[flatulence]] (\"What are they feeding you?\"). However Phoebe sympathizes with it because she can relate to being an outcast. The verses consist of Phoebe rattling off a list of ways in which the cat is disliked (\"They won't take you to the [[veterinarian|vet]]\", \"you're obviously not their favorite pet\", etc.) while the chorus ends with the uplifting message to anyone who is different or unique that \"it's not your fault\". In the episode, \"The One Where Eddie Moves In,\" Phoebe is discovered by a record producer who wants to make a music video for \"Smelly Cat\". Phoebe is delighted with the end result, somehow missing what her friends spot immediately \u2013 that the voice used in the video belongs to another woman. Phoebe turns down the opportunity, feeling bad for the woman who will not get any recognition for her voice because she does not have the \"right look\" \u2013 declaring that the woman IS, in fact, Smelly Cat. In the episode, \"The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner,\" Phoebe's former singing partner, Leslie, portrayed by [[Elizabeth Daily|E.G. Daily]], wants them to get back together. The partnership fails again when Leslie sells the song \"Smelly Cat\" to a commercial agency against Phoebe's wishes. Phoebe teaches the song to [[Chrissie Hynde]], who releases it in a 1999 album.<ref name=\"Leszczak2015\">{{cite book|author=Bob Leszczak|title=From Small Screen to Vinyl: A Guide to Television Stars Who Made Records, 1950-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpucCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA269|date=25 June 2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-4274-6|page=269}}</ref> On August 26, 2015, Kudrow performed the song as a duet with [[Taylor Swift]] during Swift's concert in Los Angeles as a part of her [[The 1989 World Tour|1989 World Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34074546/taylor-swift-sang-smelly-cat-with-lisa-kudrow-on-stage|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Taylor Swift sang Smelly Cat with Lisa Kudrow on stage|date=2015-08-27|accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref>\n\n===Age===\nHer age seemed to have differed throughout the series. In \"The One with the Mugging\", it is implied that Phoebe is older than Ross, seeing as she was fourteen when he was 12. This episode made her possibly the oldest in the group. In \"[[The One with the Jellyfish]]\" (Season 4), Phoebe states that she is twenty-nine, placing her birth in approximately 1968. However, in \"The One Where They're Going to Party,\" (Season 4), Ross states he is also 29, which does not work with the previously mentioned two-year age gap. According to \"The One with Frank Jr.\", Phoebe was born on February 16; however, in Season 9 (\"The One with Phoebe's Birthday Dinner\") Phoebe's birthday is sometime in early November, since they could not make the reservations and the dinner had to be moved back to October 31. In \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\" (Season 7), it is revealed that Phoebe was born a year earlier than she thought, believing she was 30 but was truly 31, which further adds to the inconsistency of her age throughout the show's run. Phoebe also tries on at least one occasion to manipulate the other friends into celebrating her birthday again within months of a previous birthday party.\n\n===\"Regina Phalange\"===\nPhoebe occasionally uses the [[alter ego]] Regina Phalange. The first reference to Regina Phalange is during season 5 following Ross saying \"Rachel\" instead of \"Emily\" at his wedding. She pretends to be \"Doctor Phalange\", Ross's brain doctor, claiming that names are interchangeable in his mind. When the friends go to [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], Phoebe introduces herself to the blackjack dealer as Regina Phalange. When Phoebe, Rachel, and Melissa go out to lunch (The One with Rachel's Big Kiss), and Melissa asks if she was in a sorority, she pretends to be a member of \"Thigh Mega Tampon\", a fictional sorority that was allegedly shut down when Regina Phalange died of alcohol poisoning. She also used her fake name to show Chandler and Monica how easily people lie about their names and to help Chandler with his interviewing skills in season 8 episode 4, when Joey says, \"Hi, I'm Ken Adams\" she replies, \"Regina Phalange\". In the season 10 episode \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\", Phoebe attempts to spare Joey from humiliation by introducing herself as \"R\u00e9gine Philange\" and stating that Joey is speaking an obscure regional dialect from her \"hometown\" of \"[[Est\u00e9e Lauder (businesswoman)|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]\". She immediately switches to French and claims that Joey is her younger brother who is \"un peu retard\u00e9\" (a little slow), and requesting that the casting director humor Joey's French-speaking abilities. The last reference is in the series finale when Phoebe successfully stalls Rachel's plane to Paris by saying there is a problem with the \"left phalange\", causing everyone on the plane to evacuate. The passengers are eventually convinced to return to the plane. When a woman skeptically asks an airport employee if \"the phalange\" was fixed, he replies, \"Yes, the phalange is fixed! As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard, just in case!\"\n\n==Production==\nPhoebe's pregnancy during Season 4 was to account for [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s actual pregnancy.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Kathy Griffin]], [[Jane Lynch]], and [[Megan Mullally]] all auditioned for the role of Phoebe. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her recurring role as Ursula, the waitress in ''[[Mad About You]]''.<ref name=\"BrightFT\">{{Cite video |last = Bright |first = Kevin S. |title = Friends: Final Thoughts |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2036371/ | date = November 15, 2005 |publisher = New Wave Entertainment}}</ref><ref name=\"W209\">{{Cite book |last1 = Wild |first1 = David |authorlink1 = David Wild |year = 2004 |title = Friends ...'Til the End |location = London |publisher = Headline |isbn = 0-7553-1321-6 |page = 209|title-link = Friends 'til the end (book) }}</ref> The characters were connected to make them twin sisters.

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012) which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]'' (2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", where all crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer though she personally favoured the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl\". She has appeared two times in ''[[Forbes]]''' Celebrity 100 of India (2017 and 2019).\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar was a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012) which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]'' (2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", where all crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer though she personally favoured the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl\". She has appeared two times in ''[[Forbes]]''' Celebrity 100 of India (2017 and 2019).\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar was a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''').
