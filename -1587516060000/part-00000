Abe is also currently the president of the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP). He previously served as [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] from 2005 to 2006, and as prime minister from 2006 to 2007, making him the [[List of prime ministers of Japan#Rank by length of total tenures|longest-serving prime minister]]<ref>https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/24/japan-shinzo-abe-2020-prime-minister-rest-laurels/</ref> in Japanese history, since the office was first created in 1885.\n\nFirst elected to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] in the [[1993 Japanese general election|1993 election]], he rose to be appointed [[Chief Cabinet Secretary|chief cabinet secretary]] by [[Junichiro Koizumi]], before replacing Koizumi as LDP president in September 2006. He was subsequently confirmed as prime minister by a special session of the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]], becoming, aged 52, Japan's youngest post-war prime minister, and the first to have been born after [[World War II]]. Abe resigned in September 2007, citing health reasons, shortly after his party lost the [[2007 Japanese House of Councillors election|House of Councillors election]] that year. He was replaced by [[Yasuo Fukuda]], the first in a series of five prime ministers who each failed to retain office for more than sixteen months.\n\nAfter recovering from illness, Abe staged an unexpected political comeback, defeating former [[Minister of Defense (Japan)|defense minister]] [[Shigeru Ishiba]] in a vote to become LDP president for a second time in September 2012. Following the LDP's landslide victory in the [[2012 Japanese general election|general election]] that December, he became the first former prime minister to return to the office since [[Shigeru Yoshida]] in 1948. He was later re-elected in similar landslides in the [[2014 Japanese general election|2014]] and [[2017 Japanese general election|2017 elections]].\n\nAbe is a [[Political conservative|conservative]] whom political commentators have widely described as a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Japanese nationalism|nationalist]].<ref name=\"Lucy Alexander\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article3633051.ece|title=Landslide victory for Shinzo Abe in Japan election|work=The Times|author=Lucy Alexander |date=17 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= 23 October 2017 |title= Japan election: Shinzo Abe set for record tenure |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19725705 |work= BBC News |access-date= 13 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Ohi |first=Akai |date= 20 December 2018 |title=Two Kinds of Conservatives in Japanese Politics and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Tactics to Cope with Them |url=https://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/two-kinds-conservatives-in-japanese-politics-and-prime-minister-shinzo-abe%E2%80%99s-tactics |work= East-West Center |access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Justin McCurry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/japan/120928/shinzo-abe-outspoken-nationalist-takes-reins-at-japa|title=Shinzo Abe, an outspoken nationalist, takes reins at Japan's LDP, risking tensions with China, South Korea|publisher=[[GlobalPost]]|author=Justin McCurry |date=28 September 2012}}</ref> He is a member of ''[[Nippon Kaigi]]'' and holds [[Historical revisionism|revisionist views on Japanese history]],<ref name=\"Tea Party Politics in Japan\">\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/opinion/tea-party-politics-in-japan.html Tea Party Politics in Japan]\" (New York Times - 2014/09/13)</ref> including denying the role of government coercion in the recruitment of [[Comfort women|comfort women during World War II]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't distances itself from NHK head's 'comfort women' comment |url=https://japantoday.com/category/politics/govt-distances-itself-from-nhk-heads-comfort-women-comment |accessdate=22 July 2018 |work=Japan Today |date=27 January 2014 |language=en}}</ref> a position which has created tension with neighboring [[South Korea]].<ref name=\"csis.org\">{{cite speech |title=Japan is Back |author=Abe, Shinzo |date=22 February 2013 |location=CSIS |url=http://csis.org/event/statesmens-forum-he-shinzo-abe-prime-minister-japan |access-date=29 December 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"The Japan Times\">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/11/10/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-xi-meeting-likely-monday-sources/#.VoLAE0-REWh|title=Abe meets Xi for first China-Japan summit in more than two years|date=10 November 2014|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> He is considered a [[war hawk|hard-liner]] with respect to [[North Korea]], and advocates revising [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9 of the pacifist constitution]] to permit Japan to maintain military forces.<ref name=newshour>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/july-dec06/japan_9-20.html New Japanese Leader Looks to Expand Nation's Military], ''NewsHour'', 20 September 2006.</ref><ref name=\"Japan upgrades its defence agency\">BBC website [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6243499.stm Japan upgrades its defence agency], bbc.co.uk, 9 January 2007.</ref> Abe is known internationally for his government's economic policies, nicknamed ''[[Abenomics]]'', which pursue [[monetary easing]], [[fiscal stimulus]], and [[structural adjustment|structural reforms]].<ref name=\"ft-def\">{{cite web|title=Definition of Abenomics|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=abenomics|publisher=Financial Times Lexicon|accessdate=28 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118081548/http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=abenomics|archive-date=18 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:The Abe family in 1956.jpg|thumb|left|The Abe family in 1956: his mother Y\u014dko Abe, Shinzo Abe at the age of two, his father Shintar\u014d Abe and his older brother Hironobu]]\n\nShinzo Abe was born in [[Tokyo]] to a prominent political family with significant economic influence throughout pre-war, wartime and post-war Japan.

Abe is also currently the president of the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP). He previously served as [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] from 2005 to 2006, and as prime minister from 2006 to 2007, making him the [[List of prime ministers of Japan#Rank by length of total tenures|longest-serving prime minister]]<ref>https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/24/japan-shinzo-abe-2020-prime-minister-rest-laurels/</ref> in Japanese history, since the office was first created in 1885.\n\nFirst elected to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] in the [[1993 Japanese general election|1993 election]], he rose to be appointed [[Chief Cabinet Secretary|chief cabinet secretary]] by [[Junichiro Koizumi]], before replacing Koizumi as LDP president in September 2006. He was subsequently confirmed as prime minister by a special session of the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]], becoming, aged 52, Japan's youngest post-war prime minister, and the first to have been born after [[World War II]]. Abe resigned in September 2007, citing health reasons, shortly after his party lost the [[2007 Japanese House of Councillors election|House of Councillors election]] that year. He was replaced by [[Yasuo Fukuda]], the first in a series of five prime ministers who each failed to retain office for more than sixteen months.\n\nAfter recovering from illness, Abe staged an unexpected political comeback, defeating former [[Minister of Defense (Japan)|defense minister]] [[Shigeru Ishiba]] in a vote to become LDP president for a second time in September 2012. Following the LDP's landslide victory in the [[2012 Japanese general election|general election]] that December, he became the first former prime minister to return to the office since [[Shigeru Yoshida]] in 1948. He was later re-elected in similar landslides in the [[2014 Japanese general election|2014]] and [[2017 Japanese general election|2017 elections]].\n\nAbe is a [[Political conservative|conservative]] whom political commentators have widely described as a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Japanese nationalism|nationalist]].<ref name=\"Lucy Alexander\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article3633051.ece|title=Landslide victory for Shinzo Abe in Japan election|work=The Times|author=Lucy Alexander |date=17 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= 23 October 2017 |title= Japan election: Shinzo Abe set for record tenure |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19725705 |work= BBC News |access-date= 13 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Ohi |first=Akai |date= 20 December 2018 |title=Two Kinds of Conservatives in Japanese Politics and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Tactics to Cope with Them |url=https://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/two-kinds-conservatives-in-japanese-politics-and-prime-minister-shinzo-abe%E2%80%99s-tactics |work= East-West Center |access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Justin McCurry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/japan/120928/shinzo-abe-outspoken-nationalist-takes-reins-at-japa|title=Shinzo Abe, an outspoken nationalist, takes reins at Japan's LDP, risking tensions with China, South Korea|publisher=[[GlobalPost]]|author=Justin McCurry |date=28 September 2012}}</ref> He is a member of ''[[Nippon Kaigi]]'' and holds [[Historical revisionism|revisionist views on Japanese history]],<ref name=\"Tea Party Politics in Japan\">\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/opinion/tea-party-politics-in-japan.html Tea Party Politics in Japan]\" (New York Times - 2014/09/13)</ref> including denying the role of government coercion in the recruitment of [[Comfort women|comfort women during World War II]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't distances itself from NHK head's 'comfort women' comment |url=https://japantoday.com/category/politics/govt-distances-itself-from-nhk-heads-comfort-women-comment |accessdate=22 July 2018 |work=Japan Today |date=27 January 2014 |language=en}}</ref> a position which has created tension with neighboring [[South Korea]].<ref name=\"csis.org\">{{cite speech |title=Japan is Back |author=Abe, Shinzo |date=22 February 2013 |location=CSIS |url=http://csis.org/event/statesmens-forum-he-shinzo-abe-prime-minister-japan |access-date=29 December 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"The Japan Times\">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/11/10/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-xi-meeting-likely-monday-sources/#.VoLAE0-REWh|title=Abe meets Xi for first China-Japan summit in more than two years|date=10 November 2014|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> He is considered a [[war hawk|hard-liner]] with respect to [[North Korea]], and advocates revising [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9 of the pacifist constitution]] to permit Japan to maintain military forces.<ref name=newshour>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/july-dec06/japan_9-20.html New Japanese Leader Looks to Expand Nation's Military], ''NewsHour'', 20 September 2006.</ref><ref name=\"Japan upgrades its defence agency\">BBC website [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6243499.stm Japan upgrades its defence agency], bbc.co.uk, 9 January 2007.</ref> Abe is known internationally for his government's economic policies, nicknamed ''[[Abenomics]]'', which pursue [[monetary easing]], [[fiscal stimulus]], and [[structural adjustment|structural reforms]].<ref name=\"ft-def\">{{cite web|title=Definition of Abenomics|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=abenomics|publisher=Financial Times Lexicon|accessdate=28 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118081548/http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=abenomics|archive-date=18 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:The Abe family in 1956.jpg|thumb|left|The Abe family in 1956: his mother Y\u014dko Abe, Shinzo Abe at the age of two, his father Shintar\u014d Abe and his older brother Hironobu]]\n\nShinzo Abe was born in [[Tokyo]] to a prominent political family with significant economic influence throughout pre-war, wartime and post-war Japan.

It is often contrasted with courtly, [[classical music|classical]] and later commercial music. Folk music has been preserved and transmitted orally, through print and later through recordings. The term is used to refer to English [[traditional music]] and music composed, or delivered, in a traditional style. English folk music has produced or contributed to several important musical genres, including [[sea shanties]], [[jigs]], [[hornpipe]]s and [[dance music]], such as that used for [[Morris dancing]]. It can be seen as having distinct regional and local variations in content and style, particularly in areas more removed from the cultural and political centres of the English state, as in [[Northumbria]], or the [[West Country]]. Cultural interchange and processes of migration mean that English folk music, although in many ways distinctive, has particularly interacted with the music of [[Music of Scotland|Scotland]]. It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and [[rock music]], influencing musical styles and producing [[Fusion (music)|musical fusions]], such as [[British folk rock]], [[folk punk]] and [[folk metal]]. There remains a flourishing [[sub-culture]] of English folk music, which continues to influence other genres and occasionally gains mainstream attention.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|right|Original score of ''Pastime with Good Company'' (c. 1513), held in the [[British Library]], [[London]].]]\n\nIn the strictest sense, English folk music has existed since the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] people in Britain after 400 CE. The [[Venerable Bede]]'s story of the cattleman and later ecclesiastical musician [[C\u00e6dmon]] indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'.<ref>R. I. Page, ''Life in Anglo-Saxon England'' (London: Batsford, 1970), pp. 159-60.</ref> Since this type of music was rarely notated, we have little knowledge of its form or content.<ref>C. Parrish, ''The Notation of Medieval Music'' (Maesteg: Pendragon Press, 1978).</ref> Some later tunes, like those used for [[Morris dance]], may have their origins in this period, but it is impossible to be certain of these relationships.<ref name=\"Forrest1999\">J. Forrest, ''The History of Morris Dancing, 1458\u20131750'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999), p. 48.</ref> We know from a reference in [[William Langland]]'s [[Piers Plowman]], that ballads about [[Robin Hood]] were being sung from at least by the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is [[Wynkyn de Worde]]'s collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\">B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 45-9.</ref>\n\n===16th century to the 18th century===\nWhile there was distinct court music, members of the social elite into the 16th century also seem to have enjoyed, and even to have contributed to the music of the people, as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] perhaps did with the tavern song \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\".<ref>D.

In the colonies, it mixed with styles of music brought by other immigrant groups to create a host of new genres. For instance, English ballads, combined with Irish, Scottish, and German musical traditions as well as the African banjo, became [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], which evolved, when combined with African-American blues, into [[rock and roll]].\n\n===Early 19th century===\nWith the [[Industrial Revolution]] the themes of the music of the labouring classes began to change from rural and agrarian life to include industrial [[work songs]].<ref name=\"Boyes1993\">G.

These are usually separated into two folk revivals.\n\nThe first, in the later 19th and early 20th centuries, involved figures including collectors [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] (1834\u20131924), [[Frank Kidson]] (1855\u20131926), [[Lucy Broadwood]] (1858\u20131939), and [[Anne Gilchrist (collector)|Anne Gilchrist]] (1863\u20131954), centred around the Folk Song Society, founded in 1911.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> [[Francis James Child]]'s (1825\u201396) eight-volume collection ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]'' (1882\u201392) became the most influential in defining the repertoire of subsequent performers, and [[Cecil Sharp]] (1859\u20131924), founder of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|English Folk Dance Society]], was probably the most important figure in understanding of the nature of folk song.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> The revival was part of a wider national movement in the period around the [[First World War]], and contributed to the creation of the [[English Pastoral School]] of classical music which incorporated traditional songs or motifs, as can be seen in the compositions of [[Percy Grainger]] (1882\u20131961), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (1872\u20131951), [[George Butterworth]] (1885\u20131916), [[Gustav Holst]] (1874\u20131934) and [[Frederick Delius]] (1862\u20131934).<ref name=\"Brocken2003\">M.

Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 203.</ref> Many progressive folk performers continued to retain a traditional element in their music, including Jansch and Renbourn, who with [[Jacqui McShee]], [[Danny Thompson]], and [[Terry Cox]], formed [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Sweers2005p40\">B.

Some of this, particularly the Incredible String Band, has been seen as developing into the further subgenre of psych or [[psychedelic folk]] and had a considerable impact on [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref>J.

Many were [[call and response]] songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a lead line and the rest of the sailors giving a response together.

Goodman and A. Tuck, eds, ''War and Border Societies in the Middle Ages'' (London: Routledge, 1992), pp. 6-7.</ref> The conflicts between England and Spain in the later 16th and early 17th centuries produced a number of ballads describing events, particularly naval conflicts like those of the [[Spanish Armada]].<ref name=\"SolaPinto1957\"/> The [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131653) produced a subgenre of \"[[Cavalier]] ballads\", including \"When the King Home in Peace Again\".<ref>C.

The two main types of work song in England are agricultural work songs, usually are [[rhythmic]] [[a cappella]] [[song]]s sung by people working on a physical and often repetitive task, like the 'Harvest song' common in south-west England.<ref>S. Baring-Gould, ''An Old English Home and Its Dependencies'' (1898, Read books, 2008), p. 205.</ref> The songs were probably intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings of boredom.<ref name=Peek2004>P. M. Peek and K. Yankah, ''African Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2004), p. 520.</ref> Rhythms of work songs can serve to synchronize physical movement in a group or gang. Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the 18th century, as workers took the music with which they were familiar, including [[ballads]] and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances.<ref name=Lloyd1967>A. L. Lloyd, ''Folk song in England'' (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1967), pp. 323-8.</ref> Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry.<ref>J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music, vol. 1: Media, Industry and Society'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003), p. 251.</ref> As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest [[protest songs]] and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile production]], mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries.<ref name=Lloyd1967/>\n\n==Regional traditions==\n\n===East Anglia===\n[[File:MollyDancers.jpg|thumb|right|Molly dancers at [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesea Straw Bear]] Festival]]\n\nLike many regions of England there are few distinctive local instruments and many songs were shared with the rest of Britain and with Ireland, although the distinct dialects of the regions sometimes lent them a particular stamp and, with one of the longest coastlines of any English region, songs about the sea were also particularly important. Along with the West Country, this was one of the regions that most firmly adopted reed instruments, producing many eminent practitioners of the melodeon from the mid-19th century.

However, in more recent years a distinct cultural heritage has been recognised including unique folk traditions and songs, many associated with the regions industrial connections.

It is often contrasted with courtly, [[classical music|classical]] and later commercial music. Folk music has been preserved and transmitted orally, through print and later through recordings. The term is used to refer to English [[traditional music]] and music composed, or delivered, in a traditional style. English folk music has produced or contributed to several important musical genres, including [[sea shanties]], [[jigs]], [[hornpipe]]s and [[dance music]], such as that used for [[Morris dancing]]. It can be seen as having distinct regional and local variations in content and style, particularly in areas more removed from the cultural and political centres of the English state, as in [[Northumbria]], or the [[West Country]]. Cultural interchange and processes of migration mean that English folk music, although in many ways distinctive, has particularly interacted with the music of [[Music of Scotland|Scotland]]. It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and [[rock music]], influencing musical styles and producing [[Fusion (music)|musical fusions]], such as [[British folk rock]], [[folk punk]] and [[folk metal]]. There remains a flourishing [[sub-culture]] of English folk music, which continues to influence other genres and occasionally gains mainstream attention.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|right|Original score of ''Pastime with Good Company'' (c. 1513), held in the [[British Library]], [[London]].]]\n\nIn the strictest sense, English folk music has existed since the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] people in Britain after 400 CE. The [[Venerable Bede]]'s story of the cattleman and later ecclesiastical musician [[C\u00e6dmon]] indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'.<ref>R. I. Page, ''Life in Anglo-Saxon England'' (London: Batsford, 1970), pp. 159-60.</ref> Since this type of music was rarely notated, we have little knowledge of its form or content.<ref>C.

In the colonies, it mixed with styles of music brought by other immigrant groups to create a host of new genres. For instance, English ballads, combined with Irish, Scottish, and German musical traditions as well as the African banjo, became [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], which evolved, when combined with African-American blues, into [[rock and roll]].\n\n===Early 19th century===\nWith the [[Industrial Revolution]] the themes of the music of the labouring classes began to change from rural and agrarian life to include industrial [[work songs]].<ref name=\"Boyes1993\">G. Boyes, ''The Imagined Village: Culture, Ideology, and the English Folk Revival'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1993), p. 214.</ref> Awareness that older kinds of song were being abandoned prompted renewed interest in collecting folk songs during the 1830s and 1840s, including the work of [[William Sandys (antiquarian)|William Sandys]]' ''Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern'' (1833), William Chappell, ''A Collection of National English Airs'' (1838) and [[Robert Bell (writer)|Robert Bell]]'s ''Ancient Poems, Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of England'' (1846).<ref>W.

Russell, ''Popular Music in England, 1840\u20131914: A Social History'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1987), pp. 160-90.</ref> The shift to urban centres also began to create new types of music, including from the 1850s the [[Music hall]], which developed from performances in ale houses into theatres and became the dominant locus of English popular music for over a century.<ref>D. Kift, ''The Victorian Music Hall: Culture, Class, and Conflict'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 17.</ref> This combined with increased literacy and print to allow the creation of new songs that initially built on, but began to differ from traditional music as composers like [[Lionel Monckton]] and [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] created music that reflected new social circumstances.<ref>W.

These are usually separated into two folk revivals.\n\nThe first, in the later 19th and early 20th centuries, involved figures including collectors  [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] (1834\u20131924), [[Frank Kidson]] (1855\u20131926), [[Lucy Broadwood]] (1858\u20131939), and [[Anne Gilchrist (collector)|Anne Gilchrist]] (1863\u20131954), centred around the Folk Song Society, founded in 1911.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> [[Francis James Child]]'s (1825\u201396) eight-volume collection ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]'' (1882\u201392) became the most influential in defining the repertoire of subsequent performers, and [[Cecil Sharp]] (1859\u20131924), founder of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|English Folk Dance Society]], was probably the most important figure in understanding of the nature of folk song.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> The revival was part of a wider national movement in the period around the [[First World War]], and contributed to the creation of the [[English Pastoral School]] of classical music which incorporated traditional songs or motifs, as can be seen in the compositions of [[Percy Grainger]] (1882\u20131961), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (1872\u20131951), [[George Butterworth]] (1885\u20131916), [[Gustav Holst]] (1874\u20131934) and [[Frederick Delius]] (1862\u20131934).<ref name=\"Brocken2003\">M.

Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 203.</ref> Many progressive folk performers continued to retain a traditional element in their music, including Jansch and Renbourn, who with [[Jacqui McShee]], [[Danny Thompson]], and [[Terry Cox]], formed [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Sweers2005p40\">B.

Some of this, particularly the Incredible String Band, has been seen as developing into the further subgenre of psych or [[psychedelic folk]] and had a considerable impact on [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref>J.

Perhaps the finest individual work in the genre was from artists early 1970s artists like [[Nick Drake]] and [[John Martyn]], but these can also be considered the first among the English \u2018folk troubadours\u2019 or \u2018singer-songwriters\u2019, individual performers who remained largely acoustic but who relied mostly on their own individual compositions.<ref>P.

Pegg, ''Folk'' (Wildwood House: London, 1976), p. 76.</ref> Some authors, however, find these distinctions more difficult to maintain.

The two main types of work song in England are agricultural work songs, usually are [[rhythmic]] [[a cappella]] [[song]]s sung by people working on a physical and often repetitive task, like the 'Harvest song' common in south-west England.<ref>S. Baring-Gould, ''An Old English Home and Its Dependencies'' (1898, Read books, 2008), p. 205.</ref> The songs were probably intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings of boredom.<ref name=Peek2004>P. M. Peek and K. Yankah, ''African Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2004), p. 520.</ref> Rhythms of work songs can serve to synchronize physical movement in a group or gang. Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the 18th century, as workers took the music with which they were familiar, including [[ballads]] and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances.<ref name=Lloyd1967>A. L. Lloyd, ''Folk song in England'' (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1967), pp. 323-8.</ref> Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry.<ref>J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music, vol. 1: Media, Industry and Society'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003), p. 251.</ref> As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest [[protest songs]] and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile production]], mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries.<ref name=Lloyd1967/>\n\n==Regional traditions==\n\n===East Anglia===\n[[File:MollyDancers.jpg|thumb|right|Molly dancers at [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesea Straw Bear]] Festival]]\n\nLike many regions of England there are few distinctive local instruments and many songs were shared with the rest of Britain and with Ireland, although the distinct dialects of the regions sometimes lent them a particular stamp and, with one of the longest coastlines of any English region, songs about the sea were also particularly important. Along with the West Country, this was one of the regions that most firmly adopted reed instruments, producing many eminent practitioners of the melodeon from the mid-19th century.  Also like the West Country it is one of the few regions where there is still an active tradition of [[step dancing]] and like the Midlands the tradition of [[Molly dance]] died out in the 1930s.<ref>'Step Dancing', ''East Anglian Traditional Music Trust'', http://www.eatmt.org.uk/stepdancing.htm, retrieved 16/02/09.</ref> The region was relatively neglected by folk song collectors of the first revival.

However, in more recent years a distinct cultural heritage has been recognised including unique folk traditions and songs, many associated with the regions industrial connections. It has also produced a number of important performers and some particular local instruments, such as the Lincolnshire [[bagpipes]], however the last player, John Hunsley, died in the 19th century and no actual examples of the pipes have survived.<ref>''The Pipers' Gathering'', http://www.pipersgathering.org/PB2004.shtml, retrieved 16/02/09.</ref> From the 19th century the instruments used appear to have been much like those in other regions, with fiddles, accordions and eventually silver and brass. Although, some traditions, like [[Molly dance]] died out in the 1930s, the Midlands retained strong traditions of both ceremonial and social dance, particularly in the south Midlands and [[Cotswolds]] and in the distinctive [[Border Morris]] from Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire.<ref name=\"Broughton1999\"/> The region also furnished some important material for folk songs, including a claim by Nottinghamshire for one of the most popular series of ballads, that of [[Robin Hood]], while local places appear in songs such as \u2018The Leicester Chambermaid\u2019 and \u2018Oxford\u2019 or \u2018Worcester City\u2019.<ref>R.

''Twenty-One Lincolnshire Folk-Songs from the Manuscript Collection of Percy Grainger'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1968).</ref> It was not until the early 1970s that the broader heritage of the region, including the many industrial and work songs associated with mining or [[The Potteries]], began to gain serious attention.<ref>R.

L. Lloyd gravitated to London in the 1950s, it was the base of Topic Records and it was there that the first folk clubs were formed before they spread out across the country.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> It was also the home of folk musicians like Ashley Hutchings, Richard Thompson and Simon Nicol who formed Fairport Convention, and many artists, like Bert Jansch and Davy Graham, moved there in order to be able to pursue their careers or for the greater networks and opportunities the capital allowed.<ref>P. Humphries, ''Meet on the Ledge, a History of Fairport Convention'' (London: Virgin Publishing Ltd, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 7-9.</ref> More recent performers of folk music include [[Noah and the Whale]], Emma Lee Moss, [[Mumford and Sons]] and [[The Border Surrender]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111028232903/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/folk-music-in-the-city-1547431.html \u2019Folk music in the City\u2019], ''Independent'', 06/02/09, retrieved 03/12/15.</ref>\n\n====Sussex====\n{{Main|Music of Sussex}}\n\n[[Sussex]] has disproportionately affected the history of English folk music. This was due to a flourishing tradition of [[folk dance]], [[mummers]] plays and folk song, but also in part because of the rural nature of the county in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and yet its relatively close proximity to London. It was thus a rich and convenient place for the collectors of the first folk song revival, including [[Kate Lee (English singer)|Kate Lee]], [[Lucy Broadwood]] and W. P. Merrick.<ref>W. P.
