The auctioneer \"knocks down\" the lot, declaring it sold to the winning bidder. The winning bid for a lot is also called the hammer price. Sotheby's organises the delivery of the lot in private with the buyer.\n\n===Buying===\nBuyers can find out what is for sale at Sotheby's by browsing e-catalogues, visiting pre-sale exhibitions, purchasing print catalogues and registering for e-mail alerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/buysell/buy.html|title=Sotheby's-Buy |publisher=Sotheby's |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> Buyers can register to bid in person at Sotheby's offices, or online. Sotheby's requires that prospective buyers provide government-issued proof of identity and sometimes a bank reference. There are four ways buyers can bid: in person at the auction rooms, by telephone, bid live online or make an absentee bid online. When a bid is successful, Sotheby's calculates and sums the hammer price, the buyer's premium and taxes.\n\n===Selling===\nSellers are required to submit an Auction Estimate Form, providing thorough information and a photograph of the item.

When a bid is successful, Sotheby's calculates and sums the hammer price, the buyer's premium and taxes.\n\n===Selling===\nSellers are required to submit an Auction Estimate Form, providing thorough information and a photograph of the item.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n|align=left\n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

Alastor accepts and provides her with a staff to help run the hotel, he defeats Sir Pentious when he attacks the hotel seeking revenge, and changes the name from Happy to Hazbin Hotel after inviting everyone back inside to have [[jambalaya]].<hr>Songs: \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" ''(Charlie)'', \"Inside of Every Demon Is a Rainbow\" ''(Charlie)'', \"Alastor's Reprise\" ''(Alastor)''\n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n<!---\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       =\n| Aux2            =\n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   =\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n===Season 2===--->\n}}\n\n==Other media==\n===Comic===\nVivziepop announced a prequel comic focusing on the characters prior to the events of the series.<ref name=\"7 MILLION?

Despite his shady claims that he only wishes to provide this \"charity\" for his own entertainment, Charlie allows his help for as long as he wishes, and to not do anything that would ruin her goals. Alastor accepts and provides her with a staff to help run the hotel, he defeats Sir Pentious when he attacks the hotel seeking revenge, and changes the name from Happy to Hazbin Hotel after inviting everyone back inside to have [[jambalaya]].<hr>Songs: \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" ''(Charlie)'', \"Inside of Every Demon Is a Rainbow\" ''(Charlie)'', \"Alastor's Reprise\" ''(Alastor)''\n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n<!---\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       =\n| Aux2            =\n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   =\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n===Season 2===--->\n}}\n\n==Other media==\n===Comic===\nVivziepop announced a prequel comic focusing on the characters prior to the events of the series.<ref name=\"7 MILLION?

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], it is also colloquially referred to as ''M\u011bi-Ji\u0101-y\u00edng'' (\u7f8e\u52a0\u71df) &ndash; \u201cAmerica and Canada Camp\u201d &ndash;  a reference to the origin of most participants. The program is held at the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://chientan.cyh.org.tw/?lang=en Chientan Youth Activity Center Official Website(Chinese)]</ref>(\u528d\u6f6d) in [[Taipei]] which is not to be confused with [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] subway station.\n\n==Origins of the Study Tour==\n[[File:Lb1969c.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1969 Roster Book of the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour.

The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan. This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government's subsidizing of the program was to shore up [[Overseas Chinese]] support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the [[Kuomintang]] for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the [[Overseas Chinese]] community not only for its financing but also for its political support.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23462345?seq=1 Taiwan and Overseas Chinese during the Cold War Era]</ref>  In fact Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]],<ref>[http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=sun_yat-sen.html Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]</ref> the founder of the [[Kuomintang]] as well as the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]], recognized early the importance of [[Overseas Chinese]] support<ref>[https://www.straight.com/blogra/faces-vancouver-kuomintang-building-chinatown Sun Yat-Sen and Overseas Chinese history]</ref> and went as far as to say that \"Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.<ref>[http://www.heroesofconfederation.com/Sun_Yat_Sen/sun_mission(1).html Sun Yat-Sen acknowledgement of Overseas Chinese]</ref>\"  However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its \"[[Loveboat]]\" reputation of spawning many relationships as well hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.\n\n==Changes from 1967 to 1999==\n[[File:Lb1969a.jpg|thumb|Official 1969 Certificate of attendance for the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour. Photo permission provided by [[Jan Wong]] and the Chinese Canadian Archive]]The Study Tour has gone through many changes over the years which correspond with Taiwan's changing politics and economy. After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4271166/_Chinese_American_Transnationalism_Aboard_the_Love_Boat_The_Overseas_Youth_Language_Training_and_Study_Tour_to_the_Republic_of_China_ Chinese American Transnationalism aboard the Loveboat]</ref>, the [[China Youth Corps]] conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25.  According to journalist [[Jan Wong]], a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the [[Shilin District]] near modern day [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] station.  During this time, the [[China Youth Corps]] had changed the name of the Study Tour to become \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,\" to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300\u2013500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1,200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in two separate campuses in 1990, one remaining at Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei's [[Tam Kang Campus]].  During this time, and due to the increase in student size, the [[China Youth Corps]] came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which has since been renamed the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]].\n\n[[File:Chientan.jpg|thumb|Chientan Youth Activity Center]]\nThis increase in enrolment coincided with both Taiwan's 1987 lifting of [[martial law]] and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island's reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture, improved Chinese language skills and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the international Chinese community.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/popup.php?x=news3 Direct link to August 3rd, 2004 Toronto Star article \"Finding a Mate Offshore\" by William Lin]</ref> This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of \"Asian American identity\" for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011209130536/http://www.geocities.com/jodeman.geo/loveboat.htm 'A More Complete Description of The Love Boat\" (English)]</ref>  There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common \"Chinese North American Experience\" of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society. This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships.  In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as \"little diplomats.\"  This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters.  This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan.  These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board(excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan Government subsidization, also led to an increased popularity for the trip as most agreed it was an excellent deal. \n[[File:224273 9461070452 3021 n.jpg|thumb|Students sneaking out of Chientan Campus at night to party]]\nHowever, a by-product of the Study Tour's increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child.  Some parents desiring their children to find a \"suitable Chinese spouse\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113166784230094239 The Loveboat Wall Street Journal Article]</ref> sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour.  Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour's [[Love Boat]] reputation for fear of not being allowed to go.  These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other.  All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its [[Love Boat]] nickname and reputation.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/index.php?y=inthenews ''Toronto Star'' 3 August 2004 article on the Study Tour re-published by Click2Asia.  Click2Asia indicates date and source of material (Toronto Star) in this link]</ref> Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. \n\n[[File:Loveboatclub.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students of the Love Boat enjoying an evening at a Taipei Dance Club]]\nThe job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local college-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students' itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, trips outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent(in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on insuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the [[China Youth Corps]] only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as life-changing as did the students who attended.\n\nAnother prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory [[university]] enrolment, with a preference for students in [[Ivy League]] universities and students in their final year of university and thus near the age limit. Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, or Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge.  Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families.  Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe.  Participation had gradually increased from Europe especially from the countries such as England, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.  Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants.  This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among [[Overseas Chinese]] worldwide.\n[[File:222318 9461130452 2683 n.jpg|thumb|CYC President Dr. Jeanne Li giving her final speech during the 2000 Study Tour Closing Ceremony]]\nBy the 1990s, the Study Tour had become a 6 week long program with an enrolment of 1200 participants aged from 18\u201323 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors.  As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing language class education schedule. These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others.  After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the \"Closing Ceremony\" in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium.  This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous \"9 day trip down South\" which took all 1,200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas. These scenic attractions included [[Taroko National Park]], [[Sun Moon Lake]], [[Kenting National Park]], and [[Sanxiantai]], among others.  The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning (sometimes tearfully) to their countries of origin.\n\n==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==\n[[File:Ocean2.jpg|thumb|National Taiwan Ocean University Campus]]Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by [[Ocean Campus]] in [[Keelung]].  Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus.<ref>[http://www.explode.com/passport/taiwan.shtml Explode.com Study Tour Article \"Fear and Loathing in Taiwan\" (English)]</ref>  But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei.  In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife.  Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond.  Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour.  This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.\n\n==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==\n[[File:Kenting.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Kenting]], one of the scenic sites during \"The 9 day trip down South\"]]\nOne other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student.  According to Valerie Soe's 2019 documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan<ref>[https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/about Loveboat Taiwan documentary Official Website ]</ref>\", in August 1993 during that year's \"9 day trip down south\", a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of [[Kenting]].  The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him.  His body was not found until it washed up several days later.  This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement.  Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students.  Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour,<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html Article detailing Studytour in Mid 1990s (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408160336/http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html |date=2007-04-08 }}</ref> students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.\n\n==Changes from 2000 to 2012==\n[[File:Ktvtpe.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students enjoying a night at a Taipei KTV]]\nThe program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]]. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted.  Further problems for the Study tour continued.  The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan's [[Kuomintang]] party since its inception in 1967.  After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour.  As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrolment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students.<ref>[http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html Article detailing study tour history (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116232224/http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html |date=2006-11-16 }}</ref> To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the \"Baby Boat\", a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12\u201318. The cuts did not end there.  In 2002, due to lack of government support, the [[China Youth Corps]] which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.\n[[File:Militarytpe.jpg|thumb|Love Boat participants at a Taiwan military base in [[Kaoshiung]].  To meet its ideological aims, the Study Tour required students to attend demonstrations at various military bases and to attend lectures. ]]\nAs a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted  about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in [[Taichung]].  The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus.  This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a \"Trip down South.\" There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.\n\nIn the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even \nmissile threats/military posturing from China.  However, no Study Tour year was ever canceled due to these incidents except the 2003 year.  In 2003, the worldwide SARS outbreak caused the only ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began.  Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions.\n\nThe Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.\"  One group remained at Chientan Campus which on this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks.  Another group was located at Taichung.  The enrolment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in the Taiwanese dialect.  These changes did not last when the [[Kuomintang]] party returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in mandarin were again re-established.\n\n==Changes to Chientan Campus==\n[[File:Shilinloveboat.jpg|thumb|Students enjoying the famous [[Shilin Night Market]] near Chientan Campus]]\nThe Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the [[Shilin District]] for decades since the [[China Youth Corps]] first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex.  In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/03/2003617375Remove China Youth Corps\u2019 center: Taipei councilor]</ref> and to replace it with an arts center and park<ref>[https://www.eco-business.com/news/taipei-city-mulls-shilin-district-urban-renewal-plan/ Taipei City mulls Shilin District urban renewal plan</ref>.

What fate may lie for the Chientan Youth Activity Center after the beginning of 2025, whether it be renewal or demolition, remains unknown.\n\n==Changes from 2013 to current program==\n[[File:Loveboatclass.jpg|thumb|A typical Study Tour mandarin language class]]\nThe documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan\" further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants.  The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer.  Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour.<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=2169&pid=35039 \"Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour Official Website\"]</ref>\"  It is now solely run by the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]](OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its Official website<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/ Overseas Community Affairs Council Official Website]</ref> the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 18 and 25 years old.  It is also just one of the OCAC's many \"expatriate\" programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year.   Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-straight relations.  With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes \"participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities\" as described in the OCAC's application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan's goal of establishing greater international support and recognition.\n\nEven though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe documentary [https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/ ''Loveboat Taiwan''] by Valerie Soe was released in 2019 to film festivals internationally and to public acclaim receiving several awards.<ref>[ http://urbannomad.tw/2019urbannomadawards/?lang=en Audience choice award for Loveboat Taiwan]</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2020 Harper Collins published Abigail Hing Wen's debut novel, [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23559994-loveboat-taipei ''Loveboat, Taipei''],<ref>[https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062957276/loveboat-taipei/ Loveboat, Taipei Novel]</ref> which made the New York Times best Top Ten best seller's list for Young Adult fiction.

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], it is also colloquially referred to as ''M\u011bi-Ji\u0101-y\u00edng'' (\u7f8e\u52a0\u71df) &ndash; \u201cAmerica and Canada Camp\u201d &ndash;  a reference to the origin of most participants. The program is held at the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://chientan.cyh.org.tw/?lang=en Chientan Youth Activity Center Official Website(Chinese)]</ref>(\u528d\u6f6d) in [[Taipei]] which is not to be confused with [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] subway station.\n\n==Origins of the Study Tour==\n[[File:Lb1969c.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1969 Roster Book of the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour.

The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan. This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government's subsidizing of the program was to shore up [[Overseas Chinese]] support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the [[Kuomintang]] for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the [[Overseas Chinese]] community not only for its financing but also for its political support.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23462345?seq=1 Taiwan and Overseas Chinese during the Cold War Era]</ref>  In fact Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]],<ref>[http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=sun_yat-sen.html Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]</ref> the founder of the [[Kuomintang]] as well as the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]], recognized early the importance of [[Overseas Chinese]] support<ref>[https://www.straight.com/blogra/faces-vancouver-kuomintang-building-chinatown Sun Yat-Sen and Overseas Chinese history]</ref> and went as far as to say that \"Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.<ref>[http://www.heroesofconfederation.com/Sun_Yat_Sen/sun_mission(1).html Sun Yat-Sen acknowledgement of Overseas Chinese]</ref>\"  However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its \"[[Loveboat]]\" reputation of spawning many relationships as well hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.\n\n==Changes from 1967 to 1999==\n[[File:Lb1969a.jpg|thumb|Official 1969 Certificate of attendance for the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour. Photo permission provided by [[Jan Wong]] and the Chinese Canadian Archive]]The Study Tour has gone through many changes over the years which correspond with Taiwan's changing politics and economy. After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4271166/_Chinese_American_Transnationalism_Aboard_the_Love_Boat_The_Overseas_Youth_Language_Training_and_Study_Tour_to_the_Republic_of_China_ Chinese American Transnationalism aboard the Loveboat]</ref>, the [[China Youth Corps]] conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25.  According to journalist [[Jan Wong]], a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the [[Shilin District]] near modern day [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] station.  During this time, the [[China Youth Corps]] had changed the name of the Study Tour to become \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,\" to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300\u2013500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1,200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in two separate campuses in 1990, one remaining at Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei's [[Tam Kang Campus]].  During this time, and due to the increase in student size, the [[China Youth Corps]] came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which has since been renamed the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]].\n\n[[File:Chientan.jpg|thumb|Chientan Youth Activity Center]]\nThis increase in enrolment coincided with both Taiwan's 1987 lifting of [[martial law]] and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island's reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture, improved Chinese language skills and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the National Chinese Community.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/popup.php?x=news3 Direct link to August 3rd, 2004 Toronto Star article \"Finding a Mate Offshore\" by William Lin]</ref> This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of \"Asian American identity\" for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011209130536/http://www.geocities.com/jodeman.geo/loveboat.htm 'A More Complete Description of The Love Boat\" (English)]</ref>  There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common \"Chinese North American Experience\" of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society. This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships.  In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as \"little diplomats.\"  This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters.  This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan.  These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board(excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan Government subsidization, also led to an increased popularity for the trip as most agreed it was an excellent deal. \n[[File:224273 9461070452 3021 n.jpg|thumb|Students sneaking out of Chientan Campus at night to party]]\nHowever, a by-product of the Study Tour's increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child.  Some parents desiring their children to find a \"suitable Chinese spouse\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113166784230094239 The Loveboat Wall Street Journal Article]</ref> sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour.  Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour's [[Love Boat]] reputation for fear of not being allowed to go.  These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other.  All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its [[Love Boat]] nickname and reputation.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/index.php?y=inthenews ''Toronto Star'' 3 August 2004 article on the Study Tour re-published by Click2Asia.  Click2Asia indicates date and source of material (Toronto Star) in this link]</ref> Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. \n\n[[File:Loveboatclub.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students of the Love Boat enjoying an evening at a Taipei Dance Club]]\nThe job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local college-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students' itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, trips outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent(in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on insuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the [[China Youth Corps]] only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as life-changing as did the students who attended.\n\nAnother prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory [[university]] enrolment, with a preference for students in [[Ivy League]] universities and students in their final year of university and thus near the age limit. Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, or Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge.  Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families.  Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe.  Participation had gradually increased from Europe especially from the countries such as England, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.  Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants.  This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among [[Overseas Chinese]] worldwide.\n[[File:222318 9461130452 2683 n.jpg|thumb|CYC President Dr. Jeanne Li giving her final speech during the 2000 Study Tour Closing Ceremony]]\nBy the 1990s, the Study Tour had become a 6 week long program with an enrolment of 1200 participants aged from 18\u201323 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors.  As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing language class education schedule. These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others.  After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the \"Closing Ceremony\" in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium.  This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous \"9 day trip down South\" which took all 1,200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas. These scenic attractions included [[Taroko National Park]], [[Sun Moon Lake]], [[Kenting National Park]], and [[Sanxiantai]], among others.  The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning (sometimes tearfully) to their countries of origin.\n\n==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==\n[[File:Ocean2.jpg|thumb|National Taiwan Ocean University Campus]]Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by [[Ocean Campus]] in [[Keelung]].  Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus.<ref>[http://www.explode.com/passport/taiwan.shtml Explode.com Study Tour Article \"Fear and Loathing in Taiwan\" (English)]</ref>  But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei.  In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife.  Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond.  Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour.  This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.\n\n==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==\n[[File:Kenting.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Kenting]], one of the scenic sites during \"The 9 day trip down South\"]]\nOne other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student.  According to Valerie Soe's 2019 documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan<ref>[https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/about Loveboat Taiwan documentary Official Website ]</ref>\", in August 1993 during that year's \"9 day trip down south\", a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of [[Kenting]].  The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him.  His body was not found until it washed up several days later.  This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement.  Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students.  Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour,<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html Article detailing Studytour in Mid 1990s (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408160336/http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html |date=2007-04-08 }}</ref> students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.\n\n==Changes from 2000 to 2012==\n[[File:Ktvtpe.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students enjoying a night at a Taipei KTV]]\nThe program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]]. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted.  Further problems for the Study tour continued.  The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan's [[Kuomintang]] party since its inception in 1967.  After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour.  As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrolment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students.<ref>[http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html Article detailing study tour history (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116232224/http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html |date=2006-11-16 }}</ref> To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the \"Baby Boat\", a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12\u201318. The cuts did not end there.  In 2002, due to lack of government support, the [[China Youth Corps]] which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.\n[[File:Militarytpe.jpg|thumb|Love Boat participants at a Taiwan military base in [[Kaoshiung]].  To meet its ideological aims, the Study Tour required students to attend demonstrations at various military bases and to attend lectures. ]]\nAs a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted  about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in [[Taichung]].  The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus.  This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a \"Trip down South.\" There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.\n\nIn the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even \nmissile threats/military posturing from China.  However, no Study Tour year was ever canceled due to these incidents except the 2003 year.  In 2003, the worldwide SARS outbreak caused the only ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began.  Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions.\n\nThe Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.\"  One group remained at Chientan Campus which on this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks.  Another group was located at Taichung.  The enrolment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in the Taiwanese dialect.  These changes did not last when the [[Kuomintang]] party returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in mandarin were again re-established.\n\n==Changes to Chientan Campus==\n[[File:Shilinloveboat.jpg|thumb|Students enjoying the famous [[Shilin Night Market]] near Chientan Campus]]\nThe Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the [[Shilin District]] for decades since the [[China Youth Corps]] first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex.  In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/03/2003617375Remove China Youth Corps\u2019 center: Taipei councilor]</ref> and to replace it with an arts center and park<ref>[https://www.eco-business.com/news/taipei-city-mulls-shilin-district-urban-renewal-plan/ Taipei City mulls Shilin District urban renewal plan</ref>.

What fate may lie for the Chientan Youth Activity Center after the beginning of 2025, whether it be renewal or demolition, remains unknown.\n\n==Changes from 2013 to current program==\n[[File:Loveboatclass.jpg|thumb|A typical Study Tour mandarin language class]]\nThe documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan\" further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants.  The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer.  Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour.<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=2169&pid=35039 \"Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour Official Website\"]</ref>\"  It is now solely run by the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]](OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its Official website<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/ Overseas Community Affairs Council Official Website]</ref> the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 18 and 25 years old.  It is also just one of the OCAC's many \"expatriate\" programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year.   Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-straight relations.  With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes \"participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities\" as described in the OCAC's application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan's goal of establishing greater international support and recognition.\n\nEven though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe documentary [https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/ ''Loveboat Taiwan''] by Valerie Soe was released in 2019 to film festivals internationally and to public acclaim receiving several awards.<ref>[ http://urbannomad.tw/2019urbannomadawards/?lang=en Audience choice award for Loveboat Taiwan]</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2020 Harper Collins published Abigail Hing Wen's debut novel, [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23559994-loveboat-taipei ''Loveboat, Taipei''],<ref>[https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062957276/loveboat-taipei/ Loveboat, Taipei Novel]</ref> which made the New York Times best Top Ten best seller's list for Young Adult fiction.

In 1936 she spent a month visiting former refugees with whom she had worked during and after the war.\n\nOn returning to Birmingham, Barrow continued her work with the [[settlement movement]], throwing herself into the newly formed Housing Improvement Society, '''COPEC'''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brion|first=Marion|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VeyJAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA34&dq=florence%20barrow%20quaker%20women&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q=florence%20barrow%20quaker%20women&f=false|title=Women in the Housing Service|date=2002-2011|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-134-89359-1|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref> that pioneered municipal slum clearance and the regeneration of inner-city housing. Copec was named after the '''Christian Conference on Politics, Economics and Citizenship''' which was held in Birmingham in 1924. The issue of housing was a matter of increasing concern in Birmingham in the inter-war period. Barrow sold a house to buy the first Copec properties, 19 [[back-to-back house]]s in Pope Street. She moved out of 35 Frederick Road and downsized to number 23, which is where her [http://openplaques.org/plaques/51523 blue plaque] is sited, giving the difference in price to Copec.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/blue-plaque-to-florence-barrow-unveiled/|title=Birmingham Civic Society|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> She also acted as a rent collector in [[Nechells]] and was very involved in promoting the work, giving talks and writing leaflets to raise awareness and funds for the organisation. In one appeal she wrote that \"even the poorest house was a home\", and that society had a responsibility to provide decent and affordable homes for all. She was the driving force for over 37 years behind \"practical schemes of reconditioning, reconstruction, conversion and rebuilding\" (The Friend). Barrow was a member of Copec's committee from its foundation until shortly before her death, and served as its Honorary Secretary from 1928 to 1954. \n\nAt the same time as she was working voluntarily for Copec she was engaged in a number of other initiatives, most notably as honorary secretary of the '''Birmingham Council of Community Associations''' founded in 1930 to coordinate amenities on the new housing estates in North Birmingham. \u00a0\n\nShe joined the all-male Council of the [[Birmingham Civic Society]] in 1928, and remained on it for the next 30 years: for most of that period she was the only female member. The Civic Society was in some ways a family interest: members of [[Cadbury family]], who were closely related to the Barrows, were involved from the outset; and Florence's brother, Walter Barrow, was a founding member of the Council and served on it for many years. \n\nAt the age of 56, in 1932, she left Birmingham for Syria, Salonika, and Egypt to work once more with refugees. During the later 1930s the Quakers sent her as a [[Espionage|secret agent]] to [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Austria]], taking messages to and from endangered Jews. She later said she had found it \"very trying to know that every conversation might be overheard\" and reported to the Gestapo.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Birmingham Evening Mail|date=4 March 1964|access-date=|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Barrow continued to organise the reception of Jewish refugees from Nazism. In 1958 the City of Birmingham awarded her its Civic gold medal for its services to its urban housing programme, including the provision of low-rental accommodation for single working women and [[sheltered housing]] for the elderly and handicapped. They regretted to report that her active days as a social worker were almost finished, at the age to 82.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Birmingham Post|date=3 March 1958|work=Birmingham Post|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> It applauded, \"Miss Barrow's practical and constructive attitude towards social problems\", and went on to explain that the Civic Society was\u00a0\"anxious that the quiet and modest way in which Miss Barrow has laboured on behalf of the City\" should receive full recognition.  Many of the tributes to her that followed her death in 1964 also portrayed a strong but calm, quiet and very modest woman. As the testimony provided by Warwickshire Monthly meeting to Britain Yearly Meeting put it, \"Quiet and modest, her outward appearance gave little indication of the power within.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-life-and-work-of-Florence-Barrow.docx |title=The life and work of Florence Barrow |first=Sian |last=Roberts |publisher=Birmingham Civic Society |format=docx |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barrow, Florence}}\n[[Category:1876 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:English anti-war activists\u200e]]\n[[Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n", "text_old": "'''Florence Mary Barrow''' (27 January 1876 &ndash; 3 March 1964) was an English International Aid worker, [[Quakers|Quaker]] and housing reform activist particularly associated with her home city of [[Birmingham]].

In one appeal she wrote that \"even the poorest house was a home\", and that society had a responsibility to provide decent and affordable homes for all. She was the driving force for over 37 years behind \"practical schemes of reconditioning, reconstruction, conversion and rebuilding\" (The Friend). Barrow was a member of Copec's committee from its foundation until shortly before her death, and served as its Honorary Secretary from 1928 to 1954. \n\nAt the same time as she was working voluntarily for Copec she was engaged in a number of other initiatives, most notably as honorary secretary of the '''Birmingham Council of Community Associations''' founded in 1930 to coordinate amenities on the new housing estates in North Birmingham. \u00a0\n\nShe joined the all-male Council of the [[Birmingham Civic Society]] in 1928, and remained on it for the next 30 years: for most of that period she was the only female member. The Civic Society was in some ways a family interest: members of [[Cadbury family]], who were closely related to the Barrows, were involved from the outset; and Florence's brother, Walter Barrow, was a founding member of the Council and served on it for many years. \n\nAt the age of 56, in 1932, she left Birmingham for Syria, Salonika, and Egypt to work once more with refugees. During the later 1930s the Quakers sent her as a [[Espionage|secret agent]] to [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Austria]], taking messages to and from endangered Jews. She later said she had found it \"very trying to know that every conversation might be overheard\" and reported to the Gestapo.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Birmingham Evening Mail|date=4 March 1964|access-date=|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Barrow continued to organise the reception of Jewish refugees from Nazism. In 1958 the City of Birmingham awarded her its Civic gold medal for its services to its urban housing programme, including the provision of low-rental accommodation for single working women and [[sheltered housing]] for the elderly and handicapped. They regretted to report that her active days as a social worker were almost finished, at the age to 82.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Birmingham Post|date=3 March 1958|work=Birmingham Post|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> It applauded, \"Miss Barrow's practical and constructive attitude towards social problems\", and went on to explain that the Civic Society was\u00a0\"anxious that the quiet and modest way in which Miss Barrow has laboured on behalf of the City\" should receive full recognition.  Many of the tributes to her that followed her death in 1964 also portrayed a strong but calm, quiet and very modest woman. As the testimony provided by Warwickshire Monthly meeting to Britain Yearly Meeting put it, \"Quiet and modest, her outward appearance gave little indication of the power within.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-life-and-work-of-Florence-Barrow.docx |title=The life and work of Florence Barrow |first=Sian |last=Roberts |publisher=Birmingham Civic Society |format=docx |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barrow, Florence}}\n[[Category:1876 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:English anti-war activists\u200e]]\n[[Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly life:clean up,typo(s) fixed: nee \u2192  n\u00e9e", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Mary_Barrow"}

The corporate social responsibility policies of Gy\u00f6rgy Gatty\u00e1n and his company, the Docler Group, were mainly concerned with the support of Hungarian sport and cultural life but as a result of international expansion, the company is now supporting Luxembourgish charities and foundations as well.\n\u2003\nDocler Holding is the eponymous sponsor of several sports clubs, among others the runners team of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, the Docler Wolves American football team and the Wildboars Wheelchair Rugby Association, too. Among Docler's protegees, are Richard Rapport, Hungary's youngest grandmaster of chess and the young, but already world-champion sailor Benjamin Vadnai. Gy\u00f6rgy Gatty\u00e1n is also the co-founder of the Prima Primissima Foundation, the sponsor and mentor of the Junior Prima Prize of Hungarian folk art and community culture and the founder of the Docler Holding New Generation G\u00e1bor D\u00e9nes Award.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.doclerholding.com/en/imprint/ Docler Holding Group ]\n* Ervin Tam\u00e1s: [http://16.kerulet.ittlakunk.hu/arcok/130102/az-orszag-egyik-leggazdagabb-embere-rakosszentmihalyi-pornokiraly A man of luxury].
