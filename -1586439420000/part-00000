Simultaneously, Iranian 3D technical director Adel Adili, who worked with Kamalakannan for ''[[Anji (film)|Anji]]'' (2004), ''Yamadonga'' and ''[[Arundhati (2009 film)|Arundathi]]'' (2009), was working on the 3D Udayghad city. He started with a city-plan and added streets, buildings, mountains, temples, palaces, water bodies, a huge waterfall, rivers, gates, a moat and trees, all of which were planned and received Rajamouli's approval before being executed to full scale.

At that time, Kamalakannan was in Iran finalising the CG stadium and City with Adili. The majority of the film was shot in [[anamorphic format]], but a [[Super 35]] camera gate and lens were used for the stadium episode to minimise distortion. Post-production of the stadium scenes were given to Prasad EFX, and the film set up their own [[render farm]] in Chennai. The post process was done in several stages after the scan. The live stadium had only 7 steps, in which live people were positioned in 6 steps while the remaining 12 steps were CG extension. Adili created 3D CG people to fill the CG steps and their actions in a library of 3000 frames.<ref name=\"KK Interview IDB\" />\n\nDraper designed the birds in two flows: one flow kept flying around the stadium, while the other flow took off from a position dome and landed on a target dome. Rajamouli used those birds in several shots. Upon finishing the stages of the stadium composite, Kamalakannan flew to Iran again to work with Adel for the 3D city shots which were created entirely in CG. Adili designed 3D horses for the hero and villain and Draper designed the 3D people flocking behind the horses. About Adili's work, Kamalakannan said, \"When we started the city-shot renders, it has taken several hours to render one frame.

V. Vijayendra Prasad]] and directed by [[S. S. Rajamouli]]. The film stars [[Ram Charan]] and [[Kajal Aggarwal]], with [[Dev Gill]] and [[Srihari]] in supporting roles, and was produced by [[Allu Aravind]] of [[Geetha Arts]]. The reincarnation-themed plot revolves around four people: a valiant warrior in charge of the princess' safety, the princess who is in love with him, the commander-in-chief of the army who lusts after the princess, and an emperor who wants to conquer their kingdom. They all die before their wishes are fulfilled and the plot jumps forward 400 years, at which point the reincarnation of the warrior starts having flashbacks upon a chance encounter.\n\nMade on a budget of {{INR}}35 crore,<ref name=\"TOI budget\" /><ref name=\"NewsMinute budget\" /> production began on 2 March 2008 while principal photography commenced on 19 March 2008. The cinematography was done by [[K. K. Senthil Kumar]], and was edited by [[Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao]]. Production design was done by R. Ravinder, while the action sequences were choreographed by [[Peter Hein]] and the duo of Ram\u2014Lakshman. The visual effects were designed by R. C. Kamalakannan, with assistance from Adel Adili and Pete Draper. It is the first Telugu film to list a \"visual effects producer\" in its credits. The soundtrack was composed by [[M. M. Keeravani]], who collaborated with [[Kalyani Malik]] to score the background music.\n\n''Magadheera'' was released on 31 July 2009 across 1250 screens worldwide, to critical acclaim, and collected a distributor's share of {{INR}}731 million. Its 1000-day theatrical run surpassed ''[[Chandramukhi]]'' (2005) as the longest running [[Cinema of South India|South Indian film]]. It is also the first Telugu film to have a home media release in [[Blu-ray]]. The film won the [[National Film Awards|National Award]] for [[National Film Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] and [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects|Best Special Effects]] at the [[57th National Film Awards]] as well as winning six [[57th Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]], nine [[Nandi Awards]] and ten [[CineMAA Awards]]. The film's success catapulted the lead actors into stardom.\n\nThe film was dubbed into [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''Maaveeran'' and [[Malayalam]] as ''Dheera: The Warrior'', and was released simultaneously on 27 May 2011 in more than 100 and 50 screens respectively, with both versions being commercially successful. In 2014, the film was further remade in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali]] as ''[[Yoddha: The Warrior]]'' by [[Raj Chakraborty]].\n\n== Plot ==\nHarsha, a [[Freestyle motocross|dirt-bike racer]], is travelling via [[auto rickshaw]]. He spots the blurry outline of a woman trying to flag the auto down, and gestures to her that it is already occupied. As he does, their fingers accidentally touch, and Harsha feels an electric current passing through him, which triggers a few fleeting images. After recovering from the shock, he flees the auto in search of the girl and inquires about her to a woman named Indira \"Indu\", unaware that Indu is the same woman. Indu, thinking he is stalking her, misdirects him by convincing him that the girl is her neighbour. She and her friends exploit Harsha, having him take them to places and promising that the girl will show. After Harsha beats up a group of men who were verbally harassing Indu, she starts to fall in love with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Indu's distant cousin Raghuveer, lusts after her. He manipulates Indu and her father into trusting him. However, when he attempts to touch a sleeping Indu, he sees visions of a warrior slitting his throat. Raghuveer consults a [[Tantra|tantrik]], Ghora, who reveals that in a prior life, Raghuveer was a prince who lusted after Indu, and was killed by her lover, a warrior. Raghuveer is determined to find the [[reincarnation]] of the warrior and kill him. Meanwhile, Harsha discovers how Indu and her friends have been defrauding him, and after he pranks her in retaliation, they start to fall in love. Raghuveer discovers that Harsha is the reincarnation of the warrior, murders Indu's father and frames Harsha. As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha fails to catch them; falling into a lake, he faces a [[near-death experience]] and gets a full vision of his past-life in 1609.\n\nIn 1609, Emperor Sher Khan is preparing to invade the kingdom of Udayghar when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha). King Vikram Singh's daughter, Mithravindha Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds himself back. Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), lusts after Mithra and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished from Udayghad. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests that Bhairava not marry his daughter, because Bhairava has a high chance of dying in the ensuing battle with Khan's forces, and he does not wish to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhairava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught.\n\nBhairava takes Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God prior to the attack. Mithra demands that Bhairava admit his love for her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' and, using her own blood, paints an image of Bhairava on a rock leaving his true love to do his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev has aided Khan's army, who have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive, and Khan challenges Bhairava to kill at least 100 of his soldiers. Bhairava completes the challenge, but is severely injured in the battle. Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart and accepts him as his friend. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra before being killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he jumps to his own death.\n\nIn the present, Harsha is rescued by a fisherman named Solomon (the reincarnation of Khan) and, with Solomon's help, visits Udayghad. He reaches Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's past-life memories are not revived within the day they never can be, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Raghuveer accidentally kills Ghora. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived. Harsha fights Raghuveer, and with the help of Solomon, manages to kill him and the couple reunites.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ram Charan]] as Kala Bhairava and Harsha\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Mithravinda Devi and Indira (Indu)\n* [[Dev Gill]] as Ranadev Billa and Raghuveer\n* [[Srihari]] as Sher Khan and Solomon\n* [[Rao Ramesh]] as Ghora\n* [[Sarath Babu]] as Vikram Singh\n* [[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]] as Bhoopathi Varma\n* [[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]] as Harsha's gullible friend\n* [[Sameer Hasan]] as Maan Singh\n\n;Cameo appearances\n\n* [[Chiranjeevi]] in a [[cameo appearance]] in the [[item number|item song]] \"Bangaru Kodipetta\".\n* [[Mumaith Khan]] as Reshma, the dirt bike race organiser.

V. Vijayendra Prasad]] was watching a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by [[Army of the Mughal Empire|Mughal Army]]. Once the duo can reach [[Sinhagad]] fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote a story on the theme of [[reincarnation]] of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies in his attempt to re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a [[Chief Minister]] or a popular social worker like [[Medha Patkar]]. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director [[S. S. Rajamouli]] selected this script, but made several changes to it.{{Sfn|Chinnarayana|2015|page=10}} Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that the relationship between a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.<ref name=\"post mortem\" /> Prasad said he was inspired by the [[Kannada]] film ''[[Raja Nanna Raja]]'' (1976) while writing the story.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vijaykarnatakaepaper.com/ |title=Vijay Karnataka: ePaper |website=www.vijaykarnatakaepaper.com}}</ref>\n\nProduction for the film was officially launched on 2 March 2008 at FNCC in Hyderabad.

The majority of the film was shot in [[anamorphic format]], but a [[Super 35]] camera gate and lens were used for the stadium episode to minimise distortion. Post-production of the stadium scenes were given to Prasad EFX, and the film set up their own [[render farm]] in Chennai. The post process was done in several stages after the scan. The live stadium had only 7 steps, in which live people were positioned in 6 steps while the remaining 12 steps were CG extension. Adili created 3D CG people to fill the CG steps and their actions in a library of 3000 frames.<ref name=\"KK Interview IDB\" />\n\nDraper designed the birds in two flows: one flow kept flying around the stadium, while the other flow took off from a position dome and landed on a target dome. Rajamouli used those birds in several shots. Upon finishing the stages of the stadium composite, Kamalakannan flew to Iran again to work with Adel for the 3D city shots which were created entirely in CG. Adili designed 3D horses for the hero and villain and Draper designed the 3D people flocking behind the horses. About Adili's work, Kamalakannan said, \"When we started the city-shot renders, it has taken several hours to render one frame. But Adili re-corrected the geometry and applied several path breaking ideas, so even on 24 July, just a week before the film release, we were able to do corrections, render and submit.\"<ref name=\"KK Interview IDB\" /> {{INRConvert|40|m}} was spent solely on VFX for ''Magadheera''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Filmmakers-spend-extra-on-visual-effects/articleshow/10606670.cms |title=Filmmakers spend extra on visual effects |last=Pasupulate |first=Karthik |date=5 November 2011 |website=The Times of India |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109144452/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Filmmakers-spend-extra-on-visual-effects/articleshow/10606670.cms |archive-date=9 November 2014 |access-date=9 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Piracy ===\nDuring the film's shoot at [[Ramoji Film City]] in late November 2008, a {{convert|500|sqft|m2}} [[film can]], containing two or three scenes, was discovered missing from Rainbow lab.

Comrade Miller called to my attention the fact that the Botany Mills of Passaic had announced a wage cut of ten percent, beginning with October, 1925. I immediately instructed Miller to get in touch with our New Jersey comrades and explore the matter further, agreeing with him that on its face the situation seemed favorable enough for initiating agitation for a strike in retaliation for the wage cut. Miller was a veteran of the Party since its underground days and carried out his assignment expeditiously. His report convinced me that there was ample ground for developing a successful strike.<ref name=\"Gitlow\">\n{{cite book\n| first = Benjamin \n| last = Gitlow\n| title = I Confess: The Truth About American Communism\n| publisher = E.P.

We built up a picket line, drew up our demands and created a semblance of organization. They no longer felt lost or abandoned... They wanted to see membership applications and membership dues books...  Back in New York I reported all this to Miller. This innocent agreed that I should get application and membership cards printed. He was not aware that on this matter he would be bitterly assailed by the Foster-Cannon leadership for dual unionism and would open up a major struggle with the Party... <br> The worthlessness of the C.P. leaders did not in the least make me undervalue the great worth of the tens of thousands of devoted foreign-born workers and militant American-born youth who were the members and followers of that party... At the moment for me the important link in the chain was the innocent Bert Miller, acting on this own while the \"bigs\" were tied up with other matters, especially the N.Y.

As business manager of the ''Daily Worker'', the future research director of the House Committee on Un-American Activities had to meet a weekly payroll and find money to pay the paper, print, and other bills.  Money was very hard to find, and his life was a weekly crisis.  Thus, my chief recollection of Bert Miller from the past is less than a face than as a weary plaint:  money. <br> Bert suffered other grievances, too.  In his business office, he presided over a number of young women Communists, one of whom was a remarkably pretty Hungarian girl.  He often protested that his girls were terrified towalk through the ''Daily Worker'' office (as they sometimes had to) because, while they wriggled their way past he crowded chairs, each of the editors in turn reached back and pinched them.<ref name=Witness /></small></blockquote>    In 1927, Mandel was elected to the Party's Central Committee at its fifth congress in 1927.

I immediately instructed Miller to get in touch with our New Jersey comrades and explore the matter further, agreeing with him that on its face the situation seemed favorable enough for initiating agitation for a strike in retaliation for the wage cut.

We built up a picket line, drew up our demands and created a semblance of organization. They no longer felt lost or abandoned... They wanted to see membership applications and membership dues books...  Back in New York I reported all this to Miller. This innocent agreed that I should get application and membership cards printed. He was not aware that on this matter he would be bitterly assailed by the Foster-Cannon leadership for dual unionism and would open up a major struggle with the Party... <br> The worthlessness of the C.P. leaders did not in the least make me undervalue the great worth of the tens of thousands of devoted foreign-born workers and militant American-born youth who were the members and followers of that party...

It was an autonomous province of [[People's Republic of Serbia|Serbia]], within the larger [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] from 1945 to 1963, when it was transformed into the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\n\n===History===\nThe province was formed in October 1944 when [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and [[Yugoslav partisans]] expelled [[Axis Powers|Axis]] troops from the region. In this time, the final political status of the province was not yet determined and the newly formed provincial administration functioned independently from [[Serbia]]. The temporary borders of Vojvodina included the regions of [[Banat]], [[Ba\u010dka]] and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] and most of the region of [[Syrmia]] with [[Zemun]]. The ''de jure'' temporary border between Vojvodina and [[Croatia]] in Syrmia was [[Vukovar]]-[[Vinkovci]]-[[\u017dupanja]] line. ''De facto'', western parts of Syrmia remained under Axis military control until April 1945. From 17 October 1944 to 27 January 1945, most of the province (Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja regions) was under military administration.\n\nIn 30\u201331 July 1945, the provincial assembly of Vojvodina decided that the province should join Serbia. This decision was confirmed in the third [[AVNOJ]] assembly in 10 August 1945, and the law that regulated the autonomous status of Vojvodina within Serbia was adopted in 1 September 1945. The final borders of Vojvodina with [[Croatia]] and [[Central Serbia]] were defined in 1945: Baranja and western Syrmia were assigned to Croatia, while small parts of Banat and Syrmia near [[Belgrade]] were assigned to Central Serbia. A small part of northern [[Ma\u010dva]] near [[Sremska Mitrovica]] was assigned to Vojvodina. The capital city of the province was [[Novi Sad]], which was also the capital of the former [[Danube Banovina]] province that existed before [[World War II]].\n\nSince 1945, Vojvodina enjoyed a limited level of autonomy within Serbia. In 1963, the name of the province was changed to the ''Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina''. Under the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]], the province gained extensive rights of self-rule, which defined Vojvodina as one of the subjects of the Yugoslav federation, and also gave it voting rights equivalent to Serbia itself on the country's collective presidency.\n\n===Demographics===\n\n;

Its capital was [[Novi Sad]].\n\n===History===\nThe Autonomous Province of Vojvodina that was created in 1944 enjoyed only the small level of autonomy within [[Serbia]] since 1945. In 1963, the name of the province was changed to ''Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina''. Under the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]], the province gained extensive rights of self-rule, which defined Vojvodina as one of the subjects of the Yugoslav federation, and also gave it voting rights equivalent to Serbia itself on the country's collective presidency.\n\nUnder the rule of the Serbian president [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], Vojvodina and [[Kosovo]] lost most of their autonomy on 28 September 1990. After this, the Vojvodina was no longer a subject of the Yugoslav federation, but again only the autonomous province of Serbia, with limited level of autonomy. The name of the province was also reverted to ''[[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]]''.\n\n===Demographics===\n\nAccording to the 1981 census, the population of the province included:\n* [[Serbs]] =

the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].

It was an autonomous province of [[People's Republic of Serbia|Serbia]], within the larger [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] from 1945 to 1963, when it was transformed into the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\n\n===History===\nThe province was formed in October 1944 when [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and [[Yugoslav partisans]] expelled [[Axis Powers|Axis]] troops from the region. In this time, the final political status of the province was not yet determined and the newly formed provincial administration functioned independently from [[Serbia]]. The temporary borders of Vojvodina included the regions of [[Banat]], [[Ba\u010dka]] and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] and most of the region of [[Syrmia]] with [[Zemun]]. The ''de jure'' temporary border between Vojvodina and [[Croatia]] in Syrmia was [[Vukovar]]-[[Vinkovci]]-[[\u017dupanja]] line. ''De facto'', western parts of Syrmia remained under Axis military control until April 1945. From 17 October 1944 to 27 January 1945, most of the province (Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja regions) was under military administration.\n\nIn 30\u201331 July 1945, the provincial assembly of Vojvodina decided that the province should join Serbia. This decision was confirmed in the third [[AVNOJ]] assembly in 10 August 1945, and the law that regulated the autonomous status of Vojvodina within Serbia was adopted in 1 September 1945. The final borders of Vojvodina with [[Croatia]] and [[Central Serbia]] were defined in 1945: Baranja and western Syrmia were assigned to Croatia, while small parts of Banat and Syrmia near [[Belgrade]] were assigned to Central Serbia. A small part of northern [[Ma\u010dva]] near [[Sremska Mitrovica]] was assigned to Vojvodina. The capital city of the province was [[Novi Sad]], which was also the capital of the former [[Danube Banovina]] province that existed before [[World War II]].\n\nSince 1945, Vojvodina enjoyed a limited level of autonomy within Serbia. In 1963, the name of the province was changed to the ''Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina''. Under the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]], the province gained extensive rights of self-rule, which defined Vojvodina as one of the subjects of the Yugoslav federation, and also gave it voting rights equivalent to Serbia itself on the country's collective presidency.\n\n===Demographics===\n\n;

In this painting, only the ''action'' that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.\n* The Persian term \"[[paradise]]\" (borrowed as {{lang-he|\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05e1}}, ''pardes''), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500&nbsp;BCE. The word \"''pardes''\" occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the [[Song of Solomon]] iv. 13: \"Thy plants are an orchard (''pardes'') of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard\"; [[Ecclesiastes]] 2. 5: \"I made me gardens and orchards (''pardes''), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits\"; and in [[Nehemiah]] ii. 8: \"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (''pardes''), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city.\" In these examples ''pardes'' clearly means \"orchard\" or \"park\", but in the [[apocalyptic literature]] and in the [[Talmud]] \"paradise\" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the [[New Testament]] \"paradise\" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary [[Hellenistic]] influences.\n\n==Other views==\n===Jewish eschatology===\nIn the [[Talmud]] and the Jewish [[Kabbalah]],<ref name=\"Gan Eden\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=39&letter=E Gan Eden] \u2013 JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.</ref> the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called \"Garden in Eden\". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the \"lower Gan Eden\". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the \"higher Gan Eden\".

Among the legends are ones about the two Gardens of Eden. Beyond Paradise is the higher Gan Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants. The higher Gan Eden contains three hundred ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments. The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one's merit.  The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for \"Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples,\" the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned; and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.<ref name=Legends>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>\n\nIn chapter two, Legends of the Jews gives a brief description of the lower Gan Eden. The tree of knowledge is a hedge around the tree of life, and it is so vast that it would take one over five hundred years to clear a path through the tree of knowledge to reach the tree of life. From beneath the trees flow all the world's waters in the form of four rivers: Tigris, Nile, Euphrates, and Ganges. After the fall of man, the world was no longer irrigated by this water. While in the garden, though, Adam and Eve were served meat dishes by angels and the animals of the world understood human language, respected mankind as God's image, and feared Adam and Eve. When one dies, one's soul must pass through the lower Gan Eden in order to reach the higher Gan Eden. The way to the garden is the Cave of Machpelah that Adam guards.

There are several mentions of \"the Garden\" in the Qur'an (2:35, 7:19, 20:117), while the Garden of Eden, without the word ''\u02bfadn'',<ref>See [http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEadon+pos%3Apn list of occurrences].</ref> is commonly the fourth layer of the Islamic [[Jannah|heaven]] and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].<ref>Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} p. 133</ref> The Quran refers frequently over various [[Surah]] about the first abode of Adam and Hawwa (Eve), including surat [[Sad (surah)|Sad]], which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71\u201388), surat [[al-Baqara]], surat [[al-A'raf]], and surat [[al-Hijr (surah)|al-Hijr]] although sometimes without mentioning the location. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Hawwa and Adam after they were tempted by [[Shaitan]]. Despite the Biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, which [[God in Islam|God]] specifically claimed it was forbidden to Adam and Eve. Some [[tafsir|exegesis]] added an account, about [[Satan]], disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, resulting in disobeying God.<ref>Leaman, Oliver ''The Quran, an encyclopedia'', p. 11, 2006</ref> These stories are also featured in the [[hadith]] collections, including [[al-Tabari]].<ref>Wheeler, Brannon ''Mecca and Eden: ritual, relics, and territory in Islam'' p. 16, 2006</ref>\n\n===Latter Day Saints===\n{{see also|Adam and Eve (LDS Church)}}\nFollowers of the [[Latter Day Saints movement]] (also known as [[Mormons]]) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], located in present-day [[Daviess County, Missouri]].

The idyll of \"Naming Day in Eden\" was less often depicted. Much of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' occurs in the Garden of Eden. [[Michelangelo]] depicted a [[:File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 022.jpg|scene]] at the Garden of Eden in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].

In this painting, only the ''action'' that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.\n* The Persian term \"[[paradise]]\" (borrowed as {{lang-he|\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05e1}}, ''pardes''), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500&nbsp;BCE. The word \"''pardes''\" occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the [[Song of Solomon]] iv. 13: \"Thy plants are an orchard (''pardes'') of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard\"; [[Ecclesiastes]] 2. 5: \"I made me gardens and orchards (''pardes''), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits\"; and in [[Nehemiah]] ii. 8: \"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (''pardes''), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city.\" In these examples ''pardes'' clearly means \"orchard\" or \"park\", but in the [[apocalyptic literature]] and in the [[Talmud]] \"paradise\" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the [[New Testament]] \"paradise\" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary [[Hellenistic]] influences.\n\n==Other views==\n===Jewish eschatology===\nIn the [[Talmud]] and the Jewish [[Kabbalah]],<ref name=\"Gan Eden\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=39&letter=E Gan Eden] \u2013 JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.</ref> the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called \"Garden in Eden\". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the \"lower Gan Eden\". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the \"higher Gan Eden\". The [[rabbi]]s differentiate between ''Gan'' and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the ''Gan'', whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.<ref name=\"Gan Eden\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Jewish eschatology]],<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba \u2013 The Afterlife] - JewFAQ.org; 02-22-2010.</ref><ref name=\"Eshatology\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=460&letter=E#1239 Eshatology] \u2013 JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.</ref> the higher Gan Eden is called the \"Garden of Righteousness\". It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly ''[[chayot]]'' carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance. Its Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants are \"clothed with garments of light and eternal life, and eat of the tree of life\" (Enoch 58,3) near to God and His anointed ones.<ref name=\"Eshatology\"/> This Jewish rabbinical concept of a higher Gan Eden is opposed by the Hebrew terms ''[[gehinnom]]''<ref>\"Gehinnom is the Hebrew name; Gehenna is Yiddish.\" [http://www.jewfaq.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi?Keywords=Gehinnom Gehinnom \u2013 Judaism 101] websourced 02-10-2010.</ref> and ''[[sheol]]'', figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism, a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from [[heaven]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm#Gan |title=Gan Eden and Gehinnom |publisher=Jewfaq.org |accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref>\n\nIn modern Jewish eschatology it is believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.<ref>{{cite web|title=End of Days|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/a/48925077.html|work=End of Days|publisher=Aish|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Legends====\nIn the 1909 book ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', [[Louis Ginzberg]] compiled Jewish legends found in [[rabbinic literature]]. Among the legends are ones about the two Gardens of Eden. Beyond Paradise is the higher Gan Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants. The higher Gan Eden contains three hundred ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments. The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one's merit.  The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for \"Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples,\" the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned; and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.<ref name=Legends>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>\n\nIn chapter two, Legends of the Jews gives a brief description of the lower Gan Eden. The tree of knowledge is a hedge around the tree of life, and it is so vast that it would take one over five hundred years to clear a path through the tree of knowledge to reach the tree of life. From beneath the trees flow all the world's waters in the form of four rivers: Tigris, Nile, Euphrates, and Ganges. After the fall of man, the world was no longer irrigated by this water. While in the garden, though, Adam and Eve were served meat dishes by angels and the animals of the world understood human language, respected mankind as God's image, and feared Adam and Eve. When one dies, one's soul must pass through the lower Gan Eden in order to reach the higher Gan Eden. The way to the garden is the Cave of Machpelah that Adam guards.  The cave leads to the gate of the garden, guarded by a cherub with a flaming sword. If a soul is unworthy of entering, the sword annihilates it. Within the garden is a pillar of fire and smoke that extends to the higher Gan Eden, which the soul must climb in order to reach the higher Gan Eden.<ref name=Legends/>\n\n===Islamic view===\n[[File:Spanish-Arabic map of 1109.jpg|thumb|[[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]] world map from 1109 with Eden in the East (at top)]]\nThe term ''jann\u0101t \u02bfadni'' (\"Gardens of Eden\" or \"Gardens of Perpetual Residence\") is used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] for the destination of the righteous. There are several mentions of \"the Garden\" in the Qur'an (2:35, 7:19, 20:117), while the Garden of Eden, without the word ''\u02bfadn'',<ref>See [http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEadon+pos%3Apn list of occurrences].</ref> is commonly the fourth layer of the Islamic [[Jannah|heaven]] and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].<ref>Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} p. 133</ref> The Quran refers frequently over various [[Surah]] about the first abode of Adam and Hawwa (Eve), including surat [[Sad (surah)|Sad]], which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71\u201388), surat [[al-Baqara]], surat [[al-A'raf]], and surat [[al-Hijr (surah)|al-Hijr]] although sometimes without mentioning the location. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Hawwa and Adam after they were tempted by [[Shaitan]]. Despite the Biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, which [[God in Islam|God]] specifically claimed it was forbidden to Adam and Eve. Some [[tafsir|exegesis]] added an account, about [[Satan]], disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, resulting in disobeying God.<ref>Leaman, Oliver ''The Quran, an encyclopedia'', p. 11, 2006</ref> These stories are also featured in the [[hadith]] collections, including [[al-Tabari]].<ref>Wheeler, Brannon ''Mecca and Eden: ritual, relics, and territory in Islam'' p. 16, 2006</ref>\n\n===Latter Day Saints===\n{{see also|Adam and Eve (LDS Church)}}\nFollowers of the [[Latter Day Saints movement]] (also known as [[Mormons]]) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], located in present-day [[Daviess County, Missouri]].

The idyll of \"Naming Day in Eden\" was less often depicted. Much of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' occurs in the Garden of Eden. [[Michelangelo]] depicted a [[:File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 022.jpg|scene]] at the Garden of Eden in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. In ''[[Divine Comedy|the Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] places the Garden at the top of [[Purgatory|Mt. Purgatory]]. For many medieval writers, the image of the Garden of Eden also creates a location for human [[love]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], often associated with the classic and medieval [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the [[locus amoenus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Curtius|1953|p=200, n.31}}</ref> One of oldest depictions of Garden of Eden is made in [[Byzantine style]] in [[Ravenna]], while the city was still under Byzantine control.
