Earth has been overrun by giant insects, known simply as \"Them.\" Most of the human race has been wiped out, and the few thousand survivors are waiting in [[suspended animation]] until the world is habitable again. The world is patrolled by dog soldiers called \"auxes,\" such as Gene, who fight Them on humanity's behalf.\n\n==Plot==\n===First series===\nAt the beginning of the series, Gene the Hackman is the leader of his pack, patrolling Antarctica (which they call \"Anarchticy\", the name having been corrupted over the centuries). They follow the orders of voices in their heads known as the urgings, which are transmitted to them by their \"Masters\" (who are never seen in the series). On the coast, Gene and his pack encounter a mysterious \"land bridge\" which leads into the sea and beyond the horizon. They conclude that \"Them\" from another continent created the bridge to invade Antarctica. The urgings stop, something which has never happened before, and so the pack debate whether to return home to report their discovery or continue their patrol (which has already lasted for an unprecedented length of time). Some of the pack desert Gene, and those who remain with him are all killed in action. Gene alone survives, with crippling injuries, and finds refuge in a mysterious building.\n\nThe building turns out to be an ancient outpost, built nearly two thousand years ago by humans. It is run automatically by an advanced computer, and contains a human operative in suspended animation, who is awoken by the computer on Gene's arrival. Gene has never seen a human before \u2013 it is revealed that what he thinks are the Masters are not actually humans but merely robots which run everything while the humans sleep \u2013 so he is initially sceptical that this human, who he regards as weak and sickly, could be a Master. But when Gene's injuries are rapidly healed with advanced medical technology he hasn't seen before, he accepts the possibility that there might be more to the human than meets the eye.\n\nThe outpost is attacked by overwhelming numbers of Them, and despite the advanced weaponry available there, Gene is only saved by the timely arrival of another pack. The human does not survive, and the new pack does not believe Gene's story. The story ends as Gene heads alone out of Antarctica over the land bridge.\n\n===Second series: \"The Promised Land\"===\nGene has arrived in [[Tasmania]], and finds it to be overrun with new species of Them he hasn't seen before. They are larger than the ones he was used to fighting at home. But many of them have been incapacitated by parasites, \"ticks\", gruesome bulbous creatures covered with teeth which attach themselves to the giant insects' bodies. Gene himself is attacked by dozens of these ticks in a swamp, and only just manages to fight them off.\n\nShortly after recovering from this attack, Gene begins to hear the urgings again, for the first time since discovering the land bridge. The urgings lead Gene to discover a small farm run by a community of humans. The farm is surrounded by a fence to keep Them out, but Gene manages to get inside. Once in the farm, Gene befriends a young girl, called Leezee Sower, who introduces him to her father. The adults accept Gene, recognising that his combat abilities will be useful in defending the farm against Them, who have recently been attacking with greater frequency and ferocity than before.\n\nGene enjoys living on the farm, but becomes suspicious about the fact that he is being fed meat, given that there are no animals on the farm. He is told that the meat is being grown artificially in a large warehouse, but it is out of bounds and he is strictly forbidden to enter it. Defying the rules of the farmers and the admonitions of the urgings, Gene investigates anyway. He is horrified to discover that the warehouse is infested with ticks. The farmers arrive and arrest him for uncovering their secret, and Gene learns that each of the farmers is infected with a tick, even Leezee Sower. Gene insists that the ticks must be destroyed, as their presence on the farm is evidently the reason why Them are attacking it. But the humans refuse. They regard the ticks as normal, even desirable, and they are unconcerned about being infected. Leezee points out to Gene that he is also infected, and Gene realises that he has had a tick attached to him since the attack in the swamp. The voices he has heard in his head since then are not really the urgings of the Masters, but the telepathic thoughts of the tick as it tries to control him. Gene kills his tick, but the experience is so agonisingly painful that he almost does not survive.\n\nThat night, Them attack and overwhelm the farm, killing everyone. Gene manages to rescue Leezee and they escape into the wilderness, the only survivors. Leezee begs Gene to let her return to the farm, but Gene recognises that this isn't really her own desire but her tick's, as it controls her. He leads her farther away from the farm.\n\nGene tries to kill Leezee's tick, but the tick tells him that Leezee would not survive the separation. Gene reluctantly abandons the attempt for the time being, intending to search for someone intelligent enough to figure out how to detach or kill the tick without also killing its host.\n\n===Third series: \"Call of the Wild\"===\nGene and Leezee reach [[Sydney]], which is in ruins. They discover a new pack of auxes, but these ones are not pure-breeds like Gene. They have been breeding wild for centuries, and so the gene pool has diversified. Most of the pack welcome Gene, and one female pack member in particular, called Clara Bow, is especially fond of him. But there is one male, called Dingo Star, who resents Gene as he sees him as a rival to his own status within the pack.\n\nThe pack turns out to be just one of many packs, which all belong to a kingdom run by an aux of greater than normal intelligence, called Rex Horizon. Rex has a pet human, who he keeps in a cage, and it transpires that the auxes all think that Leezee is Gene's pet, since they had no prior knowledge of humans. Rex's pet, Paul Numan, tells Gene that three years ago he was in suspended animation on a space station in orbit around the earth. He was awoken and sent down to Sydney to investigate some unexplained electrical activity, which turned out to be the result of Rex having discovered how to make the old machines work again. He offers to take Leezee to safety up on the station, if Gene will rescue him. But Gene is now loyal to the Wild Kingdom he has just joined, instead of to his old Masters, and he refuses to help.\n\nThe Wild Kingdom suddenly finds that it is being attacked by Them more frequently than ever before, and by Them of increasing size. Numan realises it is because they can detect the scent of Leezee's tick parasite, which is deadly to Them, and they want to destroy it. Rex orders Dingo to abduct Leezee and chain her up outside where Them will find her, so that Them will leave the Kingdom alone. Rex tells Gene that his pet ran away, but Gene knows this is a lie, since he alone understands that Leezee is not his pet. Gene releases Numan from his cage, and enlists him to help find Leezee and take her to the orbiting station. Dingo interrupts the rescue, and a brutal fight ensues, in which Gene kills Dingo. Gene's pack hunts him down as a wanted murderer.\n\nGene and Numan find Leezee and save her from Them in the nick of time. Numan summons a ship to collect him and Leezee and take them to the orbiting station. But they are forced to leave Gene behind when he is captured by his pack. Gene only survives because of the intervention of Clara Bow, and the pack allow him to escape, realising that by removing the tick from the Wild Kingdom he may have saved them all from destruction. Gene sets out across Australia on his own.\n\n===Fourth series: \"His Master's Voice\"===\nClara Bow catches up with Gene and tells him that she would rather stay with him than live in the Wild Kingdom. Together they discover a base run by robots, where an elderly and insane human general has awoken from suspended animation. A series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] throughout the story show the general as a young captain in New Mexico, six years before the last human survivors entered suspended animation. He was the leader of the project which created the first dog soldiers, the ancestors of Gene Hackman.\n\nThe general detains them, intending to harvest Gene's body for DNA with which to make a new army of thousands of auxes like him (a process which will be fatal to Gene). Clara Bow is held as a  hostage, along with some other aux captives whose DNA is not pure enough for the general's purposes. Gene resists at first, but surrenders when the general threatens to kill the hostages if he does not submit. Luring the mad general into a false sense of security, Gene kills him, and the robots deactivate. Gene, Clara Bow and the other hostages leave the base together.\n\n===Fifth series: \"Aux Drift\"===\nGene and his new pack discover Aux Drift, a mining outpost where humans and auxes work together. These humans are not \"Masters,\" and they explain that that term only refers to the elite humans who could afford to enter suspended animation when the world was overrun by Them. The humans who could not afford to hide in suspended animation were simply abandoned to fend for themselves.\n\nAux Drift is attacked by a swarm of Them which display more intelligence than usual. Gene discovers that they are being controlled by a giant Them, one bigger than any that has ever been seen before. The miners teach him how to use explosives, and he kills the giant insect by blowing it up. Aux Drift is abandoned, and the miners take Gene's pack back home to their city, which they call the Kingdom.\n\n===Sixth series: \"Beast of Eden\"===\nBy the start of this story, Gene and Clara Bow have produced two sons, and Gene is recognised as the toughest soldier in the Kingdom. The Kingdom is attacked by a larger army of Them than anyone has seen before. This super-swarm is controlled by another king Them, like the one at Aux Drift, and so Gene leads a mission to kill it. He leaves Clara behind to protect their sons.\n\nDuring Gene's mission, his pack encounters Numan, who has returned to Earth to investigate whether the Masters' new plan to defeat Them is working. After the king has been killed, Numan reveals that the Masters took the tick parasite from Leezee Sower and used it to create a biological weapon to infect and destroy Them. Numan discovers that Them perceive the ticks as a greater threat than the humans or the auxes, but realises that Them are evolving rapidly to counter the ticks, which is the reason that intelligent Them kings now exist. Gene is furious and he attacks Numan, but Numan's bodyguard, an aux called Major Canis, stops him. Numan takes Gene (and the only two surviving members of his pack) back to the Masters' space station in orbit.\n\n===Seventh series: \"As it is in Heaven\"===\nIt is six months after Gene arrived on the station. The Kingdom has been destroyed by Them. Gene and his friends have been put into suspended animation to keep him out of the way, because the Masters consider them a liability. The Masters decide that this is no longer a good use of their resources, so they decide to euthanise Gene and his pack in their sleep.\n\nLeezee Sower, now an adult, decides to save Gene instead. She wakes him and they flee, killing two aux in the process. In a bid to force Gene to surrender, Major Canis wakes Gene's two friends from suspended animation and takes them hostage, threatening to kill them if Gene does not submit. Gene attempts a rescue, but he fails and both his friends are killed. Gene turns against the Masters and vows never to obey or help them again, apart from Sower.\n\nGene and Sower escape into an abandoned part of the space station, where they encounter Pause, a renegade aux who has turned against the Masters. Pause is able to hack into the station's computer systems without the Masters knowing. He recruits Gene and Sower to help him steal the codes which control the Masters' new weapon, the ticks. The Masters' plan is to use the ticks to destroy Them, and then activate a faulty gene they have bred into the ticks which will kill them all, leaving Earth fit for human habitation again. \n\nGene steals the codes, but while hiding from Major Canis he discovers the laboratory where the ticks are being bred. There he discovers the real Leezee Sower, who has become a hideously deformed hybrid, part human, part giant tick. The original Sower explains that the other Leezee Sower who Gene has been with on the station is a clone. The scientists had been unable to remove the tick from Sower, so instead they had kept her in the lab, and created the clone through which she could live a normal life, since the original can see what the clone sees and can control her.\n\nMajor Canis and Numan discover Gene in the lab, and demand that he hand over the codes. The giant tick, controlling Sower's voice, demands the codes so that its species won't be destroyed. Not willing to help either side, Gene instead attacks everybody. He kills the original Leezee Sower and wounds Numan and Canis. He escapes from the station with the Sower clone, Pause and the codes, to return to the Kingdom and his family \u2013 not knowing that the Kingdom has been destroyed.\n\n===Eighth series: \"Alpha and Omega\"===\nGene's shuttle crash lands in [[Patagonia]], pursued by a squad of auxes led by Canis and Numan. They encounter an unprecedented phenomenon: auxes and humans riding Them as steeds. This new force captures Gene, but Pause and Leezee Sower escape.\n\nGene learns that the Them-riders are infected with ticks; not the weaponised ones genetically engineered by the masters but natural ticks which evolved at an accelerated rate. The influence of these ticks enables the humans and auxes to work together as equals, and they refer to themselves as \"Us.\" Us invite Gene to join them, but he does not trust the ticks, and so he refuses.\n\nCanis's squad attacks Us, but is repulsed and Numan is captured. Numan is forcibly infected with a tick, making him one of Us. He tells Us about the codes Gene stole from the masters, and they search Gene but fail to find the codes. They threaten Gene, but are suddenly attacked again by Canis.\n\nMeanwhile, Pause has requested a nuclear strike by imitating Canis's voice in a radio message to the orbiting satellite. During the chaos caused by the blast, Gene escapes from Us, and Canis is killed by Pause and Leezee. Gene discloses that he gave the codes to Leezee, who has had them ever since they landed.\n\nThe masters in the space station believe Gene and the codes to have been destroyed in the nuclear explosion, and so they begin working to recreate the codes from scratch, a process that will take years.\n\nMeanwhile Us, now led by Numan, are ambushed by a new humanoid form of Them, which have also evolved at a highly accelerated rate in an arms race with the ticks. This new form of Them tells Numan, in English, that his species is finished, and then kills him.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* Gene Hackman\n* \"Them,\" as Gene and the others label them, are a highly [[evolution|evolved]] type of [[insect]] that was possibly created sometime in the early 21st century, either purposefully or unintentionally. Quickly overpowering [[human race|humanity]], they established themselves as the [[wikt:Special:Search/domination|dominant]] life form on [[Earth]]. As a result, the few remaining humans left retreated to the [[Antarctic]] and built [[machine]]s to protect themselves.\n* Leezee Sower (from the second series), a human girl who Gene takes under his protection. (In the seventh series she is an adult.)\n* Clara Bow (from the third series), a female aux who becomes Gene's mate.\n* Paul Numan (from the third series), a human scientist from a space station in orbit.\n* Major Canis, an aux soldier from the orbiting station.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{anchor|Collected editions}}\nAll of the stories are written by [[Dan Abnett]] and illustrated by [[Richard Elson]].\n* \"Kingdom\" (in ''2000 AD'', Prog 2007 and #1518\u20131525, 2006\u20132007)\n* \"The Promised Land\" (in ''2000 AD'', Prog 2008 and #1567\u20131576, 2007\u20132008\n* \"Call of the Wild\" (in ''2000 AD'' #1650\u20131661, 2009)\n* \"His Master's Voice\" (in ''2000 AD'' Prog 2011 and #1715\u20131725, 2011)\n* \"Aux Drift\" (in ''2000 AD'' #1900\u20131909, 2015)\n* \"Beast of Eden\"  (in ''2000 AD'' #1961\u20131972, 2016)\n* \"As it is in Heaven\" (in ''2000 AD'' #2011\u20132022, 2017)\n* \"Alpha and Omega\" (in ''2000 AD'' #2100\u20132110, 2018)\n\n===Novel===\n* ''Fiefdom'' by Dan Abnett and Nik Vincent, 2014\n\n===Trade paperbacks===\n* ''Kingdom: The Promised Land'' [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], 144 pages, [[Rebellion Developments]], December 2008, {{ISBN|1-905437-89-7}}, [[Simon & Schuster]], June 2011, {{ISBN|1-907519-87-4}} (collects the first two series)\n* ''Kingdom: Call of the Wild'', 144 pages, [[Rebellion Developments]], March 2012, {{ISBN|1-907992-98-7}} (collects \"Call of the Wild\" and \"His Master's Voice\")\n* ''Kingdom: Aux Drift'', 144 pages, 2000 AD, March 2017, {{ISBN|978-1781085288}} (collects \"Aux Drift\" and \"Beast of Eden\")\n* ''Kingdom: Alpha and Omega'', 144 pages, 2000 AD, February 2020, {{ISBN|1781087539}} (collects \"As it is in Heaven\" and \"Alpha and Omega\")\n\nThe first six series were collected in ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]'' in 2017 and 2018.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=KINGDOM ''Kingdom''] at 2000 AD online\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=25437|title=Gene Hackman}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081221094319/http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=1618 Gene The Hackman is Tougher than Tough], Broken Frontier, December 19, 2008\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingdom}}\n[[Category:Comics by Dan Abnett]]\n[[Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{for2|the Japanese comics series|[[Kingdom (manga)]]|the DC Comics storyline|[[The Kingdom (comics)]]}}\n{{Infobox comics meta series <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \n|title               = Kingdom\n|image               = <!-- filename format only -->\n|imagesize           = <!-- default 250 -->\n|caption             = \n|schedule            = Weekly\n|format              = \n|limited             = \n|anthology           =\n|graphicnovel        = \n|1shot               = \n|individual          = \n|titles              = ''2000 AD''\n|notable             = y\n|SciFi               = y\n|publisher           = [[Rebellion Developments]]\n|date                = \n|startyr              = 2006\n|endyr               = present\n|issues              = \n|main_char_team      = Gene Hackman\n|writers             = [[Dan Abnett]]\n|artists             = [[Richard Elson]]\n|pencillers          = \n|inkers              = \n|letterers           = [[Ellie De Ville]]<br />[[Simon Bowland]]\n|colorists           = Richard Elson<br />[[Abigail Ryder]]\n|editors             = [[Tharg]] ([[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]])\n|creative_team_month = \n|creative_team_year  = \n|creators            = [[Dan Abnett]]<br />[[Richard Elson]]\n|nonUS               = y\n|reprint             = \n|TPB                 = The Promised Land\n|ISBN                = 1-905437-89-7\n|TPB2               = Call of the Wild\n|ISBN2             = 1-907992-98-7\n|altcat              = 2000 AD comic strips\n|sort                = Kingdom\n}}\n'''''Kingdom''''' is a comic series created by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Richard Elson]] and published in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', starting in 2006.\n\nThe story revolves around a humanoid [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] [[dog]] named after [[Gene Hackman]], in the distant future.

He offers to take Leezee to safety up on the station, if Gene will rescue him. But Gene is now loyal to the Wild Kingdom he has just joined, instead of to his old Masters, and he refuses to help.\n\nThe Wild Kingdom suddenly finds that it is being attacked by Them more frequently than ever before, and by Them of increasing size. Numan realises it is because they can detect the scent of Leezee's tick parasite, which is deadly to Them, and they want to destroy it. Rex orders Dingo to abduct Leezee and chain her up outside where Them will find her, so that Them will leave the Kingdom alone. Rex tells Gene that his pet ran away, but Gene knows this is a lie, since he alone understands that Leezee is not his pet. Gene releases Numan from his cage, and enlists him to help find Leezee and take her to the orbiting station. Dingo interrupts the rescue, and a brutal fight ensues, in which Gene kills Dingo. Gene's pack hunts him down as a wanted murderer.\n\nGene and Numan find Leezee and save her from Them in the nick of time. Numan summons a ship to collect him and Leezee and take them to the orbiting station. But they are forced to leave Gene behind when he is captured by his pack. Gene only survives because of the intervention of Clara Bow, and the pack allow him to escape, realising that by removing the tick from the Wild Kingdom he may have saved them all from destruction. Gene sets out across Australia on his own.\n\n===Fourth series: \"His Master's Voice\"===\nClara Bow catches up with Gene and tells him that she would rather stay with him than live in the Wild Kingdom. Together they discover a base run by robots, where an elderly and insane human general has awoken from suspended animation. A series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] throughout the story show the general as a young captain in New Mexico, six years before the last human survivors entered suspended animation. He was the leader of the project which created the first dog soldiers, the ancestors of Gene Hackman.\n\nThe general detains them, intending to harvest Gene's body for DNA with which to make a new army of thousands of auxes like him (a process which will be fatal to Gene). Clara Bow is held as a  hostage, along with some other aux captives whose DNA is not pure enough for the general's purposes. Gene resists at first, but surrenders when the general threatens to kill the hostages if he does not submit. Luring the mad general into a false sense of security, Gene kills him, and the robots deactivate. Gene, Clara Bow and the other hostages leave the base together.\n\n===Fifth series: \"Aux Drift\"===\nGene and his new pack discover Aux Drift, a mining outpost where humans and auxes work together. These humans are not \"Masters,\" and they explain that that term only refers to the elite humans who could afford to enter suspended animation when the world was overrun by Them. The humans who could not afford to hide in suspended animation were simply abandoned to fend for themselves.\n\nAux Drift is attacked by a swarm of Them which display more intelligence than usual. Gene discovers that they are being controlled by a giant Them, one bigger than any that has ever been seen before. The miners teach him how to use explosives, and he kills the giant insect by blowing it up. Aux Drift is abandoned, and the miners take Gene's pack back home to their city, which they call the Kingdom.\n\n===Sixth series: \"Beast of Eden\"===\nBy the start of this story, Gene and Clara Bow have produced two sons, and Gene is recognised as the toughest soldier in the Kingdom. The Kingdom is attacked by a larger army of Them than anyone has seen before. This super-swarm is controlled by another king Them, like the one at Aux Drift, and so Gene leads a mission to kill it. He leaves Clara behind to protect their sons.\n\nDuring Gene's mission, his pack encounters Numan, who has returned to Earth to investigate whether the Masters' new plan to defeat Them is working. After the king has been killed, Numan reveals that the Masters took the tick parasite from Leezee Sower and used it to create a biological weapon to infect and destroy Them. Numan discovers that Them perceive the ticks as a greater threat than the humans or the auxes, but realises that Them are evolving rapidly to counter the ticks, which is the reason that intelligent Them kings now exist. Gene is furious and he attacks Numan, but Numan's bodyguard, an aux called Major Canis, stops him. Numan takes Gene (and the only two surviving members of his pack) back to the Masters' space station in orbit.\n\n===Seventh series: \"As it is in Heaven\"===\nIt is six months after Gene arrived on the station. The Kingdom has been destroyed by Them. Gene and his friends have been put into suspended animation to keep him out of the way, because the Masters consider them a liability. The Masters decide that this is no longer a good use of their resources, so they decide to euthanise Gene and his pack in their sleep.\n\nLeezee Sower, now an adult, decides to save Gene instead. She wakes him and they flee, killing two aux in the process. In a bid to force Gene to surrender, Major Canis wakes Gene's two friends from suspended animation and takes them hostage, threatening to kill them if Gene does not submit. Gene attempts a rescue, but he fails and both his friends are killed. Gene turns against the Masters and vows never to obey or help them again, apart from Sower.\n\nGene and Sower escape into an abandoned part of the space station, where they encounter Pause, a renegade aux who has turned against the Masters. Pause is able to hack into the station's computer systems without the Masters knowing. He recruits Gene and Sower to help him steal the codes which control the Masters' new weapon, the ticks. The Masters' plan is to use the ticks to destroy Them, and then activate a faulty gene they have bred into the ticks which will kill them all, leaving Earth fit for human habitation again. \n\nGene steals the codes, but while hiding from Major Canis he discovers the laboratory where the ticks are being bred. There he discovers the real Leezee Sower, who has become a hideously deformed hybrid, part human, part giant tick. The original Sower explains that the other Leezee Sower who Gene has been with on the station is a clone. The scientists had been unable to remove the tick from Sower, so instead they had kept her in the lab, and created the clone through which she could live a normal life, since the original can see what the clone sees and can control her.\n\nMajor Canis and Numan discover Gene in the lab, and demand that he hand over the codes. The giant tick, controlling Sower's voice, demands the codes so that its species won't be destroyed. Not willing to help either side, Gene instead attacks everybody. He kills the original Leezee Sower and wounds Numan and Canis. He escapes from the station with the Sower clone, Pause and the codes, to return to the Kingdom and his family \u2013 not knowing that the Kingdom has been destroyed.\n\n===Eighth series: \"Alpha and Omega\"===\nGene's shuttle crash lands in [[Patagonia]], pursued by a squad of auxes led by Canis and Numan. They encounter an unprecedented phenomenon: auxes and humans riding Them as steeds. This new force captures Gene, but Pause and Leezee Sower escape.\n\nGene learns that the Them-riders are infected with ticks; not the weaponised ones genetically engineered by the masters but natural ticks which evolved at an accelerated rate. The influence of these ticks enables the humans and auxes to work together as equals, and they refer to themselves as \"Us.\" Us invite Gene to join them, but he does not trust the ticks, and so he refuses.\n\nCanis's squad attacks Us, but is repulsed and Numan is captured. Numan is forcibly infected with a tick, making him one of Us. He tells Us about the codes Gene stole from the masters, and they search Gene but fail to find the codes. They threaten Gene, but are suddenly attacked again by Canis.\n\nMeanwhile, Pause has requested a nuclear strike by imitating Canis's voice in a radio message to the orbiting satellite. During the chaos caused by the blast, Gene escapes from Us, and Canis is killed by Pause and Leezee. Gene discloses that he gave the codes to Leezee, who has had them ever since they landed.\n\nThe masters in the space station believe Gene and the codes to have been destroyed in the nuclear explosion, and so they begin working to recreate the codes from scratch, a process that will take years.\n\nMeanwhile Us, now led by Numan, are ambushed by a new humanoid form of Them, which have also evolved at a highly accelerated rate in an arms race with the ticks. This new form of Them tells Numan, in English, that his species is finished, and then kills him.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* Gene Hackman\n* \"Them,\" as Gene and the others label them, are a highly [[evolution|evolved]] type of [[insect]] that was possibly created sometime in the early 21st century, either purposefully or unintentionally. Quickly overpowering [[human race|humanity]], they established themselves as the [[wikt:Special:Search/domination|dominant]] life form on [[Earth]]. As a result, the few remaining humans left retreated to the [[Antarctic]] and built [[machine]]s to protect themselves.\n* Leezee Sower (from the second series), a human girl who Gene takes under his protection. (In the seventh series she is an adult.)\n* Clara Bow (from the third series), a female aux who becomes Gene's mate.\n* Paul Numan (from the third series), a human scientist from a space station in orbit.\n* Major Canis, an aux soldier from the orbiting station.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{anchor|Collected editions}}\nAll of the stories are written by [[Dan Abnett]] and illustrated by [[Richard Elson]].\n* \"Kingdom\" (in ''2000 AD'', Prog 2007 and #1518\u20131525, 2006\u20132007)\n* \"The Promised Land\" (in ''2000 AD'', Prog 2008 and #1567\u20131576, 2007\u20132008\n* \"Call of the Wild\" (in ''2000 AD'' #1650\u20131661, 2009)\n* \"His Master's Voice\" (in ''2000 AD'' Prog 2011 and #1715\u20131725, 2011)\n* \"Aux Drift\" (in ''2000 AD'' #1900\u20131909, 2015)\n* \"Beast of Eden\"  (in ''2000 AD'' #1961\u20131972, 2016)\n* \"As it is in Heaven\" (in ''2000 AD'' #2011\u20132022, 2017)\n* \"Alpha and Omega\" (in ''2000 AD'' #2100\u20132110, 2018)\n\n===Novel===\n* ''Fiefdom'' by Dan Abnett and Nik Vincent, 2014\n\n===Trade paperbacks===\n* ''Kingdom: The Promised Land'' [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], 144 pages, [[Rebellion Developments]], December 2008, {{ISBN|1-905437-89-7}}, [[Simon & Schuster]], June 2011, {{ISBN|1-907519-87-4}} (collects the first two series)\n* ''Kingdom: Call of the Wild'', 144 pages, [[Rebellion Developments]], March 2012, {{ISBN|1-907992-98-7}} (collects \"Call of the Wild\" and \"His Master's Voice\")\n* ''Kingdom: Aux Drift'', 144 pages, 2000 AD, March 2017, {{ISBN|978-1781085288}} (collects \"Aux Drift\" and \"Beast of Eden\")\n* ''Kingdom: Alpha and Omega'', 144 pages, 2000 AD, February 2020, {{ISBN|1781087539}} (collects \"As it is in Heaven\" and \"Alpha and Omega\")\n\nThe first six series were collected in ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]'' in 2017 and 2018.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=KINGDOM ''Kingdom''] at 2000 AD online\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=25437|title=Gene Hackman}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081221094319/http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=1618 Gene The Hackman is Tougher than Tough], Broken Frontier, December 19, 2008\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingdom}}\n[[Category:Comics by Dan Abnett]]\n[[Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(comics)"}

She first appeared as a guest character on 24 November 2009, and was reintroduced in 2010 as a regular character after piquing the interest of new executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]. Empson took maternity leave in October 2013 and after appearing several times during her break via webcam, Kim returned to Albert Square on 30 December 2014.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a553048/eastenders-star-tameka-empson-expecting-baby.html EastEnders star Tameka Empson expecting baby<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03wnvpl BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 24/02/2014<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bnc88 BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 22/07/2014<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0419k8n BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 17/04/2014<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04fc277 BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 18/08/2014<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was announced on 16 July 2019 that Empson would be taking a break from the show but will return at some point in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a28406819/eastenders-tameka-empson-kim-fox-exit-break/|title=EastEnders star Tameka Empson is taking a break from her role as Kim Fox|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=16 July 2019|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref> She departed on 23 July 2019. Kim made a special appearance via webcam on 25 December 2019.\n\nKim is described as \"viscous and bubbly\" on the outside, but hiding vulnerability and low self-esteem. The ''EastEnders'' website describes Kim as having [[big hair]], a loud personality, hyperactive and a big heart. She is sharp, family-orientated and cares about her appearance, having a loud dress sense and being the life and soul of any party. She chooses the wrong men to have relationships with, but knows what she wants when it comes to love. Kim makes her first appearance for Denise's wedding to [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). She briefly returns after Denise is presumed dead, but makes a more permanent return when she separates from her boyfriend [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]). Kim kisses [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), sparking a brief feud with his wife, [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). She establishes a short-lived [[speakeasy]] and later opens a [[bed and breakfast]]. Kim also goes through a [[HIV]] scare and has a relationship with [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]). Kim gave birth to a baby girl, [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Pearl Fox|Pearl]], prematurely during [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]], which celebrated ''EastEnders''' 30th anniversary. In later storylines, Kim has suffered a [[miscarriage]] and had to cope with becoming a single mother to her and [[Vincent Hubbard]]'s ([[Richard Blackwood]]) children, Pearl and [[Mica Fox-Hubbard|Mica]], following Vincent's mysterious disappearance in April 2018.\n\nKim is often shown in a comedic light and as a result, Empson earned a nomination for \"Best Comedy Performance\" at the 2011 [[British Soap Awards]]. That same year she won the \"Funniest Performance\" award at the ''[[Inside Soap Awards]]'' and again the following year. Ruth Deller from entertainment website [[Lowculture]] praised the character during her guest appearance in 2009 and later said Kim is a \"big, ballsy, whirlwind\", who provides some light relief to the show. Daniel Maier from ''[[The Guardian]]'' has criticised Kim's B&B venture, calling it a \"holding pen for characters who are 'between homes' within Albert Square's hermetically sealed biosphere.\"\n\n==Storylines==\nKim visits [[Walford]] to attend the wedding of her sister, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). She is disappointed by her plans for a low-key [[hen night]], so organises a livelier event. During her visit, Kim's partner, [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]), makes a pass at her niece, [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]), but she chooses to forgive him. She makes a repeat visit seven months later and reveals that she has broken up with Dexter, as he was unfaithful to her. The following month, Kim is told that Denise has committed suicide. She returns to Walford for the funeral, as does her sister, [[Daphne Fox|Daphne]] (Emi Wokoma). It later transpires that Denise is still alive, as her death was staged by her husband, [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). Kim comes to stay with her, having once more separated from Dexter. She begins working at the local beauty salon and establishes a short-lived [[speakeasy]]. Kim causes trouble by kissing her married neighbour, [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). His wife, [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), finds out and is initially furious, but she and Kim forge a bond and become friends. Despite earlier conflict over her speakeasy, Kim also becomes friends with [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), landlady of the local pub. When Dexter buys Kim out of their restaurant business, she purchases the house next door to Denise's and opens a [[bed and breakfast]], called \"Kimberley's Palace\". It becomes her sole source of income when she is fired from the beauty salon for her lax attitude to work. Walford's new GP, [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), makes a long term booking at the B&B. Kim is initially attracted to him, but refrains from pursuing him as Denise is also interested in him. She accidentally tells [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) that Denise and Yusef haven't had sex yet which Masood uses to his advantage by telling Denise. Denise is at first annoyed with Kim for telling people about her private life, but they later reconcile. The next day, Kim helps out at [[Tommy Moon]]'s christening.\n\nKim wakes up in a skip and after initially lets Patrick and Denise believe she may have been attacked. However, Patrick find CCTV footage of a drunken Kim entering the local shop, the Minute Mart, late at night and taking alcohol. Kim explains to Denise that her erratic behaviour is due to a former boyfriend telling her that he has contracted HIV. Denise persuades Kim to take a HIV test which comes back negative, leaving Kim relieved. After Yusef sets the B&B on fire, Kim, Patrick and Denise are left homeless, so they move in with brothers [[Anthony Moon|Anthony]] ([[Matt Lapinskas]]) and [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline) and borrow clothes from friends. Kim starts spending money, thinking that insurance will cover the damage, but Patrick tells her that he was holding illegal alcohol and fireworks in the B&B, which made the fire worse, and the insurance may not pay out. Kim is angry and says she no longer wants to live with Patrick, but Denise later convinces Kim that her material possessions are not what matters and they should be a family.  After the insurance company refuse to pay for the damage, Patrick decides to retire and offers Kim and Denise the Minute Mart. Kim arranges a blind date, and on her way to it, is saved by [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]) from a falling ladder. She is attracted to him, and later when he sees she has been stood up, he offers to get her another drink. However, she is disappointed to learn that he has two children, saying she is fed up of men with \"baggage\". She then tries to chat up [[Gethin Williams]] ([[Bradley Freegard]]), but he harshly rejects her.\n\nShe turns her attention back to Ray after seeing him running and tells him she has started an fitness venture called \"Kimba\". She enlists some people to come to the class but Ray does not come. Ray asks Kim out but she says she has a date, and then meets [[List of EastEnders characters (2012)#Sinclair|Sinclair]] (Colin Michael Carmichael) from the Internet. Sinclair makes inappropriate comments about Kim's race. Ray calls Kim easy so she slaps him, and she then slaps Sinclair for his comments. When [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]) inherits all of Yusef's money, she gives it to Kim and Denise but is unhappy when they start spending it frivolously. Kim and Ray eventually reconcile and they share a kiss, although Kim continues to play hard to get, pretending she does not like him. Kim dislikes it when she sees Ray and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) playfight in the kitchen. She also becomes jealous when she overhears him flirting with Bianca whilst helping in the kitchen. As a result, she accidentally slices off the top of Ray's finger when he tries to help her fillet some fish. She accompanies him to the hospital where they open up to one another and decide to start a relationship. Ray is upset when his son, [[Morgan Butcher|Morgan]] (Devon Higgs) moves away. To cheer him up, Kim organises an intimate evening for them, however Ray arrives with his daughter, [[Sasha Dixon|Sasha]] (Rebecca Sanneh). Kim is shocked and tells Ray that, although she is interested in him, she does not think she can take on his children. Denise convinces Kim that she needs to accept Sasha and arranges for Kim to look after her. It goes well and she promises to do it again.\n\nMeanwhile, a man from the local council tells Kim that the new name for the B&B, Kim's Olympic Palace, infringes copyright. The next day, Kim is disappointed as the B&B's sign is taken down. Kim and Sasha start to bond and Kim and Ray declare their love for one another. When the B&B opens, Denise is annoyed by Kim's apathetic approach to running the place and quits. Kim struggles to run the B&B by herself and they later reconcile. When playing basketball with Sasha and Morgan, Kim smashes a window in the charity shop. Sasha takes the blame and works there, but she is unhappy, so Kim says she will organise some work experience for Sasha with a forensic scientist. Kim later admits this was a lie, leading to Ray moving out. Kim then gets Sasha a placement with [[Les Coker]]'s ([[Roger Sloman]]) firm of funeral directors, and Ray and Kim make up. Kim discovers that Ray has been looking for flats locally and she assumes that Ray is looking for somewhere for them both to live. However, she is left upset and humiliated when Ray reveals that the flat is actually for Sasha's mother, Deanne, so that they can both be closer to Sasha. Ray affirms his love for her and they reconcile. A few months later, Ray kisses Denise, and when Kim finds out, Ray says Denise initiated it. Kim slaps Denise and disowns her, however they soon reconcile. Ray ends his relationship with Kim, who is devastated and blames Denise, saying she does not want to see her again. Kim and Denise reconcile again when Ray admits he kissed Denise. A few months later Kim and Ray resume their relationship. Ray learns that Deanne has been in an accident and so decides to move to Essex to be closer to Sasha. Kim agrees to move with him, but at her birthday party she realises they do not have much in common and decides to stay, saying a tearful goodbye to him. Kim departs to work on a cruise ship, and during her time away, she marries [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]).\n\nKim returns to Walford after splitting from Vincent and reveals to Denise that she is pregnant. Kim struggles with caring for Patrick, who has suffered a [[stroke]]. Kim goes into labour early and gives birth to a girl, [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]]. She briefly falls out with Denise when she insults Kim's failed marriage, and leaves a voicemail and a text message for Vincent, informing him that he is a father. She regrets this afterwards and confides in Kat, [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]), [[Shirley Carter]] (Linda Henry) and Patrick that after the cruise, she visited Vincent to tell him she was pregnant but discovered he was a criminal when she saw him covered in blood and fled. Pearl develops an infection and is ill in hospital for several months, and when she brings her daughter home, Kim finds Vincent waiting for her. He explains that he was helping the victim of a mugging when she saw him, and although she is still suspicious, she reunites with him. She provides him with a false alibi for the assault on a drug dealer and key witness at [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) trial, and later discovers from his foster sister [[Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) that he did this for [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), a former girlfriend of his. She confronts Ronnie thinking she is having an affair with Vincent, but they explain they are no longer together, although Kim tells Ronnie to stay away from Vincent. Vincent cons [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) into giving him his wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]]'s ([[Letitia Dean]]) bar, the Albert. Sharon reinvests in the bar and Kim competes with Sharon to manage it. Vincent surprises Kim with news that he has bought them a house, but Denise tells Kim that he is just sweetening her up and Patrick throws him out of the house. Vincent tries to win Kim back by saying the new house is for Pearl. Kim decides to move on from Vincent but soon changes her mind and they kiss. Kim and Vincent's mother, [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]), then realise that Vincent has invited them both to live with him without telling them. When Claudette accuses Kim of freeloading, Kim decides to sell her share of her house, where Denise and Patrick live, which leaves them with a smaller home.\n\nKim is shocked to discover Vincent has taken delivery of a large amount of drugs, but he tells her that it is so he can set up Phil by planting them in his house as revenge for his father, Eric, killing Vincent's father, Henry. Vincent tells Kim how this happened, and Claudette confirms it, but convinces Kim not to tell anyone. When Phil deliberately scares Kim, Kim and Sharon attempt to end the feud and with Ronnie's help, Phil and Vincent agree. However, Phil later kidnaps Pearl from the house, and Vincent refuses to call the police, instead revealing he has a gun and will end it his own way. However, it soon emerges that Claudette killed Henry, not Eric, and Kim is reunited with Pearl.\n\nKim and Claudette clash at Pearl's first birthday party, and when Claudette's foster son [[Linford Short]] ([[Leon Lopez]]) announces that she is a finalist in the Pride of Walford Awards, Kim tries to take the attention away by jumping on Pearl's bouncy castle, which Claudette then punctures; Denise tells Kim that Claudette did this deliberately. Kim is horrified when Donna decides she wants Vincent to be a sperm donor so she can have a baby, but Vincent convinces her it is the right thing to do, however, it does not work and Donna changes her mind. When Kim finds out that Denise is pregnant but wants the baby adopted, Kim decides she and Vincent should adopt the child, but Denise is against this. Vincent discovers that Kim has received a parking fine in his car for parking in a bus lane; she discovers that Donna has a disabled parking permit so Kim uses Claudette as a way into Donna's flat and steals the permit to go shopping. Vincent discovers this and tells Donna, who tells her it is wrong; Patrick reveals Kim has never passed her driving test so Vincent bans her from driving his car. Vincent then gives Kim driving lessons, but she is angry that people are taking bets on whether she will pass or fail her test. She also worries when Denise does not want to tell her daughters that she is pregnant; Kim tells Libby, prompting her return to Walford. She passes her driving test but breaks her arm, so she is annoyed that she is unable to drive. Kim and Vincent travel to [[Montserrat]] and Denise is upset to learn that Kim has told their mother, [[Emerald Fox]] ([[Do\u00f1a Croll]]), that Denise is pregnant. Denise gives birth to a boy, but Kim becomes angry when she discovers that Denise still plans to have her son adopted and tries to reason with her. Denise refuses to change her mind, so Kim brands her a \"cold-hearted bitch\". Vincent comforts Kim but advises her to accept and respect Denise's decision otherwise she would lose her sister, however, Kim stands by her own decision and decides to cut all ties with Denise. When Denise survives a bus crash, Denise rejects Kim's support. Kim throws Emerald a farewell dinner and invites Denise but Emerald and Patrick suspect that she has planned it for the same time as Denise's class to make her look bad. Kim embarrasses Denise by interrupting her class and revealing that Denise abandoned her son. An angry but defiant Denise eventually goes to the dinner but confronts Kim, telling her that she realises that Kim still sees Denise as a mother and fears being abandoned by her. At Emerald's leaving party, Kim and Denise stand up for each other against Emerald when she criticises Kim's parenting, and when Kim says she is thankful for her sister, Emerald says they are not really sisters, explaining that Denise was brought to her as a baby. This causes Kim and Denise to reunite. After learning that Denise's friends know the identity of her son's biological father, Kim decides to find out the truth herself, concluding that Denise's former fianc\u00e9 [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) is the father. Kim confronts Ian but his wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) informs her that he has had a vasectomy so cannot father any more children. Denise eventually tells Kim that Phil is the father, which shocks Kim; Denise begs her not to tell anyone. When [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) suffers a cardiac arrest, Kim assists [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), who performs CPR. Kim is interviewed by a local radio station and plans to use the opportunity to advertise The Albert, but changes her mind after seeing Ian, who has lost his son and business in a fire.\n\nKim thinks she has food poisoning but later finds out she is being sick because she is pregnant. She tells Vincent but he refuses to show interest of the idea of having another child, which hurts and confuses Kim, but they later are both excited by this. However, Kim suffers a [[miscarriage]], which devastates her. She continues to pretend she is pregnant and tries to get pregnant but this fails and she eventually tells Denise and Carmel the truth. Kim suspects Vincent is cheating on her but he is selling the Albert, which he has been forced to do by [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]). Aidan buys it from Vincent for \u00a31, and Kim discovers that she and Vincent risk losing their home due to Vincent's loss of income. Vincent decides to return to his police informant days, offering information on the heist in return for cash. However, Phil discovers Vincent is talking to the police and has a corrupt officer threaten Vincent. Vincent disappears and Kim is forced to move in with Denise and get a job at the local shop.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Introduction===\nKim was referenced multiple times following Denise's arrival in ''EastEnders''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a177716/robbie-gee-to-guest-in-eastenders.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Robbie Gee to guest in 'EastEnders'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=17 September 2009|location=[[London]]}}</ref> She initially appeared as a guest character, along with her boyfriend Dexter, between 24 and 27 November 2009.<ref name=\"24NO\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a187179/owen-crashes-denises-hen-night.html|title=Owen crashes Denise's hen night|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}</ref><ref name=\"27NO\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a187182/peggys-furious-by-phils-actions.html|title=Peggy's furious by Phil's actions|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}</ref> In December 2009, executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] was asked by entertainment website ''[[Digital Spy]]'' if there were plans for Kim and Dexter to return.

It might be Phil, but she's not afraid to take him on. The Mitchells think that they're the big guns in the Square \u2013 but as far as Kim's concerned, the Fox family are the same.

Kim's sister Denise features in two of the episodes, and Lorna Sinclair plays a B&B guest in the third episode. The official synopsis says: \"A camera crew is given access to all areas of 'Kim's Palace'.

What it can do is provide characters who offer some light relief to the show, whilst still functioning (just about) as believable human beings. Kim Fox is one such character\u2014a big, ballsy, whirlwind, she brings a sense of fabulousness to all her scenes and works well as the kind of character that can sympathise with those going through the usual Walford misery whilst encouraging them to embrace their inner fag/hag. Cherish her before she succumbs to the inevitable marriage to Phil/Ian/Max/Whoever.\"<ref name=\"rd\">{{cite news|url=http://www.lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2010/12/30/soapstar-superstars-july-december-2010/ |title=Soapstar Superstars: July \u2013 December 2010 |last=Deller |first=Ruth |date=30 December 2010 |publisher=[[Lowculture]] |accessdate=1 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vQ5HSnEu?url=http://www.lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2010/12/30/soapstar-superstars-july-december-2010/ |archivedate= 1 January 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEmpson received a nomination in the \"Best Comedy Performance\" category at the [[British Soap Awards#2011 winners|British Soap Awards 2011]],<ref name=\"bsa2011panel\">{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/pressreleases/programmepressreleases/bsa2011/default.html |title=The British Soap Awards 2011: Nominations |date=2 May 2011 |work=ITV Press Centre |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |accessdate=3 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506051855/http://www.itv.com/presscentre/pressreleases/programmepressreleases/bsa2011/default.html |archivedate= 6 May 2011 |df= }}</ref> {{cn span|[[British Soap Awards#2012 winners|2012]], [[British Soap Awards#2015 winners|2015]], [[British Soap Awards#2016 winners|2016]] and [[British Soap Awards#2017 winners|2017]]|date=June 2017}} for her portrayal of Kim.

She is the half-sister of [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]), and aunt to [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) and [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]). She first appeared as a guest character on 24 November 2009, and was reintroduced in 2010 as a regular character after piquing the interest of new executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]. Empson took maternity leave in October 2013 and after appearing several times during her break via webcam, Kim returned to Albert Square on 30 December 2014.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a553048/eastenders-star-tameka-empson-expecting-baby.html EastEnders star Tameka Empson expecting baby<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03wnvpl BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 24/02/2014<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bnc88 BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 22/07/2014<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0419k8n BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 17/04/2014<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04fc277 BBC One \u2013 EastEnders, 18/08/2014<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was announced on 16 July 2019 that Empson would be taking a break from the show but will return at some point in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a28406819/eastenders-tameka-empson-kim-fox-exit-break/|title=EastEnders star Tameka Empson is taking a break from her role as Kim Fox|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=16 July 2019|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref> She departed on 23 July 2019. Kim made a special appearance via webcam on 25 December 2019.\n\nKim is described as \"viscous and bubbly\" on the outside, but hiding vulnerability and low self-esteem. The ''EastEnders'' website describes Kim as having [[big hair]], a loud personality, hyperactive and a big heart. She is sharp, family-orientated and cares about her appearance, having a loud dress sense and being the life and soul of any party. She chooses the wrong men to have relationships with, but knows what she wants when it comes to love. Kim makes her first appearance for Denise's wedding to [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). She briefly returns after Denise is presumed dead, but makes a more permanent return when she separates from her boyfriend [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]). Kim kisses [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), sparking a brief feud with his wife, [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). She establishes a short-lived [[speakeasy]] and later opens a [[bed and breakfast]]. Kim also goes through a [[HIV]] scare and has a relationship with [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]). Kim gave birth to a baby girl, [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Pearl Fox|Pearl]], prematurely during [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]], which celebrated ''EastEnders''' 30th anniversary. In later storylines, Kim has suffered a [[miscarriage]] and had to cope with becoming a single mother to her and [[Vincent Hubbard]]'s ([[Richard Blackwood]]) children, Pearl and [[Mica Fox-Hubbard|Mica]], following Vincent's mysterious disappearance in April 2018.\n\nKim is often shown in a comedic light and as a result, Empson earned a nomination for \"Best Comedy Performance\" at the 2011 [[British Soap Awards]]. That same year she won the \"Funniest Performance\" award at the ''[[Inside Soap Awards]]'' and again the following year. Ruth Deller from entertainment website [[Lowculture]] praised the character during her guest appearance in 2009 and later said Kim is a \"big, ballsy, whirlwind\", who provides some light relief to the show. Daniel Maier from ''[[The Guardian]]'' has criticised Kim's B&B venture, calling it a \"holding pen for characters who are 'between homes' within Albert Square's hermetically sealed biosphere.\"\n\n==Storylines==\nKim visits [[Walford]] to attend the wedding of her sister, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). She is disappointed by her plans for a low-key [[hen night]], so organises a livelier event. During her visit, Kim's partner, [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]), makes a pass at her niece, [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]), but she chooses to forgive him. She makes a repeat visit seven months later and reveals that she has broken up with Dexter, as he was unfaithful to her. The following month, Kim is told that Denise has committed suicide. She returns to Walford for the funeral, as does her sister, [[Daphne Fox|Daphne]] (Emi Wokoma). It later transpires that Denise is still alive, as her death was staged by her husband, [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). Kim comes to stay with her, having once more separated from Dexter. She begins working at the local beauty salon and establishes a short-lived [[speakeasy]]. Kim causes trouble by kissing her married neighbour, [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). His wife, [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), finds out and is initially furious, but she and Kim forge a bond and become friends. Despite earlier conflict over her speakeasy, Kim also becomes friends with [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), landlady of the local pub. When Dexter buys Kim out of their restaurant business, she purchases the house next door to Denise's and opens a [[bed and breakfast]], called \"Kimberley's Palace\". It becomes her sole source of income when she is fired from the beauty salon for her lax attitude to work. Walford's new GP, [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), makes a long term booking at the B&B. Kim is initially attracted to him, but refrains from pursuing him as Denise is also interested in him. She accidentally tells [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) that Denise and Yusef haven't had sex yet which Masood uses to his advantage by telling Denise. Denise is at first annoyed with Kim for telling people about her private life, but they later reconcile. The next day, Kim helps out at [[Tommy Moon]]'s christening.\n\nKim wakes up in a skip and after initially lets Patrick and Denise believe she may have been attacked. However, Patrick find CCTV footage of a drunken Kim entering the local shop, the Minute Mart, late at night and taking alcohol. Kim explains to Denise that her erratic behaviour is due to a former boyfriend telling her that he has contracted HIV. Denise persuades Kim to take a HIV test which comes back negative, leaving Kim relieved. After Yusef sets the B&B on fire, Kim, Patrick and Denise are left homeless, so they move in with brothers [[Anthony Moon|Anthony]] ([[Matt Lapinskas]]) and [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline) and borrow clothes from friends. Kim starts spending money, thinking that insurance will cover the damage, but Patrick tells her that he was holding illegal alcohol and fireworks in the B&B, which made the fire worse, and the insurance may not pay out. Kim is angry and says she no longer wants to live with Patrick, but Denise later convinces Kim that her material possessions are not what matters and they should be a family.  After the insurance company refuse to pay for the damage, Patrick decides to retire and offers Kim and Denise the Minute Mart. Kim arranges a blind date, and on her way to it, is saved by [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]) from a falling ladder. She is attracted to him, and later when he sees she has been stood up, he offers to get her another drink. However, she is disappointed to learn that he has two children, saying she is fed up of men with \"baggage\". She then tries to chat up [[Gethin Williams]] ([[Bradley Freegard]]), but he harshly rejects her.\n\nShe turns her attention back to Ray after seeing him running and tells him she has started an fitness venture called \"Kimba\". She enlists some people to come to the class but Ray does not come. Ray asks Kim out but she says she has a date, and then meets [[List of EastEnders characters (2012)#Sinclair|Sinclair]] (Colin Michael Carmichael) from the Internet. Sinclair makes inappropriate comments about Kim's race. Ray calls Kim easy so she slaps him, and she then slaps Sinclair for his comments. When [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]) inherits all of Yusef's money, she gives it to Kim and Denise but is unhappy when they start spending it frivolously. Kim and Ray eventually reconcile and they share a kiss, although Kim continues to play hard to get, pretending she does not like him. Kim dislikes it when she sees Ray and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) playfight in the kitchen. She also becomes jealous when she overhears him flirting with Bianca whilst helping in the kitchen. As a result, she accidentally slices off the top of Ray's finger when he tries to help her fillet some fish. She accompanies him to the hospital where they open up to one another and decide to start a relationship. Ray is upset when his son, [[Morgan Butcher|Morgan]] (Devon Higgs) moves away. To cheer him up, Kim organises an intimate evening for them, however Ray arrives with his daughter, [[Sasha Dixon|Sasha]] (Rebecca Sanneh). Kim is shocked and tells Ray that, although she is interested in him, she does not think she can take on his children. Denise convinces Kim that she needs to accept Sasha and arranges for Kim to look after her. It goes well and she promises to do it again.\n\nMeanwhile, a man from the local council tells Kim that the new name for the B&B, Kim's Olympic Palace, infringes copyright. The next day, Kim is disappointed as the B&B's sign is taken down. Kim and Sasha start to bond and Kim and Ray declare their love for one another. When the B&B opens, Denise is annoyed by Kim's apathetic approach to running the place and quits. Kim struggles to run the B&B by herself and they later reconcile. When playing basketball with Sasha and Morgan, Kim smashes a window in the charity shop. Sasha takes the blame and works there, but she is unhappy, so Kim says she will organise some work experience for Sasha with a forensic scientist. Kim later admits this was a lie, leading to Ray moving out. Kim then gets Sasha a placement with [[Les Coker]]'s ([[Roger Sloman]]) firm of funeral directors, and Ray and Kim make up. Kim discovers that Ray has been looking for flats locally and she assumes that Ray is looking for somewhere for them both to live. However, she is left upset and humiliated when Ray reveals that the flat is actually for Sasha's mother, Deanne, so that they can both be closer to Sasha. Ray affirms his love for her and they reconcile. A few months later, Ray kisses Denise, and when Kim finds out, Ray says Denise initiated it. Kim slaps Denise and disowns her, however they soon reconcile. Ray ends his relationship with Kim, who is devastated and blames Denise, saying she does not want to see her again. Kim and Denise reconcile again when Ray admits he kissed Denise. A few months later Kim and Ray resume their relationship. Ray learns that Deanne has been in an accident and so decides to move to Essex to be closer to Sasha. Kim agrees to move with him, but at her birthday party she realises they do not have much in common and decides to stay, saying a tearful goodbye to him. Kim departs to work on a cruise ship, and during her time away, she marries [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]).\n\nKim returns to Walford after splitting from Vincent and reveals to Denise that she is pregnant. Kim struggles with caring for Patrick, who has suffered a [[stroke]]. Kim goes into labour early and gives birth to a girl, [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]]. She briefly falls out with Denise when she insults Kim's failed marriage, and leaves a voicemail and a text message for Vincent, informing him that he is a father. She regrets this afterwards and confides in Kat, [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]), [[Shirley Carter]] (Linda Henry) and Patrick that after the cruise, she visited Vincent to tell him she was pregnant but discovered he was a criminal when she saw him covered in blood and fled. Pearl develops an infection and is ill in hospital for several months, and when she brings her daughter home, Kim finds Vincent waiting for her. He explains that he was helping the victim of a mugging when she saw him, and although she is still suspicious, she reunites with him. She provides him with a false alibi for the assault on a drug dealer and key witness at [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) trial, and later discovers from his foster sister [[Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) that he did this for [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), a former girlfriend of his. She confronts Ronnie thinking she is having an affair with Vincent, but they explain they are no longer together, although Kim tells Ronnie to stay away from Vincent. Vincent cons [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) into giving him his wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]]'s ([[Letitia Dean]]) bar, the Albert. Sharon reinvests in the bar and Kim competes with Sharon to manage it. Vincent surprises Kim with news that he has bought them a house, but Denise tells Kim that he is just sweetening her up and Patrick throws him out of the house. Vincent tries to win Kim back by saying the new house is for Pearl. Kim decides to move on from Vincent but soon changes her mind and they kiss. Kim and Vincent's mother, [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]), then realise that Vincent has invited them both to live with him without telling them. When Claudette accuses Kim of freeloading, Kim decides to sell her share of her house, where Denise and Patrick live, which leaves them with a smaller home.\n\nKim is shocked to discover Vincent has taken delivery of a large amount of drugs, but he tells her that it is so he can set up Phil by planting them in his house as revenge for his father, Eric, killing Vincent's father, Henry. Vincent tells Kim how this happened, and Claudette confirms it, but convinces Kim not to tell anyone. When Phil deliberately scares Kim, Kim and Sharon attempt to end the feud and with Ronnie's help, Phil and Vincent agree. However, Phil later kidnaps Pearl from the house, and Vincent refuses to call the police, instead revealing he has a gun and will end it his own way. However, it soon emerges that Claudette killed Henry, not Eric, and Kim is reunited with Pearl.\n\nKim and Claudette clash at Pearl's first birthday party, and when Claudette's foster son [[Linford Short]] ([[Leon Lopez]]) announces that she is a finalist in the Pride of Walford Awards, Kim tries to take the attention away by jumping on Pearl's bouncy castle, which Claudette then punctures; Denise tells Kim that Claudette did this deliberately. Kim is horrified when Donna decides she wants Vincent to be a sperm donor so she can have a baby, but Vincent convinces her it is the right thing to do, however, it does not work and Donna changes her mind. When Kim finds out that Denise is pregnant but wants the baby adopted, Kim decides she and Vincent should adopt the child, but Denise is against this. Vincent discovers that Kim has received a parking fine in his car for parking in a bus lane; she discovers that Donna has a disabled parking permit so Kim uses Claudette as a way into Donna's flat and steals the permit to go shopping. Vincent discovers this and tells Donna, who tells her it is wrong; Patrick reveals Kim has never passed her driving test so Vincent bans her from driving his car. Vincent then gives Kim driving lessons, but she is angry that people are taking bets on whether she will pass or fail her test. She also worries when Denise does not want to tell her daughters that she is pregnant; Kim tells Libby, prompting her return to Walford. She passes her driving test but breaks her arm, so she is annoyed that she is unable to drive. Kim and Vincent travel to [[Montserrat]] and Denise is upset to learn that Kim has told their mother, [[Emerald Fox]] ([[Do\u00f1a Croll]]), that Denise is pregnant. Denise gives birth to a boy, but Kim becomes angry when she discovers that Denise still plans to have her son adopted and tries to reason with her. Denise refuses to change her mind, so Kim brands her a \"cold-hearted bitch\". Vincent comforts Kim but advises her to accept and respect Denise's decision otherwise she would lose her sister, however, Kim stands by her own decision and decides to cut all ties with Denise. When Denise survives a bus crash, Denise rejects Kim's support. Kim throws Emerald a farewell dinner and invites Denise but Emerald and Patrick suspect that she has planned it for the same time as Denise's class to make her look bad. Kim embarrasses Denise by interrupting her class and revealing that Denise abandoned her son. An angry but defiant Denise eventually goes to the dinner but confronts Kim, telling her that she realises that Kim still sees Denise as a mother and fears being abandoned by her. At Emerald's leaving party, Kim and Denise stand up for each other against Emerald when she criticises Kim's parenting, and when Kim says she is thankful for her sister, Emerald says they are not really sisters, explaining that Denise was brought to her as a baby. This causes Kim and Denise to reunite. After learning that Denise's friends know the identity of her son's biological father, Kim decides to find out the truth herself, concluding that Denise's former fianc\u00e9 [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) is the father. Kim confronts Ian but his wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) informs her that he has had a vasectomy so cannot father any more children. Denise eventually tells Kim that Phil is the father, which shocks Kim; Denise begs her not to tell anyone. When [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) suffers a cardiac arrest, Kim assists [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), who performs CPR. Kim is interviewed by a local radio station and plans to use the opportunity to advertise The Albert, but changes her mind after seeing Ian, who has lost his son and business in a fire.\n\nKim thinks she has food poisoning but later finds out she is being sick because she is pregnant. She tells Vincent but he refuses to show interest of the idea of having another child, which hurts and confuses Kim, but they later are both excited by this. However, Kim suffers a [[miscarriage]], which devastates her. She continues to pretend she is pregnant and tries to get pregnant but this fails and she eventually tells Denise and Carmel the truth. Kim suspects Vincent is cheating on her but he is selling the Albert, which he has been forced to do by [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]). Aidan buys it from Vincent for \u00a31, and Kim discovers that she and Vincent risk losing their home due to Vincent's loss of income. Vincent decides to return to his police informant days, offering information on the heist in return for cash. However, Phil discovers Vincent is talking to the police and has a corrupt officer threaten Vincent. Vincent disappears and Kim is forced to move in with Denise and get a job at the local shop.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Introduction===\nKim was referenced multiple times following Denise's arrival in ''EastEnders''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a177716/robbie-gee-to-guest-in-eastenders.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Robbie Gee to guest in 'EastEnders'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=17 September 2009|location=[[London]]}}</ref> She initially appeared as a guest character, along with her boyfriend Dexter, between 24 and 27 November 2009.<ref name=\"24NO\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a187179/owen-crashes-denises-hen-night.html|title=Owen crashes Denise's hen night|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}</ref><ref name=\"27NO\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a187182/peggys-furious-by-phils-actions.html|title=Peggy's furious by Phil's actions|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}</ref> In December 2009, executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] was asked by entertainment website ''[[Digital Spy]]'' if there were plans for Kim and Dexter to return.
