He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 [[war crimes trial]] of former personnel of the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-852|U-852]]'' for their actions in what became known as the [[Heinz-Wilhelm Eck#Peleus affair|''Peleus'' affair]]. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of [[British Kenya]] during [[Jomo Kenyatta]]'s unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau]]. Later that year he represented the litigants in the [[Crichel Down affair]], which led to changes in the law on [[eminent domain|compulsory purchase]]. In 1955 he defended [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman to be [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|executed for murder]] in the United Kingdom. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by [[Home Secretary]] [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]]. Two years later, Stevenson took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of [[John Bodkin Adams]] for the murder of [[Death of Edith Alice Morrell|Edith Alice Morrell]].\n\nStevenson became a High Court judge in 1957, and acquired a reputation for severity in sentencing. He sentenced the [[Kray twins]] to life imprisonment in 1969, with a recommendation that they serve not less than 30&nbsp;years each. In 1970 Stevenson passed long sentences on eight Cambridge University students who took part in the [[Garden House riot]], and the following year gave Jake Prescott of the [[Angry Brigade]] 15 years for conspiracy to cause explosions.\n\nOne of his fellow judges, Sir [[Robin Dunn]], described him as \"the worst judge since the war\".<ref name=\"WorstJudge\"/> After Dunn's attack, several high-profile legal figures came to Stevenson's defence,<ref name=\"WorstJudge\"/> among them fellow judge and biographer [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Lord Roskill]], who pointed out that Stevenson could be merciful to those he regarded as victims.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Lord Devlin]] described Stevenson as the \"last of the grand eccentrics\".{{sfn|Devlin|1986|p=38|ps=none}} Stevenson retired from the bench in 1979 aged 76, and died at [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]] in East Sussex on 26 December 1987.\n\n==Early life==\nStevenson was born in [[Newquay]], Cornwall, on 17 October 1902, the eldest child and only son of the Reverend John George Stevenson and his wife Olive, sister of [[Henry Wickham Steed]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> journalist and editor of ''[[The Times]]'' from 1919 until 1922.<ref name=\"Steed\"/> The Rev. J. G. Stevenson, a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister, died when his son was fourteen years old, plunging the family into relative poverty. An uncle who was a [[solicitor]] funded Stevenson's ongoing education at [[Dulwich College]] in London, intending that the young Stevenson would join the family firm once his schooling was complete. There was no money available to allow him to attend university, so Stevenson studied for an external London University LLB degree after becoming an [[articled clerk]] in his uncle's legal practice.<ref name= \"ODNB\"/> Stevenson was determined to become a [[barrister]], and joined the [[Inner Temple]], of which he became the treasurer in 1972.\n\n==Career at the bar==\nShortly after being [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1925 he joined the [[chambers (law)|chambers]] of [[Wintringham Stable]]<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> at 2 Crown Office Row,<ref name=\"ViscountBledisloe\"/> now [[Fountain Court Chambers]].<ref name=\"TheLawyer\"/> He remained there for the rest of his legal career except for the war years,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> eventually becoming head of chambers.<ref name=\"SirPeterWebster\"/>\n\nMost of Stevenson's early legal work was in the field of [[United Kingdom insolvency law|insolvencies]], \"almost always with small fees\", and he made steady progress until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He did very little criminal work in this part of his career.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In 1940 he joined the army and served until 1945 as a [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Deputy Judge Advocate]] with the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]];<ref name=\"TimesObit\"/> he was appointed a [[King's Counsel]] in 1943.<ref name=\"London Gazette36069\"/> In 1945 he served as Judge Advocate at the war crimes trial in [[Hamburg]] of former personnel of the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-852|U-852]]'', the so-called ''Peleus'' affair.<ref name=\"UBoatNet\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Law-Reports_Vol-1.pdf |title=Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals |last=United Nations War Crimes Commission |year=1947 |publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office |pages=1\u201320 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> The U-boat captain, [[Heinz-Wilhelm Eck]], was accused of ordering his crew to open fire on the survivors of a Greek ship, the [[SS Peleus|SS ''Peleus'']], which they had just torpedoed and sunk.

When they did not honour this promise, the Martens successfully campaigned to be allowed to buy the land back. The case led to a public enquiry, changes in the law on compulsory purchase, and the first resignation of a government minister since 1917.{{sfn|Cooke|2003|p=330|ps=none}}\n\nAccording to fellow judge [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Eustace Roskill]], Stevenson's \"fluent delivery, distinctive voice, remarkable sense of timing, and pungency of phrase soon marked him out as an advocate of note.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> One commentator described him as a \"shameless performer\" in court. He was probably the most successful barrister of his day.<ref name=\"John Platts-Mills\"/>\n\nIn 1955, aided by junior counsel [[Sebag Shaw]] and [[Peter Rawlinson, Baron Rawlinson of Ewell|Peter Rawlinson]], Stevenson defended [[Ruth Ellis]] against the charge of murdering her lover. Stevenson's decision to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum,{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=136|ps=none}} and his \"near silent performance in court\",{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=210|ps=none}} have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: \"Let me make this abundantly plain: there is no question here but this woman shot this man&nbsp;... You will not hear one word from me&nbsp;\u2013 or from the lady herself&nbsp;\u2013 questioning that.\"{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=207|ps=none}} The jury took 23&nbsp;minutes to find Ellis guilty;{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|loc=back cover|ps=none}} she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Public revulsion at the case is thought to have played a part in the abolition of [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment in the UK]] in 1969.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>{{efn|The 1965 [[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965|Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act]] abolished the death penalty for murder.

The prosecution's conduct of the trial has been heavily criticised,{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|p=241|ps=none}} and its decision to drop a second murder charge via a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' was scathingly described by the trial judge, [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]], as \"an abuse of process\", saying: \"The use of ''nolle prosequi'' to conceal the deficiencies of the prosection was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that there might have been something in the talk of mass murder after all\".{{sfn|Devlin|1986|pp=180\u2013182|ps=none}} Stevenson was of the opinion that had he been allowed to, he \"could have successfully prosecuted Adams on six murder counts\".{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|p=242}} Journalist [[Rodney Hallworth]] reports that Stevenson said of Adams' decision not to give evidence in court \"I firmly believe justice is not served by the present law.

He then began to attract press attention.<ref name=\"TimesObit\"/> Known for his outspokenness,<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Stevenson described one case as a \"pretty anaemic kind of rape\", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend<ref name=MarcelBerlins/> and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence.<ref name=\"Millbank\"/> To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked \"I see you come from [[Slough]]. It is a terrible place. You can go back there.\"{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}} In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in [[Manchester]] was \"a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make\".{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=31|ps=none}}\n\nFollowing a 1964 parallel of his comments in the wake of the Bodkin Adams case, Stevenson attracted criticism for his summing up to the jury in the case of Ryan (1964) 50 Cr App R 144, at 148:{{quote|It is, we think, clear&nbsp;... that it is wrong to say to a jury \"Because the accused exercised what is undoubtedly his right, the privilege of remaining silent, you may draw an inference of guilt\"; it is quite a different matter to say \"this accused, as he is entitled to do, has not advanced at an earlier stage the explanation that has been offered to you today; you the jury may take that into account when you are assessing the weight that you think it right to attribute to the explanation.\"<ref name=\"SpikingTheJudge\"/>}}\nThe academic lawyer [[Rupert Cross]] described Stevenson's pronouncement as \"gibberish\", and to the Court of Appeal in 1977 it seemed that Stevenson had made a distinction \"without a difference\".<ref name=\"SpikingTheJudge\"/> Although Stevenson's direction was not in accordance with the law in 1964, Parliament introduced a form of caution under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] that reflects what he proposed. His earlier suggestion that defendants in criminal trials should be forced to answer prosecution questions has not been adopted.\n\nStevenson believed that it was the judge's duty to help prevent crime by imposing robust punishments on those found guilty,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and he became noted for the severity of his sentencing, which led to occasional calls from the \"[[liberal elite|liberal establishment]]\" for his resignation.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=31|ps=none}} In 1969 he sentenced the [[Kray twins]], Reggie and Ronnie, to a minimum of 30&nbsp;years in jail each, saying, \"In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.\"<ref name=\"BBC\"/> He remarked later that the Krays had only told the truth twice during the trial: when Reggie referred to a barrister as \"a fat slob\" and when Ronnie accused the judge of being biased.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1970 he controversially gave what were seen as excessively long sentences to eight Cambridge University students who took part in the [[Garden House riot]], a demonstration against the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Greek military government]] that turned violent.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>{{efn|name=Garden House|All eight of the students found guilty of at least one offence received custodial sentences ranging from nine to eighteen months; those under 21 were sent to [[borstal]] rather than prison.<ref name=\"GardenHouse\"/>}} He noted that the sentences would have been even longer but for the students' exposure to \"the evil influence of some members of the university\". There were few, if any, examples of serious violence at student demonstrations in the years which followed the trial.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}}{{efn|name=Appeals|All but one of the sentences were upheld on appeal.<ref name=\"GardenHouse\"/>}} The following year he gave a 15-year sentence to Jake Prescott, a member of [[the Angry Brigade]], for conspiracy to cause explosions.

His sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal.<ref name=\"GlasgowHerald\"/><ref name=\"MailOnline\"/>\n\nStevenson turned down a chance to join the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], a decision he later regretted, and was subsequently critical of some of its decisions.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was appointed a [[Privy Counsellor]] in the 1973 [[New Year Honours]].<ref name=\"London Gazette45860\"/> His reference to the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] as a \"buggers' charter\" earned him a reprimand from the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Elwyn Jones, Baron Elwyn-Jones|Elwyn Jones]], and a [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]] calling for his resignation.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}}{{efn|Stevenson made his comment while sentencing a 61-year-old man to five years in prison for homosexual acts involving teenagers: \"Cases such as these are all the more grave in these days because some years ago Parliament committed itself to pass a buggers' charter ...\".<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>}} In 1976 the Court of Appeal overturned three of Stevenson's decisions in a single day, and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Marcus Lipton]] tabled another parliamentary motion calling for his removal from the bench.{{sfn|Coote|1993|p=140|ps=none}}\n\nBut Eustace Roskill cautions that \"It would be wrong to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases&nbsp;.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: \"You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's something to be said for him, you do your best not to put him inside.\"{{sfn|Baker|2005|p=152}} Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWhen asked towards the end of his career whether he had been stung by the criticism he had received, Stevenson replied \"A lot of my colleagues are just constipated Methodists\".{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}} There was no compulsory retirement age for a judge with Stevenson's length of service, which resulted in some speculation following the announcement of his retirement from the bench in 1979 that perhaps his unpopularity with certain sections of the media and establishment had led to pressure on him to step down.<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>\n\nIn an article published on the day of Stevenson's retirement [[Corinna Adam]] of ''The Guardian'' observed that:\n{{quote|He [Stevenson] holds the record among Old Bailey judges for having his sentences queried and taken to appeal.

He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 [[war crimes trial]] of former personnel of the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-852|U-852]]'' for their actions in what became known as the [[Heinz-Wilhelm Eck#Peleus affair|''Peleus'' affair]]. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of [[British Kenya]] during [[Jomo Kenyatta]]'s unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau]]. Later that year he represented the litigants in the [[Crichel Down affair]], which led to changes in the law on [[eminent domain|compulsory purchase]]. In 1955 he defended [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman to be [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|executed for murder]] in the United Kingdom. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by [[Home Secretary]] [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]]. Two years later, Stevenson took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of [[John Bodkin Adams]] for the murder of [[Death of Edith Alice Morrell|Edith Alice Morrell]].\n\nStevenson became a High Court judge in 1957, and acquired a reputation for severity in sentencing. He sentenced the [[Kray twins]] to life imprisonment in 1969, with a recommendation that they serve not less than 30&nbsp;years each. In 1970 Stevenson passed long sentences on eight Cambridge University students who took part in the [[Garden House riot]], and the following year gave Jake Prescott of the [[Angry Brigade]] 15 years for conspiracy to cause explosions.\n\nOne of his fellow judges, Sir [[Robin Dunn]], described him as \"the worst judge since the war\".<ref name=\"WorstJudge\"/> After Dunn's attack, several high-profile legal figures came to Stevenson's defence,<ref name=\"WorstJudge\"/> among them fellow judge and biographer [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Lord Roskill]], who pointed out that Stevenson could be merciful to those he regarded as victims.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Lord Devlin]] described Stevenson as the \"last of the grand eccentrics\".{{sfn|Devlin|1986|p=38|ps=none}} Stevenson retired from the bench in 1979 aged 76, and died at [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]] in East Sussex on 26 December 1987.\n\n==Early life==\nStevenson was born in [[Newquay]], Cornwall, on 17 October 1902, the eldest child and only son of the Reverend John George Stevenson and his wife Olive, sister of [[Henry Wickham Steed]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> journalist and editor of ''[[The Times]]'' from 1919 until 1922.<ref name=\"Steed\"/> The Rev. J. G. Stevenson, a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister, died when his son was fourteen years old, plunging the family into relative poverty. An uncle who was a [[solicitor]] funded Stevenson's ongoing education at [[Dulwich College]] in London, intending that the young Stevenson would join the family firm once his schooling was complete. There was no money available to allow him to attend university, so Stevenson studied for an external London University LLB degree after becoming an [[articled clerk]] in his uncle's legal practice.<ref name= \"ODNB\"/> Stevenson was determined to become a [[barrister]], and joined the [[Inner Temple]], of which he became the treasurer in 1972.\n\n==Career at the bar==\nShortly after being [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1925 he joined the [[chambers (law)|chambers]] of [[Wintringham Stable]]<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> at 2 Crown Office Row,<ref name=\"ViscountBledisloe\"/> now [[Fountain Court Chambers]].<ref name=\"TheLawyer\"/> He remained there for the rest of his legal career except for the war years,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> eventually becoming head of chambers.<ref name=\"SirPeterWebster\"/>\n\nMost of Stevenson's early legal work was in the field of [[United Kingdom insolvency law|insolvencies]], \"almost always with small fees\", and he made steady progress until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He did very little criminal work in this part of his career.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In 1940 he joined the army and served until 1945 as a [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Deputy Judge Advocate]] with the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]];<ref name=\"TimesObit\"/> he was appointed a [[King's Counsel]] in 1943.<ref name=\"London Gazette36069\"/> In 1945 he served as Judge Advocate at the war crimes trial in [[Hamburg]] of former personnel of the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-852|U-852]]'', the so-called ''Peleus'' affair.<ref name=\"UBoatNet\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Law-Reports_Vol-1.pdf |title=Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals |last=United Nations War Crimes Commission |year=1947 |publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office |pages=1\u201320 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> The U-boat captain, [[Heinz-Wilhelm Eck]], was accused of ordering his crew to open fire on the survivors of a Greek ship, the [[SS Peleus|SS ''Peleus'']], which they had just torpedoed and sunk.

When they did not honour this promise, the Martens successfully campaigned to be allowed to buy the land back. The case led to a public enquiry, changes in the law on compulsory purchase, and the first resignation of a government minister since 1917.{{sfn|Cooke|2003|p=330|ps=none}}\n\nAccording to fellow judge [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Eustace Roskill]], Stevenson's \"fluent delivery, distinctive voice, remarkable sense of timing, and pungency of phrase soon marked him out as an advocate of note.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> One commentator described him as a \"shameless performer\" in court. He was probably the most successful barrister of his day.<ref name=\"John Platts-Mills\"/>\n\nIn 1955, aided by junior counsel [[Sebag Shaw]] and [[Peter Rawlinson, Baron Rawlinson of Ewell|Peter Rawlinson]], Stevenson defended [[Ruth Ellis]] against the charge of murdering her lover. Stevenson's decision to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum,{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=136|ps=none}} and his \"near silent performance in court\",{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=210|ps=none}} have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: \"Let me make this abundantly plain: there is no question here but this woman shot this man&nbsp;... You will not hear one word from me&nbsp;\u2013 or from the lady herself&nbsp;\u2013 questioning that.\"{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=207|ps=none}} The jury took 23&nbsp;minutes to find Ellis guilty;{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|loc=back cover|ps=none}} she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Public revulsion at the case is thought to have played a part in the abolition of [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment in the UK]] in 1969.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>{{efn|The 1965 [[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965|Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act]] abolished the death penalty for murder. The last hangings were in 1964.}}\n\nStevenson was a leading member of the legal team assisting Sir [[Reginald Manningham-Buller]] during the failed prosecution of Dr [[John Bodkin Adams]] in 1957. The prosecution's conduct of the trial has been heavily criticised,{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|p=241|ps=none}} and its decision to drop a second murder charge via a [[nolle prosequi]] was scathingly described by the trial judge, [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]], as \"an abuse of process\", saying: \"The use of ''nolle prosequi'' to conceal the deficiencies of the prosection was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that there might have been something in the talk of mass murder after all\".{{sfn|Devlin|1986|pp=180\u2013182|ps=none}} Stevenson was of the opinion that had he been allowed to, he \"could have successfully prosecuted Adams on six murder counts\".{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|p=242}} Journalist [[Rodney Hallworth]] reports that Stevenson said of Adams' decision not to give evidence in court \"I firmly believe justice is not served by the present law. It should be possible for the prosecution to directly examine an accused&nbsp;... It was a clear example of the privilege of silence having enabled a guilty man to escape.\"{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|pp=232\u2013233|ps=none}} In Stevenson's opinion Adams \"was so incredibly lucky to have literally got away with murder\".{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|pp=232\u2013233|ps=none}}\n\n==Judicial career==\n{{quote box|width=20em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|quote=... without knowing what bodies, political or other, Melford belonged to, it would be safe to say that he was on the right wing of all of them.{{sfn|Devlin|1986|p=38|ps=none}}\n|source=\u2014[[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Lord Devlin]]}}\n{{quote box|width=20em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|quote=Bathurst <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Christopher Hiley Ludlow Bathurst, 3rd Viscount Bledisloe|Viscount Bledisloe]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> used to recount the story of Stevenson trying a manslaughter case in which a man who had run over a child pleaded, in extenuation, that he had thought the child was a dog; the judge, a great spaniel lover, promptly gave him the maximum sentence.<ref name=\"ViscountBledisloe\"/>}}\n{{quote box|width=20em|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|quote=I must confess I cannot tell whether you are innocent or guilty.

He then began to attract press attention.<ref name=\"TimesObit\"/> Known for his outspokenness,<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Stevenson described one case as a \"pretty anaemic kind of rape\", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend<ref name=MarcelBerlins/> and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence.<ref name=\"Millbank\"/> To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked \"I see you come from [[Slough]]. It is a terrible place. You can go back there.\"{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}} In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in [[Manchester]] was \"a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make\".{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=31|ps=none}}\n\nFollowing a 1964 parallel of his comments in the wake of the Bodkin Adams case, Stevenson attracted criticism for his summing up to the jury in the case of Ryan (1964) 50 Cr App R 144, at 148:{{quote|It is, we think, clear&nbsp;... that it is wrong to say to a jury \"Because the accused exercised what is undoubtedly his right, the privilege of remaining silent, you may draw an inference of guilt\"; it is quite a different matter to say \"this accused, as he is entitled to do, has not advanced at an earlier stage the explanation that has been offered to you today; you the jury may take that into account when you are assessing the weight that you think it right to attribute to the explanation.\"<ref name=\"SpikingTheJudge\"/>}}\nThe academic lawyer [[Rupert Cross]] described Stevenson's pronouncement as \"gibberish\", and to the Court of Appeal in 1977 it seemed that Stevenson had made a distinction \"without a difference\".<ref name=\"SpikingTheJudge\"/> Although Stevenson's direction was not in accordance with the law in 1964, Parliament introduced a form of caution under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] that reflects what he proposed. His earlier suggestion that defendants in criminal trials should be forced to answer prosecution questions has not been adopted.\n\nStevenson believed that it was the judge's duty to help prevent crime by imposing robust punishments on those found guilty,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and he became noted for the severity of his sentencing, which led to occasional calls from the \"[[liberal elite|liberal establishment]]\" for his resignation.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=31|ps=none}} In 1969 he sentenced the [[Kray twins]], Reggie and Ronnie, to a minimum of 30&nbsp;years in jail each, saying, \"In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.\"<ref name=\"BBC\"/> He remarked later that the Krays had only told the truth twice during the trial: when Reggie referred to a barrister as \"a fat slob\" and when Ronnie accused the judge of being biased.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1970 he controversially gave what were seen as excessively long sentences to eight Cambridge University students who took part in the [[Garden House riot]], a demonstration against the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Greek military government]] that turned violent.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>{{efn|name=Garden House|All eight of the students found guilty of at least one offence received custodial sentences ranging from nine to eighteen months; those under 21 were sent to [[borstal]] rather than prison.<ref name=\"GardenHouse\"/>}} He noted that the sentences would have been even longer but for the students' exposure to \"the evil influence of some members of the university\". There were few, if any, examples of serious violence at student demonstrations in the years which followed the trial.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}}{{efn|name=Appeals|All but one of the sentences were upheld on appeal.<ref name=\"GardenHouse\"/>}} The following year he gave a 15-year sentence to Jake Prescott, a member of [[the Angry Brigade]], for conspiracy to cause explosions. Prescott had been found not guilty of direct involvement in the bombings, but had admitted to addressing three envelopes. His sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal.<ref name=\"GlasgowHerald\"/><ref name=\"MailOnline\"/>\n\nStevenson turned down a chance to join the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], a decision he later regretted, and was subsequently critical of some of its decisions.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was appointed a [[Privy Counsellor]] in the 1973 [[New Year Honours]].<ref name=\"London Gazette45860\"/> His reference to the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] as a \"buggers' charter\" earned him a reprimand from the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Elwyn Jones, Baron Elwyn-Jones|Elwyn Jones]], and a [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]] calling for his resignation.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}}{{efn|Stevenson made his comment while sentencing a 61-year-old man to five years in prison for homosexual acts involving teenagers: \"Cases such as these are all the more grave in these days because some years ago Parliament committed itself to pass a buggers' charter ...\".<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>}} In 1976 the Court of Appeal overturned three of Stevenson's decisions in a single day, and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Marcus Lipton]] tabled another parliamentary motion calling for his removal from the bench.{{sfn|Coote|1993|p=140|ps=none}}\n\nBut Eustace Roskill cautions that \"It would be wrong to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases&nbsp;.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: \"You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's something to be said for him, you do your best not to put him inside.\"{{sfn|Baker|2005|p=152}} Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWhen asked towards the end of his career whether he had been stung by the criticism he had received, Stevenson replied \"A lot of my colleagues are just constipated Methodists\".{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}} There was no compulsory retirement age for a judge with Stevenson's length of service, which resulted in some speculation following the announcement of his retirement from the bench in 1979 that perhaps his unpopularity with certain sections of the media and establishment had led to pressure on him to step down.<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>\n\nIn an article published on the day of Stevenson's retirement [[Corinna Adam]] of ''The Guardian'' observed that:\n{{quote|He [Stevenson] holds the record among Old Bailey judges for having his sentences queried and taken to appeal. He also holds the record for getting away with it. He has gradually become such a stock hate-figure that lawyers tend automatically to advise their clients, if found guilty, to take their cases higher up.<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>}}\n\n==Personal life==\nStevenson married Anna Cecilia Francesca Imelda Reinstein, daughter of a Bavarian hairdresser,<ref>http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1992/British-WWII-Spymaster-Dies-At-Age-90/id-47ea59eab4ebb000d0dd51b9729710f2</ref> in 1929.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> They had one daughter.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He \"turned her [his wife] out\" after he discovered that she had been having an affair with Colonel [[Maurice Buckmaster]], head of the French section of the [[Special Operations Executive]].<ref name=\"TelegraphObit\"/> They were divorced in 1942,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and she married Buckmaster.<ref>{{cite ODNB |id=50926 ||last=Foot |first=M.

He opened his campaign by declaring that in the interests of a clean fight, he would make no allusions to the \"alleged homosexuality\" of his opponent, [[Tom Driberg]],{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}} who heavily defeated him in the vote; Stevenson returned to his legal practice the following year.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nDespite his severe manner, Stevenson was extremely sociable and he was often the centre of a lively crowd at the bar of the [[Garrick Club]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> of which he was a member.<ref name=\"WhosWho\"/> His home at [[Winchelsea]] on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> but the area had been known by that name for many years before his arrival.{{sfn|Cooper|1850|p=112|ps=none}} Following his retirement, Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders,{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}} and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Among the programmes he took part in was [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]]'s six-part series ''[[State

{"title_page": "Ralph Earl", "text_new": "'''Ralph Earl''' (May 11, 1751&nbsp;&ndash; August 16, 1801) was an [[United States|American]] painter known for his portraits, of which at least 183 can be documented. He also painted six landscapes, including a panorama display of [[Niagara Falls]].\n\n== Early life ==\nRalph Earl was born on May 11, 1751 in either [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]] or [[Leicester, Massachusetts]], the oldest of four children of Ralph Earle and Phebe Whittemore Earl. By 1774, he was working in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] as a portrait painter.  In the autumn of 1774, Earl returned to [[Leicester, Massachusetts]] to marry his cousin, Sarah Gates. A few months later, their daughter Phebe was born in January 1775.  Earl left them both with Sarah's parents and returned to New Haven to continue painting portraits.  Earl's wife and daughter joined him in New Haven in November 1776, and they lived there until May 1777, when their son, John, was born. Sarah later attested that this six-month period \"was all the time we kept house together.\"\n\n==Career==\nLike many of the colonial craftsmen, Earl was self-taught, and for many years was an itinerant painter. In 1775, Earl visited [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]], which were the sites of recent battles in the [[American Revolution]]. Although his father was a colonel in the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Revolutionary army]], Earl himself was a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]].<ref>[http://www.worcesterart.org/Collection/Early_American/Artists/earl_r/biography/index.html www.worcesterart.org]</ref> Working in collaboration with the engraver [[Amos Doolittle]], Earl drew four battle scenes that were made into pro-Revolutionary propaganda prints.\n{|-\n|[[File:Battle of Lexington.jpeg|150px]]\n|[[File:British Army in Concord.jpeg|150px]]\n|[[File:North Bridge Fight.jpeg|150px]]\n|[[File:Percy's rescue at Lexington.jpeg|150px]]\n|}\n\nIn 1778, he left behind his wife and daughter and escaped to England by disguising himself as the servant of British army captain [[John Money]].\n\nIn [[London]], he entered the studio of [[Benjamin West]], and painted the king and many notables. Earl continued painting portraits in the town of [[Norwich]].  He later married Ann Whiteside, an English woman, despite the fact that he had never ended his marriage with Sarah Gates. In 1785 or 1786, Earl returned to the [[United States]] with his new wife.\n\n===Return to America===\nAfter his return to America, he made portraits of [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[Caleb Strong|Governor Caleb Strong]], [[Roger Sherman]], and other prominent men. He also painted a large picture of [[Niagara Falls]].  In September 1786, while living in [[New York City]], Earl was imprisoned for failing to pay his personal debts. Even while in jail, he drew portraits of his visitors, friends, and family of the [[Society for the Relief of Distressed Debtors]].

He also painted six landscapes, including a panorama display of [[Niagara Falls]].\n\n== Early life ==\nRalph Earl was born on May 11, 1751 in either [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]] or [[Leicester, Massachusetts]], the oldest of four children of Ralph Earle and Phebe Whittemore Earl. By 1774, he was working in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] as a portrait painter.  In the autumn of 1774, Earl returned to [[Leicester, Massachusetts]] to marry his cousin, Sarah Gates. A few months later, their daughter Phebe was born in January 1775.  Earl left them both with Sarah's parents and returned to New Haven to continue painting portraits.  Earl's wife and daughter joined him in New Haven in November 1776, and they lived there until May 1777, when their son, John, was born. Sarah later attested that this six-month period \"was all the time we kept house together.\"\n\n==Career==\nLike many of the colonial craftsmen, Earl was self-taught, and for many years was an itinerant painter. In 1775, Earl visited [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]], which were the sites of recent battles in the [[American Revolution]]. Although his father was a colonel in the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Revolutionary army]], Earl himself was a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]].<ref>[http://www.worcesterart.org/Collection/Early_American/Artists/earl_r/biography/index.html www.worcesterart.org]</ref> Working in collaboration with the engraver [[Amos Doolittle]], Earl drew four battle scenes that were made into pro-Revolutionary propaganda prints.\n{|-\n|[[File:Battle of Lexington.jpeg|150px]]\n|[[File:British Army in Concord.jpeg|150px]]\n|[[File:North Bridge Fight.jpeg|150px]]\n|[[File:Percy's rescue at Lexington.jpeg|150px]]\n|}\n\nIn 1778, he left behind his wife and daughter and escaped to England by disguising himself as the servant of British army captain [[John Money]].\n\nIn [[London]], he entered the studio of [[Benjamin West]], and painted the king and many notables. Earl continued painting portraits in the town of [[Norwich]].  He later married Ann Whiteside, an English woman, despite the fact that he had never ended his marriage with Sarah Gates. In 1785 or 1786, Earl returned to the [[United States]] with his new wife.\n\n===Return to America===\nAfter his return to America, he made portraits of [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[Caleb Strong|Governor Caleb Strong]], [[Roger Sherman]], and other prominent men. He also painted a large picture of [[Niagara Falls]].  In September 1786, while living in [[New York City]], Earl was imprisoned for failing to pay his personal debts.

Eastern State's revolutionary system of incarceration, dubbed the \"Pennsylvania system\" or [[separate system]],  encouraged separate confinement as a form of rehabilitation. The warden was legally required to visit every inmate every day, and the overseers were mandated to see each inmate three times a day.\n\nThe Pennsylvania system was opposed contemporaneously by the [[Auburn system]] (also known as the New York system), which held that prisoners should be forced to work together in silence, and could be subjected to physical punishment ([[Sing Sing Correctional Facility|Sing Sing]] prison was an example of the Auburn system). Although the Auburn system was favored in the United States, Eastern State's radial floor plan and system of solitary confinement was the model for over 300 prisons worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOriginally, inmates were housed in cells that could only be accessed by entering through a small exercise yard attached to the back of the prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, opened onto the cell blocks. This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the cell blocks through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have the feel of a [[Church (building)|church]].<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.treasuresofpa.com/2009/11/esp |title=Eastern State Penitentiary \u2013 Treasures of Pennsylvania |website=Treasuresofpa.com |date=November 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150355/http://www.treasuresofpa.com/2009/11/esp/ |archivedate=April 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome believe that the doors were small so prisoners would have a harder time getting out, minimizing an attack on an officer. Others have explained the small doors forced the prisoners to bow while entering their cell. This design is related to penance and ties to the religious inspiration of the prison. The cells were made of concrete with a single glass [[Skylight (window)|skylight]], representing the \"Eye of God\", suggesting to the prisoners that God was always watching them.<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\"/>\n\nOutside the cell was an individual area for exercise, enclosed by high walls so prisoners could not communicate. Exercise time for each prisoner was synchronized so no two prisoners next to each other would be out at the same time. Prisoners were allowed to garden and even keep pets in their exercise yards. When a prisoner left his cell, an accompanying guard would wrap a hood over his head to prevent him from being recognized by other prisoners.<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\"/>\n\nCell accommodations were advanced for their time, including a faucet with running water over a flush toilet, as well as curved pipes along part of one wall which served as central heating during the winter months where hot water would be run through the pipes to keep the cells reasonably heated. Toilets were remotely flushed twice a week by the guards of the cellblock.\n\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary, Two Story Hall.jpg|thumb|right|One of the two-story cell blocks in Eastern State Penitentiary]]\nThe original design of the building was for seven one-story cell blocks, but by the time cell block three was completed, the prison was already over capacity. All subsequent cell blocks had two floors. Toward the end, cell blocks 14 and 15 were hastily built due to overcrowding. They were built and designed by prisoners. Cell block 15 was for the worst behaved prisoners, and the guards were gated off from there entirely.\n\nInmates were punished with the \"individual-treatment system.\"  At the time this form of punishment was thought to be most effective.  They would be separated from others.<ref>Vaux, Richard, 1816-1895. \"Brief sketch of the origin and history of the State Penitentiary for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia.\" 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Pennsylvania Governor [[Gifford Pinchot]] allegedly sentenced Pep \"The Cat-Murdering Dog\" (an actual dog) to a life sentence at Eastern State. Pep allegedly murdered the governor's wife's cherished cat. Prison records reflect that Pep was assigned an inmate number (no. C2559), which is seen in his mug shot. However, the reason for Pep's incarceration remains a subject of some debate. A contemporary newspaper article reported that the governor donated his own dog to the prison to increase inmate morale.<ref name=\"esp history\"/>\n\nOn April 3, 1945, a major escape was carried out by twelve inmates (including the infamous [[Willie Sutton]]), who over the course of a year managed to dig an undiscovered {{convert|97|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnel under the prison wall.  During renovations in the 1930s an additional 30 incomplete inmate-dug tunnels were discovered.\n\nIt was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv2\">{{Cite journal|url={{NHLS url|id=66000680}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Eastern State Penintentiary|date=August 6, 1974 |format=PDF |author=Richard E.

Many prisoners and guards were transferred to [[State Correctional Institution - Graterford|Graterford Prison]], about {{convert|31|mi|km}} northwest of Eastern State. The City of Philadelphia purchased the property with the intention of redeveloping it. The site had several proposals, including a mall and a luxury apartment complex surrounded by the old prison walls.\n\nDuring the abandoned era (from closing until the late 80s) a \"forest\" grew in the cell blocks and outside within the walls. The prison also became home to many stray cats.\n\nIn 1988, the Eastern State Penitentiary Task Force successfully petitioned Mayor [[Wilson Goode]] to halt redevelopment. In 1994, Eastern State opened to the public for history tours.\n\n=== End of the solitary confinement system ===\n[[File:ESP-cell.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical cell in restored condition.]]\nThe solitary confinement system eventually collapsed due to overcrowding problems. By 1913, Eastern State officially abandoned the solitary system and operated as a congregate prison until it closed in 1970 (Eastern State was briefly used to house city inmates in 1971 after a riot at [[Holmesburg]] Prison).\n\n[[File:Al-capone-cell.jpg|thumb|250px|Al Capone's cell.]]\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, PA barber shop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The remains of the barber shop.]]\n\nThe prison was one of the largest public-works projects of the early republic, and was a tourist destination in the 19th century.  Notable visitors included [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] while notable inmates included [[Willie Sutton]] and [[Al Capone]] in 1929. Visitors spoke with prisoners in their cells, proving that inmates were not isolated, though the prisoners themselves were not allowed to have any visits with family or friends during their stay.\n\nMost of the early prisoners were petty criminals incarcerated for various robbery and theft charges (muggers, pickpockets, purse-snatchers, burglars, etc.) and the first-time offenders often served two years.\n\nThe Penitentiary was intended not simply to punish, but to move the criminal toward spiritual reflection and change. While some have argued that the Pennsylvania system was [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-inspired, there is little evidence to support this; the organization that promoted Eastern State's creation, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (today's [[Pennsylvania Prison Society]]) was less than half Quaker, and was led for nearly fifty years by Philadelphia's Anglican bishop, [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]]. Proponents of the system believed strongly that the criminals, exposed, in silence, to thoughts of their behavior and the ugliness of their crimes, would become genuinely penitent.\n\nIn reality, the guards and councilors of the facility designed a variety of physical and psychological torture regimens for various infractions, including dousing prisoners in freezing water outside during winter months, chaining their tongues to their wrists in a fashion such that struggling against the chains could cause the tongue to tear, strapping prisoners into chairs with tight leather restraints for days on end, and putting the worst behaved prisoners into a pit called \"The Hole\", an underground cellblock dug under cellblock 14 where they would have no light, no human contact, and little food for as long as two weeks.\n\n===Prison reform and rehabilitation===\n[[SCI Graterford]] opened in the 1920s after disturbances occurred at Eastern State; the Pennsylvania prison board opened Graterford to assume functions previously held by Eastern State.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20180324042618/https://www.cor.pa.gov/Facilities/StatePrisons/Pages/Graterford.aspx SCI Graterford].\" [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]].

Retrieved on September 27, 2018.</ref>\n\nPrior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary (then known as '''State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia''') had established a far reaching program of group therapy with the goal of having all inmates involved. From 1967, when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been moderately successful as many inmates were involved in the groups which were voluntary. An interesting aspect was that the groups were led by two therapists, one from the psych or social work staff, and the second from the prison officer staff.<ref>Prison Manifesto. {{ISBN|0-9769715-0-X}}. Author Bernard Mazie</ref>\n\n==Architectural significance==\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary aerial crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Eastern State Penitentiary's radial plan served as the model for hundreds of later prisons.]]\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary Cross Section.jpg|thumb|250px|Cross Section of Cell Block]]\n\nWhen the Eastern State Penitentiary, or Cherry Hill as it was known at the time, was erected in 1829 in Francisville (the idea of this new prison was created in a meeting held at Benjamin Franklin's house in 1787) it was the largest and most expensive public structure in the country.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\">Johnston, Norman. Eastern State Penitentiary: Crucible of Good Intentions. Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1994.</ref> Its architectural significance first arose in 1821, when British architect [[John Haviland]] was chosen to design the building. Haviland found most of his inspiration for his plan for the penitentiary from prisons and asylums built beginning in the 1780s in England and Ireland.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/> He gave the prison a neo-Gothic look to instill fear into those who thought of committing a crime.<ref name=\"DolanESP\">{{cite book | title=Eastern State Penitentiary | publisher=Arcadia Publications | author=Dolan, Francis X. | year=2007 | location=Charleston, SC}}</ref>\n\nThese complexes consist of cell wings radiating in a semi or full circle array from a center tower whence the prison could be kept under constant surveillance. The design for the penitentiary which Haviland devised became known as the hub-and-spoke plan which consisted of an octagonal center connected by corridors to seven radiating single-story cell blocks, each containing two ranges of large single cells\u20148 x 12 feet x 10 feet high- with hot water heating, a water tap, toilet, and individual exercise yards the same width as the cell.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/>\n\nThere were rectangular openings in the cell wall through which food and work materials could be passed to the prisoner, as well as peepholes for guards to observe prisoners without being seen. To minimize the opportunities for communication between inmates Haviland designed a basic flush toilet for each cell with individual pipes leading to a central sewer which he hoped would prevent the sending of messages between adjacent cells.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/>\n\nDespite his efforts, prisoners were still able to communicate with each other and the flushing system had to be redesigned several times. Haviland remarked that he chose the design to promote \"watching, convenience, economy, and ventilation\".<ref>Norman Johnson, Crucible of Good Intentions:35</ref> Once construction of the prison was completed in 1836, it could house 450 prisoners.<ref>Johnston, Norman. The Human Cage: A Brief History of Prison Architecture. New York: Walker and Company, 1973.</ref>\n\nHaviland completed the architecture of the Eastern state penitentiary in 1836. Each cell was lit only by a single lighting source from either skylights or windows, which was considered the \"Window of God\" or \"Eye of God\". The church viewed imprisonment, usually in isolation, as an instrument that would modify sinful or disruptive behavior. The time spent in prison would help inmates reflect on their crimes committed, giving them the mission for redemption.\n\n==Modern-day historic site==\n\nThe Eastern State Penitentiary operates as a museum and historic site, open year-round. Guided tours are offered during the winter, and during the warmer months, self-guided recorded tours with headphones are also available (narrated mainly by [[Steve Buscemi]], with former guards, wardens and prisoners also contributing). A scavenger hunt is available for children.\n\nVisitors are allowed to walk into several specially marked solitary confinement cells, but most of them remain off limits and filled with original rubble and debris from years of neglect.

When restoration began, the cats were captured and neutered, thus causing them eventually to die off. Artist Linda Brenner sculpted 39 cat sculptures, which surround the property. The sculptures were purposefully made of a material that slowly dissolves over time to represent the inevitable natural decay that faces all living things.\n* '''The End of the Tunnel''' \u2013 Hundreds of feet of red piping were installed by artist Dayton Castleman representing paths of escape routes used by prisoners.\n* '''Recollection Tableaux''' \u2013 Six [[diorama]]s were sculpted by artist Susan Hagen to represent important moments in the prison's history. They are scattered around cell block seven.\n* '''GTMO''' \u2013 A replica of a [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] cell was set up by artist William Cromar inside one of the cells.\n* '''Midway of Another Day''' \u2013 A metal [[sundial]] set up to show \"the passing of time\" by Michael Grothusen in the courtyard of cell block one.\n* '''I always wanted to go to [[Paris, France]]''' \u2013 Artist Alexa Hoyer set up three TVs, one in a cell, one in a hallway, and one in a shower room, showing seven decades of prison films. The title ''I always wanted to go to Paris, France'' is from a quotation from one of the film excerpts screened in the prisoner's cell.\n* '''Juxtaposition''' \u2013 Brothers Matthew and Jonathan Stemler divided cell #34 in cell block 11 horizontally. A grid at the ceiling supports a display of suspended plaster pieces along a single plane. Ground [[mica]] [[schist]] poured onto the floor softens the step and enhances the texture of the space, while a bench provides a vantage point in which to view and consider the overall effect of the piece.\n* '''My Glass House''' \u2013 An ongoing project set up by artist Judith Taylor by taking black and white pictures of natural [[habitat]] found in the prison's walls. The prints are then turned into glass, and replace the missing glass in the [[greenhouse]] in the courtyard of cell block one.\n* [[File:RYE 3600.jpg|thumb|Pictures of people killed by people incarcerated here]]'''Living Space''' \u2013 Created by Johanna Inman and Anna Norton, Living Space consists of five videos containing time-lapse photographs of the ways Eastern State Penitentiary is altered by the changes of weather and light. The artists put their cameras in places that make Eastern State Penitentiary unique to capture the subtle ways nature plays upon the structure of the building. The goal was to create photographs which are contemplative. By allowing the public to see the gradual effects of time upon specific places, growth and decay are recognized and explored as components that make Eastern State Penitentiary a more living space.\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary Purge Incomplete.jpg|thumb|right|Purge Incomplete, Mary Jo Bole's exhibit]]\n* '''Purge Incomplete''' \u2013 [[Mary Jo Bole]]'s exhibit explores the history of plumbing at the penitentiary. The building had running water before the White House did. Consisting of sculptural pieces made of resin, brass, and frosted glass, Bole's designs are modeled after John Haviland's original design for the plumbing at Eastern State Penitentiary. The exhibit includes views of the plumbing from the vantage point of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts glow within the cells.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:Gargoyle 2, Exterior of Eastern State Penitentiary, 2006.JPG|thumb|right | Fake gargoyle on the exterior of the Eastern State Penitentiary for the [[Halloween]]-themed \"Terror Behind the Walls\" haunted attraction]]\nDue to its ominous appearance, gloomy atmosphere, and long history, Eastern State has been used as a location for television programs and films about [[haunting]]s. [[Paranormal TV]] shows like ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', [[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHXLbp7x3MM</ref> and ''[[MTV's Fear]]'' explored the [[paranormal]] at Eastern State. Eastern State was also used in an episode of ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'' titled \"The House\" which dealt with a murder after an inmate escape. For the show, the prison was renamed Northern State Penitentiary.\n\nOn June 1, 2007, ''[[Most Haunted Live!]]'' conducted and broadcast a paranormal investigation live (for the first time in the United States) from Eastern State Penitentiary for seven continuous hours hoping to come in contact with supernatural beings. Punk group the [[Dead Milkmen]] also filmed the music video for their song \"Punk Rock Girl\" in Eastern State. In the [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[The Suffering (game)|The Suffering]]'', players can find a video documentary of Eastern State Penitentary, one of the inspirations for the game.\n\nEastern State has also served as a location in several feature films. [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1995 film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|Twelve Monkeys]]'' used it as the setting for a mental hospital. The 1998 film [[Return to Paradise (1998 film)|''Return to Paradise'']] used it as a substitute for a prison in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124595/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt |website=IMDB |accessdate=July 12, 2018|title=Return to Paradise (1998) }}</ref>  The 2000 film ''[[Animal Factory]]'', directed by [[Steve Buscemi]] relied heavily on Eastern State in its portrayal of a prison in a state of advancing decay.

The warden was legally required to visit every inmate every day, and the overseers were mandated to see each inmate three times a day.\n\nThe Pennsylvania system was opposed contemporaneously by the [[Auburn system]] (also known as the New York system), which held that prisoners should be forced to work together in silence, and could be subjected to physical punishment ([[Sing Sing Correctional Facility|Sing Sing]] prison was an example of the Auburn system). Although the Auburn system was favored in the United States, Eastern State's radial floor plan and system of solitary confinement was the model for over 300 prisons worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOriginally, inmates were housed in cells that could only be accessed by entering through a small exercise yard attached to the back of the prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, opened onto the cell blocks. This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the cell blocks through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have the feel of a [[Church (building)|church]].<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.treasuresofpa.com/2009/11/esp |title=Eastern State Penitentiary \u2013 Treasures of Pennsylvania |website=Treasuresofpa.com |date=November 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150355/http://www.treasuresofpa.com/2009/11/esp/ |archivedate=April 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome believe that the doors were small so prisoners would have a harder time getting out, minimizing an attack on an officer. Others have explained the small doors forced the prisoners to bow while entering their cell. This design is related to penance and ties to the religious inspiration of the prison. The cells were made of concrete with a single glass [[Skylight (window)|skylight]], representing the \"Eye of God\", suggesting to the prisoners that God was always watching them.<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\"/>\n\nOutside the cell was an individual area for exercise, enclosed by high walls so prisoners could not communicate. Exercise time for each prisoner was synchronized so no two prisoners next to each other would be out at the same time. Prisoners were allowed to garden and even keep pets in their exercise yards. When a prisoner left his cell, an accompanying guard would wrap a hood over his head to prevent him from being recognized by other prisoners.<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\"/>\n\nCell accommodations were advanced for their time, including a faucet with running water over a flush toilet, as well as curved pipes along part of one wall which served as central heating during the winter months where hot water would be run through the pipes to keep the cells reasonably heated. Toilets were remotely flushed twice a week by the guards of the cellblock.\n\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary, Two Story Hall.jpg|thumb|right|One of the two-story cell blocks in Eastern State Penitentiary]]\nThe original design of the building was for seven one-story cell blocks, but by the time cell block three was completed, the prison was already over capacity. All subsequent cell blocks had two floors. Toward the end, cell blocks 14 and 15 were hastily built due to overcrowding. They were built and designed by prisoners. Cell block 15 was for the worst behaved prisoners, and the guards were gated off from there entirely.\n\nInmates were punished with the \"individual-treatment system.\"  At the time this form of punishment was thought to be most effective.  They would be separated from others.<ref>Vaux, Richard, 1816-1895. \"Brief sketch of the origin and history of the State Penitentiary for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia.\" 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Pennsylvania Governor [[Gifford Pinchot]] allegedly sentenced Pep \"The Cat-Murdering Dog\" (an actual dog) to a life sentence at Eastern State. Pep allegedly murdered the governor's wife's cherished cat. Prison records reflect that Pep was assigned an inmate number (no. C2559), which is seen in his mug shot. However, the reason for Pep's incarceration remains a subject of some debate. A contemporary newspaper article reported that the governor donated his own dog to the prison to increase inmate morale.<ref name=\"esp history\"/>\n\nOn April 3, 1945, a major escape was carried out by twelve inmates (including the infamous [[Willie Sutton]]), who over the course of a year managed to dig an undiscovered {{convert|97|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnel under the prison wall.  During renovations in the 1930s an additional 30 incomplete inmate-dug tunnels were discovered.\n\nIt was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv2\">{{Cite journal|url={{NHLS url|id=66000680}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Eastern State Penintentiary|date=August 6, 1974 |format=PDF |author=Richard E.

Many prisoners and guards were transferred to [[State Correctional Institution - Graterford|Graterford Prison]], about {{convert|31|mi|km}} northwest of Eastern State. The City of Philadelphia purchased the property with the intention of redeveloping it. The site had several proposals, including a mall and a luxury apartment complex surrounded by the old prison walls.\n\nDuring the abandoned era (from closing until the late 80s) a \"forest\" grew in the cell blocks and outside within the walls. The prison also became home to many stray cats.\n\nIn 1988, the Eastern State Penitentiary Task Force successfully petitioned Mayor [[Wilson Goode]] to halt redevelopment. In 1994, Eastern State opened to the public for history tours.\n\n=== End of the solitary confinement system ===\n[[File:ESP-cell.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical cell in restored condition.]]\nThe solitary confinement system eventually collapsed due to overcrowding problems. By 1913, Eastern State officially abandoned the solitary system and operated as a congregate prison until it closed in 1970 (Eastern State was briefly used to house city inmates in 1971 after a riot at [[Holmesburg]] Prison).\n\n[[File:Al-capone-cell.jpg|thumb|250px|Al Capone's cell.]]\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, PA barber shop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The remains of the barber shop.]]\n\nThe prison was one of the largest public-works projects of the early republic, and was a tourist destination in the 19th century.  Notable visitors included [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] while notable inmates included [[Willie Sutton]] and [[Al Capone]] in 1929. Visitors spoke with prisoners in their cells, proving that inmates were not isolated, though the prisoners themselves were not allowed to have any visits with family or friends during their stay.\n\nMost of the early prisoners were petty criminals incarcerated for various robbery and theft charges (muggers, pickpockets, purse-snatchers, burglars, etc.) and the first-time offenders often served two years.\n\nThe Penitentiary was intended not simply to punish, but to move the criminal toward spiritual reflection and change. While some have argued that the Pennsylvania system was [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-inspired, there is little evidence to support this; the organization that promoted Eastern State's creation, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (today's [[Pennsylvania Prison Society]]) was less than half Quaker, and was led for nearly fifty years by Philadelphia's Anglican bishop, [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]]. Proponents of the system believed strongly that the criminals, exposed, in silence, to thoughts of their behavior and the ugliness of their crimes, would become genuinely penitent.\n\nIn reality, the guards and councilors of the facility designed a variety of physical and psychological torture regimens for various infractions, including dousing prisoners in freezing water outside during winter months, chaining their tongues to their wrists in a fashion such that struggling against the chains could cause the tongue to tear, strapping prisoners into chairs with tight leather restraints for days on end, and putting the worst behaved prisoners into a pit called \"The Hole\", an underground cellblock dug under cellblock 14 where they would have no light, no human contact, and little food for as long as two weeks.\n\n===Prison reform and rehabilitation===\n[[SCI Graterford]] opened in the 1920s after disturbances occurred at Eastern State; the Pennsylvania prison board opened Graterford to assume functions previously held by Eastern State.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20180324042618/https://www.cor.pa.gov/Facilities/StatePrisons/Pages/Graterford.aspx SCI Graterford].\" [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]].

From 1967, when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been moderately successful as many inmates were involved in the groups which were voluntary. An interesting aspect was that the groups were led by two therapists, one from the psych or social work staff, and the second from the prison officer staff.<ref>Prison Manifesto. {{ISBN|0-9769715-0-X}}.

Eastern State Penitentiary: Crucible of Good Intentions. Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1994.</ref> Its architectural significance first arose in 1821, when British architect [[John Haviland]] was chosen to design the building. Haviland found most of his inspiration for his plan for the penitentiary from prisons and asylums built beginning in the 1780s in England and Ireland.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/> He gave the prison a neo-Gothic look to instill fear into those who thought of committing a crime.<ref name=\"DolanESP\">{{cite book | title=Eastern State Penitentiary | publisher=Arcadia Publications | author=Dolan, Francis X. | year=2007 | location=Charleston, SC}}</ref>\n\nThese complexes consist of cell wings radiating in a semi or full circle array from a center tower whence the prison could be kept under constant surveillance. The design for the penitentiary which Haviland devised became known as the hub-and-spoke plan which consisted of an octagonal center connected by corridors to seven radiating single-story cell blocks, each containing two ranges of large single cells\u20148 x 12 feet x 10 feet high- with hot water heating, a water tap, toilet, and individual exercise yards the same width as the cell.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/>\n\nThere were rectangular openings in the cell wall through which food and work materials could be passed to the prisoner, as well as peepholes for guards to observe prisoners without being seen. To minimize the opportunities for communication between inmates Haviland designed a basic flush toilet for each cell with individual pipes leading to a central sewer which he hoped would prevent the sending of messages between adjacent cells.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/>\n\nDespite his efforts, prisoners were still able to communicate with each other and the flushing system had to be redesigned several times. Haviland remarked that he chose the design to promote \"watching, convenience, economy, and ventilation\".<ref>Norman Johnson, Crucible of Good Intentions:35</ref> Once construction of the prison was completed in 1836, it could house 450 prisoners.<ref>Johnston, Norman. The Human Cage: A Brief History of Prison Architecture. New York: Walker and Company, 1973.</ref>\n\nHaviland completed the architecture of the Eastern state penitentiary in 1836. Each cell was lit only by a single lighting source from either skylights or windows, which was considered the \"Window of God\" or \"Eye of God\". The church viewed imprisonment, usually in isolation, as an instrument that would modify sinful or disruptive behavior. The time spent in prison would help inmates reflect on their crimes committed, giving them the mission for redemption.\n\n==Modern-day historic site==\n\nThe Eastern State Penitentiary operates as a museum and historic site, open year-round. Guided tours are offered during the winter, and during the warmer months, self-guided recorded tours with headphones are also available (narrated mainly by [[Steve Buscemi]], with former guards, wardens and prisoners also contributing). A scavenger hunt is available for children.\n\nVisitors are allowed to walk into several specially marked solitary confinement cells, but most of them remain off limits and filled with original rubble and debris from years of neglect. The city skyline of Philadelphia is visible from the prison courtyard, which still has the original baseball backstop and a chain link fence atop the \"outfield wall,\" the outer prison wall, to attempt to keep home run balls inside the grounds. There is also a camera located in the center guard tower, that lets visitors experience a correctional officer view of the prison.\n\nIn addition, Eastern State holds many special events throughout the year. Each July, there is a [[Bastille Day]] celebration, complete with a comedic reinterpretation of the storming of the Bastille and the tossing of thousands of [[Tastykake]]s from the towers,<ref>{{cite news|author=Dobrzynsky, Judith H.|title=For a Summer Getaway, A Model Prison|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 11, 2007|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E0D91039F932A25754C0A961958260&sec=travel&spon=&pagewanted=2M|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}</ref> accompanied by a cry of \"let them eat Tastykake!\" from an actor portraying Marie Antoinette.\n\nThe museum attracts close to 220,000 visitors each year.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36163247|title=Inside decaying US prison, former inmates are guides|last=Lussenhop|first=Jessica|date=May 11, 2016|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nReligious murals in the prison chaplain's office, painted in 1955 by inmate Lester Smith, remain visible to guests despite damage from exposure to sunlight.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\" />\n\nThe tour ends with an exhibit titled \"Prisons Today: Questions in the Age of Mass Incarceration\" which informs guests about the US prison system today and its failings.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\" />\n\n===Restoration===\nThe facility was kept in \"[[arrested decay|preserved ruin]]\", meaning no significant renovation or restoration was attempted, until 1991, when [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] provided funding so that stabilization and preservation efforts could begin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/learn/timeline |title=Timeline &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |date=August 20, 1929 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425031932/http://www.easternstate.org/learn/timeline |archivedate=April 25, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Fundraising and projects====\n* '''Perimeter Lighting''': In 2001, the Perimeter Lighting project, funded by the Department of Community and Economic Development ($250,000), and the 2000 Halloween Fundraiser ($50,000) were completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/perimeter-lighting |title=Perimeter Lighting &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418124429/http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/perimeter-lighting |archivedate=April 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n* '''Rotunda and Links Roofing''': In 2002, the Rotunda and Links Roofing project, funded by [[National Trust for Historic Preservation|Save America's Treasures Award]] ($500,000), now defunded, the City of Philadelphia ($355,000), the Keystone Historic Preservation ($90,000), and the 2002 Halloween Fundraiser ($55,000) was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/rotunda-and-links-roofing |title=Rotunda and Links Roofing &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418124241/http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/rotunda-and-links-roofing |archivedate=April 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n* '''Industrial Building Stabilization''': In 2003, the Industrial Building Stabilization project, funded by the Eastern State Penitentiary Board of Directors, Senator Vincent J.

They are scattered around cell block seven.\n* '''GTMO''' \u2013 A replica of a [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] cell was set up by artist William Cromar inside one of the cells.\n* '''Midway of Another Day''' \u2013 A metal [[sundial]] set up to show \"the passing of time\" by Michael Grothusen in the courtyard of cell block one.\n* '''I always wanted to go to [[Paris, France]]''' \u2013 Artist Alexa Hoyer set up three TVs, one in a cell, one in a hallway, and one in a shower room, showing seven decades of prison films. The title ''I always wanted to go to Paris, France'' is from a quotation from one of the film excerpts screened in the prisoner's cell.\n* '''Juxtaposition''' \u2013 Brothers Matthew and Jonathan Stemler divided cell #34 in cell block 11 horizontally. A grid at the ceiling supports a display of suspended plaster pieces along a single plane. Ground [[mica]] [[schist]] poured onto the floor softens the step and enhances the texture of the space, while a bench provides a vantage point in which to view and consider the overall effect of the piece.\n* '''My Glass House''' \u2013 An ongoing project set up by artist Judith Taylor by taking black and white pictures of natural [[habitat]] found in the prison's walls. The prints are then turned into glass, and replace the missing glass in the [[greenhouse]] in the courtyard of cell block one.\n* [[File:RYE 3600.jpg|thumb|Pictures of people killed by people incarcerated here]]'''Living Space''' \u2013 Created by Johanna Inman and Anna Norton, Living Space consists of five videos containing time-lapse photographs of the ways Eastern State Penitentiary is altered by the changes of weather and light. The artists put their cameras in places that make Eastern State Penitentiary unique to capture the subtle ways nature plays upon the structure of the building. The goal was to create photographs which are contemplative. By allowing the public to see the gradual effects of time upon specific places, growth and decay are recognized and explored as components that make Eastern State Penitentiary a more living space.\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary Purge Incomplete.jpg|thumb|right|Purge Incomplete, Mary Jo Bole's exhibit]]\n* '''Purge Incomplete''' \u2013 [[Mary Jo Bole]]'s exhibit explores the history of plumbing at the penitentiary. The building had running water before the White House did. Consisting of sculptural pieces made of resin, brass, and frosted glass, Bole's designs are modeled after John Haviland's original design for the plumbing at Eastern State Penitentiary. The exhibit includes views of the plumbing from the vantage point of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts glow within the cells.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:Gargoyle 2, Exterior of Eastern State Penitentiary, 2006.JPG|thumb|right | Fake gargoyle on the exterior of the Eastern State Penitentiary for the [[Halloween]]-themed \"Terror Behind the Walls\" haunted attraction]]\nDue to its ominous appearance, gloomy atmosphere, and long history, Eastern State has been used as a location for television programs and films about [[haunting]]s. [[Paranormal TV]] shows like ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', [[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHXLbp7x3MM</ref> and ''[[MTV's Fear]]'' explored the [[paranormal]] at Eastern State.

For the show, the prison was renamed Northern State Penitentiary.\n\nOn June 1, 2007, ''[[Most Haunted Live!]]'' conducted and broadcast a paranormal investigation live (for the first time in the United States) from Eastern State Penitentiary for seven continuous hours hoping to come in contact with supernatural beings. Punk group the [[Dead Milkmen]] also filmed the music video for their song \"Punk Rock Girl\" in Eastern State. In the [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[The Suffering (game)|The Suffering]]'', players can find a video documentary of Eastern State Penitentary, one of the inspirations for the game.\n\nEastern State has also served as a location in several feature films. [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1995 film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|Twelve Monkeys]]'' used it as the setting for a mental hospital. The 1998 film [[Return to Paradise (1998 film)|''Return to Paradise'']] used it as a substitute for a prison in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124595/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt |website=IMDB |accessdate=July 12, 2018|title=Return to Paradise (1998) }}</ref>  The 2000 film ''[[Animal Factory]]'', directed by [[Steve Buscemi]] relied heavily on Eastern State in its portrayal of a prison in a state of advancing decay. In June 2008, [[Paramount Pictures]] used parts of Eastern State Penitentiary for the filming of ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.\n\nIn September 2008, the History Press released ''Eastern State Penitentiary: A History'', the only comprehensive history book currently in print about Eastern State.
