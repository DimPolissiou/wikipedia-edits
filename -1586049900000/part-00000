The north of the district contains swampy [[floodplain]] of the [[Waikato River]] and several small lakes, of which the largest is [[Lake Waikare]].\n\nOther than Ngaruawahia, the main population centres are [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]], [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan]], and [[Te Kauwhata]]. The main industries in the district are [[dairy farming]], [[forestry]], and [[coal]] [[mining]]. There is a [[Huntly Power Station|major coal-fired power station at Huntly]]. Te Kauwhata is at the centre of a major [[wine]] region.\n\n==Population==\nAt the 2006 census the district had a population of 43,959. Of these, 6834 lived in Huntly, 5106 in Ngaruawahia, 2637 in Raglan, and 1294 in Te Kauwhata.

His life inspired several books and at least one movie.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012322/ ''The Iron Trail'' (1921) at IMDB.com]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMichael James Heney was born on October 24, 1864, near [[Head, Clara and Maria|Stonecliffe]], [[Renfrew County, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. He was the son of Thomas Eugene Heney and Mary Ann McCourt, Irish immigrants. His family farmed in the upper [[Ottawa Valley]].\n\nAt age 14, Heney ran away from home to work on the newly announced [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. He started as a water boy, then graduated to a track laying crew assistant and mule skinner. In 1883 he was included in a survey and location crew in the [[Selkirk Mountains]], eventually becoming foreman.  In 1887 he was hired to construct a rail line for the [[Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad]].  In 1897 he was contracted to build a gold mining [[hydraulic mining|hydraulic line]] at [[Anchor Point, Alaska]].<ref name=Quinn/>{{rp|7}}\n\n==Building Railroads in Alaska==\nWhen the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] came, Heney was ready. He visited the [[Skagway]] area to survey potential routes to the interior. By chance, he met Erastus Hawkins representing the Pacific Contract Company, Limited, which was organized to build through the [[White Pass]] inside of the St. James hotels lobby. A deal was struck and Heney was hired, first as labor foreman and then as contractor.

He was the son of Thomas Eugene Heney and Mary Ann McCourt, Irish immigrants. His family farmed in the upper [[Ottawa Valley]].\n\nAt age 14, Heney ran away from home to work on the newly announced [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. He started as a water boy, then graduated to a track laying crew assistant and mule skinner. In 1883 he was included in a survey and location crew in the [[Selkirk Mountains]], eventually becoming foreman.  In 1887 he was hired to construct a rail line for the [[Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad]].  In 1897 he was contracted to build a gold mining [[hydraulic mining|hydraulic line]] at [[Anchor Point, Alaska]].<ref name=Quinn/>{{rp|7}}\n\n==Building Railroads in Alaska==\nWhen the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] came, Heney was ready.
