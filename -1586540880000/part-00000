The name \"[[wild onion (disambiguation)|wild onion]]\" is applied to a number of ''Allium'' species, but ''A. cepa'' is exclusively known from cultivation.

The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the [[Delia antiqua|onion fly]], the [[Ditylenchus dipsaci|onion eelworm]], and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of ''A. cepa'', such as [[shallot]]s and [[potato onion]]s, produce multiple bulbs.\n\nOnions are cultivated and used around the world. As a food item, they are usually served cooked, as a [[vegetable]] or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make [[Pickled onion|pickles]] or [[chutney]]s. They are [[pungent]] when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\n[[File:ARS red onion.jpg|thumb|Roots, leaves and developing bulb]]\nThe onion plant (''Allium cepa''), also known as the bulb onion<ref name=GRIN>{{GRIN | ''Allium cepa'' var.

It is a [[biennial plant]], but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of {{convert|15|to|45|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of a [[basal disc]]. From the underside of the disc, a bundle of [[Fibrous root system|fibrous roots]] extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.<ref name=RHS />\n\nIn the autumn, the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then normally harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The [[inflorescence]] takes the form of a globular [[umbel]] of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.<ref name=RHS /> The average pH of an onion is around 5.5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foodsafety.wisc.edu/business_food/files/Approximate_pH.pdf|title=Approximate pH Values of Common Foods and Ingredients|website=Wisconsin Food Safety and Health|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224184605/http://www.foodsafety.wisc.edu/business_food/files/Approximate_pH.pdf|archive-date=2012-12-24|url-status=dead|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Origin and history ===\n[[File:An onion, woodcut, 1547 Wellcome L0029214.jpg|thumb|Woodcut, 1547]]\n\nBecause the wild onion is [[extinction|extinct]] and ancient records of using onions span [[Western Asia|western]] and [[Eastern Asia|eastern]] Asia, the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain,<ref name=\"cumo\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WqfACQAAQBAJ&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248 |title=Onion.

Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.<ref name=Hessayon>{{cite book |title=Be your own Vegetable Doctor |last=Hessayon |first=D.G. |authorlink = D. G.

The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Delia_antiqua/ |title=''Delia antiqua'' (Meigen): Onion Fly |website=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nThe onion eelworm (''[[Ditylenchus dipsaci]]''), a tiny parasitic soil-living [[nematode]], causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing [[carrot]]s, [[parsnip]]s, and [[bean]]s, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/techniques/pests/onion_eelworm.htm |title=Onion Eelworm (''Ditylenchus dipsaci'') |year=2011 |website=GardenAction  |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWhite rot of onions, leeks, and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus ''[[Stromatinia cepivora|Sclerotium cepivorum]]''. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of [[Mycelium|mycelia]], which later produces small, globular black structures called [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]]. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=226 |title=Onion white rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nNeck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage. It is caused by ''[[Botrytis allii]]'', which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of [[spore]]s are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=747 |title=Onion neck rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Storage in the home ===\n[[File:\u0c09\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Pickled onion]]\n\nCooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at [[room temperature]], optimally in a single layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location.

The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs from a master. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.<ref name=\"Rabinowitch 20-21\" />\n\nI'itoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the [[Baboquivari Peak Wilderness]], Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and is easy to grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1&nbsp;in below the surface and 12&nbsp;in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/programs/ark_product_detail/iitoi_onion/ |title=I'Itoi Onion |year=2010 |website=Ark of Taste |publisher=Slow Food USA |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==== Hybrids with ''A. cepa'' parentage ====\nA number of hybrids are cultivated that have ''A. cepa'' parentage, such as the [[Diploid#Polyploid types|diploid]] [[tree onion]] or Egyptian onion (''A.'' \u00d7''proliferum''), and the [[Triploid#Polyploid types|triploid]] onion (''A.'' \u00d7''cornutum'').\n\nThe tree onion or Egyptian onion produces bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers, and is now known to be a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of ''A. cepa'' and ''A. fistulosum''.

The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the [[Delia antiqua|onion fly]], the [[Ditylenchus dipsaci|onion eelworm]], and various fungi cause rotting.

It is a [[biennial plant]], but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of {{convert|15|to|45|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of a [[basal disc]]. From the underside of the disc, a bundle of [[Fibrous root system|fibrous roots]] extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.<ref name=RHS />\n\nIn the autumn, the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then normally harvested.

Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require a high level of [[Soil#Nutrients|nutrients]] in the soil. [[Phosphorus]] is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. [[Nitrogen]] and [[potash]] can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/publications/pubDetail.cfm?pk_id=7749 |title=2007 Onion Production Guide |author=Boyhan, George E.; Kelley, W. Terry (eds.) |year=2007 |website=Production Guides |publisher=University of Georgia: College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. Most traditional European onions are referred to as \"long-day\" onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as \"intermediate-day\" types, requiring only 12\u201313 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, \"short-day\" onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11\u201312 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/onion-bulb-formation-strongly-linked-day-length |title=Onion bulb formation is strongly linked with day length |author=Savonen, Carol |date=2006-07-13 |website= |publisher=Oregon State University Extension Service |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in [[Hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;9.<ref name=almanac /> Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to \"[[Bolting (horticulture)|bolt]]\", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/onion/onion-bolting.htm |title=What is Onion Bolting and how to Keep an Onion from Bolting |author=Rhoades, Jackie |website=Gardening Know How |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref>\n\nOnions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown [[bulb|bulbs called \"sets\"]].

The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need much water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be stored, they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying, then placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They are stored effectively in a well-ventilated, cool place.<ref name=RHS />\n\n=== Pests and diseases ===\n[[File:Uienvlieg maden.jpg|thumb|left|Larvae of the onion fly]]\n\nOnions suffer from a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.<ref name=Hessayon>{{cite book |title=Be your own Vegetable Doctor |last=Hessayon |first=D.G. |authorlink = D. G.

The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Delia_antiqua/ |title=''Delia antiqua'' (Meigen): Onion Fly |website=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nThe onion eelworm (''[[Ditylenchus dipsaci]]''), a tiny parasitic soil-living [[nematode]], causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing [[carrot]]s, [[parsnip]]s, and [[bean]]s, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/techniques/pests/onion_eelworm.htm |title=Onion Eelworm (''Ditylenchus dipsaci'') |year=2011 |website=GardenAction  |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWhite rot of onions, leeks, and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus ''[[Stromatinia cepivora|Sclerotium cepivorum]]''. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of [[Mycelium|mycelia]], which later produces small, globular black structures called [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]]. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=226 |title=Onion white rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nNeck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage. It is caused by ''[[Botrytis allii]]'', which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of [[spore]]s are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=747 |title=Onion neck rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Storage in the home ===\n[[File:\u0c09\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Pickled onion]]\n\nCooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at [[room temperature]], optimally in a single layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw moisture from [[vegetables]] with which they are stored which may cause them to [[Decomposition|decay]].<ref name=almanac /><ref name=Jauron>{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/news/2009/jul/062201.htm |title=Harvesting and storing onions |author=Jauron, Richard |date=2009-07-27 |publisher=Iowa State University Extension |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref>\n\nSweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month.

''aggregatum'') ===\nThis group contains shallots and potato onions, also referred to as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs from a master. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.<ref name=\"Rabinowitch 20-21\" />\n\nI'itoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the [[Baboquivari Peak Wilderness]], Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and is easy to grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1&nbsp;in below the surface and 12&nbsp;in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/programs/ark_product_detail/iitoi_onion/ |title=I'Itoi Onion |year=2010 |website=Ark of Taste |publisher=Slow Food USA |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==== Hybrids with ''A. cepa'' parentage ====\nA number of hybrids are cultivated that have ''A. cepa'' parentage, such as the [[Diploid#Polyploid types|diploid]] [[tree onion]] or Egyptian onion (''A.'' \u00d7''proliferum''), and the [[Triploid#Polyploid types|triploid]] onion (''A.'' \u00d7''cornutum'').\n\nThe tree onion or Egyptian onion produces bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers, and is now known to be a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of ''A. cepa'' and ''A. fistulosum''.

A seven-time champion in the [[NASCAR Cup Series]], he currently competes full-time in the series, driving the No. 48 [[Chevrolet Camaro (sixth generation)#ZL1|Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LE]] for [[Hendrick Motorsports]].\n\nJohnson was born in [[El Cajon, California]], and began racing motorcycles at the age of four. After graduating from [[Granite Hills High School (El Cajon, California)|Granite Hills High School]] he competed in [[off-road racing|off-road]] series. He raced in [[Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group]] (MTEG), [[Short-course Off-road Drivers Association]] (SODA) and [[SCORE International]], winning rookie of the year in each series. In 1998, Johnson and his team, [[Herzog Motorsports]], began stock car racing. He moved to the national [[American Speed Association]] (ASA) series for [[late model]] touring cars, and won another rookie of the year title. In 2000, he switched to the NASCAR Busch Series (now [[NASCAR Xfinity Series|Xfinity Series]]).\n\nHe moved to Hendrick Motorsports in the Winston Cup Series in 2002. After finishing fifth in the points in his first full season, he was second in 2003 and 2004, and fifth in 2005. Johnson won his first Cup Series championship in 2006 and with further wins in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, he became the first and only driver in NASCAR history<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.carophile.org/greatest-race-car-drivers-of-all-time/6/ |title = 10 Greatest Race Car Drivers of All Time - Page 6 of 10|date = May 7, 2015}}</ref> to win five consecutive championships. Johnson finished sixth in the points standings in the 2011 season and third in 2012 before winning his sixth championship in 2013. In 2016, Johnson won his seventh championship, tying [[Richard Petty]] and [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the most Cup Series championships of all time. Johnson is also a two-time winner of the [[Daytona 500]], winning in [[2006 Daytona 500|2006]] and [[2013 Daytona 500|2013]]. Between 2002 and 2017, Johnson recorded seven championships, 83 career race wins,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/motorsports/jimmie-johnson-grabs-rare-bristol-win-after-larson-mishap/ar-BBAhxli?li=BBnb7Kz |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425120448/http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/motorsports/jimmie-johnson-grabs-rare-bristol-win-after-larson-mishap/ar-BBAhxli?li=BBnb7Kz |archive-date=April 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 222 top fives, 341 top tens, and 35 [[pole position]]s.

Three years later, he won the 60cc class championship, despite having an injured knee.<ref name=hendrickbiography /> Afterward, he moved to the [[Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group]] (MTEG) Stadium Racing Series where he won several more awards. In 1993, Johnson was given the opportunity to drive for Herb Fishel. He refused the deal and continued racing [[Baja Bug|buggies]] and trucks in off-road stadium and desert races. He also reported for [[ESPN]] in the [[SCORE International|Short Course Off-Road Drivers Association]] (SODA).

During the season, he had a spectacular accident on lap 46 during the Lysol 200 at Watkins Glen when his brakes failed entering the first turn. He had to swerve quickly to the right to avoid the 86 of Dennis Demers, but went into the grass on the inside of turn one, then went back across the track, caught some air on the gravel trap before finally crashing head-on into the carafoam barriers at the far end of the turn while still more than 150+ MPH. Many feared that this accident could have resulted in career ending injuries or potentially have killed him, but he climbed out of the car unscathed and raised his fists in the air like he'd won the race, much to the delight of the crowd. Otherwise, in a rather uneventful season which featured one DNQ at Daytona and six top-10s, he finished tenth in the point standings. During the [[2001 NASCAR Busch Series|2001 season]], Johnson recorded one win, which was at [[Chicagoland Speedway]], and finished eighth in the point standings. He also began racing in the Winston Cup Series for [[Hendrick Motorsports]], making his cup debut during the [[UAW-GM Quality 500]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]]. In the following season, Johnson left Herzog Motorsports to move to Hendrick Motorsports in the Winston Cup Series, driving the No. 48 [[Lowe's]] Chevrolet.<ref name=jimmiejohnsonorg /><ref name='teamlowesjimmie'>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowesracing.com/Team-Lowes/Jimmie-Johnson.aspx |title=Team Lowe's Racing&nbsp;\u2013 Jimmie Johnson |publisher=Lowesracing.com |date=September 17, 1975 |accessdate=February 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217135255/http://lowesracing.com/Team-Lowes/Jimmie-Johnson.aspx |archivedate=December 17, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NASCAR.COM&nbsp;\u2013 Before Hendrick, there was Herzog Motorsports|url=http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/12/07/jjohnson.liberati.houston/index.html|work=December 7, 2006|publisher=Nascar.com|accessdate=February 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010024736/http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/12/07/jjohnson.liberati.houston/index.html|archivedate=October 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===NASCAR Cup Series===\n====2002\u201305====\nJohnson began racing full-time in the Winston Cup Series during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 season]].

[[Kyle Busch]], [[Kurt Busch]], [[Mark Martin]], [[Jeff Gordon]], and [[Denny Hamlin]].<ref name=2013season /> Afterward, he placed fourth in the [[2013 Budweiser Duels|first Budweiser Duel]],

on lap 32 and leading a handful of laps before falling back to the middle of the pack. Over the last few laps, Johnson was racing alongside [[Brad Keselowski]] for the lead until a caution came out for debris. Johnson took the advantage of leading on the last restart. With five laps to go, Johnson led a lane with [[Greg Biffle]] and [[Danica Patrick]]. He then held off a last lap charge from [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Mark Martin]] to win his second Daytona 500.<ref name=\"daytonawin2013\">{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2013/02/24/2013-daytona-500-winner-jimmie-johnson-dale-earnhardt-jr-danica-patrick-nascar/1943461/ | title=Jimmie Johnson wins Daytona 500; Danica Patrick eighth | work=USA Today | date=February 24, 2013 | accessdate=February 24, 2013 | author=Nate Ryan and Heather Tucker}}</ref> This was Johnson's first Daytona 500 win with regular crew chief Chad Knaus, as he won the 2006 race with [[Darian Grubb]] as Knaus was serving a five-race suspension. It was also the first time since his 2006 win that he finished better than 27th in the Daytona 500, after a streak of six years where he had never finished better than 27th because of crashes and mechanical failures.\n\nThe following week at Phoenix, Johnson started inside the top ten and finished second behind [[Carl Edwards]]. He followed this with a sixth-place finish at Las Vegas. At Bristol, he was running on the lead lap until a spin late race forced him back to a 22nd-place finish. At Fontana, he struggled for most of the race, racing near the back of the pack, but salvaged a 12th-place finish. Johnson won his first pole position of the season at Martinsville and had the dominant car, leading 346 of 500 laps on the way to his eighth Martinsville race win. Johnson also assumed the point lead as well, which he would hold on to for the remainder of the regular season. Johnson's consistency was enough that there were points in the summer where he was more than a full two race wins' worth of points ahead of [[Carl Edwards]] or [[Clint Bowyer]]. Afterward, Johnson finished sixth at Texas. At Kansas, he led nine laps and finished third behind [[Matt Kenseth]] and [[Kasey Kahne]]. Johnson finished 12th the following week at Richmond, allowing him to build even further on his point lead. At Talladega, he was the only driver besides [[Matt Kenseth]] to lead double digit laps (16), and finished in fifth place. A fourth-place finish the following week at Darlington allowed Johnson to further solidify his point lead over Edwards.\n\nIn the [[2013 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race]], Johnson won his record fourth All-Star race after a fast pit stop allowed him to start the final 10-lap sprint in second, and later passed [[Kasey Kahne]] for the victory.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/jimmie-johnson-races-record-4th-035533465--nascar.html|title=Jimmie Johnson races to record 4th All-Star win|work=[[Yahoo!

At [[2013 FedEx 400|Dover]], Johnson led 143 laps, but finished 17th when he jumped [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] on the last restart causing NASCAR to issue him a penalty. He was able to redeem himself for this mistake the following week at Pocono by earning the pole position, leading the most laps, and winning his third race of the season, which increased his point lead to 51 points over Edwards. This also snapped a nine-year winless streak for Johnson at Pocono since sweeping both of the track's 2004 NASCAR Cup Series races. At the [[2013 Quicken Loans 400|Quicken Loans 400]] at Michigan, Johnson closed in on [[Greg Biffle]] for the lead with less than ten laps left, but suffered a flat tire with less than five laps to go. Johnson would finish the race in 28th, his worst finish of the season to that point.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/06/16/jimmie-johnson-michigan-results-quicken-loans-400.html|title=Trouble snares Hendrick quartet at Michigan|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=June 16, 2013|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> Johnson then finished ninth at Sonoma. At Kentucky, Johnson started third. He had the dominant car of the race, leading 182 of 267 laps. However, on a restart on lap 246, Johnson was slow to get up to speed and was subsequently touched and spun by [[Joey Logano]], costing Johnson a shot at the win and giving the race to [[Matt Kenseth]]. Johnson was able to charge through the field after the caution and restart to salvage a ninth-place finish.\n\nReturning to Daytona for the [[2013 Coke Zero 400|Coke Zero 400]], Johnson led 94 laps and held off [[Tony Stewart]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] on a [[green-white-checker finish]] to win his fourth race of the year. In winning the race, Johnson became the first driver since [[Bobby Allison]] in 1982 to sweep both Daytona races in a season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/johnson-1st-driver-sweep-daytona-024739887--nascar.html|title=Johnson 1st driver to sweep Daytona since 1982|work=[[Yahoo!

Johnson led the most laps and almost won, but a slow final pit stop cost him the race to Newman. The following week at Pocono, Johnson won another pole position, setting another track qualifying record. He led 43 of the first 80 laps before he cut a right front tire that knocked a spark plug loose and affected the handling of the car. Johnson's pit crew worked hard to repair the car, fixing the plug on the last pit stop, and managing to salvage a 13th-place finish after racing near the back of the pack for most of the race.\n\nReturning to Michigan, Johnson qualified third but crashed in happy hour, forcing him to a backup car and a 43rd starting spot. After running up to the lead through pit stop strategy, Johnson lost an engine on lap 55, relegating him to a 40th-place finish. This was followed by a streak of three poor finishes of 36th at Bristol, 28th at Atlanta, and 40th at Richmond due to crashes and mechanical failures.\n\nJohnson started the Chase seeded in second place. He started the Chase with a fifth-place finish at Chicago, followed by a fourth-place finish at New Hampshire. At Dover, Johnson led 243 laps and held off [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] over the last 25 laps to win his eighth race at the track, also redeeming himself for the restart line violation that had cost him a shot at winning the June race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2013/09/29/Jimmie-Johnson-wins-record-eighth-victory-at-Dover|title=Jimmie Johnson wins record eighth victory at Dover|work=[[Hendrick Motorsports]]|date=September 29, 2013|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJohnson spent the next several races chasing [[Matt Kenseth]] for the points lead, eventually gaining it at Talladega, though losing it when he and Kenseth tied for points lead at Martinsville. Returning to Texas, Johnson had the dominant car, leading 255 laps to his sixth win of the season. The following weekend at Phoenix, Johnson avoided trouble in tight racing on two separate occasions (a near scrape in turn 4 on the first lap, and later a near spin after contact with [[Carl Edwards]] in turn 1) to escape with a third-place finish. He also capitalized on Kenseth suffering from a poor-handling car. With Kenseth finishing 23rd, Johnson took a 28-point lead to the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. In the finale, Johnson raced conservatively to a ninth-place finish to secure his sixth title. He closed out the season with six wins, three poles, 16 top five and 24 top ten finishes, with an average finish of 9.8 and average start of 10.7.\n\n====2014====\nStatistically, 2014 was one of Johnson's worst seasons to date. He started the season on an up-and-down note, but went winless through the first 11 races of the 2014 season (his best finish was 2nd at Martinsville). Skepticism began to arise, as he had never gone more than 12 races into a season without a win, and hadn't gone that long since the first few years of his Cup career. However, Johnson won the Coca-Cola 600, his first win in the race since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/10984179/jimmie-johnson-wins-coca-cola-600-first-victory-season|title=Jimmie Johnson wins Coca-Cola 600|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=May 26, 2014|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> Afterward, he went on to win at Dover the following week, making it the 13th time he had back-to-back wins.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/06/01/jimmie-johnson-wins-dover-race-fedex-400-nascar-sprint-cup/9844103/|title=Jimmie Johnson makes it nine wins at Dover|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=June 1, 2014|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, Johnson recorded his first win at Michigan, after several years of being deprived of a shot at victory as the result of running out of gas or blowing an engine. However, he didn't keep up with the momentum. After finishing in the top ten at Sonoma and Kentucky, Johnson was collected in an early wreck in the Coke Zero 400, finishing 42nd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/motorracing/os-nascar-daytona-coke-notes-0707-20140706,0,343580.story|title=Jimmie Johnson falls from No. 2 in NASCAR Cup Series points standings.|access-date=July 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714224048/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/motorracing/os-nascar-daytona-coke-notes-0707-20140706,0,343580.story|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Johnson's streak of misfortune continued the next several weeks, finishing 42nd for the second week in a row at New Hampshire. This was followed up by an inconsistent run at Indy (14th), and poor showings resulting from accidents at Pocono (39th) and Watkins Glen (28th). Despite the poor finishes, Johnson qualified fourth for the Chase.\n\nIn the Chase, Johnson finished 12th at Chicagoland, fifth at New Hampshire, and third at Dover to advance to the Contender Round. However, trouble struck when he finished 40th and 17th in the next two races.\n\nAt Talladega, Johnson started second and led a high of 84 laps. However, a 24th-place finish kept him from advancing to the Eliminator Round. At Martinsville, Johnson started seventh but finished 39th after being involved in a crash early in the race. Returning to Texas, Johnson dominated and held off [[Brad Keselowski]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] to score his third straight win in the fall Texas race, and also ended an 18-race-winless-streak. At Phoenix, he struggled for most of the day and finished 38th after blowing a tire and crashing out. At the season finale at Homestead, Johnson finished ninth, and closed out finishing 11th in points. This marks the first time in Johnson's NASCAR Cup career that he has finished outside of the top ten in the final points.\n\n====2015====\n[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|right|Johnson leading the [[2015 Daytona 500]].]]\nJohnson began his season with a win in the [[Budweiser Duel]]. He started the season by finishing fifth in the [[2015 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] for the second year in a row. The following week, he won the [[2015 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500|Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500]] at Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/content/nascar/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/3/1/nascar-sprint-cup-series-atlanta-motor-speedway-race-recap.html|title=Johnson survives for soggy Atlanta win|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAt Las Vegas, Johnson crashed twice into the outside wall, leaving him with a 41st-place finish. He rebounded with an 11th-place finish in Phoenix and a ninth-place finish at California, his first top ten there in two years. At Martinsville, he struggled to a 35th-place finish. However, his momentum returned at Texas when he held off [[Kevin Harvick]] and [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] to win. At Bristol, he avoided tight trouble early in the race and came home second to polesitter [[Matt Kenseth]]. At Richmond, he finished third. These finishes moved him back up to fourth in the standings. At Talladega, Johnson started fifth and led 50 laps, only to finish second to Earnhardt, Jr.\n\nAt Kansas, Johnson gambled by staying out on the last round of pit stops, and held off Harvick and Earnhardt again to win his third race at Kansas and of the season. In winning, he established a Cup record of 23 wins on 1.5-mile tracks, taking what was both his 200th top five and his 300th top ten finish.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bonkowski|first1=Jerry|title=Jimmie Johnson leads Hendrick onslaught, holds off Kevin Harvick to win at Kansas|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/10/jimmie-johnson-leads-hendrick-onslaught-holds-off-harvick-to-win-at-kansas/|website=NASCAR Talk|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=May 10, 2015|date=May 10, 2015}}</ref> At Charlotte, he spun out on two occasions. The first time was early in the race while running 16th coming out of turn 4 but he was lucky to avoid hitting anything. He wasn't so lucky on the second spin late in the race; while running fifth, he spun out again at exactly the same place, and hit the wall in pit road, causing some nose damage. Those spin-outs would leave him with a 40th-place finish. He rebounded the following week with a [[2015 FedEx 400|win at Dover]], and also became one of four drivers to have won 10 or more races at one track. This gave him a total of 74 career wins, two fewer than [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s 76.\n\nAt Pocono, Johnson cut a tire on lap 88, but did not take major damage. He was able to work his way through the field to finish in third place. He finished 19th at Michigan after the race was called for rain on lap 138. At Sonoma, Johnson led the most laps at 45 laps, but a late race caution caused by [[Casey Mears]]' broken wheel axle cost him, and he was passed by [[Kyle Busch]] with five laps to go, and slipped back to sixth place.\n[[File:TSM350 - 2015 - Jimmie Johnson 2 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Johnson during [[2015 Toyota/Save Mart 350]] qualifying]]\nReturning to Daytona, Johnson started 12th and led 35 laps before finishing second to [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], in a repeat of the Talladega race. At Kentucky, Johnson started sixth and ran inside the top ten for most of the night, finishing ninth. At the second stop in Pocono, Johnson, along with two of his Hendrick teammates, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr, took advantage of several cars running out of fuel to finish in the Top 6 (Gordon finished 3rd, Dale Jr. took 4th, Johnson grabbed 6th). At Watkins Glen, despite suffering two penalties (lap 3: Overshooting the entrance to the inner loop, and caution No. 1 (lap 26-28): Speeding through pit road) Johnson rallied to finish 10th. He wasn't so lucky at Michigan, late in the race, he got loose and spun in turn 3, and damaged the splitter on his car, resulting in a 39th-place finish (10 laps down). He rebounded at Bristol by finishing 4th, but had bad luck once more at Darlington. He spun out on lap 134 in turn 4, bringing out the 7th caution, and was never a real threat. He ended up 19th. He was able to recover a bit for a 9th-place finish at Richmond, and started 1st in the Chase in a three-way tie between him, Kyle Busch, and Matt Kenseth.\n\nJohnson opened up the Chase in a rough way. At Chicagoland, he blew a left front tire early in the race, but was able to charge through the field to salvage an 11th-place finish. He also was the subject of controversy when he made contact with [[Kevin Harvick]] on a three-wide pass that led to Harvick cutting a left rear tire, leaving Harvick with a 42nd-place finish.\n\nAt Loudon, Johnson finished 6th after blowing a tire in the 3rd position. At Dover, his Chase hopes came to an end when his car broke a drive line, leading him to finish 36 laps down in 41st place. At the fall race at Texas Johnson won, passing Brad Keselowski with 4 laps to go. This marked his fourth consecutive win in the fall race, and third consecutive win on that track, having also won the spring race. That victory also marked the 75th of his NASCAR Cup Series career, putting him one race win short of tying Dale Earnhardt's career wins. Also in the process, he snapped a 20-race-winless-streak.\n\nJohnson finished 5th at Phoenix, and for the third year in a row, he finished 9th at Homestead. Also in the process, he edged out Ryan Newman by 1 point to finish 10th in the final standings. With the retirement of his teammate and mentor, Jeff Gordon, Johnson assumed the active wins record with 75.\n\n====2016: The seventh title====\nJohnson began the 2016 season with a 16th-place finish at the [[2016 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]]. In the next race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, he won his 1st race of the season and the 76th of his career, tying [[Dale Earnhardt]] for seventh on the all-time wins list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2620556-jimmie-johnson-ties-earnhardt-victory-mark-as-nascar-returns-to-normal|title=Johnson Ties Earnhardt Victory Mark as NASCAR Returns to Normal|last=Dutton|first=Monte|date=February 29, 2016|website=Bleacher Report|access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> Johnson finished third and eleventh in the next two events of the season at Las Vegas and Phoenix.

At Richmond, he led 44 laps early in the race and finished 3rd. At [[2016 GEICO 500|Talladega]], Johnson was spun by [[Paul Menard]] and got involved in a multi-car accident with 28 laps to go, finishing 22nd. Johnson's streak of misfortune continued through the next several months, crashing out at [[2016 AAA 400 Drive for Autism|Dover]], [[2016 Axalta \"We Paint Winners\" 400|Pocono]], [[2016 Coke Zero 400|Daytona]], Kentucky and at Watkins Glen, where he finished last for the first time in his career. His top-10 finishes during the period came only in the [[2016 Coca-Cola 600|Coca-Cola 600]] and [[2016 Brickyard 400|Brickyard 400]], where he finished 3rd in both races. Johnson finished 7th and 6th at Bristol and Michigan the following two weeks, but finished 33rd at Darlington after he spun out of turn 4. Johnson then finished 11th at Richmond. He qualified 8th for the Chase.\n\nJohnson began the [[NASCAR Chase for the Championship|Chase for the Championship]] by leading a race-high 118 laps at Chicagoland, but received a speeding penalty during a green flag pit stop late in the race, ultimately finished 12th. Johnson finished 8th the following week at Loudon. At [[2016 Citizen Soldier 400|Dover]], Johnson led 90 laps but once again received a pit road penalty with 105 laps to go, costing him a win. He would charge through the field and finish 7th (1st car a lap down). He was able to move to the \"Round of 12\" of the Chase.\n\nAt Charlotte, Johnson led a race-high 155 laps and won the [[2016 Bank of America 500|Bank of America 500]], claiming his 8th win at the track and the 3rd win of the season, also snapping his 24-race winless streak. This marked Johnson's first appearance in the \"Round of 8\" under the current Chase system. He then finished 4th at Kansas and 23rd at [[2016 Hellmann's 500|Talladega]]. At Martinsville, Johnson had contact with [[Denny Hamlin]] on lap 198 and had a tire rub to cause a caution but was able to stay on the lead lap. Later during a caution on lap 362, he lost fuel pressure but was able to get the car refired and stayed on the lead lap again. After the restart, he took the lead from Hamlin and led the final 92 laps to win the [[2016 Goody's Fast Relief 500|Goody's Fast Relief 500]]. This locked him into the Championship 4 for the final race at Homestead. Johnson finished 11th in the rain-shortened race at [[2016 AAA Texas 500|Texas]], and 38th at [[2016 Can-Am 500|Phoenix]] after being penalized a lap for passing the pace car coming down to pit road and involved in a wreck on a restart.\n\n{{Wikinews|Jimmie Johnson wins seventh NASCAR Cup Series championship}}\nJohnson claimed his seventh championship by winning at [[2016 Ford EcoBoost 400|Homestead]] on November 20. After losing his starting spot due to a pre-race inspection fault, Johnson started at the rear of the field. He progressed through the field, cracking the top 10 quickly, but remained stagnant around 5th place for a majority of the race. On a restart with 10 laps to go, [[Carl Edwards]] came across the nose of Joey Logano, hit the inside wall and triggered a massive wreck, ending Edwards' championship hopes. Johnson avoided the accident, and was put into position to win the title. On the final restart, he passed [[Kyle Larson]], winning the race and his seventh championship, tying [[Richard Petty]] and [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the most all-time of championships.\n\n====2017====\nJohnson came into 2017 as the defending Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion. The start of the season didn't go as smoothly as the end of last season, however. Through the first six races of the season, Johnson only scored one top ten finish. He rebounded with back to back wins at the [[2017 O'Reilly Auto Parts 500]] in Texas and the [[2017 Food City 500]] at Bristol. This would be the 14th time he has won back-to-back races in his career. Johnson then finished just outside the top ten at Richmond, even after colliding with his teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr earlier in the race. Johnson scored his third win of the season at Dover in June after beating [[Kyle Larson]] in an overtime finish. This was Johnson's 11th win at Dover and 83rd career win, which tied him with [[Cale Yarborough]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wackerlin|first=Jeff|title=Monster Milestone Win for Johnson|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2017/06/Jimmie-Johnson-Wins-AAA-400-Drive-For-Autism-for-83rd-Career-Win.aspx|website=MRN.com|publisher=[[Motor Racing Network]]|accessdate=June 4, 2017|date=June 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607143356/http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2017/06/Jimmie-Johnson-Wins-AAA-400-Drive-For-Autism-for-83rd-Career-Win.aspx|archive-date=June 7, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rest of the season didn't go smoothly for Johnson. On June 11, 2017, during the [[2017 Axalta presents the Pocono 400|Axalta presents the Pocono 400]], Johnson's brakes failed causing him and [[Jamie McMurray]] to crash hard, causing McMurray's car to burst into flames. Johnson was uninjured in the accident.  Johnson suffered a big slump during the summer part of the season, only getting 3 Top 10 finishes, no Top 5 finishes, and 3 DNF's from [[2017 Quaker State 400|Kentucky]], [[2017 Brantley Gilbert Big Machine Brickyard 400|Indianapolis]], and [[2017 Overton's 400|Pocono]]. Regardless, Johnson was able to make the playoffs from the earlier wins. Johnson was one of the favorites to win the title after making through the first round with an 8th-place finish at Chicago, a 14th-place finish at New Hampshire, and a 3rd-place finish, at Dover. In the second round, Johnson finished with a 7th-place finish at Charlotte, but the next week he was involved in [[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]] at Talladega finishing 24th after his car was disqualified for violating the NASCAR Damaged Vehicle Policy in which his crew worked on the car during the red flag. At Kansas in the elimination race, Johnson was entering as the spot to advance with a 7-point advantage but advanced after finishing 6th and getting 5 points in Stage 1 and staying out before the end of Stage 2 and finishing 10th, getting 1 stage point, and even though he spun a few times, he got by a big wreck involving Chase Drivers [[Matt Kenseth]] and [[Jamie McMurray]] and finished the race in 11th place, advancing to the Round of 8. Unfortunately his performance slipped in the third round. He finished 12th at Martinsville, but had tire problems at Texas which slipped him to finish 27th and had a chance to win at Phoenix but blew a tire just one lap before the end of Stage 2 which put him in the garage and ended his day and he was eliminated in the round of 8. Johnson would go on to finish 10th in the final standings.\n\n====2018====\n[[File:Jimmie Johnson Richmond 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's 2018 car at [[Richmond Raceway]]]]\nJohnson's [[Speedweeks]] did not go smoothly, wrecking in each of his three races. At the [[2018 Advance Auto Parts Clash|Advance Auto Parts Clash]], he was wrecked on the last lap by [[Kyle Larson]]; this was the seventh year in a row he failed to finish the Clash. Johnson qualified third for the [[2018 Daytona 500]], but had to go to a backup car after wrecking in his [[2018 Can-Am Duels|Duel]]. On lap 59 of the Daytona 500, he got caught up in a wreck started by [[Ryan Blaney]], and [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]], which also involved his teammate [[William Byron (racing driver)|William Byron]], [[Erik Jones]], [[Daniel Su\u00e1rez]], [[Trevor Bayne]], and [[Ty Dillon]] and ended up 38th. Since then, Johnson struggled throughout the 2018 season with only two top-fives and eight top-10 finishes by the time he barely made the Playoffs for the 15th season in a row. Johnson's only great run off the season came at the [[2018 Bank of America Roval 400|Charlotte Roval race]] where he ran in the Top 10 for most of the day and battled [[Martin Truex Jr.]] for the win on the final lap, but he locked his brakes on turn 17 and spun out of control, taking Truex out with him in the process while Blaney passed them to win the race. Johnson finished eighth, and as a result of a three-way tie with 0 points, he was eliminated in the Round of 16. Johnson would go on to score only one more top-ten finish afterwards and wound up a then career-worst 14th in the final point standings since running full-time in 2002, winless for the first time in his illustrious career along with equaling a career-low 11 top-ten finishes for the second season in a row.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, Lowe's announced they would no longer sponsor the 48 car at the conclusion of the 2018 season. In October, it was announced that Johnson and his long time crew chief [[Chad Knaus]] would part ways at the end of the season, ending a 17-year partnership, the longest in NASCAR history. Johnson will be paired with [[JR Motorsports]] crew chief [[Kevin Meendering]] in the 2019 season. On October 28, 2018, Hendrick Motorsports announced that [[Ally Financial]] signed a two-year deal to sponsor the No. 48 team starting in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/jimmie-johnson-sponsor-ally-financial-lowes/3204616/|title=Jimmie Johnson finds new sponsor in Ally Financial for 2019 season | last=Utter | first=Jim | work=Motorsport.com | date=October 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2018, Johnson participated in a motorsports cultural exchange with two-time [[Formula One]] champion [[Fernando Alonso]] at [[Bahrain International Circuit]], where both drivers compared their respective race cars.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2018/11/26/jimmie-johnson-fernando-alonso-ride-swap-bahrain/ |title=Championship swap: Jimmie Johnson, Fernando Alonso turn laps together |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=[[NASCAR|NASCAR Digital Media LLC.]] |date=November 26, 2018 |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alonso-swaps-seats-with-nascar-racer-jimmie-johnson.10JBhEOUi6AOWeAgWCcEUQ.html |title=Alonso swaps seats with NASCAR racer Jimmie Johnson |website=FormulaOne.com |publisher=[[Formula One|Formula One World Championship Limited]]/[[Tata Communications]] |date=November 26, 2018 |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====2019====\n[[File:Jimmie Johnson 48 Sonoma 2019.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson racing during the [[2019 Toyota/Save Mart 350]]]]\nThe [[2019 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|2019 season]] started on a positive note for Johnson, as he won the [[2019 Advance Auto Parts Clash]] after contact between him and [[Paul Menard]] sent Menard spinning while battling for the lead and triggering \"[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]\" on lap 55 right before the rain arrived.  It was also the first race with new sponsor [[Ally Financial]] and crew chief [[Kevin Meendering]].  He followed it up by finishing 8th in the first duel race.  In the Daytona 500, Johnson ran up front most of the race, but when he came to pit road with around 40 to go, [[B. J. McLeod]] and [[Cody Ware]]\u2019s cars spun behind him and hit him in the left rear.  The contact ripped off the left rear quarter-panel.  He recovered to finish 9th after being 2 laps down.

He followed up that performance with a ninth-place finish.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/02/10/jimmie-johnson-wins-rain-shortened-advance-auto-parts-clash-at-daytona/ |title=Jimmie Johnson wins rain-shortened Advance Auto Parts Clash |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC. |date=February 10, 2019 |accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref>  On March 29 in [[2019 O'Reilly Auto Parts 500|O'Reilly Auto Parts 500]] qualifying at Texas, Johnson got his first pole since 2016 at Texas and scored his first top-five finish since the [[2018 Coca-Cola 600]] two days later.

A seven-time champion in the [[NASCAR Cup Series]], he currently competes full-time in the series, driving the No. 48 [[Chevrolet Camaro (sixth generation)#ZL1|Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LE]] for [[Hendrick Motorsports]].\n\nJohnson was born in [[El Cajon, California]], and began racing motorcycles at the age of four. After graduating from [[Granite Hills High School (El Cajon, California)|Granite Hills High School]] he competed in [[off-road racing|off-road]] series. He raced in [[Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group]] (MTEG), [[Short-course Off-road Drivers Association]] (SODA) and [[SCORE International]], winning rookie of the year in each series.

During the season, he had a spectacular accident on lap 46 during the Lysol 200 at Watkins Glen when his brakes failed entering the first turn. He had to swerve quickly to the right to avoid the 86 of Dennis Demers, but went into the grass on the inside of turn one, then went back across the track, caught some air on the gravel trap before finally crashing head-on into the carafoam barriers at the far end of the turn while still more than 150+ MPH. Many feared that this accident could have resulted in career ending injuries or potentially have killed him, but he climbed out of the car unscathed and raised his fists in the air like he'd won the race, much to the delight of the crowd. Otherwise, in a rather uneventful season which featured one DNQ at Daytona and six top-10s, he finished tenth in the point standings. During the [[2001 NASCAR Busch Series|2001 season]], Johnson recorded one win, which was at [[Chicagoland Speedway]], and finished eighth in the point standings. He also began racing in the Winston Cup Series for [[Hendrick Motorsports]], making his cup debut during the [[UAW-GM Quality 500]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]].

It was also the first time since his 2006 win that he finished better than 27th in the Daytona 500, after a streak of six years where he had never finished better than 27th because of crashes and mechanical failures.\n\nThe following week at Phoenix, Johnson started inside the top ten and finished second behind [[Carl Edwards]]. He followed this with a sixth-place finish at Las Vegas. At Bristol, he was running on the lead lap until a spin late race forced him back to a 22nd-place finish. At Fontana, he struggled for most of the race, racing near the back of the pack, but salvaged a 12th-place finish. Johnson won his first pole position of the season at Martinsville and had the dominant car, leading 346 of 500 laps on the way to his eighth Martinsville race win. Johnson also assumed the point lead as well, which he would hold on to for the remainder of the regular season. Johnson's consistency was enough that there were points in the summer where he was more than a full two race wins' worth of points ahead of [[Carl Edwards]] or [[Clint Bowyer]]. Afterward, Johnson finished sixth at Texas. At Kansas, he led nine laps and finished third behind [[Matt Kenseth]] and [[Kasey Kahne]]. Johnson finished 12th the following week at Richmond, allowing him to build even further on his point lead. At Talladega, he was the only driver besides [[Matt Kenseth]] to lead double digit laps (16), and finished in fifth place. A fourth-place finish the following week at Darlington allowed Johnson to further solidify his point lead over Edwards.\n\nIn the [[2013 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race]], Johnson won his record fourth All-Star race after a fast pit stop allowed him to start the final 10-lap sprint in second, and later passed [[Kasey Kahne]] for the victory.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/jimmie-johnson-races-record-4th-035533465--nascar.html|title=Jimmie Johnson races to record 4th All-Star win|work=[[Yahoo!

At [[2013 FedEx 400|Dover]], Johnson led 143 laps, but finished 17th when he jumped [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] on the last restart causing NASCAR to issue him a penalty. He was able to redeem himself for this mistake the following week at Pocono by earning the pole position, leading the most laps, and winning his third race of the season, which increased his point lead to 51 points over Edwards. This also snapped a nine-year winless streak for Johnson at Pocono since sweeping both of the track's 2004 NASCAR Cup Series races. At the [[2013 Quicken Loans 400|Quicken Loans 400]] at Michigan, Johnson closed in on [[Greg Biffle]] for the lead with less than ten laps left, but suffered a flat tire with less than five laps to go. Johnson would finish the race in 28th, his worst finish of the season to that point.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/06/16/jimmie-johnson-michigan-results-quicken-loans-400.html|title=Trouble snares Hendrick quartet at Michigan|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=June 16, 2013|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> Johnson then finished ninth at Sonoma. At Kentucky, Johnson started third. He had the dominant car of the race, leading 182 of 267 laps. However, on a restart on lap 246, Johnson was slow to get up to speed and was subsequently touched and spun by [[Joey Logano]], costing Johnson a shot at the win and giving the race to [[Matt Kenseth]]. Johnson was able to charge through the field after the caution and restart to salvage a ninth-place finish.\n\nReturning to Daytona for the [[2013 Coke Zero 400|Coke Zero 400]], Johnson led 94 laps and held off [[Tony Stewart]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] on a [[green-white-checker finish]] to win his fourth race of the year.

Johnson's pit crew worked hard to repair the car, fixing the plug on the last pit stop, and managing to salvage a 13th-place finish after racing near the back of the pack for most of the race.\n\nReturning to Michigan, Johnson qualified third but crashed in happy hour, forcing him to a backup car and a 43rd starting spot. After running up to the lead through pit stop strategy, Johnson lost an engine on lap 55, relegating him to a 40th-place finish. This was followed by a streak of three poor finishes of 36th at Bristol, 28th at Atlanta, and 40th at Richmond due to crashes and mechanical failures.\n\nJohnson started the Chase seeded in second place. He started the Chase with a fifth-place finish at Chicago, followed by a fourth-place finish at New Hampshire. At Dover, Johnson led 243 laps and held off [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] over the last 25 laps to win his eighth race at the track, also redeeming himself for the restart line violation that had cost him a shot at winning the June race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2013/09/29/Jimmie-Johnson-wins-record-eighth-victory-at-Dover|title=Jimmie Johnson wins record eighth victory at Dover|work=[[Hendrick Motorsports]]|date=September 29, 2013|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJohnson spent the next several races chasing [[Matt Kenseth]] for the points lead, eventually gaining it at Talladega, though losing it when he and Kenseth tied for points lead at Martinsville. Returning to Texas, Johnson had the dominant car, leading 255 laps to his sixth win of the season. The following weekend at Phoenix, Johnson avoided trouble in tight racing on two separate occasions (a near scrape in turn 4 on the first lap, and later a near spin after contact with [[Carl Edwards]] in turn 1) to escape with a third-place finish. He also capitalized on Kenseth suffering from a poor-handling car. With Kenseth finishing 23rd, Johnson took a 28-point lead to the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. In the finale, Johnson raced conservatively to a ninth-place finish to secure his sixth title. He closed out the season with six wins, three poles, 16 top five and 24 top ten finishes, with an average finish of 9.8 and average start of 10.7.\n\n====2014====\nStatistically, 2014 was one of Johnson's worst seasons to date. He started the season on an up-and-down note, but went winless through the first 11 races of the 2014 season (his best finish was 2nd at Martinsville). Skepticism began to arise, as he had never gone more than 12 races into a season without a win, and hadn't gone that long since the first few years of his Cup career. However, Johnson won the Coca-Cola 600, his first win in the race since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/10984179/jimmie-johnson-wins-coca-cola-600-first-victory-season|title=Jimmie Johnson wins Coca-Cola 600|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=May 26, 2014|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> Afterward, he went on to win at Dover the following week, making it the 13th time he had back-to-back wins.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/06/01/jimmie-johnson-wins-dover-race-fedex-400-nascar-sprint-cup/9844103/|title=Jimmie Johnson makes it nine wins at Dover|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=June 1, 2014|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, Johnson recorded his first win at Michigan, after several years of being deprived of a shot at victory as the result of running out of gas or blowing an engine. However, he didn't keep up with the momentum. After finishing in the top ten at Sonoma and Kentucky, Johnson was collected in an early wreck in the Coke Zero 400, finishing 42nd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/motorracing/os-nascar-daytona-coke-notes-0707-20140706,0,343580.story|title=Jimmie Johnson falls from No. 2 in NASCAR Cup Series points standings.|access-date=July 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714224048/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/motorracing/os-nascar-daytona-coke-notes-0707-20140706,0,343580.story|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Johnson's streak of misfortune continued the next several weeks, finishing 42nd for the second week in a row at New Hampshire. This was followed up by an inconsistent run at Indy (14th), and poor showings resulting from accidents at Pocono (39th) and Watkins Glen (28th). Despite the poor finishes, Johnson qualified fourth for the Chase.\n\nIn the Chase, Johnson finished 12th at Chicagoland, fifth at New Hampshire, and third at Dover to advance to the Contender Round. However, trouble struck when he finished 40th and 17th in the next two races.\n\nAt Talladega, Johnson started second and led a high of 84 laps. However, a 24th-place finish kept him from advancing to the Eliminator Round. At Martinsville, Johnson started seventh but finished 39th after being involved in a crash early in the race. Returning to Texas, Johnson dominated and held off [[Brad Keselowski]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] to score his third straight win in the fall Texas race, and also ended an 18-race-winless-streak. At Phoenix, he struggled for most of the day and finished 38th after blowing a tire and crashing out. At the season finale at Homestead, Johnson finished ninth, and closed out finishing 11th in points. This marks the first time in Johnson's NASCAR Cup career that he has finished outside of the top ten in the final points.\n\n====2015====\n[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|right|Johnson leading the [[2015 Daytona 500]].]]\nJohnson began his season with a win in the [[Budweiser Duel]]. He started the season by finishing fifth in the [[2015 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] for the second year in a row. The following week, he won the [[2015 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500|Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500]] at Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/content/nascar/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/3/1/nascar-sprint-cup-series-atlanta-motor-speedway-race-recap.html|title=Johnson survives for soggy Atlanta win|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAt Las Vegas, Johnson crashed twice into the outside wall, leaving him with a 41st-place finish. He rebounded with an 11th-place finish in Phoenix and a ninth-place finish at California, his first top ten there in two years. At Martinsville, he struggled to a 35th-place finish. However, his momentum returned at Texas when he held off [[Kevin Harvick]] and [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] to win. At Bristol, he avoided tight trouble early in the race and came home second to polesitter [[Matt Kenseth]]. At Richmond, he finished third. These finishes moved him back up to fourth in the standings. At Talladega, Johnson started fifth and led 50 laps, only to finish second to Earnhardt, Jr.\n\nAt Kansas, Johnson gambled by staying out on the last round of pit stops, and held off Harvick and Earnhardt again to win his third race at Kansas and of the season. In winning, he established a Cup record of 23 wins on 1.5-mile tracks, taking what was both his 200th top five and his 300th top ten finish.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bonkowski|first1=Jerry|title=Jimmie Johnson leads Hendrick onslaught, holds off Kevin Harvick to win at Kansas|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/10/jimmie-johnson-leads-hendrick-onslaught-holds-off-harvick-to-win-at-kansas/|website=NASCAR Talk|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=May 10, 2015|date=May 10, 2015}}</ref> At Charlotte, he spun out on two occasions. The first time was early in the race while running 16th coming out of turn 4 but he was lucky to avoid hitting anything. He wasn't so lucky on the second spin late in the race; while running fifth, he spun out again at exactly the same place, and hit the wall in pit road, causing some nose damage. Those spin-outs would leave him with a 40th-place finish. He rebounded the following week with a [[2015 FedEx 400|win at Dover]], and also became one of four drivers to have won 10 or more races at one track. This gave him a total of 74 career wins, two fewer than [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s 76.\n\nAt Pocono, Johnson cut a tire on lap 88, but did not take major damage. He was able to work his way through the field to finish in third place. He finished 19th at Michigan after the race was called for rain on lap 138. At Sonoma, Johnson led the most laps at 45 laps, but a late race caution caused by [[Casey Mears]]' broken wheel axle cost him, and he was passed by [[Kyle Busch]] with five laps to go, and slipped back to sixth place.\n[[File:TSM350 - 2015 - Jimmie Johnson 2 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Johnson during [[2015 Toyota/Save Mart 350]] qualifying]]\nReturning to Daytona, Johnson started 12th and led 35 laps before finishing second to [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], in a repeat of the Talladega race. At Kentucky, Johnson started sixth and ran inside the top ten for most of the night, finishing ninth. At the second stop in Pocono, Johnson, along with two of his Hendrick teammates, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr, took advantage of several cars running out of fuel to finish in the Top 6 (Gordon finished 3rd, Dale Jr. took 4th, Johnson grabbed 6th). At Watkins Glen, despite suffering two penalties (lap 3: Overshooting the entrance to the inner loop, and caution No. 1 (lap 26-28): Speeding through pit road) Johnson rallied to finish 10th. He wasn't so lucky at Michigan, late in the race, he got loose and spun in turn 3, and damaged the splitter on his car, resulting in a 39th-place finish (10 laps down). He rebounded at Bristol by finishing 4th, but had bad luck once more at Darlington. He spun out on lap 134 in turn 4, bringing out the 7th caution, and was never a real threat. He ended up 19th. He was able to recover a bit for a 9th-place finish at Richmond, and started 1st in the Chase in a three-way tie between him, Kyle Busch, and Matt Kenseth.\n\nJohnson opened up the Chase in a rough way. At Chicagoland, he blew a left front tire early in the race, but was able to charge through the field to salvage an 11th-place finish. He also was the subject of controversy when he made contact with [[Kevin Harvick]] on a three-wide pass that led to Harvick cutting a left rear tire, leaving Harvick with a 42nd-place finish.\n\nAt Loudon, Johnson finished 6th after blowing a tire in the 3rd position. At Dover, his Chase hopes came to an end when his car broke a drive line, leading him to finish 36 laps down in 41st place. At the fall race at Texas Johnson won, passing Brad Keselowski with 4 laps to go. This marked his fourth consecutive win in the fall race, and third consecutive win on that track, having also won the spring race. That victory also marked the 75th of his NASCAR Cup Series career, putting him one race win short of tying Dale Earnhardt's career wins. Also in the process, he snapped a 20-race-winless-streak.\n\nJohnson finished 5th at Phoenix, and for the third year in a row, he finished 9th at Homestead. Also in the process, he edged out Ryan Newman by 1 point to finish 10th in the final standings. With the retirement of his teammate and mentor, Jeff Gordon, Johnson assumed the active wins record with 75.\n\n====2016: The seventh title====\nJohnson began the 2016 season with a 16th-place finish at the [[2016 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]]. In the next race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, he won his 1st race of the season and the 76th of his career, tying [[Dale Earnhardt]] for seventh on the all-time wins list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2620556-jimmie-johnson-ties-earnhardt-victory-mark-as-nascar-returns-to-normal|title=Johnson Ties Earnhardt Victory Mark as NASCAR Returns to Normal|last=Dutton|first=Monte|date=February 29, 2016|website=Bleacher Report|access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> Johnson finished third and eleventh in the next two events of the season at Las Vegas and Phoenix.

At Richmond, he led 44 laps early in the race and finished 3rd. At [[2016 GEICO 500|Talladega]], Johnson was spun by [[Paul Menard]] and got involved in a multi-car accident with 28 laps to go, finishing 22nd. Johnson's streak of misfortune continued through the next several months, crashing out at [[2016 AAA 400 Drive for Autism|Dover]], [[2016 Axalta \"We Paint Winners\" 400|Pocono]], [[2016 Coke Zero 400|Daytona]], Kentucky and at Watkins Glen, where he finished last for the first time in his career. His top-10 finishes during the period came only in the [[2016 Coca-Cola 600|Coca-Cola 600]] and [[2016 Brickyard 400|Brickyard 400]], where he finished 3rd in both races. Johnson finished 7th and 6th at Bristol and Michigan the following two weeks, but finished 33rd at Darlington after he spun out of turn 4. Johnson then finished 11th at Richmond. He qualified 8th for the Chase.\n\nJohnson began the [[NASCAR Chase for the Championship|Chase for the Championship]] by leading a race-high 118 laps at Chicagoland, but received a speeding penalty during a green flag pit stop late in the race, ultimately finished 12th. Johnson finished 8th the following week at Loudon. At [[2016 Citizen Soldier 400|Dover]], Johnson led 90 laps but once again received a pit road penalty with 105 laps to go, costing him a win. He would charge through the field and finish 7th (1st car a lap down). He was able to move to the \"Round of 12\" of the Chase.\n\nAt Charlotte, Johnson led a race-high 155 laps and won the [[2016 Bank of America 500|Bank of America 500]], claiming his 8th win at the track and the 3rd win of the season, also snapping his 24-race winless streak. This marked Johnson's first appearance in the \"Round of 8\" under the current Chase system. He then finished 4th at Kansas and 23rd at [[2016 Hellmann's 500|Talladega]]. At Martinsville, Johnson had contact with [[Denny Hamlin]] on lap 198 and had a tire rub to cause a caution but was able to stay on the lead lap. Later during a caution on lap 362, he lost fuel pressure but was able to get the car refired and stayed on the lead lap again. After the restart, he took the lead from Hamlin and led the final 92 laps to win the [[2016 Goody's Fast Relief 500|Goody's Fast Relief 500]]. This locked him into the Championship 4 for the final race at Homestead. Johnson finished 11th in the rain-shortened race at [[2016 AAA Texas 500|Texas]], and 38th at [[2016 Can-Am 500|Phoenix]] after being penalized a lap for passing the pace car coming down to pit road and involved in a wreck on a restart.\n\n{{Wikinews|Jimmie Johnson wins seventh NASCAR Cup Series championship}}\nJohnson claimed his seventh championship by winning at [[2016 Ford EcoBoost 400|Homestead]] on November 20. After losing his starting spot due to a pre-race inspection fault, Johnson started at the rear of the field. He progressed though the field, cracking the top 10 quickly, but remained stagnant around 5th place for a majority of the race. On a restart with 10 laps to go, [[Carl Edwards]] came across the nose of Joey Logano, hit the inside wall and triggered a massive wreck, ending Edwards' championship hopes. Johnson avoided the accident, and was put into position to win the title. On the final restart, he passed [[Kyle Larson]], winning the race and his seventh championship, tying [[Richard Petty]] and [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the most all-time of championships.\n\n====2017====\nJohnson came into 2017 as the defending Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion. The start of the season didn't go as smoothly as the end of last season, however. Through the first six races of the season, Johnson only scored one top ten finish. He rebounded with back to back wins at the [[2017 O'Reilly Auto Parts 500]] in Texas and the [[2017 Food City 500]] at Bristol. This would be the 14th time he has won back-to-back races in his career. Johnson then finished just outside the top ten at Richmond, even after colliding with his teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr earlier in the race. Johnson scored his third win of the season at Dover in June after beating [[Kyle Larson]] in an overtime finish. This was Johnson's 11th win at Dover and 83rd career win, which tied him with [[Cale Yarborough]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wackerlin|first=Jeff|title=Monster Milestone Win for Johnson|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2017/06/Jimmie-Johnson-Wins-AAA-400-Drive-For-Autism-for-83rd-Career-Win.aspx|website=MRN.com|publisher=[[Motor Racing Network]]|accessdate=June 4, 2017|date=June 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607143356/http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2017/06/Jimmie-Johnson-Wins-AAA-400-Drive-For-Autism-for-83rd-Career-Win.aspx|archive-date=June 7, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rest of the season didn't go smoothly for Johnson. On June 11, 2017, during the [[2017 Axalta presents the Pocono 400|Axalta presents the Pocono 400]], Johnson's brakes failed causing him and [[Jamie McMurray]] to crash hard, causing McMurray's car to burst into flames. Johnson was uninjured in the accident.  Johnson suffered a big slump during the summer part of the season, only getting 3 Top 10 finishes, no Top 5 finishes, and 3 DNF's from [[2017 Quaker State 400|Kentucky]], [[2017 Brantley Gilbert Big Machine Brickyard 400|Indianapolis]], and [[2017 Overton's 400|Pocono]]. Regardless, Johnson was able to make the playoffs from the earlier wins. Johnson was one of the favorites to win the title after making through the first round with an 8th-place finish at Chicago, a 14th-place finish at New Hampshire, and a 3rd-place finish, at Dover. In the second round, Johnson finished with a 7th-place finish at Charlotte, but the next week he was involved in [[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]] at Talladega finishing 24th after his car was disqualified for violating the NASCAR Damaged Vehicle Policy in which his crew worked on the car during the red flag. At Kansas in the elimination race, Johnson was entering as the spot to advance with a 7-point advantage but advanced after finishing 6th and getting 5 points in Stage 1 and staying out before the end of Stage 2 and finishing 10th, getting 1 stage point, and even though he spun a few times, he got by a big wreck involving Chase Drivers [[Matt Kenseth]] and [[Jamie McMurray]] and finished the race in 11th place, advancing to the Round of 8. Unfortunately his performance slipped in the third round. He finished 12th at Martinsville, but had tire problems at Texas which slipped him to finish 27th and had a chance to win at Phoenix but blew a tire just one lap before the end of Stage 2 which put him in the garage and ended his day and he was eliminated in the round of 8. Johnson would go on to finish 10th in the final standings.\n\n====2018====\n[[File:Jimmie Johnson Richmond 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's 2018 car at [[Richmond Raceway]]]]\nJohnson's [[Speedweeks]] did not go smoothly, wrecking in each of his three races. At the [[2018 Advance Auto Parts Clash|Advance Auto Parts Clash]], he was wrecked on the last lap by [[Kyle Larson]]; this was the seventh year in a row he failed to finish the Clash. Johnson qualified third for the [[2018 Daytona 500]], but had to go to a backup car after wrecking in his [[2018 Can-Am Duels|Duel]]. On lap 59 of the Daytona 500, he got caught up in a wreck started by [[Ryan Blaney]], and [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]], which also involved his teammate [[William Byron (racing driver)|William Byron]], [[Erik Jones]], [[Daniel Su\u00e1rez]], [[Trevor Bayne]], and [[Ty Dillon]] and ended up 38th. Since then, Johnson struggled throughout the 2018 season with only two top-fives and eight top-10 finishes by the time he barely made the Playoffs for the 15th season in a row. Johnson's only great run off the season came at the [[2018 Bank of America Roval 400|Charlotte Roval race]] where he ran in the Top 10 for most of the day and battled [[Martin Truex Jr.]] for the win on the final lap, but he locked his brakes on turn 17 and spun out of control, taking Truex out with him in the process while Blaney passed them to win the race. Johnson finished eighth, and as a result of a three-way tie with 0 points, he was eliminated in the Round of 16. Johnson would go on to score only one more top-ten finish afterwards and wound up a then career-worst 14th in the final point standings since running full-time in 2002, winless for the first time in his illustrious career along with equaling a career-low 11 top-ten finishes for the second season in a row.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, Lowe's announced they would no longer sponsor the 48 car at the conclusion of the 2018 season. In October, it was announced that Johnson and his long time crew chief [[Chad Knaus]] would part ways at the end of the season, ending a 17-year partnership, the longest in NASCAR history. Johnson will be paired with [[JR Motorsports]] crew chief [[Kevin Meendering]] in the 2019 season. On October 28, 2018, Hendrick Motorsports announced that [[Ally Financial]] signed a two-year deal to sponsor the No. 48 team starting in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/jimmie-johnson-sponsor-ally-financial-lowes/3204616/|title=Jimmie Johnson finds new sponsor in Ally Financial for 2019 season | last=Utter | first=Jim | work=Motorsport.com | date=October 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2018, Johnson participated in a motorsports cultural exchange with two-time [[Formula One]] champion [[Fernando Alonso]] at [[Bahrain International Circuit]], where both drivers compared their respective race cars.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2018/11/26/jimmie-johnson-fernando-alonso-ride-swap-bahrain/ |title=Championship swap: Jimmie Johnson, Fernando Alonso turn laps together |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=[[NASCAR|NASCAR Digital Media LLC.]] |date=November 26, 2018 |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alonso-swaps-seats-with-nascar-racer-jimmie-johnson.10JBhEOUi6AOWeAgWCcEUQ.html |title=Alonso swaps seats with NASCAR racer Jimmie Johnson |website=FormulaOne.com |publisher=[[Formula One|Formula One World Championship Limited]]/[[Tata Communications]] |date=November 26, 2018 |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====2019====\n[[File:Jimmie Johnson 48 Sonoma 2019.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson racing during the [[2019 Toyota/Save Mart 350]]]]\nThe [[2019 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|2019 season]] started on a positive note for Johnson, as he won the [[2019 Advance Auto Parts Clash]] after contact between him and [[Paul Menard]] sent Menard spinning while battling for the lead and triggering \"[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]\" on lap 55 right before the rain arrived.  It was also the first race with new sponsor [[Ally Financial]] and crew chief [[Kevin Meendering]].  He followed it up by finishing 8th in the first duel race.  In the Daytona 500, Johnson ran up front most of the race, but when he came to pit road with around 40 to go, [[B. J.
