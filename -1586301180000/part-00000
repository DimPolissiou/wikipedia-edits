Youtube.  Youtube, 15 Nov. 2011. Web 26 May 2013.</ref> Narco culture is dynamic in that there are various regional differences within Mexico and among those who participate in it.\n\n==Origin==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}The origins of narco culture, like drug trafficking, had humble beginnings in Mexico. Narco culture emerged from the practice of drug trafficking in the highlands of Badiraguato, Sinaloa. It is in the sierra or countryside where an identity of drug trafficking was created and then consolidated once it crossed into the urban sphere. Narcoculture has been defined as a code of conduct and lifestyle for those that participate in the \"narco world.\"<ref name=\"OvalleMarroquin\" />\n\nMany scholars, like Luis Astorga and Jorge Alan Sanchez Godoy explain that there is no evidence that would suggest that [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] or [[opium]] were consumed in Mexico prior to the arrival of the Spanish and the Chinese {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Although indigenous communities in Mexico consumed hallucinogenic mushrooms and [[Peyote#History|Peyote]] in their religious practices it was not until the arrival of the Spanish that cannabis was introduced to Mexico.\nDrug trafficking in Mexico has been considered by Luis Astorga, to have originated with the Chinese immigration to Sinaloa. It is said {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that the Chinese immigrants brought [[poppy seeds]] with them when they arrived in Mexico to work in the railroads and mines.\nSanchez Godoy explains that after cannabis was brought to Mexico, it was used for medical purposes and poppy plants were used for decoration and served as inspiration for several Mexican [[corridos]] or ballads.\n\n== Drug production in Mexico ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe US effectively banned all [[Psychoactive drug]]s when the federal government passed in 1914 the Harrison Act, prohibiting all non-medicinal use of opium, morphine, and cocaine. In 1919 The National Prohibition Act made alcoholic beverages illegal and The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 outlawed marijuana.<ref name=\"isreview.org\">{{cite web|url=http://isreview.org/issue/90/political-economy-mexicos-drug-war|title=The political economy of Mexico's drug war - International Socialist Review|website=isreview.org|access-date=2016-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218202935/http://isreview.org/issue/90/political-economy-mexicos-drug-war|archive-date=2016-12-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMexico\u2019s proximity to the US made it an easy source and American bootleggers and traffickers rushed to obtain illicit narcotics and alcohol. Exports of Mexican opium, heroin, and marijuana for US consumption steadily increased as a result of Prohibition.<ref name=\"isreview.org\"/>\n\nThe [[black market]] grew quickly, with millions of Americans requiring a huge supply of alcohol, heroin, marijuana and cocaine. The initial shortage caused a boost in drug prices, and these new super-profits attracted black market suppliers to fill the vacuum.<ref name=\"isreview.org\"/>\n\n=== Expulsion of Chinese producers ===\n\nDuring the early 1920s, the Chinese in Sinaloa were victims of segregation, hate crimes, and forceful deportation. In 1927, to cooperate with its northern neighbour Mexican President [[Plutarco Elias Calles]], by federal mandate, ordered the expulsion of the Chinese poppy producers.<ref name=\"SanchezGodoy\" />\n\n=== US morphine demand ===\nOnce the Chinese were expelled from Sinaloa, the production of narcotics was then controlled by the rural Mexican farmers. The narcotics production in Mexico was still small,{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} but the demand for [[morphine]] in the United States created by the disruption in its morphine supply from Europe during the World Wars led to the temporary legalization of narcotics in Mexico.\n\n===Mexican production and the birth of narcoculture ===\nScholars like Sanchez Godoy and Luis Astorga {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} state that narcotics were temporarily legalized in Sinaloa in order to supply the United States' demand during the world war. \nThe period when the production of narcotics was temporarily legalized, shaped and created the drug trafficking identity in the region. This is when narcoculture first begins to appear. It is also the period when Mexico entered the large-scale production of narcotics.\n\n== The rise of the Mexican drug cartels and the consolidation of narcoculture ==\n\nThe 1950s in Mexico were marked by the term \"''narcotr\u00e1fico''\" (narco traffic) that began to appear in the media. During the 1940s through 1970s drug trafficking in Mexico was considered to be a \"small family business\" with a relatively simple organization and division of labor.<ref name=\"SanchezGodoy\" /> It is not until after the 1970s with the growth of demand from the United States and alliances with Colombian drug traffickers that cartels in Mexico were formed to control the production and distribution of narcotics. Mexico then became a producer and distributor.\n\nIn previous decades, Mexico served as the route of entrance for the cocaine arriving to the United States from Colombia. With Mexico supplying the United States with heroin and morphine during World War II, it became a producer. The alliance between Mexican cartels and Colombian cartels meant that Mexico was now a distributor and producer. As drug trafficking expanded in Mexico, so did narcoculture. Narcoculture expanded into the urban sector of society and began the process of legitimization and moved away from a subculture into a part of the dominant culture.\n\n=== Coining the term narcoculture ===\nThe term \"narcoculture\" was first coined in the 1970s. Narcoculture defines the way of life and ideas of drug traffickers. Its existence depends on the acceptance of drug traffickers and drug trafficking, becoming a transnational network of production, transportation, and commercialization of illegal drugs.\n\nDrug trafficking has political, economic, ideological, and cultural implications. Drug traffickers interact with the rest of society and as this daily interaction progresses, some of the drug traffickers' mannerisms are adopted by society and this leads to cultural change and legitimization. The drug traffickers' way of life or narcoculture becomes legitimate in the society. Some aspects are adopted by those outside of drug trafficking, and over time people forget that what they have adopted is narcoculture. Narcoculture begins a process of legitimization when it begins to include the popular classes in the urban cities.\n\n=== Rise of the Mexican Mafiosos ===\nNarcoculture in Sinaloa shares many characteristics with Mediterranean culture and mafias in that it is said that the Sinaloa narcoculture is based on honor, bravery, family loyalty, protection, vengeance, generosity, hospitality, nobility, and prestige much like the Mediterranean mafias. Drug traffickers use \"claves\" (codes) to maintain a level of secrecy. Some of these codes, however, have been revealed in ''narcocorridos'' (Mexican ballads about drug trafficking) and are then used by people who listen to this music, even if they are not drug traffickers. This is when narcoculture becomes a part of the mainstream discourse.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, narcoculture and drug trafficking in Sinaloa were almost exclusively rural. The stigma that was placed on narcotics early on meant that people in the cities were reluctant to accept it as a legitimate activity. In the countryside of Sinaloa, people were starving and drug trafficking seemed like the only viable solution. The rural population saw themselves a part of the marginalized society with no real access to education or other methods of social upward mobility. They felt ignored by the government and by society. Drug trafficking then became a source of income and an outlet to rebel against the government that had forgotten them in the countryside.\n\n=== Mafioso Poseurs and modern narcoculture  ===\nNarcoculture is a type of crime-related subculture that emerges in places where traffickers or other mafias have great power, and in consequence great cultural influence.\nBecause of that influence their lives and exploits are often glamorised by the mass media and they are looked up to as role models by some young people.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=25064542|title=Review|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=159\u2013163|last1=Nakano|first1=Koichi|year=2005|doi=10.1353/jjs.2005.0020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ccja-acjp.ca/en/cjcr300/cjcr348.html|title=Book Review - Criminal Identities and Consumer Culture: Crime, Exclusion and the New Culture of Narcissism - CCJA|publisher=|access-date=2014-10-17|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141017024417/https://www.ccja-acjp.ca/en/cjcr300/cjcr348.html|archive-date=2014-10-17|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.infocollections.org/ukedu/en/d/Ji0005e/5.html|title=The Culture of Violence: 4.

Indeed, many of the participants in narcoculture are young people who come from marginalized sectors of society. The admiration that youth have for narcos is  similar to the way other kids look up to rock stars or sports legends. In some cases, the admiration that they feel for the drug traffickers, who they see as heroes, does lead them to get involved in drug trafficking. But in most cases they merely consume the narco culture and imagine that they are part of the narco world, or becoming \"narco-[[poseur]]s\".\n\nNarcoculture has created a fantasy where some people believe that drug trafficking is the only way to escape poverty. This fantasy is supported primarily through music (''[[narcocorridos]]'') and visual media, including television and film. \nSome believe that narcoculture originated in the highlands of Sinaloa, where many of the famous drug lords were born, such as the [[Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel|Beltran Leyva brothers]], [[Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo]] \"Don Neto\", [[Rafael Caro Quintero]], and [[Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno]] \"El Azul\".\nNarcoculture is rooted in the northern rural areas of Mexico and although it is constantly changing, it continues to foster and strengthen its rural roots over time.<ref name=\"SanchezGodoy\" />\n\n=== Narcoculture lifestyle ===\n\nNarcoculture glorifies the individual and his achievements, wealth, and masculinity.<ref name=\"RockwellNatalia\">Rockwell, Natalia Mendoza.

The clothing is gender-conscious, where men and women wear distinct fashion items pertaining to their gender. In most Mexican cities, there are men wearing ''[[piteado]]'' belts, cowboy boots made of exotic animal skin, silk shirts and cowboy hats or baseball caps; thus, some narcos have cast aside the cowboy or Northern style to wear expensive designer clothes.\n\nCertain clothing items, such as Ralph Lauren Polo shirts or Ed Hardy style clothing, were worn by several infamous drug traffickers at the moment of their capture, becoming highly fashionable items among the masses, prompting the creation of imitation styles sold on the black market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217060036/http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionDigital/Ediciones/20110613/PDFS/General_20.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=17 December 2014|website=archive.org|access-date=5 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528015605/http://web.archive.org/web/20141217060036/http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionDigital/Ediciones/20110613/PDFS/General_20.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nStyles vary in many border towns, but it is very common to see drug traffickers wearing luxury brand labels such as Burberry or Gucci hats, shirts, belts and shoes. Women associated with drug cartels often dress very ostentatiously and wear lots of jewelry, and it is common to see them wear such brands as Bebe, Guess, Burberry, Gucci and Coach.\n\nBesides wearing expensive brands, the drug lords run their own bars, which are visited mostly by men.

In other parts of Mexico the acceptance of narcoculture has been a slow process. Narco ''corridos'', however, have helped narcoculture become more acceptable in places where interactions with drug traffickers do not take place on a daily basis.<ref name=\"OvalleMarroquin\">Ovalle Marroquin, Lilian P. \"Las Fronteras de la 'narcocultura.' \" 2007. Digital file.</ref>\n\nThe Mexican ''corrido'', a song narrating stories real or imagined about historical characters, became popular during the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The ''corrido'' became popular because it narrated news and events to a largely illiterate population. The ''corrido'' also created popular heroes and celebrated their lives and adventures. [[Pancho Villa]], revolutionary leader, was one of the figures celebrated through this corridos.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\">Galdamez Martinez,  Efren, Garcia Abarca, Sarai, Gonzalez Flores Mariela, Perez Camacho, Humberto, and Trejo Salazar,  Elisa. \"Los narcocorridos como forma de expression en Mexico:  Los del Norte.\" Slideshare.net.  n.d.  Web. 22 May 2013.</ref>\n\nAlthough these ''corridos''  mention kidnappings, assassination, executions, battles and disasters, they differ from the current ''narco-corridos'' in that the original ''corridos'' attempted to tell a story and give a moral message (like the fall and redemption, the sin and punishment, or life and death of a person ).\n\nThe first ''narco-corridos'' began to appear in the 1970s. Most scholars agree that the [[Tigres del Norte]] were the pioneers of this genre, first appearing in the southern United States, then becoming  popular in Sinaloa, Sonora, Tijuana and Michoac\u00e1n.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" />\n\n''Narcocorridos'' glorify and romanticize narco trafficking, and in a more recent trend of hyper-violent lyrics ( called ''[[Narcocorrido#Movimiento alterado|Movimiento alterado]]'', Spanish for the ''cocaine-[[alertness]] movement''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/region/Movimiento-alterado-narco-sale-closet_0_276572792.html|title=Movimiento alterado: cuando el narco 'sale del cl\u00f3set'|author=Milenio Digital|work=Milenio|access-date=2015-05-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424133814/http://www.milenio.com/region/Movimiento-alterado-narco-sale-closet_0_276572792.html|archive-date=2015-04-24|url-status=live}}</ref> they started to express the pride of modern narcos have in murdering, torturing and dismembering their rivals. The traditional ''corridos'' spoke about the benevolent bandit who committed crimes for a good cause (in a robin-hood style).  Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, and Rafael Caro Quintero among others, have been elevated to popular heroes in a similar way as the traditional corrido elevated the so-called benevolent bandits [[Heraclio Bernal]] and Jesus Malverde during the Mexican Revolution.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" /> The ''corridos'' about these characters praised the bravery of these bandits and identified them as defenders of the poor against an unjust government.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" />\n\nIn addition to narrating the stories of well-known drug lords, ''narcocorridos'' demonstrate the evolution of drug trafficking in Mexico. The ''narcocorridos'' display a yearning for the countryside while expressing a desire for the modernity that the city has to offer. The austerity and simplicity of the countryside is reflected through images of horses, the ranch, agriculture, poverty, and the sombrero. The modernity of the city and material desires are expressed through images of mansions, luxury cars, cell phones,  and designer clothing.<ref name=\"GaxiolaGraciela\">Gaxiola, Graciela. \" 'Chinola kid,' narrativa desde la frontera.\" El Debate 21 May 2013. Online.</ref> Despite the poverty that exists in rural areas, the narco corridos idealize it as a place where there is no judgment or obstacles that would impede drug trafficking.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" />\n\n==== Narco Hip-Hop ====\n\nA music scene, similar to the early underground [[gangsta-rap]] scene of the mid to late 1990s, has emerged in northeastern Mexico ([[Nuevo Leon]], [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Coahuila]]), where the musical phenomenon of hip-hop is being co-opted by the influence of organized crime and the [[Mexican Drug War|drug war]] in the region. With lyrics similar to those of a [[narcocorrido]] (drug ballad), has appeared the [[Latin hip hop#Narco-Rap|Mexican Narco-rap]].\n\nHowever, unlike the corridos, which relate to rural regions of the Mexican Pacific (and which are generally linked to the [[Sinaloa cartel]]) the narco-rap emerged in the urban area of Tamaulipas, in the border with [[Texas]], a turf currently under armed dispute between [[the Zetas]] and the [[Gulf Cartel]].\n\nDerived from the constant presence of \"halcones\" (\"hawks\", cartel spies) and cartel-convoys circulating the streets of the region, young people have been involved in the local narcoculture, and narco-raps express the reality of life on the streets, of those cities under the drug cartels rule.\n\nThere are several notable cases, among them is a highly popular song called {{YouTube|Pfrp8_JkABo|''The Song of Metro 3''}} that praises the life and exploits of drug lord [[Samuel Flores Borrego]] (alias Metro 3) for his \"ferocity and loyalty.\" <ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=d9VvdwvVpxwC&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=samuel+flores+borrego&source=bl&ots=QI_7ZVyNCK&sig=TMP3VIN-0FH9xkF_HK4Dyx2P-y8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TZ0gULvpI4bA2gWz2YCoCw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=samuel%20flores%20borrego&f=false To Die in Mexico: Dispatches from Inside the Drug War</ref>\n\nSome of the main exponents of the genre are [[Cartel De Santa]],  [[Samuel Flores Borrego#Narco-Rap legacy|Cano y Blunt]], DemenT and Big Los.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/es_mx/read/en-tamaulipas-los-narcos-disparan-a-ritmo-de-rap-0000156-v5n4|title=En Tamaulipas los narcos disparan a ritmo de rap|work=VICE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/06/23/hfr-el-narco-rap-la-banda-sonora-del-horror-en-reynosa|title=El narco-rap, la banda sonora del horror en Reynosa|date=23 June 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131031413/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/06/23/hfr-el-narco-rap-la-banda-sonora-del-horror-en-reynosa|archivedate=31 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://diario.mx/El_Paso/2013-06-16_0ee2cdd6/se-suman-los-raperos-norteamericanos-a-la-ola-narco/|title=Se suman los raperos norteamericanos a la 'ola narco'|author=Luis Chaparro<br>El Diario de El Paso|date=16 June 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevoheraldo.com/el_valle/noticias_locales/mcallen-reynosa-la-maldosa/article_b3e9d5da-e8e4-11e2-b83d-0019bb30f31a.html|title=McALLEN: 'Reynosa la Maldosa'|work=El Nuevo Heraldo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2013/06/us-rappers-dedicate-their-songs-to.html|title=Borderland Beat: US Rappers Dedicate Their Songs to Mexican Drug Lords|author=Chivis|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/mexicos-narco-rappers-are-here-to-stay-cano-blunt-interview-reynosa|title=Mexico's Narco Rappers Are Here to Stay|work=VICE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuestraaparenterendicion.com/index.php/biblioteca/cronicas-y-reportajes/item/962-voy-a-morir-porque-creen-que-soy-un-zeta|title=Voy a morir porque creen que soy un Zeta|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThis trend of narco-Mexico-related hip-hop has also an [[United States|American]] counterpart, artists such as the rapper [[Uncle Murda]], [[Skrillex]], [[YG (rapper)|YG]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[2 Chainz]] and [[The Game (rapper)|Jayceon \"The Game\" Taylor]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/12/world/americas/mexico-el-chapo-profile/|title=The legend of 'El Chapo': Hiding in plain sight?|first1=Catherine E.|last1=Shoichet|first2=Don|last2=Melvin|first3=Mariano|last3=Castillo|website=CNN|access-date=2018-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913135832/http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/12/world/americas/mexico-el-chapo-profile/|archive-date=2017-09-13|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/es_mx/blog/the-game-acaba-de-lanzar-una-cancin-dedicada-al-chapo|title=The Game y Skrillex acaban de lanzar una canci\u00f3n dedicada al Chapo|date=23 September 2015|website=vice.com|access-date=21 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085426/http://noisey.vice.com/es_mx/blog/the-game-acaba-de-lanzar-una-cancin-dedicada-al-chapo|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espectaculos.televisa.com/musica/noticias/865919/chapo-joaquin-guzman-loera-tambien-tiene-hip-hop-corridos/|title=Televisa Espect\u00e1culos secci\u00f3n de M\u00fasica|website=Espect\u00e1culos Producci\u00f3n|access-date=2018-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054527/http://espectaculos.televisa.com/musica/noticias/865919/chapo-joaquin-guzman-loera-tambien-tiene-hip-hop-corridos/|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref>have made songs dedicated Drug traffickers such as \"El Chapo Guzm\u00e1n\".\n\n=== Narco juniors ===\n\n\"Narco juniors\" are a new form of narcocultural expression.

Unlike their fathers or grandfathers, the narco juniors have for the most part been raised in urban wealth. The older narco traffickers were raised in rural poverty, placed a high value on family and felt connected to their people and culture. They felt a responsibility to give back to their community. The narco juniors share a cynical pride in being drug traffickers. The narco juniors place more value on spending money, parties, and luxury.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" /> The marginalized people who were helped by the older traffickers, have now become the victims of the narco juniors' aggression.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" />\n\n=== Narco religion ===\n\nNarco-superstition and religion is a major aspect of narcoculture. It is a form of [[superstition]], depicted through drug traffickers' devotion to St. [[St. Jude|Jude Thaddaeus]] (patron of lost causes and desperate situations) and [[Jesus Malverde]]. Jesus Malverde was said to be a bandit that stole from the rich to give to the poor. He lived his life running from the authorities. His image was appropriated as the patron saint of drug traffickers, the poor, and the marginalized. An altar with his name was erected in the place where it is said that he was hanged by the government.\n\nAnother aspect of narco religion is the involvement of drug traffickers with their local churches. This occurs primarily through narco limosnas (narco-donations) that drug traffickers give to the church.{{fact|date=January 2019}} Drug traffickers have also used the church to launder money. Nora Perez-Rayon Elizundia gives an example of a bishop in Aguascalientes that admitted to taking donations from a drug trafficker because he said that the money could  be \"purified\" when used for good causes.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn other parts of Mexico some drug traffickers and their hitmen pray for protection to the [[Santa Muerte|Holy Death]], a personification of death, and in some cases they practice [[Santer\u00eda]] or [[devil worship]]ing. These type of activities are not mainstream narco-behaviors, but do occur in some remote areas.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Narco propaganda ===\nNarco propaganda includes narco mantas, banners that appear in public places, such as highway overpasses and bridges. This is a way for narcos to communicate directly to the populace. These banners are also used to threaten leaders or other members of rival cartels.\nVariations of these banners include the narco poster, a message left next to a dead body, and the narco-pinta, graffiti sprayed or hand-painted on a whitewashed brick or adobe wall next to a commercial building or house.<ref name=\"Campbell, Howard\">Campbell, Howard. \"Narco-Propaganda in the Mexican 'Drug War' An Anthropological Perspective.\" (2014): Sage Journals.

In a recent interview Hilario states that the narco western is the modern version of a western.<ref name=\"GaxiolaGraciela\" /> Instead of a horse, his character drives a truck and instead of fighting Apaches, his character must defeat criminals and the federal police in the state of Sinaloa.\n\n=== Narco cinema===\nSee: [[Mexploitation#Mexican narcocinema]]\n\nNarco cinema in Mexico started as a combination of ''[[telenovela]]s'' (soap operas) and Mexican cinema during the 1960s, where the 'golden age' of cinema collapsed due to the interest of the population in television.<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\">Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos '[http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/en/e-misferica-82/gutierrez Narco and Cinema: The War Over Public Debate in Mexico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119025246/http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/en/e-misferica-82/gutierrez |date=2014-11-19 }}', In E-MISFERICA 8.2 #Narcomachine, 2011.</ref> During the 1970s, narco cinema consisted of movies released mostly for home entertainment or 'video home', creating a B-film market that focused on very controversial topics, that with use of violence would try to create a national reality or identity. These films were mostly made with a low budget, usually under 140,000 Mexican pesos (US$10,000), telling stories about police, drug dealers and prostitutes. These films are rarely discussed in mainstream media because of their low budgets, and connection with   pop culture and low brow entertainment.<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\" />\n\nNarco cinema today controls the Mexican film market, being influential along the border between the United States and Mexico. The films deal with the identity of the narco, consisting of a struggle of an anti-hero being immersed in a border culture, articulating narratives of life, death, love, loss, hope, greed, desire, humor and violence, alongside addiction, repetition and compulsion.<ref name=\"Benavides, O. Hugo.\">Benavides, O. Hugo. Drugs, Thugs, and Divas: Telenovelas and Narco Dramas in Latin America. Austin, TX, USA: University of Texas Press, 2008.</ref>\n\nNarco cinema develops anti-norms and expresses feelings discouraged in culturally accepted institutions.<ref name=\"Benavides, O. Hugo.\" /> In this genre violence is at its most extreme, weapons and thug-like behavior taking center stage. The use of stereotyped characters and predictable plots alienates those looking for subtexts, complex story lines, and sophisticated writing, but for the poor rural people, these films are in demand because they tell the story of their lives and the lives around them.<ref name=\"Benavides, O. Hugo.\" />\n\nNarco violence is also used by mainstream films, taking inspiration from real life events that marked the country, or in other cases fictionalized events,<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\" /> example: [[Breaking Bad]].\n\nSome examples of mainstream narco cinema include ''[[Miss Bala (2011 film)|Miss Bala]]'', ''[[El Infierno]]'' and ''[[Heli (film)|Heli]]''.\n\n''Miss Bala'', a 2011 film directed by Gerardo Naranjo, that premiered in Cannes and got attention from critics, became a box office success in Mexico. Based on real life events, it tells the story of a young woman dreaming of becoming a beauty pageant queen. Narcos manipulate her to work for them, in exchange for her victory.<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\" />\n\n''El Infierno'' is a film directed by Luis Estrada. Compared to ''Miss Bala'', this film is more fictionalized and makes use of dark humor, developing empathy for the anti-hero, glorifying the drug bosses.<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\" />\n\n''Heli'', by Mexican director Amat Escalante, is one of the most representative films of narco cinema. The director said he tried not to focus the movie around explicit violence, which is expected of drug related movies. Yet one scene from the movie was considered the most brutal in Mexican cinema, showing traffickers burning the genitals of two young men in front of a group of children. Escalante refers to this as exposition, in that it shows how Mexico's youth is being ruined by these kind of people, at times leaving them without anything to look forward to in the future. The film focuses on love, family and hope, people wanting to believe they can succeed. This hope is conveyed through the eyes of Estela, a girl who falls in love with an older boy who involves her and her family in the drug world. Overall, Heli tries to eliminate the stereotypical figure of the Mexican cowboy or ''ranchero'', where the male figure is depicted by wearing boots and a hat. Instead the film shows atrocities committed by traffickers without offering any real solutions.<ref name=\"Molina, Javier.\">Molina, Javier. \"Mexican Cinema Brings Narco-terror to the Screen.\" ''El Pa\u00eds'', 6 August 2013.

Youtube.  Youtube, 15 Nov. 2011. Web 26 May 2013.</ref> Narco culture is dynamic in that there are various regional differences within Mexico and among those who participate in it.\n\n==Origin==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}The origins of narco culture, like drug trafficking, had humble beginnings in Mexico. Narco culture emerged from the practice of drug trafficking in the highlands of Badiraguato, Sinaloa. It is in the sierra or countryside where an identity of drug trafficking was created and then consolidated once it crossed into the urban sphere. Narcoculture has been defined as a code of conduct and lifestyle for those that participate in the \"narco world.\"<ref name=\"OvalleMarroquin\" />\n\nMany scholars, like Luis Astorga and Jorge Alan Sanchez Godoy explain that there is no evidence that would suggest that [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] or [[opium]] were consumed in Mexico prior to the arrival of the Spanish and the Chinese {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Although indigenous communities in Mexico consumed hallucinogenic mushrooms and [[Peyote#History|Peyote]] in their religious practices it was not until the arrival of the Spanish that cannabis was introduced to Mexico.\nDrug trafficking in Mexico has been considered by Luis Astorga, to have originated with the Chinese immigration to Sinaloa. It is said {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that the Chinese immigrants brought [[poppy seeds]] with them when they arrived in Mexico to work in the railroads and mines.\nSanchez Godoy explains that after cannabis was brought to Mexico, it was used for medical purposes and poppy plants were used for decoration and served as inspiration for several Mexican [[corridos]] or ballads.\n\n== Drug production in Mexico ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe US effectively banned all [[Psychoactive drug]]s when the federal government passed in 1914 the Harrison Act, prohibiting all non-medicinal use of opium, morphine, and cocaine. In 1919 The National Prohibition Act made alcoholic beverages illegal and The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 outlawed marijuana.<ref name=\"isreview.org\">{{cite web|url=http://isreview.org/issue/90/political-economy-mexicos-drug-war|title=The political economy of Mexico's drug war - International Socialist Review|website=isreview.org|access-date=2016-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218202935/http://isreview.org/issue/90/political-economy-mexicos-drug-war|archive-date=2016-12-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMexico\u2019s proximity to the US made it an easy source and American bootleggers and traffickers rushed to obtain illicit narcotics and alcohol. Exports of Mexican opium, heroin, and marijuana for US consumption steadily increased as a result of Prohibition.<ref name=\"isreview.org\"/>\n\nThe [[black market]] grew quickly, with millions of Americans requiring a huge supply of alcohol, heroin, marijuana and cocaine. The initial shortage caused a boost in drug prices, and these new super-profits attracted black market suppliers to fill the vacuum.<ref name=\"isreview.org\"/>\n\n=== Expulsion of Chinese producers ===\n\nDuring the early 1920s, the Chinese in Sinaloa were victims of segregation, hate crimes, and forceful deportation. In 1927, to cooperate with its northern neighbour Mexican President [[Plutarco Elias Calles]], by federal mandate, ordered the expulsion of the Chinese poppy producers.<ref name=\"SanchezGodoy\" />\n\n=== US morphine demand ===\nOnce the Chinese were expelled from Sinaloa, the production of narcotics was then controlled by the rural Mexican farmers. The narcotics production in Mexico was still small,{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} but the demand for [[morphine]] in the United States created by the disruption in its morphine supply from Europe during the World Wars led to the temporary legalization of narcotics in Mexico.\n\n===Mexican production and the birth of narcoculture ===\nScholars like Sanchez Godoy and Luis Astorga {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} state that narcotics were temporarily legalized in Sinaloa in order to supply the United States' demand during the world war. \nThe period when the production of narcotics was temporarily legalized, shaped and created the drug trafficking identity in the region. This is when narcoculture first begins to appear. It is also the period when Mexico entered the large-scale production of narcotics.\n\n== The rise of the Mexican drug cartels and the consolidation of narcoculture ==\n\nThe 1950s in Mexico were marked by the term \"''narcotr\u00e1fico''\" (narco traffic) that began to appear in the media. During the 1940s through 1970s drug trafficking in Mexico was considered to be a \"small family business\" with a relatively simple organization and division of labor.<ref name=\"SanchezGodoy\" /> It is not until after the 1970s with the growth of demand from the United States and alliances with Colombian drug traffickers that cartels in Mexico were formed to control the production and distribution of narcotics. Mexico then became a producer and distributor.\n\nIn previous decades, Mexico served as the route of entrance for the cocaine arriving to the United States from Colombia. With Mexico supplying the United States with heroin and morphine during World War II, it became a producer. The alliance between Mexican cartels and Colombian cartels meant that Mexico was now a distributor and producer. As drug trafficking expanded in Mexico, so did narcoculture. Narcoculture expanded into the urban sector of society and began the process of legitimization and moved away from a subculture into a part of the dominant culture.\n\n=== Coining the term narcoculture ===\nThe term \"narcoculture\" was first coined in the 1970s. Narcoculture defines the way of life and ideas of drug traffickers. Its existence depends on the acceptance of drug traffickers and drug trafficking, becoming a transnational network of production, transportation, and commercialization of illegal drugs.\n\nDrug trafficking has political, economic, ideological, and cultural implications. Drug traffickers interact with the rest of society and as this daily interaction progresses, some of the drug traffickers' mannerisms are adopted by society and this leads to cultural change and legitimization. The drug traffickers' way of life or narcoculture becomes legitimate in the society. Some aspects are adopted by those outside of drug trafficking, and over time people forget that what they have adopted is narcoculture. Narcoculture begins a process of legitimization when it begins to include the popular classes in the urban cities.\n\n=== Rise of the Mexican Mafiosos ===\nNarcoculture in Sinaloa shares many characteristics with Mediterranean culture and mafias in that it is said that the Sinaloa narcoculture is based on honor, bravery, family loyalty, protection, vengeance, generosity, hospitality, nobility, and prestige much like the Mediterranean mafias. Drug traffickers use \"claves\" (codes) to maintain a level of secrecy. Some of these codes, however, have been revealed in ''narcocorridos'' (Mexican ballads about drug trafficking) and are then used by people who listen to this music, even if they are not drug traffickers. This is when narcoculture becomes a part of the mainstream discourse.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, narcoculture and drug trafficking in Sinaloa were almost exclusively rural. The stigma that was placed on narcotics early on meant that people in the cities were reluctant to accept it as a legitimate activity. In the countryside of Sinaloa, people were starving and drug trafficking seemed like the only viable solution. The rural population saw themselves a part of the marginalized society with no real access to education or other methods of social upward mobility. They felt ignored by the government and by society. Drug trafficking then became a source of income and an outlet to rebel against the government that had forgotten them in the countryside.\n\n=== Mafioso Poseurs and modern narcoculture  ===\nNarcoculture is a type of crime-related subculture that emerges in places where traffickers or other mafias have great power, and in consequence great cultural influence.\nBecause of that influence their lives and exploits are often glamorised by the mass media and they are looked up to as role models by some young people.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=25064542|title=Review|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=159\u2013163|last1=Nakano|first1=Koichi|year=2005|doi=10.1353/jjs.2005.0020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ccja-acjp.ca/en/cjcr300/cjcr348.html|title=Book Review - Criminal Identities and Consumer Culture: Crime, Exclusion and the New Culture of Narcissism - CCJA|publisher=|access-date=2014-10-17|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141017024417/https://www.ccja-acjp.ca/en/cjcr300/cjcr348.html|archive-date=2014-10-17|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.infocollections.org/ukedu/en/d/Ji0005e/5.html|title=The Culture of Violence: 4.

Indeed, many of the participants in narcoculture are young people who come from marginalized sectors of society. The admiration that youth have for narcos is  similar to the way other kids look up to rock stars or sports legends. In some cases, the admiration that they feel for the drug traffickers, who they see as heroes, does lead them to get involved in drug trafficking. But in most cases they merely consume the narco culture and imagine that they are part of the narco world, or becoming \"narco-[[poseur]]s\".\n\nNarcoculture has created a fantasy where some people believe that drug trafficking is the only way to escape poverty. This fantasy is supported primarily through music (''[[narcocorridos]]'') and visual media, including television and film. \nSome believe that narcoculture originated in the highlands of Sinaloa, where many of the famous drug lords were born, such as the [[Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel|Beltran Leyva brothers]], [[Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo]] \"Don Neto\", [[Rafael Caro Quintero]], and [[Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno]] \"El Azul\".\nNarcoculture is rooted in the northern rural areas of Mexico and although it is constantly changing, it continues to foster and strengthen its rural roots over time.<ref name=\"SanchezGodoy\" />\n\n=== Narcoculture lifestyle ===\n\nNarcoculture glorifies the individual and his achievements, wealth, and masculinity.<ref name=\"RockwellNatalia\">Rockwell, Natalia Mendoza.

The clothing is gender-conscious, where men and women wear distinct fashion items pertaining to their gender. In most Mexican cities, there are men wearing ''[[piteado]]'' belts, cowboy boots made of exotic animal skin, silk shirts and cowboy hats or baseball caps; thus, some narcos have cast aside the cowboy or Northern style to wear expensive designer clothes.\n\nCertain clothing items, such as Ralph Lauren Polo shirts or Ed Hardy style clothing, were worn by several infamous drug traffickers at the moment of their capture, becoming highly fashionable items among the masses, prompting the creation of imitation styles sold on the black market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217060036/http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionDigital/Ediciones/20110613/PDFS/General_20.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=17 December 2014|website=archive.org|access-date=5 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528015605/http://web.archive.org/web/20141217060036/http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionDigital/Ediciones/20110613/PDFS/General_20.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nStyles vary in many border towns, but it is very common to see drug traffickers wearing luxury brand labels such as Burberry or Gucci hats, shirts, belts and shoes. Women associated with drug cartels often dress very ostentatiously and wear lots of jewelry, and it is common to see them wear such brands as Bebe, Guess, Burberry, Gucci and Coach.\n\nBesides wearing expensive brands, the drug lords run their own bars, which are visited mostly by men.

In other parts of Mexico the acceptance of narcoculture has been a slow process. Narco ''corridos'', however, have helped narcoculture become more acceptable in places where interactions with drug traffickers do not take place on a daily basis.<ref name=\"OvalleMarroquin\">Ovalle Marroquin, Lilian P. \"Las Fronteras de la 'narcocultura.' \" 2007. Digital file.</ref>\n\nThe Mexican ''corrido'', a song narrating stories real or imagined about historical characters, became popular during the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The ''corrido'' became popular because it narrated news and events to a largely illiterate population. The ''corrido'' also created popular heroes and celebrated their lives and adventures. [[Pancho Villa]], revolutionary leader, was one of the figures celebrated through this corridos.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\">Galdamez Martinez,  Efren, Garcia Abarca, Sarai, Gonzalez Flores Mariela, Perez Camacho, Humberto, and Trejo Salazar,  Elisa. \"Los narcocorridos como forma de expression en Mexico:  Los del Norte.\" Slideshare.net.  n.d.  Web. 22 May 2013.</ref>\n\nAlthough these ''corridos''  mention kidnappings, assassination, executions, battles and disasters, they differ from the current ''narco-corridos'' in that the original ''corridos'' attempted to tell a story and give a moral message (like the fall and redemption, the sin and punishment, or life and death of a person ).\n\nThe first ''narco-corridos'' began to appear in the 1970s. Most scholars agree that the [[Tigres del Norte]] were the pioneers of this genre, first appearing in the southern United States, then becoming  popular in Sinaloa, Sonora, Tijuana and Michoac\u00e1n.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" />\n\n''Narcocorridos'' glorify and romanticize narco trafficking, and in a more recent trend of hyper-violent lyrics ( called ''[[Narcocorrido#Movimiento alterado|Movimiento alterado]]'', Spanish for the ''cocaine-[[alertness]] movement''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/region/Movimiento-alterado-narco-sale-closet_0_276572792.html|title=Movimiento alterado: cuando el narco 'sale del cl\u00f3set'|author=Milenio Digital|work=Milenio|access-date=2015-05-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424133814/http://www.milenio.com/region/Movimiento-alterado-narco-sale-closet_0_276572792.html|archive-date=2015-04-24|url-status=live}}</ref> they started to express the pride of modern narcos have in murdering, torturing and dismembering their rivals. The traditional ''corridos'' spoke about the benevolent bandit who committed crimes for a good cause (in a robin-hood style).  Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, and Rafael Caro Quintero among others, have been elevated to popular heroes in a similar way as the traditional corrido elevated the so-called benevolent bandits [[Heraclio Bernal]] and Jesus Malverde during the Mexican Revolution.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" /> The ''corridos'' about these characters praised the bravery of these bandits and identified them as defenders of the poor against an unjust government.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" />\n\nIn addition to narrating the stories of well-known drug lords, ''narcocorridos'' demonstrate the evolution of drug trafficking in Mexico. The ''narcocorridos'' display a yearning for the countryside while expressing a desire for the modernity that the city has to offer. The austerity and simplicity of the countryside is reflected through images of horses, the ranch, agriculture, poverty, and the sombrero. The modernity of the city and material desires are expressed through images of mansions, luxury cars, cell phones,  and designer clothing.<ref name=\"GaxiolaGraciela\">Gaxiola, Graciela. \" 'Chinola kid,' narrativa desde la frontera.\" El Debate 21 May 2013. Online.</ref> Despite the poverty that exists in rural areas, the narco corridos idealize it as a place where there is no judgment or obstacles that would impede drug trafficking.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" />\n\n==== Narco Hip-Hop ====\n\nA music scene, similar to the early underground [[gangsta-rap]] scene of the Mid to Late 90's, has emerged in northeastern Mexico ([[Nuevo Leon]], [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Coahuila]]), where the musical phenomenon of hip-hop is being co-opted by the influence of organized crime and the [[Mexican Drug War|drug war]] in the region. With lyrics similar to those of a [[narcocorrido]] (drug ballad), has appeared the [[Latin hip hop#Narco-Rap|Mexican Narco-rap]].\n\nHowever, unlike the corridos, which relate to rural regions of the Mexican Pacific (and which are generally linked to the [[Sinaloa cartel]]) the narco-rap emerged in the urban area of Tamaulipas, in the border with [[Texas]], a turf currently under armed dispute between [[the Zetas]] and the [[Gulf Cartel]].\n\nDerived from the constant presence of \"halcones\" (\"hawks\", cartel spies) and cartel-convoys circulating the streets of the region, young people have been involved in the local narcoculture, and narco-raps express the reality of life on the streets, of those cities under the drug cartels rule.\n\nThere are several notable cases, among them is a highly popular song called {{YouTube|Pfrp8_JkABo|''The Song of Metro 3''}} that praises the life and exploits of drug lord [[Samuel Flores Borrego]] (alias Metro 3) for his \"ferocity and loyalty.\" <ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=d9VvdwvVpxwC&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=samuel+flores+borrego&source=bl&ots=QI_7ZVyNCK&sig=TMP3VIN-0FH9xkF_HK4Dyx2P-y8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TZ0gULvpI4bA2gWz2YCoCw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=samuel%20flores%20borrego&f=false To Die in Mexico: Dispatches from Inside the Drug War</ref>\n\nSome of the main exponents of the genre are [[Cartel De Santa]],  [[Samuel Flores Borrego#Narco-Rap legacy|Cano y Blunt]], DemenT and Big Los.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/es_mx/read/en-tamaulipas-los-narcos-disparan-a-ritmo-de-rap-0000156-v5n4|title=En Tamaulipas los narcos disparan a ritmo de rap|work=VICE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/06/23/hfr-el-narco-rap-la-banda-sonora-del-horror-en-reynosa|title=El narco-rap, la banda sonora del horror en Reynosa|date=23 June 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131031413/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/06/23/hfr-el-narco-rap-la-banda-sonora-del-horror-en-reynosa|archivedate=31 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://diario.mx/El_Paso/2013-06-16_0ee2cdd6/se-suman-los-raperos-norteamericanos-a-la-ola-narco/|title=Se suman los raperos norteamericanos a la 'ola narco'|author=Luis Chaparro<br>El Diario de El Paso|date=16 June 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevoheraldo.com/el_valle/noticias_locales/mcallen-reynosa-la-maldosa/article_b3e9d5da-e8e4-11e2-b83d-0019bb30f31a.html|title=McALLEN: 'Reynosa la Maldosa'|work=El Nuevo Heraldo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2013/06/us-rappers-dedicate-their-songs-to.html|title=Borderland Beat: US Rappers Dedicate Their Songs to Mexican Drug Lords|author=Chivis|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/mexicos-narco-rappers-are-here-to-stay-cano-blunt-interview-reynosa|title=Mexico's Narco Rappers Are Here to Stay|work=VICE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuestraaparenterendicion.com/index.php/biblioteca/cronicas-y-reportajes/item/962-voy-a-morir-porque-creen-que-soy-un-zeta|title=Voy a morir porque creen que soy un Zeta|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThis trend of narco-Mexico-related hip-hop has also an [[United States|American]] counterpart, artists such as the rapper [[Uncle Murda]], [[Skrillex]], [[YG (rapper)|YG]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[2 Chainz]] and [[The Game (rapper)|Jayceon \"The Game\" Taylor]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/12/world/americas/mexico-el-chapo-profile/|title=The legend of 'El Chapo': Hiding in plain sight?|first1=Catherine E.|last1=Shoichet|first2=Don|last2=Melvin|first3=Mariano|last3=Castillo|website=CNN|access-date=2018-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913135832/http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/12/world/americas/mexico-el-chapo-profile/|archive-date=2017-09-13|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/es_mx/blog/the-game-acaba-de-lanzar-una-cancin-dedicada-al-chapo|title=The Game y Skrillex acaban de lanzar una canci\u00f3n dedicada al Chapo|date=23 September 2015|website=vice.com|access-date=21 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085426/http://noisey.vice.com/es_mx/blog/the-game-acaba-de-lanzar-una-cancin-dedicada-al-chapo|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espectaculos.televisa.com/musica/noticias/865919/chapo-joaquin-guzman-loera-tambien-tiene-hip-hop-corridos/|title=Televisa Espect\u00e1culos secci\u00f3n de M\u00fasica|website=Espect\u00e1culos Producci\u00f3n|access-date=2018-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054527/http://espectaculos.televisa.com/musica/noticias/865919/chapo-joaquin-guzman-loera-tambien-tiene-hip-hop-corridos/|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref>have made songs dedicated Drug traffickers such as \"El Chapo Guzm\u00e1n\".\n\n=== Narco juniors ===\n\n\"Narco juniors\" are a new form of narcocultural expression.

Unlike their fathers or grandfathers, the narco juniors have for the most part been raised in urban wealth. The older narco traffickers were raised in rural poverty, placed a high value on family and felt connected to their people and culture. They felt a responsibility to give back to their community. The narco juniors share a cynical pride in being drug traffickers. The narco juniors place more value on spending money, parties, and luxury.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" /> The marginalized people who were helped by the older traffickers, have now become the victims of the narco juniors' aggression.<ref name=\"GaldamezMartinez\" />\n\n=== Narco religion ===\n\nNarco-superstition and religion is a major aspect of narcoculture. It is a form of [[superstition]], depicted through drug traffickers' devotion to St. [[St. Jude|Jude Thaddaeus]] (patron of lost causes and desperate situations) and [[Jesus Malverde]]. Jesus Malverde was said to be a bandit that stole from the rich to give to the poor. He lived his life running from the authorities. His image was appropriated as the patron saint of drug traffickers, the poor, and the marginalized. An altar with his name was erected in the place where it is said that he was hanged by the government.\n\nAnother aspect of narco religion is the involvement of drug traffickers with their local churches. This occurs primarily through narco limosnas (narco-donations) that drug traffickers give to the church.{{fact|date=January 2019}} Drug traffickers have also used the church to launder money. Nora Perez-Rayon Elizundia gives an example of a bishop in Aguascalientes that admitted to taking donations from a drug trafficker because he said that the money could  be \"purified\" when used for good causes.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn other parts of Mexico some drug traffickers and their hitmen pray for protection to the [[Santa Muerte|Holy Death]], a personification of death, and in some cases they practice [[Santer\u00eda]] or [[devil worship]]ing. These type of activities are not mainstream narco-behaviors, but do occur in some remote areas.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Narco propaganda ===\nNarco propaganda includes narco mantas, banners that appear in public places, such as highway overpasses and bridges. This is a way for narcos to communicate directly to the populace. These banners are also used to threaten leaders or other members of rival cartels.\nVariations of these banners include the narco poster, a message left next to a dead body, and the narco-pinta, graffiti sprayed or hand-painted on a whitewashed brick or adobe wall next to a commercial building or house.<ref name=\"Campbell, Howard\">Campbell, Howard. \"Narco-Propaganda in the Mexican 'Drug War' An Anthropological Perspective.\" (2014): Sage Journals.

Sometimes they exaggerate  the legacy of these people, and of  the crimes they have committed, in order to intimidate their enemies or the population in general.<ref name=\"Boothroyd, Dave\">Boothroyd, Dave.

In a recent interview Hilario states that the narco western is the modern version of a western.<ref name=\"GaxiolaGraciela\" /> Instead of a horse, his character drives a truck and instead of fighting Apaches, his character must defeat criminals and the federal police in the state of Sinaloa.\n\n=== Narco cinema===\nSee: [[Mexploitation#Mexican narcocinema]]\n\nNarco cinema in Mexico started as a combination of ''[[telenovela]]s'' (soap operas) and Mexican cinema during the 1960s, where the 'golden age' of cinema collapsed due to the interest of the population in television.<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\">Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos '[http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/en/e-misferica-82/gutierrez Narco and Cinema: The War Over Public Debate in Mexico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119025246/http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/en/e-misferica-82/gutierrez |date=2014-11-19 }}', In E-MISFERICA 8.2 #Narcomachine, 2011.</ref> During the 1970s, narco cinema consisted of movies released mostly for home entertainment or 'video home', creating a B-film market that focused on very controversial topics, that with use of violence would try to create a national reality or identity. These films were mostly made with a low budget, usually under 140,000 Mexican pesos (US$10,000), telling stories about police, drug dealers and prostitutes. These films are rarely discussed in mainstream media because of their low budgets, and connection with   pop culture and low brow entertainment.<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\" />\n\nNarco cinema today controls the Mexican film market, being influential along the border between the United States and Mexico. The films deal with the identity of the narco, consisting of a struggle of an anti-hero being immersed in a border culture, articulating narratives of life, death, love, loss, hope, greed, desire, humor and violence, alongside addiction, repetition and compulsion.<ref name=\"Benavides, O. Hugo.\">Benavides, O. Hugo. Drugs, Thugs, and Divas: Telenovelas and Narco Dramas in Latin America. Austin, TX, USA: University of Texas Press, 2008.</ref>\n\nNarco cinema develops anti-norms and expresses feelings discouraged in culturally accepted institutions.<ref name=\"Benavides, O. Hugo.\" /> In this genre violence is at its most extreme, weapons and thug-like behavior taking center stage. The use of stereotyped characters and predictable plots alienates those looking for subtexts, complex story lines, and sophisticated writing, but for the poor rural people, these films are in demand because they tell the story of their lives and the lives around them.<ref name=\"Benavides, O. Hugo.\" />\n\nNarco violence is also used by mainstream films, taking inspiration from real life events that marked the country, or in other cases fictionalized events,<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\" /> example: [[Breaking Bad]].\n\nSome examples of mainstream narco cinema include ''[[Miss Bala (2011 film)|Miss Bala]]'', ''[[El Infierno]]'' and ''[[Heli (film)|Heli]]''.\n\n''Miss Bala'', a 2011 film directed by Gerardo Naranjo, that premiered in Cannes and got attention from critics, became a box office success in Mexico. Based on real life events, it tells the story of a young woman dreaming of becoming a beauty pageant queen. Narcos manipulate her to work for them, in exchange for her victory.<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\" />\n\n''El Infierno'' is a film directed by Luis Estrada. Compared to ''Miss Bala'', this film is more fictionalized and makes use of dark humor, developing empathy for the anti-hero, glorifying the drug bosses.<ref name=\" Guti\u00e9rrez, Carlos\" />\n\n''Heli'', by Mexican director Amat Escalante, is one of the most representative films of narco cinema. The director said he tried not to focus the movie around explicit violence, which is expected of drug related movies. Yet one scene from the movie was considered the most brutal in Mexican cinema, showing traffickers burning the genitals of two young men in front of a group of children. Escalante refers to this as exposition, in that it shows how Mexico's youth is being ruined by these kind of people, at times leaving them without anything to look forward to in the future. The film focuses on love, family and hope, people wanting to believe they can succeed. This hope is conveyed through the eyes of Estela, a girl who falls in love with an older boy who involves her and her family in the drug world. Overall, Heli tries to eliminate the stereotypical figure of the Mexican cowboy or ''ranchero'', where the male figure is depicted by wearing boots and a hat. Instead the film shows atrocities committed by traffickers without offering any real solutions.<ref name=\"Molina, Javier.\">Molina, Javier. \"Mexican Cinema Brings Narco-terror to the Screen.\" ''El Pa\u00eds'', 6 August 2013.

He was known for his high-pitched screamed vocals and lyrics that either shock, offend, or invoke [[black comedy|morbid humor]]. Throughout his career, Putnam was also involved in numerous side projects.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nPutnam was born on May 15, 1968, in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/71292842 |title=Seth Edward Putnam |website=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> to father Edward R.

In the mid-1980s, Putnam played bass in the [[thrash metal]] band [[Executioner (band)|Executioner]].\n\n===Personality===\nDespite his shock humor and turbulent lifestyle, Putnam was often described by fans and peers as a warm, intelligent, sensitive man. Putnam saw himself as a [[comedian]] and used music as an outlet.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2011/06/28/seth-putnam-remembered/ |title=Seth Putnam Remembered |date=June 28, 2011 |first=Shawn |last=Macomber |magazine=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn school, classmates who knew Putnam described him as intelligent and stern, but unmotivated, apathetic and often an underwhelming student. Putnam skipped a grade in school and became a very bright student, tutoring his classmates. In his own words, Putnam often blamed brutal fights with Catholic school nuns for helping to shape his cynical personality. When he reached high school after eighth grade, he had lost interest in excelling in education or academics, becoming more of a slacker and underachiever.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/467/20831/Seth-Putnam-from-Anal-Cunt-discusses-growing-up.html |title=Seth Putnam from Anal Cunt discusses growing up |date=January 5, 2011 |first=Jason |last=Fisher |website=The Gauntlet |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> By the time he had graduated school, Putnam had left the Catholic religion in which he was raised. After graduation, Putnam showed no interest in attending college or university.\n\nThe 2019 grindcore documentary ''Slave to the Grind'' explores Putnam in detail, with his peers expressing the duality of his nature:<ref name=\"sttg\">{{Citation | title = Slave to the Grind | publisher = Death by Digital| year = 2019 | url = https://reelhouse.org/deathbydigital/slave-to-the-grind/slave-to-the-grind }}</ref> former bandmates Tim Morse and Scott Hull describe Putnam often being personable and relaxed, but Hull also notes that he'd often get arrested causing trouble on the street.<ref name=\"sttg\"/> [[Discordance Axis]] singer Jon Chang notes that he was really close to Putnam for years, but describes him as a \"really disturbed guy\" and a \"backstabbing piece of shit at the end of his life\". Chang also recounted an incident \nafter a show when Putnam introduced his mother to Chang, he remarked that they had met earlier when he pulled Putnam's mother out from the show's [[moshpit]], causing Putnam to become aggressive and threaten Chang, much to the confusion of everyone present.<ref name=\"sttg\"/> \nPutnam was also good friends with [[Pantera]] frontman, [[Phil Anselmo|Philip Anselmo]].\n\n===Drug overdose and coma===\nOn October 12, 2004 Putnam was hospitalized after ingesting a cocktail of [[crack-cocaine]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[heroin]], and two months' worth of [[Ambien]] sleeping pills.<ref name=\"coma\">{{cite news |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/cellars/documents/05023497.asp |title=Coma chameleon - Seth Putnam's near-death experience |first=Carly |last=Carioli |newspaper=[[Boston Phoenix]] |date=October 12, 2004 |accessdate=August 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217193005/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/cellars/documents/05023497.asp |archivedate=December 17, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has been reported that he spent the previous day contemplating suicide,<ref name=\"coma\" /> though exact circumstances surrounding the drug overdose are vague.\n\nAnal Cunt's 1997 album ''I Like It When You Die'' contained the track \"You're in a Coma\". Putnam's reaction to the resulting irony of being in a coma was published in the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'': \"Actually, it turned out it was just as gay as the song I wrote nine years ago \u2013 being in a coma was just as fuckin' stupid as I wrote it was.\"<ref name=\"coma\" /> Anal Cunt kept performing the song during live shows after the coma, with Putnam sharing anecdotes with the audience before the song.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Feud with Chris Barnes===\nThere was friction between Putnam and [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] vocalist [[Chris Barnes (musician)|Chris Barnes]]. According to Putnam's defunct website, Putnam heckled Barnes during a Six Feet Under set, leading to an altercation between the two, ending with Six Feet Under's roadies ganging up on Putnam while Barnes fled to his tour bus and hid there. Putnam released the song \"[[It Just Gets Worse|Chris Barnes Is a Pussy]]\" as retaliation to the incident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wickedsickrecords.com/SP_FAQs.htm |title=Seth Putnam Frequently Asked ?'s |website=Wicked Sick Records |date=April 16, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330181724/http://www.wickedsickrecords.com/SP_FAQs.htm |archivedate=March 30, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> According to Putnam in an interview with Capital Chaos TV several years later, Six Feet Under went out of their way to avoid playing in the same city as Anal Cunt several years after the incident.

That summer, they recorded 4 songs. all of them were old Sickness songs. \"Blinking Blue Lights\" was actually recorded by Kilslug, but never released. The other songs that were done originally by the Sickness never got released either. They made another E.P. called \"Bad Mood\" that had a certain amount of copies pressed but were never officially released. Seth and Lee Suniga (owner of Menace To Sobriety Records) sold them on eBay. Angry Hate did 2 live shows in March and April of 2002.\n\n====Satan's Warriors====\nSatan's Warriors started in February of 1986 after Seth and his friends made up a fake death metal fanzine with fake band names as a joke, Seth eventually admitted to doing it, in April of that year. There was an opening for a band to play live over the radio so Seth got a lineup together and made a four-song demo with him on drums and vocals and his cousin Drew on guitar. Their final show was on July of 1988. They were supposed to get back together in 2003 and re-record some songs written between 1986 and 1988. The lineup was supposed to be with Seth on guitar & vocals, Paulie Kraynak on second guitar, and John Gillis on drums.\n\n====Impaled Northern Moonforest====\nIn early 1997, Seth and Josh Martin came up with the idea of starting a joke black metal band and decided to record a demo, they didn't use actual drums because someone was sleeping in the room next to them so Josh played his acoustic guitar while Seth did vocals and percussion by slapping his leg and a mattress, they did a few shows and sold copies of their first demo, the titles on the demo are different from the ones on the 7\" vinyl release due to Seth and Josh losing their copies of the demo and forgetting the titles.\n\n====Shit Scum====\nShit Scum formed in 1988 after Seth saw an ad looking for musicians, Seth chose to call after seeing Cryptic Slaughter as the only influence because not many people in Boston were into that band. Seth eventually invited Fred Ordonez to see Satan's Warriors (which was their last show), Anal Cunt was also playing what was supposed to be their last show but Fred and his friends never showed up, so Seth did another show with Anal Cunt so Fred could see them, Shit Scum also did their first show on the same day. Seth was eventually invited to a studio to play bass on their first demo called \"Self Mutilation\", they later did a show in 1990, Seth and Fred (without Wayne who was their drummer) went to a studio that college rock bands mainly performed at. The engineer didn't like them and tried convincing them to quit, the record was eventually finished and they ended up owing the studio money so the studio kept the master reel. Anal Cunt did a tour in Germany and did some Shit Scum covers. Matthias Weigand (head of Ecocentric Records) liked the cover of the song \"Shit Scum\" and wanted to put out a 7\". Seth called the studio and asked about the reel, the guy on the phone said \"it's right here, pick it up whenever you want\", not knowing they owed money to the studio. Seth mixed all the songs and sent them to Ecocentric Records. Fred never had a cover for the record so Matthias made one up. The record was eventually called \"Manson Is Jesus\". Fred wanted the record to be called, \"I Wish this Record Could Punch You in the Face\", and have a fist on the cover. Shit Scum had already broken up by the time the album was released.\n\n====Full Blown A.I.D.S.====\nFull Blown A.I.D.S. started in 1997 while he was jamming with his friend and cousin.

He was known for his high-pitched screamed vocals and lyrics that either shock, offend, or invoke [[black comedy|morbid humor]]. Throughout his career, Putnam was also involved in numerous side projects.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nPutnam was born on May 15, 1968, in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/71292842 |title=Seth Edward Putnam |website=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> to father Edward R. Putnam and mother Barbara Ann Donohue. His parents are divorced. Seth was married to his first wife, Alison, from December 1998 through June 2001. He married Julie, his second wife, in 2008. In the mid-1980s, Putnam played bass in the [[thrash metal]] band [[Executioner (band)|Executioner]].\n\n===Personality===\nDespite his shock humor and turbulent lifestyle, Putnam was often described by fans and peers as a warm, intelligent, sensitive man. Putnam saw himself as a [[comedian]] and used music as an outlet.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2011/06/28/seth-putnam-remembered/ |title=Seth Putnam Remembered |date=June 28, 2011 |first=Shawn |last=Macomber |magazine=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn school, classmates who knew Putnam described him as intelligent and stern, but unmotivated, apathetic and often an underwhelming student. Putnam skipped a grade in school and became a very bright student, tutoring his classmates. In his own words, Putnam often blamed brutal fights with Catholic school nuns for helping to shape his cynical personality. When he reached high school after eighth grade, he had lost interest in excelling in education or academics, becoming more of a slacker and underachiever.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/467/20831/Seth-Putnam-from-Anal-Cunt-discusses-growing-up.html |title=Seth Putnam from Anal Cunt discusses growing up |date=January 5, 2011 |first=Jason |last=Fisher |website=The Gauntlet |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> By the time he had graduated school, Putnam had left the Catholic religion in which he was raised. After graduation, Putnam showed no interest in attending college or university.\n\nThe 2019 grindcore documentary ''Slave to the Grind'' explores Putnam in detail, with his peers expressing the duality of his nature:<ref name=\"sttg\">{{Citation | title = Slave to the Grind | publisher = Death by Digital| year = 2019 | url = https://reelhouse.org/deathbydigital/slave-to-the-grind/slave-to-the-grind }}</ref> former bandmates Tim Morse and Scott Hull describe Putnam often being personable and relaxed, but Hull also notes that he'd often get arrested causing trouble on the street.<ref name=\"sttg\"/> [[Discordance Axis]] singer Jon Chang notes that he was really close to Putnam for years, but describes him as a \"really disturbed guy\" and a \"backstabbing piece of shit at the end of his life\". Chang also recounted an incident \nafter a show when Putnam introduced his mother to Chang, he remarked that they had met earlier when he pulled Putnam's mother out from the show's [[moshpit]], causing Putnam to become aggressive and threaten Chang, much to the confusion of everyone present.<ref name=\"sttg\"/> \nPutnam was also good friends with [[Pantera]] frontman, [[Phil Anselmo|Philip Anselmo]].\n\n===Drug overdose and coma===\nOn October 12, 2004 Putnam was hospitalized after ingesting a cocktail of [[crack-cocaine]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[heroin]], and two months' worth of [[Ambien]] sleeping pills.<ref name=\"coma\">{{cite news |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/cellars/documents/05023497.asp |title=Coma chameleon - Seth Putnam's near-death experience |first=Carly |last=Carioli |newspaper=[[Boston Phoenix]] |date=October 12, 2004 |accessdate=August 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217193005/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/cellars/documents/05023497.asp |archivedate=December 17, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has been reported that he spent the previous day contemplating suicide,<ref name=\"coma\" /> though exact circumstances surrounding the drug overdose are vague.\n\nAnal Cunt's 1997 album ''I Like It When You Die'' contained the track \"You're in a Coma\". Putnam's reaction to the resulting irony of being in a coma was published in the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'': \"Actually, it turned out it was just as gay as the song I wrote nine years ago \u2013 being in a coma was just as fuckin' stupid as I wrote it was.\"<ref name=\"coma\" /> Anal Cunt kept performing the song during live shows after the coma, with Putnam sharing anecdotes with the audience before the song.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Feud with Chris Barnes===\nThere was friction between Putnam and [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] vocalist [[Chris Barnes (musician)|Chris Barnes]]. According to Putnam's defunct website, Putnam heckled Barnes during a Six Feet Under set, leading to an altercation between the two, ending with Six Feet Under's roadies ganging up on Putnam while Barnes fled to his tour bus and hid there. Putnam released the song \"[[It Just Gets Worse|Chris Barnes Is a Pussy]]\" as retaliation to the incident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wickedsickrecords.com/SP_FAQs.htm |title=Seth Putnam Frequently Asked ?'s |website=Wicked Sick Records |date=April 16, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330181724/http://www.wickedsickrecords.com/SP_FAQs.htm |archivedate=March 30, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> According to Putnam in an interview with Capital Chaos TV several years later, Six Feet Under went out of their way to avoid playing in the same city as Anal Cunt several years after the incident. Putnam stated \"I guess he (Chris Barnes) is still afraid of me\". Despite the feud, Putnam stated that \"[[Bringer of Blood|Murdered in the Basement]]\" was his favorite song by Six Feet Under.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anal-cunt-s-seth-putnam-chris-barnes-is-a-pussy/ |title=Anal Cunt's Seth Putnam: 'Chris Barnes Is A Pussy' |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=November 4, 2003 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn June 11, 2011, Putnam died of a suspected [[heart attack]] at the age of 43.<ref name=\"BMDead\" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Rosie |last=Swash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/seth-putnam-dies-aged-43 |title=Seth Putnam, the 'GG Allin of grindcore', dies aged 43  |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPutnam's grave is located within Newton Cemetery in Newton, Massachusetts.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Side projects and former bands==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2019}}\n\n====Angry Hate====\nThe idea of the band came up when Seth and Larry Lifeless (Kilslug vocalist) were drunk one night watching [[Jerry Springer]] and Larry said \"That guy looks like he should be in an old punk band called Angry Hate or something\".\nThe first recording was in January ,1999, of Larry hammering a fence against some lady's garage which was put on at the end of the song, \"M.P.\" on the first release. That summer, they recorded 4 songs. all of them were old Sickness songs. \"Blinking Blue Lights\" was actually recorded by Kilslug, but never released. The other songs that were done originally by the Sickness never got released either. They made another E.P. called \"Bad Mood\" that had a certain amount of copies pressed but were never officially released. Seth and Lee Suniga (owner of Menace To Sobriety Records) sold them on eBay. Angry Hate did 2 live shows in March and April of 2002.\n\n====Satan's Warriors====\nSatan's Warriors started in February of 1986 after Seth and his friends made up a fake death metal fanzine with fake band names as a joke, Seth eventually admitted to doing it, in April of that year. There was an opening for a band\nto play live over the radio so Seth got a lineup together and made a 4 song demo with him on drums and vocals and his cousin Drew on guitar. Their final show was on July of 1988. They were supposed to get back together in 2003 and re-record some songs written between 1986 and 1988. The lineup was supposed to be with Seth on guitar & vocals, Paulie Kraynak on second guitar, and John Gillis on drums.\n\n====Impaled Northern Moonforest====\nIn early 1997, Seth and Josh Martin came up with the idea of starting a joke black metal band and decided to record a demo, they didn't use actual drums because someone was sleeping in the room next to them so Josh played his acoustic guitar while Seth did vocals and percussion by slapping his leg and a mattress, they did a few shows and sold copies of their first demo, the titles on the demo are different from the ones on the 7\" vinyl release due to Seth and Josh losing their copies of the demo and forgetting the titles.\n\n====Shit Scum====\nShit Scum formed in 1988 after Seth saw an ad looking for musicians, Seth chose to call after seeing Cryptic Slaughter as the only influence because not many people in Boston were into that band. Seth eventually invited Fred Ordonez to see Satan's Warriors (which was their last show), Anal Cunt was also playing what was supposed to be their last show but Fred and his friends never showed up, so Seth did another show with Anal Cunt so Fred could see them, Shit Scum also did their first show on the same day. Seth was eventually invited to a studio to play bass on their first demo called \"Self Mutilation\", they later did a show in 1990, Seth and Fred (without Wayne who was their drummer) went to a studio that college rock bands mainly performed at. The engineer didn't like them and tried convincing them to quit, the record was eventually finished and they ended up owing the studio money so the studio kept the master reel. Anal Cunt did a tour in Germany and did some Shit Scum covers. Matthias Weigand (head of Ecocentric Records) liked the cover of the song \"Shit Scum\" and wanted to put out a 7\". Seth called the studio and asked about the reel, the guy on the phone said \"it's right here, pick it up whenever you want\", not knowing they owed money to the studio. Seth mixed all the songs and sent them to Ecocentric Records. Fred never had a cover for the record so Matthias made one up. The record was eventually called \"Manson Is Jesus\". Fred wanted the record to be called, \"I Wish this Record Could Punch You in the Face\", and have a fist on the cover. Shit Scum had already broken up by the time the album was released.\n\n====Full Blown A.I.D.S.====\nFull Blown A.I.D.S. started in 1997 while he was jamming with his friend and cousin. In 1998 he wrote some songs and recorded a demo of \"No One Cares\" with Nate Linehan on drums. In 2002 he moved to Texas for a while but eventually moved back to Boston.

In 1979, he obtained the state degree of a (qualified) Teacher of Physics, which is his only formal academic degree. Although he began his studies in the heyday of the student movement's political participation during the government of [[Salvador Allende]], he spent most of his life as a student during the years of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|Chilean military dictatorship]].\n\nBetween 1975 and 1999 he worked as a secondary school teacher of physics in schools and colleges of Santiago.\n\n[[File:Fenomenologia 1.jpg|thumb|left|Carlos P\u00e9rez Soto teaches a class on [[Hegel]]'s ''Phenomenology of Spirit'']]\n\nIn 1984, he began teaching in higher education at the Institute of Arts and Social Sciences, which gathered intellectuals who opposed Pinochet's dictatorship and which in 1991 became the University known until today as [[University of Art and Social Sciences|ARCIS]]. He continued as a university professor, teaching epistemology and philosophy of science in psychology departments, first at the [[Diego Portales University]] and later at the [[University of Chile]]. In the late 1980s he was already well known among students and scholars for his critical approach, his Marxist analysis and concrete policy proposals. In this context, he received invitations to give lectures and conferences at numerous Chilean universities so that the following years were characterized by an intense teaching activity.\n\nIn the last decade he has taught regular courses and elective seminars at the [[University of Chile]] (Faculty of Law),<ref>[http://www.derecho.uchile.cl/pregrado/secretaria-de-estudios/53916/ciencias-del-derecho-curriculum  Academic curriculum at the website of the University of Chile]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |title=On Carlos P\u00e9rez Soto at the web site of the Faculty of Law |access-date=2014-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323045122/http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |archive-date=2014-03-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> at the [[Catholic University of Valparaiso]] (School of Psychology), the [[Andr\u00e9s Bello National University]] (School of Sociology), at [[University of Santiago, Chile|University of Santiago]] (Department of Philosophy), [[Academy of Christian Humanism University]] (Dance School) and at the [[Finis Terrae University]] (School of Theatre).\n\nIn the late 1990s he also started giving some seminars and conferences outside Chile, at the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] on Hegel (1997) and Marxism (1999), as well as in Cali, at the [[University of Valle|Universidad del Valle]] on epistemology and dialectics (1998).<ref>[http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf  Texto de seminario en Cali] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323033746/http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf |date=March 23, 2014 }}, formato PDF</ref>\n\n[[File:Tumba de Hegel.jpg|thumb| P\u00e9rez Soto by Hegel's tomb in [[Berlin]]]]\n\nAt the ARCIS University, where he has focused his academic work, besides teaching in regular courses at the School of Psychology, (Psychological Theories and Systems) and the School of Sociology (Epistemology; Classics of social thought - Marx, Science, Technology and society), Philosophy (Philosophy of Science), Political Science (Theory of power and the state) and Pedagogy of Dance (Dance History), he served as senior researcher at the Center for Social Research as well as Coordinator of Academic Informatics.\n\nAs a Marxist intellectual he has been interviewed with some frequency by the leftist press,<ref>[http://www.puntofinal.cl/676/cambio.php Entrevista en Revista Punto final] diciembre de 2008</ref> mainly because he has made relevant theoretical contributions to the political discussion.

Here the following contributions stand out:\n* The idea that the bureaucracy should be considered a social class in the Marxist sense of the term; \n* the formulation of a Marxist critique of the ruling regime in socialist countries, based on the concept of bureaucracy as a class; \n* conducting a review of the processes of objective bureaucratization occurred in advanced capitalism; \n* the proposal of the reconstruction of Marxist theory based on a materialist reading of Hegel's philosophy.\n\nHis proposals for a new anti-psychiatry are also a political program. They focus on a profound critique of the psychiatric practices, on the need for an unmedicalization and de-privatization of the symptoms, in order to return the problems to the scope of their actual causes, origins and perpetuation: the social sphere. Among other differences with the anti-psychiatry postulates of the twentieth century ( [[Ronald David Laing|Laing]], [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|Cooper]] or [[Franco Basaglia|Basaglia]]), the \"new\" anti-psychiatry that Perez Soto promotes is one that also overcomes the paternalistic aspects of the psychiatric house as a \"shelter\", going beyond the logic of organizing a more humane or better quality psychiatric care, paving the way for an anti-psychiatry which arises from the persons themselves that are affected. Apart from a summary and historical connection of the different moments of critical psychiatry and anti-psychiatry, two specific contributions of Carlos Perez stand out:\n* The development of a critique of the medicalization processes of behavioral disturbances; \n* the proposal of distinctions to criticize the medicalization and commodification of modern medicine.\n\nThe following contributions in the field of art and dance are important: \n* His proposal of a theoretically founded reconstruction of modern dance history in its European tradition and throughout the twentieth century; \n* his proposal of technical style distinctions in contemporary dance; \n* his proposals or theoretical distinctions regarding the political art, political use of art and particular politics of the art guild itself.\n\nWith his second book ''Comentar obras de danza'' (Discussing Works of Dance), he ended his excursion through the history of dance. As he explains, because he wants to return to the core of his developments. \n{{cita|I usually write about Marxism, that's the center of all my thoughts. From there I ventured into epistemology and philosophy of science, critical psychology and anti-psychiatry. From now on I will probably write more about the Hegelian philosophy, to which I have devoted many years of study. Except in the most general subjects of aesthetics and art history, this book marks for me the end of a period, and a farewell.\nP\u00e9rez Soto, C.

In 1979, he obtained the state degree of a (qualified) Teacher of Physics, which is his only formal academic degree. Although he began his studies in the heyday of the student movement's political participation during the government of [[Salvador Allende]], he spent most of his life as a student during the years of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|Chilean military dictatorship]].\n\nBetween 1975 and 1999 he worked as a secondary school teacher of physics in schools and colleges of Santiago.\n\n[[File:Fenomenologia 1.jpg|thumb|left|Carlos P\u00e9rez Soto teaches a class on [[Hegel]]'s ''Phenomenology of Spirit'']]\n\nIn 1984, he began teaching in higher education at the Institute of Arts and Social Sciences, which gathered intellectuals who opposed Pinochet's dictatorship and which in 1991 became the University known until today as [[University of Art and Social Sciences|ARCIS]]. He continued as a university professor, teaching epistemology and philosophy of science in psychology departments, first at the [[Diego Portales University]] and later at the [[University of Chile]]. In the late 80's he was already well known among students and scholars for his critical approach, his Marxist analysis and concrete policy proposals. In this context, he received invitations to give lectures and conferences at numerous Chilean universities so that the following years were characterized by an intense teaching activity.\n\nIn the last decade he has taught regular courses and elective seminars at the [[University of Chile]] (Faculty of Law),<ref>[http://www.derecho.uchile.cl/pregrado/secretaria-de-estudios/53916/ciencias-del-derecho-curriculum  Academic curriculum at the website of the University of Chile]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |title=On Carlos P\u00e9rez Soto at the web site of the Faculty of Law |access-date=2014-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323045122/http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |archive-date=2014-03-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> at the [[Catholic University of Valparaiso]] (School of Psychology), the [[Andr\u00e9s Bello National University]] (School of Sociology), at [[University of Santiago, Chile|University of Santiago]] (Department of Philosophy), [[Academy of Christian Humanism University]] (Dance School) and at the [[Finis Terrae University]] (School of Theatre).\n\nIn the late 90's he also started giving some seminars and conferences outside Chile, at the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] on Hegel (1997) and Marxism (1999), as well as in Cali, at the [[University of Valle|Universidad del Valle]] on epistemology and dialectics (1998).<ref>[http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf  Texto de seminario en Cali] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323033746/http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf |date=March 23, 2014 }}, formato PDF</ref>\n\n[[File:Tumba de Hegel.jpg|thumb| P\u00e9rez Soto by Hegel's tomb in [[Berlin]]]]\n\nAt the ARCIS University, where he has focused his academic work, besides teaching in regular courses at the School of Psychology, (Psychological Theories and Systems) and the School of Sociology (Epistemology; Classics of social thought - Marx, Science, Technology and society), Philosophy (Philosophy of Science), Political Science (Theory of power and the state) and Pedagogy of Dance (Dance History), he served as senior researcher at the Center for Social Research as well as Coordinator of Academic Informatics.\n\nAs a Marxist intellectual he has been interviewed with some frequency by the leftist press,<ref>[http://www.puntofinal.cl/676/cambio.php Entrevista en Revista Punto final] diciembre de 2008</ref> mainly because he has made relevant theoretical contributions to the political discussion.

Here the following contributions stand out:\n* The idea that the bureaucracy should be considered a social class in the Marxist sense of the term; \n* the formulation of a Marxist critique of the ruling regime in socialist countries, based on the concept of bureaucracy as a class; \n* conducting a review of the processes of objective bureaucratization occurred in advanced capitalism; \n* the proposal of the reconstruction of Marxist theory based on a materialist reading of Hegel's philosophy.\n\nHis proposals for a new anti-psychiatry are also a political program. They focus on a profound critique of the psychiatric practices, on the need for an unmedicalization and de-privatization of the symptoms, in order to return the problems to the scope of their actual causes, origins and perpetuation: the social sphere. Among other differences with the anti-psychiatry postulates of the twentieth century ( [[Ronald David Laing|Laing]], [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|Cooper]] or [[Franco Basaglia|Basaglia]]), the \"new\" anti-psychiatry that Perez Soto promotes is one that also overcomes the paternalistic aspects of the psychiatric house as a \"shelter\", going beyond the logic of organizing a more humane or better quality psychiatric care, paving the way for an anti-psychiatry which arises from the persons themselves that are affected. Apart from a summary and historical connection of the different moments of critical psychiatry and anti-psychiatry, two specific contributions of Carlos Perez stand out:\n* The development of a critique of the medicalization processes of behavioral disturbances; \n* the proposal of distinctions to criticize the medicalization and commodification of modern medicine.\n\nThe following contributions in the field of art and dance are important: \n* His proposal of a theoretically founded reconstruction of modern dance history in its European tradition and throughout the twentieth century; \n* his proposal of technical style distinctions in contemporary dance; \n* his proposals or theoretical distinctions regarding the political art, political use of art and particular politics of the art guild itself.\n\nWith his second book ''Comentar obras de danza'' (Discussing Works of Dance), he ended his excursion through the history of dance. As he explains, because he wants to return to the core of his developments. \n{{cita|I usually write about Marxism, that's the center of all my thoughts. From there I ventured into epistemology and philosophy of science, critical psychology and anti-psychiatry. From now on I will probably write more about the Hegelian philosophy, to which I have devoted many years of study. Except in the most general subjects of aesthetics and art history, this book marks for me the end of a period, and a farewell.\nP\u00e9rez Soto, C.
