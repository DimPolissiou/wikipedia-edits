Early Frohman-designed churches include Trinity Episcopal Church in Orange, California in 1909, and other parish churches in Santa Barbara and Inglewood, California between 1909 and 1917.<ref>[[#refFeller1979|Feller 1979]], p.23-24.</ref> \n \nDuring World War I Frohman served in the ordnance construction section of the [[United States Army|Army]] and was stationed in the Washington, D.C. area. Placed in charge of the architectural division at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], he designed buildings there and at [[Rock Island Arsenal]].

During the next two years he formed a partnership with E. Donald Robb and [[Harry B.

Robb died in 1942 and Little followed in 1944, after which Frohman served as the sole architect of the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/>\n\nAlthough adhering to Bodley and Vaughan\u2019s original plan in its essence, Frohman made substantial refinements to the initial blueprint.  His impact on the overall structure has been described by one author on the cathedral: \u201cBodley and Vaughan\u2019s preliminary plans envisioned a predominantly English Gothic structure; under Frohman\u2019s guidance the style became more eclectic, a happy blending of Medieval Gothic from both England and the Continent . . . .

Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than four million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2&nbsp;June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12&nbsp;July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014; match scheduling was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as it was in 2014. Many matches aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history.<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

[[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.<ref name=\"kKxiB\" />\n\nThe voting results were:<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n!rowspan=2|Bidders\n!colspan=2|Votes\n|-\n!Round 1\n!Round 2\n|-\n|'''Russia'''\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|9\n|{{yes|13}}\n|-\n|Portugal / Spain\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|-\n|Belgium / Netherlands\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|-\n|England\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|{{no result|Eliminated}}\n|}\n\n===Host selection criticism===\nThe choice of Russia as host has been challenged. Controversial issues included the level of racism in Russian football,<ref name=\"emKvG\" /><ref name=\"LlUcj\" /><ref name=\"hjJfX\" /> human rights abuses by the Russian government,<ref name=\"hkImm\" /> and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people in wider Russian society.<ref name=\"qKYJ4\" /><ref name=\"rMyFt\" /> Russia's involvement in the [[War in Donbass|ongoing conflict in Ukraine]] had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]].<ref name=\"eGuva\" /><ref name=\"tQHRS\" /> In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".<ref name=\"UeAW8\" />\n\nAllegations of [[corruption]] in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's [[The Football Association|FA]] to boycott the tournament.<ref name=\"mZGjr\" /> They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> FIFA appointed [[Michael J. Garcia]], a US attorney, to investigate and produce [[Garcia Report|a report]] on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-examination of the affair and [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called for a boycott of the World Cup.<ref name=\"zt9ZM\" /><ref name=\"2xMiJ\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in Eckert's independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7&nbsp;June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations\u2014the 209 [[List of FIFA Member Associations|FIFA member associations]] except automatically qualified hosts Russia\u2014applied to enter the qualifying process.<ref name=\"riaYh\" /> [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] were later disqualified before playing their first matches,<ref name=\"zimbabwe\" /><ref name=\"indonesia\" /> while [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], who joined FIFA on 13&nbsp;May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<ref name=\"k8fRX\" /> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.<ref name=\"fifa20150320\" /><ref name=\"hstri\" /> The first qualification game, between [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] and [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]], began in [[Dili]] on 12&nbsp;March 2015 as part of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC's qualification]],<ref name=\"45Ip9\" /><ref name=\"L1urj\" /><ref name=\"crlmz\" /> and the main qualifying draw took place at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace]] in [[Strelna]], [[Saint Petersburg]], on 25&nbsp;July 2015.<ref name=\"lzli9\" /><ref name=\"press release\" />\n\nOf the 32&nbsp;nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20&nbsp;countries competed at the previous tournament in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|smallest country in terms of population]] to reach the World Cup.<ref name=\"oGTMb\" /> Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four [[Arab world|Arab nations]] (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.<ref name=\"vviY2\" />\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, and three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (for the first time since 2002).

the [[International Football Association Board]]'s decision to incorporate [[video assistant referee]]s (VARs) into the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the game]] (LOTG) on

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16&nbsp;June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:Bel-Tun (26).jpg|thumb|{{Center|Exterior of Otkrytie Arena}}{{Center| in Moscow}}]]\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

It hosted its first match on 5&nbsp;September 2014.\n* Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new). Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.<ref name=\"L1mHo\" />\n* Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).

The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian [[Spartakiad]], but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the [[Mamayev Kurgan]] memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3&nbsp;April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"<ref name=\"91I71\" />\n\nFIFA president [[Gianni Infantino]] stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\"<ref name=\"kVyG9\" /> Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever\", as 98% of the stadiums were sold out, there were three billion viewers on TV around the world and seven million fans visited the fan fests.<ref name=\"kl1QG\" />\n\nHowever, the tournament was called a distraction from the international isolation and economic difficulties Russia has been facing.<ref name=\"FhofV\" /><ref name=\"ve3Sg\" /><ref name=\"M6MSu\" />\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights}}\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than four million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2&nbsp;June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12&nbsp;July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014; match scheduling was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as it was in 2014. Many matches aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history.<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"
