Manju misbehaves with the servants every now and then even over petty issues,daily reports of which reaches her father's ears courtesy to the manager([[Panchanan Bhattacharya(actor)]]) of the house.Annoyed by Manju's persistent mischief,her father is determined to marry her off an highly educated guy from an affluent family well known to him, against her daughter's will.\n\nOne day,they headed for a trip to [[Somra]],with the father's intention of the engagement ceremony to be held there . According to his plan,they are joined by Asit(the guy the father has chosen for Manju)on the way which surprises Manju as it was completely suppressed to her. On the way, Asit tries to impress her but his too benevolent gesture and funny mannarisms increasingly annoy Manju,who tricks him and her sleeping father to escape with only a briefcase which has the Bengali letter \"Mo\"(Initial letter of her name) inscribed on it and boards a different train where she accidentally meets Rajat,who is on his way to [[Patna]].She has to seek help from him as she has no ticket and she is pennyless too. Initially reluctant,Rajat finally saves her from humiliation by letting his own ticket to be borrowed by her to show to the checker while he himself pretends to be a passanger without ticket thus deposits the amount including fine.He soon deduces Manju's exact identity from the advertisement for missing in classified columns of multiple newspapers given by her father with detailed description of her and also with the announcement of a prize money of 10000 rupees.In dire need of money,Rajat plots a plan to claim the bounty.He persuades Manju to travel with him by letting her know about his knowledge of her real identity while on the other hand he writes a letter to her anxious father and promises to update him regularly on their whereabouts.\nReaching Patna,they board in an inn owned by a Bengali middle-aged man named Chakrabortymoshai/Chokkottimoshai ([[Tulsi Chakraborty]]).They book a room as a newly wed couple.While Rajat carries on playing his part of 'the husband' very smartly ,it was Manju's awkwardness which instills suspicion in clever Chakraborty's mind who himself also after going through the newspaper deduces the truth.In an attempt to grab the opportunity, Chakraborty together with his wife ([[Rajlakshmi Debi]]) tries to keep the couple on hold while planning to report to the police but his plan is foiled by a surprise arrival of Banku ([[Jiben Bose]]),a frequent customer of the inn who happens to be a friend of Rajat's.Surprised at seeing the newly wed Rajat and mistaking them to have come for honeymoon he invites them to his home which Rajat quickly accepts in order to escape Chakraborty.\n\nIn his house,Banku introduces them to his wife ([[Bharati Debi]]) and his 'mejda'(elder brother),who by fate happens to be a self-proclaimed private investigator .

She thus goes with the arrangements with an expectation of reciprocation from Rajat,whom she has realised to have developed feelings towards her too.She meets Rajat and tells him that she will wait for his 'answer'.Rajat,on the other hand is in a conflict between his duty towards his boss(so far he slyly let him get updated about their whereabouts) as well his need for money and his newly developed crush on Manju.The night is spent pleasantly,and they shared their thoughts in the form of two songs.However Rajat's message was to terminate any possibility of starting a relationship which disheartens Manju.She decides to step back respectfully.Their good time at Banku's house also comes to  an end as the 'mejda' arranges a meeting with her father.Sensing his plan is now at stake Rajat hurriedly leaves with Manju even without any formal see off.He leaves a letter to explain the situation and also revealing the truth to Banku and his wife,who was stunned and Mejda is disappointed.\n\nNext, Rajat and Manju book a guesthouse for the night's stay.

According to folklore, there were many ways people could protect themselves during the days when the ''kallikantzaroi'' were loose. One such method was to leave a [[colander]] on their doorstep to trick the visiting ''kallikantzaros''. It was believed that since it could not count above two \u2013 three was believed to be a holy number, and by pronouncing it, the ''kallikantzaros'' would supposedly kill itself \u2013 the ''kallikantzaros'' would sit at the doorstep all night, counting each hole of the colander, until the sun rose and it was forced to hide.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAnother supposed method of protection from ''kallikantzaroi'' was to leave the fire burning in the fireplace, all night, so that they could not enter through it. In some areas,{{Where|date=November 2014}} people would burn the [[Yule log]] for the duration of the twelve days. In other areas, people would throw foul-smelling shoes into the fire, as the stench was believed to repel the ''kallikantzaroi'' and thus force them to stay away.

It used a wheel scheme similar to that of a telecipher machine, such as the [[Lorenz cipher]] and the [[Geheimfernschreiber]].\n\n==Basic operation==\n[[File:M209B-IMG 0553-black.jpg|thumb]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:M209 Key wheels.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Key wheels, typewheel, and indicating disk from an M-209. Although aligned on the same axle, the key wheels turn independently of the typewheel and indicating disk.]] -->\n\nBasic operation of the M-209 is relatively straightforward. Six adjustable ''key wheels'' on top of the box each display a letter of the [[alphabet]]. These six wheels comprise the external [[key (cryptography)|key]] for the machine, providing an initial state, similar to an [[initialization vector]], for the enciphering process.\n\nTo encipher a message, the operator sets the key wheels to a random sequence of letters. An ''enciphering-deciphering knob'' on the left side of the machine is set to \"encipher\". A dial known as the ''indicator disk'', also on the left side, is turned to the first letter in the message. This letter is encoded by turning a hand crank or ''power handle'' on the right side of the machine; at the end of the cycle, the ciphertext letter is printed onto a paper tape, the key wheels each advance one letter, and the machine is ready for entry of the next character in the message. To indicate spaces between words in the message, the letter \"Z\" is enciphered. Repeating the process for the remainder of the message gives a complete ciphertext, which can then be transmitted using [[Morse code]] or another method. Since the initial key wheel setting is random, it is also necessary to send those settings to the receiving party; these may also be encrypted using a daily key or transmitted in the clear.\n\nPrinted ciphertext is automatically spaced into groups of five by the M-209 for ease of readability. A ''letter counter'' on top of the machine indicated the total number of encoded letters, and could be used as a point of reference if a mistake was made in enciphering or deciphering.\n\nThe deciphering procedure is nearly the same as for enciphering; the operator sets the enciphering-deciphering knob to \"decipher\", and aligns the key wheels to the same sequence as was used in enciphering. The first letter of the ciphertext is entered via the indicator disk, and the power handle is operated, advancing the key wheels and printing the decoded letter on the paper tape. When the letter \"Z\" is encountered, a [[cam]] causes a blank space to appear in the message, thus reconstituting the original message with spaces. Absent \"Z\"s can typically be interpreted by the operator, based on context.\n\nAn experienced M-209 operator might spend two to four seconds enciphering or deciphering each letter.\n\n==Internal elements==\n\n===Overview===\nInside the casing of the M-209, a much more complicated picture emerges. The six key wheels each have a small movable pin aligned with each letter on the wheel. These pins may each be positioned to the left or right; the positioning of these pins affects the operation of the machine. The left position is ''ineffective'', while the right position is ''effective''.\n\n[[File:M209B cypher machine rotors-IMG 0557.jpg|thumbnail|An intermediate gear unit (center) meshes with gears adjoining each key wheel. Visible to the left of the image are the paper tape and typewheel that print out messages and ciphertext.]]\n[[Image:M209 guide arm springs.png|thumbnail|An inactive pin (red) on the bottom of the left key wheel (light blue) pulls the guide arm (green) back. No pin is blocking the right guide arm, so a spring tilts that guide arm forward.]]\n[[File:M209 guide arm touching lug (1).png|thumbnail|The left guide arm is prevented from interacting with the lugs (purple) on the drum (blue), while the right guide arm is in an effective position, and will push to the left any bars with a lug in that position.]]\n\nEach key wheel contains a different number of letters, and a correspondingly different number of pins. From left to right, the wheels have:\n* 26 letters, from A to Z\n* 25 letters, from A to Z, excepting W\n* 23 letters, from A to X, excepting W\n* 21 letters, from A to U\n* 19 letters, from A to S\n* 17 letters, from A to Q\n\nThis discrepancy is chosen to give the wheel sizes a [[coprime]] nature; the end result is that the wheels only align the same way once every 26\u00d725\u00d723\u00d721\u00d719\u00d717 = 101,405,850 enciphered letters (also known as the ''period''). Each key wheel is associated with a slanted metal ''guide arm'' that is activated by any pins in the \"effective\" position. The positions of the pins on each key wheel comprise the first part of the internal keying mechanism of the M-209.\n\nBehind the row of six key wheels is a cylindrical drum consisting of 27 horizontal bars. Each drum bar is affixed with two movable ''lugs''; the lugs can be aligned with any of the six key wheels, or may be placed in one of two \"neutral\" positions. An effective pin causes its guide arm to tilt forward, contacting the drum. The positioning of the lugs comprises the second part of the internal keying mechanism. Owing to the complexity of setting the internal keying mechanism, it was altered relatively infrequently; changing internal keys once a day was common in practice.\n\nWhen the operator turns the power handle, the cylindrical drum makes a complete revolution through all 27 bars. If a lug on one of the bars contacts the guide arm of an active key wheel, that bar is slid to the left; lugs in neutral positions, or which do not contact a guide arm, do not affect the position of the bar. All bars that are slid to the left comprise a variable-toothed [[gear]], which in turn shifts the letter to be encoded; the shift is equal to the number of bars protruding to the left. The resulting ciphertext letter is printed onto the paper tape.\n\nAfter the rotation is complete, a ''retractor'' pushes the protruding bars back into place. A set of ''intermediate gears'' advances the key wheels by one position, and a locking arm latches into the drum to prevent a second encoding until the indicator disk is adjusted for the next letter.\n\nThis system allowed the offset to change for each enciphered letter; without this facility, the enciphering scheme would resemble a very insecure [[Caesar cipher|Caesar shift cipher]].\n\n===Example configuration===\nPrior to encoding anything using the M-209, the operator must set the machine according to a preset configuration. This configuration includes the settings for each pin on all six of the key wheels, and the position of each lug on the rotating drum; these were typically specified by tables in a secret system publication given to both sender and receiver. The rotational alignment of the key wheels could be chosen by the sender at random, and provided to the receiver via a secure channel of communication.\n\nEach letter on each key wheel is associated with a pin that can be set either to the left or right. A table specifying the setting of these pins might resemble the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Wheel !! Pin settings\n|-\n| 1 || <tt>AB-D---HI-K-MN----ST-VW---</tt>\n|-\n| 2 || <tt>A--DE-G--JKL\u2014O--RS-U-X--</tt>\n|-\n| 3 || <tt>AB----GH-J-LMN---RSTU-X</tt>\n|-\n| 4 || <tt>--C-EF-HI---MN-P--STU</tt>\n|-\n| 5 || <tt>-B-DEF-HI---MN-P--S</tt>\n|-\n| 6 || <tt>AB-D---H--K--NO-Q</tt>\n|}\n\nLetters that are present in the table for a given key wheel should have their corresponding pin set to the right, or \"effective\", position. Absent letters, represented by a dash, are set to the left, or \"ineffective\", position.\n\nThe rotating drum has 27 bars, each with two ''lugs''. These lugs can be set to any position 1 through 6, in which case they are aligned with the corresponding key wheel, or they may be set to one of two \"0\" positions, in which case they are ineffective. A table indicating the lug settings for the drum might look like this:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Bar !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9\n|-\n! Lugs\n| 3-6 || 0-6 || 1-6 || 1-5 || 4-5 || 0-4 || 0-4 || 0-4 || 0-4\n|-\n! Bar !! 10 !! 11 !! 12 !! 13 !! 14 !! 15 !! 16 !! 17 !! 18\n|-\n! Lugs\n| 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0\n|-\n! Bar !! 19 !! 20 !! 21 !! 22 !! 23 !! 24 !! 25 !! 26 !! 27\n|-\n! Lugs\n| 2-0 || 2-5 || 2-5 || 0-5 || 0-5 || 0-5 || 0-5 || 0-5 || 0-5\n|}\n\nBar 1 would have its lugs set in the \"3\" and \"6\" positions, bar 2's lugs in the \"0\" and \"6\" positions, and so on. Any lug in the \"3\" position, for example, will be pushed to the side by a guide arm when the currently active pin on key wheel 3 is in an \"effective\" position.\n\nFinally, the external key is set by rotating the key wheels to either a specific or random sequence of letters. In testing the internal key settings of the M-209, it is customary for the operator to set the key wheels to \"AAAAAA\", and proceed with encoding a message consisting of nothing but the letter \"A.\" The resulting ciphertext is then compared with a long ''check string'' to verify that all of the internal settings have been performed properly. The check string for this particular configuration is:\n\n T N J U W A U Q T K C Z K N U T O T B C W A R M I O\n\nKey wheel pins come into play when they reach the lower part of the key wheel during rotation; it is here that they may contact or release the guide arm that deflects the lugs to the left. The active pin is offset by a particular amount from the letter currently being displayed on the front of the key wheel; when \"AAAAAA\" is showing on the key wheels, the pins that are in play are those associated with the letters \"PONMLK\", from left to right.\n\n===Example encoding===\nAfter the M-209 is configured according to the settings above, the machine is ready to encode. Continuing with the example of a known ''check string'', the first letter to be encoded is \"A\". The operator sets the indicating disk to the letter \"A\", and turns the power handle.\n\nSince the key wheels are set to the string \"AAAAAA\", the active pins are \"PONMLK\"; according to the settings above, pin \"P\" is ineffective on the first key wheel, pin \"O\" is effective on the second key wheel, \"N\" is effective on the third, \"M\" is effective on the fourth, \"L\" is ineffective on the fifth, and \"K\" is effective on the sixth. The guide arms associated with effective pins will tilt forward and contact the rotating drum; in this case, guide arms 2, 3, 4, and 6 will be effective.\n\nAny bar on the drum with a lug in any of those positions will be slid to the left, and that bar will participate in the variable-toothed gear driving the output of the machine. According to the given settings, bars 1, 2, 3, and 5 through 21 will be slid to the left, for a total of 20 bars, or 20 \"teeth\" on the variable-toothed gear. The encoding for this letter will use a shift of 20.\n\nThe M-209 uses a reciprocal [[substitution cipher]] or ''[[Beaufort cipher|Beaufort]]'' scheme; the alphabet used in the plaintext message is mapped to the same alphabet in reverse (''[[atbash]]''):\n\n{|\n|''Plaintext alphabet:'' || <tt>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</tt>\n|-\n|''Ciphertext alphabet:'' || <tt>ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA</tt>\n|}\n\nIf shifting is not considered, \"A\" becomes \"Z\", \"B\" becomes \"Y\", \"C\" becomes \"X\" and so on. Shifting proceeds in a reverse direction; for instance, a plaintext \"P\" maps to ciphertext \"K\"; shifting by three positions, to the left, gives ciphertext \"N\". The shift is circular, so when a shift steps off the left side, it continues again on the right. This approach is self-inversing, meaning that deciphering uses the same table in the same way: a ciphertext \"N\" is entered as if it were plaintext; this maps to \"M\" in the ciphertext alphabet, or \"P\" after shifting three positions, thus giving the original plaintext back.\n\nContinuing the example above, the initial letter to be encoded was \"A\", which maps to \"Z\" in ciphertext. The shift given by the variable-toothed gear was 20; shifting to the left 20 positions gives the final ciphertext letter \"T\", which is the same as the first digit in the check string.\n\nAt the end of the encoding cycle, all six key wheels are advanced by one position. The key wheels will then read \"BBBBBB\", and the active pins will be \"QPONML\". A new set of guide arms will interact with the drum, resulting in a different shift for the next encoding operation.\n\n==Security==\nThe security of the M-209 was good for its time, but it was by no means perfect. As with the Lorenz Electric teletypewriter cipher machine (codenamed [[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]] by the Allies), if a codebreaker got hold of two overlapping sequences, he would have a fingerhold into the M-209 settings, and its operation had some distinctive quirks that could be exploited. As of early 1943, German cryptanalysts were able to read 10-30% of M-209 messages.<ref name=\"ticom\">[http://m.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/european-axis-sigint/assets/files/volume_1_synopsis.pdf Army Security Agency, European Axis Signal Intelligence in World War II, Volume I, Synopsis.

Menzer also worked on two other cipher machines based on Hagelin technology, including a follow-on to the Enigma, the \"SG-39\", and a simple but fairly strong handheld cipher machine, the \"''Schl\u00fcsselkasten''\" (\"Code Box\"). Neither of these machines reached production. Had the Menzer devices been put into service, they would have certainly caused trouble for Allied cryptanalysts, though they were no more uncrackable than the M-209.\n\nAfter the war, Hagelin came up with an improved model of the M-209, designated the \"[[C-52 (cipher machine)|C-52]]\". The C-52 featured a period of up to 2,756,205,443; wheels that could be removed and reinserted in a different order; and a printwheel with a mixed alphabet. However, the C-52 was one of the last generation of the classic cipher machines, as by that time the new digital technology was permitting the development of ciphers that were far more secure.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* J.

These six wheels comprise the external [[key (cryptography)|key]] for the machine, providing an initial state, similar to an [[initialization vector]], for the enciphering process.\n\nTo encipher a message, the operator sets the key wheels to a random sequence of letters. An ''enciphering-deciphering knob'' on the left side of the machine is set to \"encipher\". A dial known as the ''indicator disk'', also on the left side, is turned to the first letter in the message. This letter is encoded by turning a hand crank or ''power handle'' on the right side of the machine; at the end of the cycle, the ciphertext letter is printed onto a paper tape, the key wheels each advance one letter, and the machine is ready for entry of the next character in the message. To indicate spaces between words in the message, the letter \"Z\" is enciphered. Repeating the process for the remainder of the message gives a complete ciphertext, which can then be transmitted using [[Morse code]] or another method. Since the initial key wheel setting is random, it is also necessary to send those settings to the receiving party; these may also be encrypted using a daily key or transmitted in the clear.\n\nPrinted ciphertext is automatically spaced into groups of five by the M-209 for ease of readability. A ''letter counter'' on top of the machine indicated the total number of encoded letters, and could be used as a point of reference if a mistake was made in enciphering or deciphering.\n\nThe deciphering procedure is nearly the same as for enciphering; the operator sets the enciphering-deciphering knob to \"decipher\", and aligns the key wheels to the same sequence as was used in enciphering. The first letter of the ciphertext is entered via the indicator disk, and the power handle is operated, advancing the key wheels and printing the decoded letter on the paper tape. When the letter \"Z\" is encountered, a [[cam]] causes a blank space to appear in the message, thus reconstituting the original message with spaces. Absent \"Z\"s can typically be interpreted by the operator, based on context.\n\nAn experienced M-209 operator might spend two to four seconds enciphering or deciphering each letter.\n\n==Internal elements==\n\n===Overview===\nInside the casing of the M-209, a much more complicated picture emerges. The six key wheels each have a small movable pin aligned with each letter on the wheel. These pins may each be positioned to the left or right; the positioning of these pins affects the operation of the machine. The left position is ''ineffective'', while the right position is ''effective''.\n\n[[File:M209B cypher machine rotors-IMG 0557.jpg|thumbnail|An intermediate gear unit (center) meshes with gears adjoining each key wheel. Visible to the left of the image are the paper tape and typewheel that print out messages and ciphertext.]]\n[[Image:M209 guide arm springs.png|thumbnail|An inactive pin (red) on the bottom of the left key wheel (light blue) pulls the guide arm (green) back. No pin is blocking the right guide arm, so a spring tilts that guide arm forward.]]\n[[File:M209 guide arm touching lug (1).png|thumbnail|The left guide arm is prevented from interacting with the lugs (purple) on the drum (blue), while the right guide arm is in an effective position, and will push to the left any bars with a lug in that position.]]\n\nEach key wheel contains a different number of letters, and a correspondingly different number of pins. From left to right, the wheels have:\n\n* 26 letters, from A to Z\n* 25 letters, from A to Z, excepting W\n* 23 letters, from A to X, excepting W\n* 21 letters, from A to U\n* 19 letters, from A to S\n* 17 letters, from A to Q\n\nThis discrepancy is chosen to give the wheel sizes a [[coprime]] nature; the end result is that the wheels only align the same way once every 26&times;25&times;23&times;21&times;19&times;17 = 101,405,850 enciphered letters (also known as the ''period''). Each key wheel is associated with a slanted metal ''guide arm'' that is activated by any pins in the \"effective\" position. The positions of the pins on each key wheel comprise the first part of the internal keying mechanism of the M-209.\n\nBehind the row of six key wheels is a cylindrical drum consisting of 27 horizontal bars. Each drum bar is affixed with two movable ''lugs''; the lugs can be aligned with any of the six key wheels, or may be placed in one of two \"neutral\" positions. An effective pin causes its guide arm to tilt forward, contacting the drum. The positioning of the lugs comprises the second part of the internal keying mechanism. Owing to the complexity of setting the internal keying mechanism, it was altered relatively infrequently; changing internal keys once a day was common in practice.\n\nWhen the operator turns the power handle, the cylindrical drum makes a complete revolution through all 27 bars. If a lug on one of the bars contacts the guide arm of an active key wheel, that bar is slid to the left; lugs in neutral positions, or which do not contact a guide arm, do not affect the position of the bar. All bars that are slid to the left comprise a variable-toothed [[gear]], which in turn shifts the letter to be encoded; the shift is equal to the number of bars protruding to the left. The resulting ciphertext letter is printed onto the paper tape.\n\nAfter the rotation is complete, a ''retractor'' pushes the protruding bars back into place. A set of ''intermediate gears'' advances the key wheels by one position, and a locking arm latches into the drum to prevent a second encoding until the indicator disk is adjusted for the next letter.\n\nThis system allowed the offset to change for each enciphered letter; without this facility, the enciphering scheme would resemble a very insecure [[Caesar cipher|Caesar shift cipher]].\n\n===Example configuration===\nPrior to encoding anything using the M-209, the operator must set the machine according to a preset configuration. This configuration includes the settings for each pin on all six of the key wheels, and the position of each lug on the rotating drum; these were typically specified by tables in a secret system publication given to both sender and receiver. The rotational alignment of the key wheels could be chosen by the sender at random, and provided to the receiver via a secure channel of communication.\n\nEach letter on each key wheel is associated with a pin that can be set either to the left or right. A table specifying the setting of these pins might resemble the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Wheel !! Pin settings\n|-\n| 1 || <tt>AB-D---HI-K-MN----ST-VW---</tt>\n|-\n| 2 || <tt>A--DE-G--JKL\u2014O--RS-U-X--</tt>\n|-\n| 3 || <tt>AB----GH-J-LMN---RSTU-X</tt>\n|-\n| 4 || <tt>--C-EF-HI---MN-P--STU</tt>\n|-\n| 5 || <tt>-B-DEF-HI---MN-P--S</tt>\n|-\n| 6 || <tt>AB-D---H--K--NO-Q</tt>\n|}\n\nLetters that are present in the table for a given key wheel should have their corresponding pin set to the right, or \"effective\", position. Absent letters, represented by a dash, are set to the left, or \"ineffective\", position.\n\nThe rotating drum has 27 bars, each with two ''lugs''. These lugs can be set to any position 1 through 6, in which case they are aligned with the corresponding key wheel, or they may be set to one of two \"0\" positions, in which case they are ineffective. A table indicating the lug settings for the drum might look like this:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Bar !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9\n|-\n! Lugs\n| 3-6 || 0-6 || 1-6 || 1-5 || 4-5 || 0-4 || 0-4 || 0-4 || 0-4\n|-\n! Bar !! 10 !! 11 !! 12 !! 13 !! 14 !! 15 !! 16 !! 17 !! 18\n|-\n! Lugs\n| 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0 || 2-0\n|-\n! Bar !! 19 !! 20 !! 21 !! 22 !! 23 !! 24 !! 25 !! 26 !! 27\n|-\n! Lugs\n| 2-0 || 2-5 || 2-5 || 0-5 || 0-5 || 0-5 || 0-5 || 0-5 || 0-5\n|}\n\nBar 1 would have its lugs set in the \"3\" and \"6\" positions, bar 2's lugs in the \"0\" and \"6\" positions, and so on. Any lug in the \"3\" position, for example, will be pushed to the side by a guide arm when the currently active pin on key wheel 3 is in an \"effective\" position.\n\nFinally, the external key is set by rotating the key wheels to either a specific or random sequence of letters. In testing the internal key settings of the M-209, it is customary for the operator to set the key wheels to \"AAAAAA\", and proceed with encoding a message consisting of nothing but the letter \"A.\" The resulting ciphertext is then compared with a long ''check string'' to verify that all of the internal settings have been performed properly. The check string for this particular configuration is:\n\n T N J U W A U Q T K C Z K N U T O T B C W A R M I O\n\nKey wheel pins come into play when they reach the lower part of the key wheel during rotation; it is here that they may contact or release the guide arm that deflects the lugs to the left. The active pin is offset by a particular amount from the letter currently being displayed on the front of the key wheel; when \"AAAAAA\" is showing on the key wheels, the pins that are in play are those associated with the letters \"PONMLK\", from left to right.\n\n===Example encoding===\nAfter the M-209 is configured according to the settings above, the machine is ready to encode. Continuing with the example of a known ''check string'', the first letter to be encoded is \"A\". The operator sets the indicating disk to the letter \"A\", and turns the power handle.\n\nSince the key wheels are set to the string \"AAAAAA\", the active pins are \"PONMLK\"; according to the settings above, pin \"P\" is ineffective on the first key wheel, pin \"O\" is effective on the second key wheel, \"N\" is effective on the third, \"M\" is effective on the fourth, \"L\" is ineffective on the fifth, and \"K\" is effective on the sixth. The guide arms associated with effective pins will tilt forward and contact the rotating drum; in this case, guide arms 2, 3, 4, and 6 will be effective.\n\nAny bar on the drum with a lug in any of those positions will be slid to the left, and that bar will participate in the variable-toothed gear driving the output of the machine. According to the given settings, bars 1, 2, 3, and 5 through 21 will be slid to the left, for a total of 20 bars, or 20 \"teeth\" on the variable-toothed gear. The encoding for this letter will use a shift of 20.\n\nThe M-209 uses a reciprocal [[substitution cipher]] or ''[[Beaufort cipher|Beaufort]]'' scheme; the alphabet used in the plaintext message is mapped to the same alphabet in reverse (''[[atbash]]''):\n\n{|\n|''Plaintext alphabet:'' || <tt>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</tt>\n|-\n|''Ciphertext alphabet:'' || <tt>ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA</tt>\n|}\n\nIf shifting is not considered, \"A\" becomes \"Z\", \"B\" becomes \"Y\", \"C\" becomes \"X\" and so on. Shifting proceeds in a reverse direction; for instance, a plaintext \"P\" maps to ciphertext \"K\"; shifting by three positions, to the left, gives ciphertext \"N\". The shift is circular, so when a shift steps off the left side, it continues again on the right. This approach is self-inversing, meaning that deciphering uses the same table in the same way: a ciphertext \"N\" is entered as if it were plaintext; this maps to \"M\" in the ciphertext alphabet, or \"P\" after shifting three positions, thus giving the original plaintext back.\n\nContinuing the example above, the initial letter to be encoded was \"A\", which maps to \"Z\" in ciphertext. The shift given by the variable-toothed gear was 20; shifting to the left 20 positions gives the final ciphertext letter \"T\", which is the same as the first digit in the check string.\n\nAt the end of the encoding cycle, all six key wheels are advanced by one position. The key wheels will then read \"BBBBBB\", and the active pins will be \"QPONML\". A new set of guide arms will interact with the drum, resulting in a different shift for the next encoding operation.\n\n==Security==\nThe security of the M-209 was good for its time, but it was by no means perfect. As with the Lorenz Electric teletypewriter cipher machine (codenamed [[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]] by the Allies), if a codebreaker got hold of two overlapping sequences, he would have a fingerhold into the M-209 settings, and its operation had some distinctive quirks that could be exploited. As of early 1943, German cryptanalysts were able to read 10-30% of M-209 messages.<ref name=\"ticom\">[http://m.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/european-axis-sigint/assets/files/volume_1_synopsis.pdf Army Security Agency, European Axis Signal Intelligence in World War II, Volume I, Synopsis.

Menzer also worked on two other cipher machines based on Hagelin technology, including a follow-on to the Enigma, the \"SG-39\", and a simple but fairly strong handheld cipher machine, the \"''Schl\u00fcsselkasten''\" (\"Code Box\"). Neither of these machines reached production. Had the Menzer devices been put into service, they would have certainly caused trouble for Allied cryptanalysts, though they were no more uncrackable than the M-209.\n\nAfter the war, Hagelin came up with an improved model of the M-209, designated the \"[[C-52 (cipher machine)|C-52]]\". The C-52 featured a period of up to 2,756,205,443; wheels that could be removed and reinserted in a different order; and a printwheel with a mixed alphabet. However, the C-52 was one of the last generation of the classic cipher machines, as by that time the new digital technology was permitting the development of ciphers that were far more secure.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* J.

It is [[holotype|based on]] [[Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano|MSNM]] V5770, a fragment of [[maxilla]], the main tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, and several isolated teeth have also been assigned to it.  The remains come from the [[Bathonian]]-age [[Isalo III Formation|Sakaraha Formation]] of [[Mahajanga Province|Mahajanga]].  The jaw fragment and teeth are similar to the representative bones of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s and some types of [[crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorphs]], and the authors refrained from assigning the genus to either group.  They interpreted the stout teeth as having been used for crushing bones, and their denticles are remarkably large, even larger than those of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Remains described in 2017 have given further insight to the phylogeny of ''R. sakalavae'', revealing it to be the oldest known [[notosuchia]]n.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n===Initial specimens===\n[[File:Razanandrongobe-fig1-locality.jpg|thumb|Map showing local geology around [[Ambondromamy]], Madagascar|350px]]\nAll known remains of ''Razanandrongobe'' originate from [[stratum|strata]] belonging to the [[Lower Jurassic]]\u2013[[Middle Jurassic]] [[Isalo Group]] in the badlands (locally called ''tanety'') surrounding the town of [[Ambondromamy]], Madagascar. In October 2001, Giovanni Pasini first verified the presence of fossil-bearing Isalo Group strata in this region. During an associated field [[survey (archaeology)|survey]] of the locality, local collectors discovered two tooth-bearing skull fragments on the surface of the ground, which belonged to two different kinds of reptiles. These fragments were later acquired by Gilles Emringer and Francois Escuilli\u00e9 from [[Gannat]], France, who intended to make them available for research.<ref name=\"maganuco2006\">{{cite journal |last1=Maganuco |first1=S. |last2=Dal Sasso |first2=C. |last3=Pasini |first3=G. |year=2006 |title=A new large predatory archosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Madagascar |journal=Atti della Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Scienze Naturali e del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale in Milano |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201351 |url=https://www.academia.edu/29170626/A_new_large_predatory_archosaur_from_the_Middle_Jurassic_Bathonian_of_Madagascar}}</ref>\n\nBased on the potential for further research, four temporary permits were obtained in the area for exploration from the Mining [[cadastre|Cadastral]] Office of Madagascar. In April 2003, a joint team from the [[Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Milan Natural History Museum]] (MSNM) and [[Civic Museum of Fossils of Besano]] launched a privately-funded expedition to the region. Pasini collected a number of teeth during this expedition. In June 2003, he gained access to one of the two skull fragments, a [[maxilla]], and recognized that the teeth were identical.

At the front of the snout, the openings of the bony nostrils, the ''apertura nasi ossea'', faced forward, and were fused at the midline. Smooth depressions known as the perinarial fossae extended down from the nostrils to the level of the teeth. The remainder of the [[premaxilla]] had a roughened surface, covered in crests, ridges, and pits. On the [[palate]], two sub-circular depressions were situated near the front of the snout, where the first pair of teeth from the lower jaw would have been located when the mouth was closed. The palatal portion of the maxilla did not close off the bottom edge of the premaxillae, leaving a large opening \u2014- the incisive foramen \u2014- which was about half as long as the premaxilla was wide.<ref name=\"dalsasso2017\"/>\n\nLike its premaxilla, the maxilla of ''Razanandrongobe'' was tall and robust. The surface of the palate, which was thickest below the eye sockets, was placed unusually high above the tooth row, at about halfway up the depth of the tooth sockets. At this position, it met the portion of the palate formed by the [[palatine bone]]s, and bordered the openings known as the suborbital fenestrae. In this way, the palate of ''Razanandrongobe'' resembled those of the [[Ziphosuchia]], including ''[[Araripesuchus]]''. On the interior of the maxilla, there was a smooth groove, which may have corresponded to a [[skeletal pneumaticity|pneumatic opening]] in the skull that is also seen in the modern''[[Alligator]]''. The inside of the tooth row on the premaxilla and maxilla bore a paradental shelf covered in ridges and furrows.<ref name=\"dalsasso2017\"/>\n\n===Lower jaw===\n[[File:Razanandrongobe-fig4-dentary.jpg|thumb|Dentary MHNT.PAL.2012.6.1 of ''Razanandrongobe'']]\nThe lower jaw of ''Razanandrongobe'' was also tall and robust. Uniquely, the tip of the lower jaw was devoid of teeth, for a section of the [[mandible|dentary]] corresponding to the diameter of more than one tooth. The front of the jaw would have been fused; on the inside of the bone, there was a scar running along the rear 20% of the fused portion, representing the attachment of the [[splenial|splenial bone]]. Like the premaxilla, the outer surface of the dentary was textured, bearing a dense network of zigzagging canals for blood vessels (i.e., ''vascular canals''). On the interior surface, immediately adjacent to the tooth row, there was a row of pits, which were enclosed by a groove towards the back of the jaw. The top margin of the bone was convex at the front, followed by a concave region behind it.<ref name=\"dalsasso2017\"/>\n\n===Teeth===\n[[File:Razanandrongobe-fig6-teeth.jpg|thumb|Various teeth of ''Razanandrongobe'']]\n''Razanandrongobe'' had five teeth in each premaxilla, at least ten in each maxilla, and eight in each half of the dentary. Most of the tooth sockets were sub-circular, although the inner half of the sockets in the maxilla and the front of the dentary were rectangular. All of them were wider than they were long, and were nearly vertical. Larger sockets were separated by narrower distances than smaller teeth, with the separating surfaces being ornamented like the paradental shelves. The teeth themselves are unusual; they bear large serrations on both the front and rear edges, which are proportionally even larger than those of [[dinosaur]]s such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. They were also thick, non-constricted, and slightly recurved (pachydont). Several types of teeth are present, making ''Razanandrongobe'' [[heterodont]]: the teeth at the front of the jaw were U-shaped (or [[salinon]]-shaped) in cross-section, while those on the sides were incisiform ([[incisor]]-like) and sub-oval in cross-section, with the smallest teeth at the rear being globe-shaped. The smallest teeth were globe-shaped. None of the teeth were particularly hypertrophied like the [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] of mammals (i.e., caniniform), but the first three dentary teeth were larger than the rest.<ref name=\"maganuco2006\"/><ref name=\"dalsasso2017\"/>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Razanandrongobe sakalavae life recon.png|thumb|Life reconstruction; the body is speculatively restored|350px]]\nIn 2006, Maganuco and colleagues identified ''Razanandrongobe'' as a member of the [[Archosauriformes]] by its serrated teeth and the [[thecodont dentition|thecodont]] condition of its teeth (i.e. their deep implantation in tooth sockets). Both characteristics are widespread among  archosauriforms, and the former may represent a shared [[synapomorphy and apomorphy|synapomorphy]] of the group.

It is [[holotype|based on]] [[Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano|MSNM]] V5770, a fragment of [[maxilla]], the main tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, and several isolated teeth have also been assigned to it.  The remains come from the [[Bathonian]]-age [[Isalo III Formation|Sakaraha Formation]] of [[Mahajanga Province|Mahajanga]].  The jaw fragment and teeth are similar to the representative bones of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s and some types of [[crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorphs]], and the authors refrained from assigning the genus to either group.  They interpreted the stout teeth as having been used for crushing bones, and their denticles are remarkably large, even larger than those of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Remains described in 2017 have given further insight to the phylogeny of ''R. sakalavae'', revealing it to be the oldest known [[notosuchia]]n.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n===Initial specimens===\n[[File:Razanandrongobe-fig1-locality.jpg|thumb|Map showing local geology around [[Ambondromamy]], Madagascar|350px]]\nAll known remains of ''Razanandrongobe'' originate from [[stratum|strata]] belonging to the [[Lower Jurassic]]\u2013[[Middle Jurassic]] [[Isalo Group]] in the badlands (locally called ''tanety'') surrounding the town of [[Ambondromamy]], Madagascar. In October 2001, Giovanni Pasini first verified the presence of fossil-bearing Isalo Group strata in this region. During an associated field [[survey (archaeology)|survey]] of the locality, local collectors discovered two tooth-bearing skull fragments on the surface of the ground, which belonged to two different kinds of reptiles. These fragments were later acquired by Gilles Emringer and Francois Escuilli\u00e9 from [[Gannat]], France, who intended to make them available for research.<ref name=\"maganuco2006\">{{cite journal |last1=Maganuco |first1=S. |last2=Dal Sasso |first2=C. |last3=Pasini |first3=G. |year=2006 |title=A new large predatory archosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Madagascar |journal=Atti della Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Scienze Naturali e del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale in Milano |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201351 |url=https://www.academia.edu/29170626/A_new_large_predatory_archosaur_from_the_Middle_Jurassic_Bathonian_of_Madagascar}}</ref>\n\nBased on the potential for further research, four temporary permits were obtained in the area for exploration from the Mining [[cadastre|Cadastral]] Office of Madagascar.

See [[WP:ENGVAR]] -->\n\n{{HTTP}}This is a list of [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) response status codes. Status codes are issued by a server in response to a [[Client (computing)|client's request]] made to the server. It includes codes from IETF [[Request for Comments]] (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in some common applications of the HTTP. The first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses. The message phrases shown are typical, but any human-readable alternative may be provided. Unless otherwise stated, the status code is part of the HTTP/1.1 standard (<nowiki>RFC 7231</nowiki>).<ref>{{cite web|title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231|website=IETF|accessdate=16 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525004653/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) maintains the official registry of HTTP status codes.<ref name=\"iana_status_codes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/|title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Status Code Registry|publisher=Iana.org|accessdate=January 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211100506/http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes|archive-date=December 11, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAll HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes or categories. The first digit of the status code defines the class of response, while the last two digits do not have any classifying or categorization role. There are five classes defined by the standard:\n\n* ''1xx informational response'' \u2013 the request was received, continuing process\n* ''2xx successful'' \u2013 the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted\n* ''3xx redirection'' \u2013 further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request\n* ''4xx client error'' \u2013 the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled\n* ''5xx server error'' \u2013 the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request\n\n==1xx Informational response==\nAn informational response indicates that the request was received and understood. It is issued on a provisional basis while request processing continues. It alerts the client to wait for a final response. The message consists only of the status line and optional header fields, and is terminated by an empty line. As the HTTP/1.0 standard did not define any 1xx status codes, servers ''must not''<ref group=\"note\">Italicised words and phrases such as ''must'' and ''should'' represent interpretation guidelines as given by RFC 2119</ref> send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 compliant client except under experimental conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Status Code Definitions|url=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html|website=W3|accessdate=16 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316011642/http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html|archive-date=March 16, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;{{anchor |100}}100 Continue\n: The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] request). Sending a large request body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be inefficient. To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send <code>Expect: 100-continue</code> as a header in its initial request and receive a <code>100 Continue</code> status code in response before sending the body. If the client receives an error code such as 403 (Forbidden) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) then it shouldn't send the request's body. The response <code>417 Expectation Failed</code> indicates that the request should be repeated without the <code>Expect</code> header as it indicates that the server doesn't support expectations (this is the case, for example, of HTTP/1.0 servers).<ref>{{cite web|title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - 5.1.1.

The [[Normans|Norman]] conquest of England in 1066 and the later [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]], soon restricted only to [[The Pale]]. The 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Acts of Union 1707]] and [[Acts of Union 1800]] aimed to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as [[Crown Dependencies]]. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the dispersal of some of the islands' population and culture throughout the world, and a rapid depopulation of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919\u20131922), with six counties remaining in the UK as Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Ireland, the term \"British Isles\" is [[British Isles naming dispute|controversial]] ,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rasBRQwwOIIC&pg=PA7 Social work in the British Isles by Malcolm Payne, Steven Shardlow] When we think about social work in the British Isles, a contentious term if ever there was one, what do we expect to see?</ref> where there are nationalist objections to its usage.<ref name=\"postwarculture\">{{Citation|first1=Alistair|last1=Davies|first2=Alan|last2=Sinfield|title=British Culture of the Postwar: An Introduction to Literature and Society, 1945\u20131999|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-12811-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/britishcultureof00adav/page/9 9]|quote=Some of the Irish dislike the 'British' in 'British Isles', while a minority of the Welsh and Scottish are not keen on 'Great Britain'. ...

Animal and plant life is similar to that of the northwestern [[European mainland]]. There are however, fewer numbers of species, with Ireland having even less. All native [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in Ireland is made up of species that migrated from elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. The only window when this could have occurred was between the end of [[Pleistocene|the last Ice Age]] (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).\n\nAs with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, [[wych elm]], birch and pine. Beech and [[Tilia|lime]], though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, [[hedgerows]], mountain slopes and marshes host [[Ericaceae|heather]], wild grasses, [[gorse]] and [[bracken]].\n\nMany larger animals, such as wolf, bear and the European elk are today extinct. However, some species such as red deer are protected. Other small mammals, such as rabbits, foxes, [[badger]]s, [[hare]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and [[stoat]]s, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. [[Wild boar]] have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain [[otter]]s and [[Pinniped|seal]]s are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the [[common chaffinch]], common blackbird, house sparrow and [[common starling]]; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as [[pheasant]], [[partridge]], and [[red grouse]]. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular salmon, trout, perch and [[Esox|pike]]. Sea fish include [[Squalidae|dogfish]], cod, [[sole (fish)|sole]], pollock and bass, as well as mussels, crab and oysters along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.\n\nFew species of reptiles or amphibians are found in Great Britain or Ireland. Only three snakes are native to Great Britain: the [[Vipera berus|common European adder]], the [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] and the [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]];<ref>{{cite web| title = Guide to British Snakes | publisher = Wildlife Britain wildlifebritain.com | url = http://www.wildlifebritain.com/britishsnakes.php | accessdate =17 August 2010 }}</ref> none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with weasels, [[European polecat|polecat]]s, wildcats, most [[shrews]], [[European mole|moles]], [[European water vole|water voles]], [[roe deer]] and common toads also being absent from Ireland. This pattern is also true for birds and insects. Notable exceptions include the [[Kerry slug]] and certain species of woodlouse native to Ireland but not Great Britain.\n\nDomestic animals include the Connemara pony, Shetland pony, English Mastiff, Irish wolfhound and many varieties of cattle and sheep.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Demography of the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:British Isles population density 2011 NUTS3.svg|upright|thumb|alt=A map of the British Isles showing the relative population densities across the area.|Population density per km\u00b2 of the British Isles' [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|regions]].]]\n\nEngland has a generally high population density, with almost 80% of the total population of the islands.

However, since the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]], the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles.

Ice covered almost all of what is now Scotland, most of Ireland and Wales, and the hills of northern England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from Great Britain and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.\n\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about two thousand years ago, various tribes, which spoke [[Celtic languages|Celtic dialects]] of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] group, were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building [[Hadrian's Wall]] to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as Hiberni, the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as Picts and the southern two thirds by Britons.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Alfred Jewel]] (9th century)]]\nAnglo-Saxons arrived as [[Fall of Rome|Roman power waned in the 5th century AD]]. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in [[Hen Ogledd|the north of what is now England]], in [[Cornwall]] and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, for being [[Christianisation of Ireland|Christianised]]\u2014traditionally by the Romano-Briton, Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as [[Dark Ages (historiography)|the Dark Ages]], Ireland entered a [[golden age]] and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|responded with missions]] (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities. These were later joined by [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]s of a similar nature.\n\nViking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and [[Wexford]]. England, however, was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of [[Denmark]]. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in [[Normandy]], in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England in 1066]]. The remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day.  A century later, the marriage of the future [[Henry II of England]] to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] created the [[Angevin Empire]], partially under the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]]. At the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], a provincial king, and under [[Laudabiliter|the authority of]] [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Angevins invaded Ireland]] in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair|the Irish High King]] to ensure the terms of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of [[Lord of Ireland]]. This title was granted to his younger son, but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died, the title of [[King of England]] and Lord of Ireland became entwined in one person.\n\n[[File:James I of England by Daniel Mytens.jpg|thumb|upright|James VI of Scotland (James I of England)]]\n\nBy the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Power in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]]. A similar situation existed in the [[Principality of Wales]], which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England from being [[vassal]] of the [[King of France]]. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as \"the only Supreme Head in Earth of the [[Church of England]]\", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared [[Kingdom of Ireland|a separate kingdom]] in personal union with England.\n\nScotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland [[Union of the Crowns|inherited the Crown of England]], and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in [[Ulster]]. Religious division heightened and the king in England came into conflict with parliament over his tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting [[English Civil War]] or [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] led to a [[revolutionary republic]] in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created a new [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class which obliterated the remnants of Old English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and English, whilst the populace was largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and at the militarily crucial [[Battle of Aughrim]] in Ireland. Resistance held out, eventually forcing the guarantee of religious tolerance in the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. However, the terms were never honoured and a new monarchy was installed.\n\nThe Kingdoms of England and Scotland were [[Acts of Union 1707|unified in 1707]] creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Following an attempted republican [[1798 Rebellion|revolution in Ireland in 1798]], the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were [[Acts of Union 1800|unified in 1801]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North America that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the [[British Empire]] expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate, however, and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working classes. Mass migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919\u20131922), with the six counties that formed Northern Ireland remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics in the British Isles}}\n{{See also|Ireland\u2013United Kingdom relations|Politics of the United Kingdom|Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland\u2013Isle of Man relations|Politics of the Isle of Man|Politics of Jersey|Politics of Guernsey|Politics of Alderney|Politics of Sark|}}\n\n[[File:British Isles terms.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Subdivisions of the British Isles<br />See also [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/British_Isles_Euler_Diagram_13.svg diagrammatic version]]]\n\nThere are two sovereign states in the British Isles: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. Ireland, sometimes called the Republic of Ireland, governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply \"the United Kingdom\", which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The Isle of Man and the two Bailiwicks of the Channel Islands, [[Jersey]] and [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], are known as the [[Crown dependencies]]. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence;<ref name=\"gov.je\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyWorld/InternationalAffairs/Pages/RelationshipEUandUK.aspx |title=Jersey's relationship with the UK and EU |publisher=Gov.je |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> responsibility for international representation rests largely with the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent parts]]: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and Northern Ireland in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have [[Devolution|devolved]] governments, meaning that each has its own parliament or assembly and is self-governing with respect to certain matters set down by law. For judicial purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and [[English law|England and Wales]] (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdictions, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.\n\nIreland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown dependencies are all [[parliamentary democracies]], with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return [[member of parliament|members]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament in London]]. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a [[Scottish Parliament|parliament in Edinburgh]] and to assemblies in [[National Assembly for Wales|Cardiff]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Belfast]] respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule; however, Northern Ireland uses a system of [[Consociationalism|power sharing]] whereby [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and [[Irish nationalist|nationalists]] share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups is required for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland to join with the rest of Ireland.) The [[British monarch]] is the head of state of the United Kingdom, while in the Republic of Ireland the head of state is the [[President of Ireland]].\n\nIreland is part of the European Union (EU) and the UK was part until 31 January 2020.<ref name=\"gov.je\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gov.gg/ccm/navigation/about-guernsey/constitution/ |title=States of Guernsey: Constitution |publisher=Gov.gg |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |title=Relationship with European Union \u2013 Isle of Man Government \u2013 Chief Secretarys Office |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=7 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925081145/http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |archivedate=25 September 2010  }}</ref> Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland are part of the [[Schengen Area]], which allows passport-free travel between certain EU member states. However, since the [[partition of Ireland]], an informal free-travel area has existed across the island of Ireland. This area required formal recognition in 1997 during the course of negotiations for the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of the European Union, and (together with the Crown dependencies) is now known as the [[Common Travel Area]].\n\nReciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional referendums]] in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than what was required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Justice]] report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement, arguing that \"the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries\".<ref>Goldsmith, 2008, [http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Citizenship: Our Common Bond], Ministry of Justice: London {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327121654/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole\u2014for example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI), a charity that operates a lifeboat service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112024357/http://www.rnli.org.uk/home RNLI.org.uk], The RNLI is a charity that provides a 24-hour lifesaving service around the UK and Republic of Ireland.</ref>\n\nThe [[Northern Ireland peace process]] has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both, and the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland also meet as the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] to develop policies common across the island of Ireland. These arrangements were made following the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]].\n\n===British\u2013Irish Council===\n{{main|British\u2013Irish Council}}\n\nAnother body established under the Good Friday Agreement, the British\u2013Irish Council, is made up of all of the states and territories of the British Isles. The [[British\u2013Irish Parliamentary Assembly]] ({{lang-ga|Tion\u00f3l Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na h\u00c9ireann}}) predates the British\u2013Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]], with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[States of Jersey]], the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[High Court of Tynwald]] (Isle of Man).\n\nThe Council does not have executive powers, but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the Parliamentary Assembly has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the British\u2013Irish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council.<ref>[Communiqu\u00e9 of the British-Irish Council], February 2008</ref> Leading on from developments in the British\u2013Irish Council, the chair of the British\u2013Irish Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, [[Niall Blaney]], has suggested that the body should shadow the British\u2013Irish Council's work.<ref>Martina Purdy, 28 February 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7268911.stm Unionists urged to drop boycott], BBC: London</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Culture of Ireland|Culture of the United Kingdom|Sport in Ireland|Sport in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Lords match in progress.jpg|thumb|One Day Cricket International at Lord's; England v Australia 10 July 2005]]\n[[File:P\u00e1draig Harrington 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[P\u00e1draig Harrington]] teeing off at [[the Open Championship]] ([[golf]]) [[2007 Open Championship|in 2007]].]]\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have separate media, although British television, newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |title=Ireland |publisher=Museum.tv |accessdate=17 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214101405/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |archive-date=14 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in the United Kingdom.

A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]] are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.\n\nMany globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including golf, [[association football]], [[Cricket in the British Isles|cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[History of snooker|snooker]] and darts, as well as many minor sports such as [[croquet]], [[bowls]], [[pitch and putt]], [[History of water polo|water polo]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]]. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is association football. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. [[Rugby union]] is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. The [[British and Irish Lions]] is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the Southern Hemisphere rugby-playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] as part of the [[Six Nations Championship]]. Also, since 2001, the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete against each other in the [[Pro14]].\n\nThe [[Ryder Cup]] in golf was originally played between a United States team and a team representing Great Britain and Ireland.

The [[Normans|Norman]] conquest of England in 1066 and the later [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland.

The 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Acts of Union 1707]] and [[Acts of Union 1800]] aimed to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as [[Crown Dependencies]]. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the dispersal of some of the islands' population and culture throughout the world, and a rapid depopulation of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century.

Animal and plant life is similar to that of the northwestern [[European mainland]]. There are however, fewer numbers of species, with Ireland having even less. All native [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in Ireland is made up of species that migrated from elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. The only window when this could have occurred was between the end of [[Pleistocene|the last Ice Age]] (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).\n\nAs with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, [[wych elm]], birch and pine. Beech and [[Tilia|lime]], though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, [[hedgerows]], mountain slopes and marshes host [[Ericaceae|heather]], wild grasses, [[gorse]] and [[bracken]].\n\nMany larger animals, such as wolf, bear and the European elk are today extinct. However, some species such as red deer are protected. Other small mammals, such as rabbits, foxes, [[badger]]s, [[hare]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and [[stoat]]s, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. [[Wild boar]] have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain [[otter]]s and [[Pinniped|seal]]s are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the [[common chaffinch]], common blackbird, house sparrow and [[common starling]]; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as [[pheasant]], [[partridge]], and [[red grouse]]. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular salmon, trout, perch and [[Esox|pike]]. Sea fish include [[Squalidae|dogfish]], cod, [[sole (fish)|sole]], pollock and bass, as well as mussels, crab and oysters along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.\n\nFew species of reptiles or amphibians are found in Great Britain or Ireland. Only three snakes are native to Great Britain: the [[Vipera berus|common European adder]], the [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] and the [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]];<ref>{{cite web| title = Guide to British Snakes | publisher = Wildlife Britain wildlifebritain.com | url = http://www.wildlifebritain.com/britishsnakes.php | accessdate =17 August 2010 }}</ref> none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with weasels, [[European polecat|polecat]]s, wildcats, most [[shrews]], [[European mole|moles]], [[European water vole|water voles]], [[roe deer]] and common toads also being absent from Ireland. This pattern is also true for birds and insects. Notable exceptions include the [[Kerry slug]] and certain species of woodlouse native to Ireland but not Great Britain.\n\nDomestic animals include the Connemara pony, Shetland pony, English Mastiff, Irish wolfhound and many varieties of cattle and sheep.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Demography of the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:British Isles population density 2011 NUTS3.svg|upright|thumb|alt=A map of the British Isles showing the relative population densities across the area.|Population density per km\u00b2 of the British Isles' [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|regions]].]]\n\nEngland has a generally high population density, with almost 80% of the total population of the islands.

Ireland for most of its history had much the same population density as Great Britain (about one third of the total population). However, since the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]], the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles. On a global scale, this disaster led to the creation of an [[Irish diaspora]] that numbers fifteen times the current population of the island.\n\nThe linguistic heritage of the British Isles is rich,<ref>{{Citation|title=Languages of the British Isles Past and Present|isbn=978-0-233-96666-3|author=WB Lockwood|publisher=Ladysmith|location=British Columbia|year=1975|quote=An introduction to the rich linguistic heritage of Great Britain and Ireland.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/languagesofbriti0000lock}}</ref> with twelve languages from six groups across four branches of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Language family|family]].

Ice covered almost all of what is now Scotland, most of Ireland and Wales, and the hills of northern England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from Great Britain and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.\n\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about two thousand years ago, various tribes, which spoke [[Celtic languages|Celtic dialects]] of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] group, were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building [[Hadrian's Wall]] to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as Hiberni, the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as Picts and the southern two thirds by Britons.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Alfred Jewel]] (9th century)]]\nAnglo-Saxons arrived as [[Fall of Rome|Roman power waned in the 5th century AD]]. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in [[Hen Ogledd|the north of what is now England]], in [[Cornwall]] and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, for being [[Christianisation of Ireland|Christianised]]\u2014traditionally by the Romano-Briton, Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as [[Dark Ages (historiography)|the Dark Ages]], Ireland entered a [[golden age]] and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|responded with missions]] (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities. These were later joined by [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]s of a similar nature.\n\nViking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and [[Wexford]]. England, however, was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of [[Denmark]]. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in [[Normandy]], in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England in 1066]]. The remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day.  A century later, the marriage of the future [[Henry II of England]] to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] created the [[Angevin Empire]], partially under the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]]. At the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], a provincial king, and under [[Laudabiliter|the authority of]] [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Angevins invaded Ireland]] in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair|the Irish High King]] to ensure the terms of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of [[Lord of Ireland]]. This title was granted to his younger son, but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died, the title of [[King of England]] and Lord of Ireland became entwined in one person.\n\n[[File:James I of England by Daniel Mytens.jpg|thumb|upright|James VI of Scotland (James I of England)]]\n\nBy the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Power in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]]. A similar situation existed in the [[Principality of Wales]], which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England from being [[vassal]] of the [[King of France]]. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as \"the only Supreme Head in Earth of the [[Church of England]]\", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared [[Kingdom of Ireland|a separate kingdom]] in personal union with England.\n\nScotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland [[Union of the Crowns|inherited the Crown of England]], and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in [[Ulster]]. Religious division heightened and the king in England came into conflict with parliament over his tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting [[English Civil War]] or [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] led to a [[revolutionary republic]] in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created a new [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class which obliterated the remnants of Old English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and English, whilst the populace was largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and at the militarily crucial [[Battle of Aughrim]] in Ireland. Resistance held out, eventually forcing the guarantee of religious tolerance in the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. However, the terms were never honoured and a new monarchy was installed.\n\nThe Kingdoms of England and Scotland were [[Acts of Union 1707|unified in 1707]] creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Following an attempted republican [[1798 Rebellion|revolution in Ireland in 1798]], the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were [[Acts of Union 1800|unified in 1801]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North America that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the [[British Empire]] expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate, however, and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working classes. Mass migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919\u20131922), with the six counties that formed Northern Ireland remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics in the British Isles}}\n{{See also|Ireland\u2013United Kingdom relations|Politics of the United Kingdom|Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland\u2013Isle of Man relations|Politics of the Isle of Man|Politics of Jersey|Politics of Guernsey|Politics of Alderney|Politics of Sark|}}\n\n[[File:British Isles terms.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Subdivisions of the British Isles<br />See also [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/British_Isles_Euler_Diagram_13.svg diagrammatic version]]]\n\nThere are two sovereign states in the British Isles: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. Ireland, sometimes called the Republic of Ireland, governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply \"the United Kingdom\", which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The Isle of Man and the two Bailiwicks of the Channel Islands, [[Jersey]] and [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], are known as the [[Crown dependencies]]. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence;<ref name=\"gov.je\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyWorld/InternationalAffairs/Pages/RelationshipEUandUK.aspx |title=Jersey's relationship with the UK and EU |publisher=Gov.je |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> responsibility for international representation rests largely with the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent parts]]: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and Northern Ireland in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have [[Devolution|devolved]] governments, meaning that each has its own parliament or assembly and is self-governing with respect to certain matters set down by law. For judicial purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and [[English law|England and Wales]] (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdictions, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.\n\nIreland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown dependencies are all [[parliamentary democracies]], with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return [[member of parliament|members]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament in London]]. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a [[Scottish Parliament|parliament in Edinburgh]] and to assemblies in [[National Assembly for Wales|Cardiff]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Belfast]] respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule; however, Northern Ireland uses a system of [[Consociationalism|power sharing]] whereby [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and [[Irish nationalist|nationalists]] share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups is required for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland to join with the rest of Ireland.) The [[British monarch]] is the head of state of the United Kingdom, while in the Republic of Ireland the head of state is the [[President of Ireland]].\n\nIreland is part of the European Union (EU) and the UK was part until 31 January 2020.<ref name=\"gov.je\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gov.gg/ccm/navigation/about-guernsey/constitution/ |title=States of Guernsey: Constitution |publisher=Gov.gg |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |title=Relationship with European Union \u2013 Isle of Man Government \u2013 Chief Secretarys Office |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=7 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925081145/http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |archivedate=25 September 2010  }}</ref> Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland are part of the [[Schengen Area]], which allows passport-free travel between certain EU member states. However, since the [[partition of Ireland]], an informal free-travel area has existed across the island of Ireland. This area required formal recognition in 1997 during the course of negotiations for the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of the European Union, and (together with the Crown dependencies) is now known as the [[Common Travel Area]].\n\nReciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional referendums]] in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than what was required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Justice]] report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement, arguing that \"the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries\".<ref>Goldsmith, 2008, [http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Citizenship: Our Common Bond], Ministry of Justice: London {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327121654/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole\u2014for example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI), a charity that operates a lifeboat service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112024357/http://www.rnli.org.uk/home RNLI.org.uk], The RNLI is a charity that provides a 24-hour lifesaving service around the UK and Republic of Ireland.</ref>\n\nThe [[Northern Ireland peace process]] has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both, and the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland also meet as the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] to develop policies common across the island of Ireland. These arrangements were made following the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]].\n\n===British\u2013Irish Council===\n{{main|British\u2013Irish Council}}\n\nAnother body established under the Good Friday Agreement, the British\u2013Irish Council, is made up of all of the states and territories of the British Isles. The [[British\u2013Irish Parliamentary Assembly]] ({{lang-ga|Tion\u00f3l Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na h\u00c9ireann}}) predates the British\u2013Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]], with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[States of Jersey]], the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[High Court of Tynwald]] (Isle of Man).\n\nThe Council does not have executive powers, but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the Parliamentary Assembly has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the British\u2013Irish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council.<ref>[Communiqu\u00e9 of the British-Irish Council], February 2008</ref> Leading on from developments in the British\u2013Irish Council, the chair of the British\u2013Irish Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, [[Niall Blaney]], has suggested that the body should shadow the British\u2013Irish Council's work.<ref>Martina Purdy, 28 February 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7268911.stm Unionists urged to drop boycott], BBC: London</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Culture of Ireland|Culture of the United Kingdom|Sport in Ireland|Sport in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Lords match in progress.jpg|thumb|One Day Cricket International at Lord's; England v Australia 10 July 2005]]\n[[File:P\u00e1draig Harrington 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[P\u00e1draig Harrington]] teeing off at [[the Open Championship]] ([[golf]]) [[2007 Open Championship|in 2007]].]]\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have separate media, although British television, newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |title=Ireland |publisher=Museum.tv |accessdate=17 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214101405/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |archive-date=14 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in the United Kingdom.

A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]] are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.\n\nMany globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including golf, [[association football]], [[Cricket in the British Isles|cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[History of snooker|snooker]] and darts, as well as many minor sports such as [[croquet]], [[bowls]], [[pitch and putt]], [[History of water polo|water polo]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]]. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is association football. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. [[Rugby union]] is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. The [[British and Irish Lions]] is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the Southern Hemisphere rugby-playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] as part of the [[Six Nations Championship]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It is also the name of the Corel graphics suite, which includes the [[bitmap-image editor]] [[Corel Photo-Paint]] as well as other graphics-related programs (see below). The latest version is marketed as CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020 (equivalent to version 22), and was released in March, 2020. CorelDraw is designed to edit two-dimensional images such as logos and posters.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1987, Corel engineers Arseng Antonio and Vicky De Guzman undertook to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems. That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989. CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x ran under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1. The inclusion of [[TrueType]] in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as [[Adobe Type Manager]]; paired with a photo-editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.\n\n=== Features by version ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | CorelDraw\n! colspan=2 | Version support\n! rowspan=2 |Windows<br>Compatibility\n! rowspan=2 | New Features\n|-\n!

It is also the name of the Corel graphics suite, which includes the [[bitmap-image editor]] [[Corel Photo-Paint]] as well as other graphics-related programs (see below). The latest version is marketed as CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020 (equivalent to version 22), and was released in March, 2020. CorelDraw is designed to edit two-dimensional images such as logos and posters.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1987, Corel engineers Arseng Antonio and Vicky De Guzman undertook to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems. That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989. CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x ran under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1. The inclusion of [[TrueType]] in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as [[Adobe Type Manager]]; paired with a photo-editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.\n\n=== Features by version ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | CorelDraw\n! colspan=2 | Version support\n! rowspan=2 |Windows<br>Compatibility\n! rowspan=2 | New Features\n|-\n!

Songs on Chillout Sessions compilations vary in style from [[Lounge music|lounge]] to [[electronica]] and are released by many different artists.\n\nThe Chillout Out genre of compilations started in the UK and since 2003 Ministry of Sound has released them under different tropes such as \"Chilled\", \"After Hours\", \"The Morning After...\" which has shown MOS to have seemingly ended its branding of the genre as Chillout Sessions.\n\nA similar series started in Australia, where the series changed its name from The Chillout Session to The Chillout Sessions and then simply to Chillout Sessions and continued until 2016 with XIX until the record label rebranded to TMRW following the acquisition of MoS by Sony in the UK.\n\nSome Chillout Sessions albums have become known and distinguishable for the symbol of a turntable (with the Ministry of Sound logo on it) frozen in ice, or in one case (''The Summer Collection 2003'') the turntable itself is made of ice. In the UK this motif is used on the covers of volumes 1, 2, ''The Winter Collection (2003)'', ''The Summer Collection'' 2003, and ''The Very Best of'' album. In Australia, the image is used for volumes 1-6 except on volume 3. The idea of the turntable with the Ministry of Sound logo on had been used on the covers of the Ministry of Sound ''Clubbers Guide'' in prior years (and in ''The Annual IV''), the idea of such turntable on the covers was last used on ''Clubbers Guide'' albums in early 2001 when ''The Chillout Session'' began using the idea.\n\n==History==\nMinistry of Sound, as a label, began in 1993 and its first album was the first volume of a series called ''[[Sessions (compilation series)|Sessions]]''. The series was successful enough for it to generate a spin-off series of ''The Chillout Session'', which began in 2001 with a UK Compilation Chart #1 album. Volume 2 was also very successful. The first and second volumes were released in both the UK and Australia, but the series divided in August 2001, with one series for the UK and the other for Australia.\n\nIn the UK, ''Ibiza Chillout Session'' was released in August 2001. Although not as successful as the prior releases, it received positive reviews, as did the ''Ibiza 2002'' album. Though the four albums released were part of the ''[[Sessions (compilation series)|Sessions]]'' series, the fifth album ''The Chillout Annual 2002'' was part of [[The Annual]] series, which was the Ministry of Sound's second series of mix albums, and likewise had ''Ibiza Annual'' spin-offs beginning in 1998.\n\nFollowing the numbered releases (volumes 1 and 2) and both the ''Ibiza...'' releases, the albums were themed to seasons, starting with ''The Winter Collection 2003'' (actually released in late 2002, as the sort of style ''Chillout Annual 2003''). The Summer 2003 edition reached #10 in the UK Compilations Chart. A third ''Ibiza...'' edition, ''Ibiza Sunsets'', was released shortly afterwards. This series, despite sales success, was suspended in favour of other Ministry of Sound albums in 2003. Its final album ''The Very Best of the Chillout Sessions'' was released in late 2003, but did not sell well and until 2011 was the worst-selling album in the series.\n\nMinistry of Sound started the series again in January 2006, with an album titled simply ''The Chillout Sessions'' (titled to reflect the fact that it was a reboot for the series). This album had good sales but there were no subsequent releases.\n\nIn 2007, Ministry of Sound launched a new series, ''Anthems'', beginning with ''[[Ministry of Sound Anthems|Anthems 1991\u20132008]]''. It sold very well and it generated a spin-off album, ''Chilled 1991\u20132008''. This was followed by a second volume in 2009, a third (suited to acoustic chill-out music) in 2010 and a fourth (''Chilled Afterhours'', similar to the label's ''Late Night Sessions'' albums) in 2011. 2011 was also the year that Ministry of Sound launched its large-scale campaign ''20:20'', to celebrate 20 years of The Ministry of Sound as a club. One of the associated releases was the box set ''XX Twenty Years'', each disc made up of a different dance genre; the final disc in the box set was ''Chillout Sessions''. Around the same time, ''Anthems Collection'' was released, with five discs, each from a different genre, the final one being ''Anthems Chilled''.\n\nAmongst the releases from 2002-2004, Ministry of Sound UK also launched spin-off compilations such as ''Late Night Sessions'' and ''Late Night Sessions: Autumn/Winter Collection''.\nWith the genre tiring somewhat (the same songs were appearing repeatedly) Ministry of Sound has continued to release Chill Out genre compilations under different guises in the UK. By 2016 these were distinctly split between house-based chillout tracks (''Chilled House Sessions 1-7, \"Morning After...'') to more chart-friendly (compared to the eclectic range of earlier releases) compilations (''The Chillout Session (2012), Perfectly Chilled'' and ''Just Chillin'''). 2016-2017 has notably been a key focus on chillout albums from MoS, much like the early 00s when Dance music had reached its zenith, due to the EDM emergence in America that has moved onto producing slower electronic tracks that combine synths with slower house rhythms or hip-hop beats.\n\nIn Australia, the series has been a continued success from Volume 3 in 2002. In a different approach from the UK, the Australian series maintained the numbering system as a suffix in its titles, with only the \"Best of...\" style album ''Chillout Classics'' omitting a number from the title.\n\nIn 2016, the Ministry of Sound UK record label was sold to Sony Music. The label is run as an independent and split between A&R and Compilations. The Compilations team were retained when moving to Sony.\n\nSince 2018, Ministry of Sound exclusively moved their Playlists to Apple Music. Many of their well known compilation brands such as Anthems, Fitness, I Love and Chilled have moved to a Playlist format, which accounts for the limited releases of non-streamable Chilled Compilation albums. A notable example is the Chilled House Session series that ran from 2009 to its final release in 2019 (Chilled House Session 9) and is now an exclusive Playlist on Apple Music.\n\n==List of albums in the Ministry of Sound Chillout Genre==\n\n===UK===\n# ''The Chillout Session'' (2001)\n# ''The Chillout Session 2'' (2001)\n# ''Ibiza Chillout Session'' (2001)\n# ''The Chillout Annual 2002'' (2001)\n# ''The Chillout Session: Ibiza 2002'' (2002)\n# ''The Chillout Session 2003: The Winter Collection'' (2002)\n# ''The Karma Collection'' (2002)\n# ''Late Night Sessions'' (2003)\n# ''The Chillout Session: The Summer Collection 2003'' (2003)\n# ''The Chillout Session: Ibiza Sunsets'' (2003)\n# ''The Very Best of the Chillout Session'' (2003)\n# ''Late Night Sessions Autumn Collection'' (2003)\n# ''The Karma Collection Sunrise'' (2003)\n# ''The Chillout Session'' (2006)\n# ''[[Chilled 1991\u20132008]]'' (2008)\n# ''Chilled II 1991\u20132009'' (2009)\n# ''The Chilled House Session'' (2009)\n# ''Chilled Acoustic'' (2010)\n# ''The Winter Sessions'' (2010)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 2'' (2011)\n# ''Chilled Afterhours'' (2011)\n# ''Chillout Session'' (CD4 in ''XX: Twenty Years'', 2011)\n# ''Late Night Sessions'' (2011)\n# ''Anthems Chilled'' (CD5 in ''[[Ministry of Sound Anthems|Anthems Collection]]'', 2011)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 3'' (2012)\n# ''Chillout Session'' (CD4 in ''XX Volume 2'', 2012)\n# ''The Chillout Session 2012'' (2012)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 4'' (2013)\n# ''Chilled House Classics'' (2013)\n# ''Chilled House Ibiza 2013'' (2013)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 5'' (2014)\n# ''Chilled House Ibiza 2014'' (2014)\n# ''The Morning After The Night Before'' (2014)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 6'' (2015)\n# ''Chilled House Ibiza 2015'' (2015)\n# ''Chilled'' (2015)\n# ''Perfectly Chilled'' (2015)\n# ''The Morning After...''

It can be purchased as an MP3 download on [[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]].\n\nThe album itself is a download replacement for ''Chilled 1991\u20132008'', which was never released as a download. It contains twenty-three of the sixty tracks on the album. Its art work is slightly similar, but there is a light blue background rather than a white one, the image is zoomed-in, and the words \"Chilled Sessions\" appear obviously instead of \"Chilled 1991\u20132008\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chilloutmoments.com chilloutmoments.com] - smooth rain, nature and wave sounds to chill.\n* [http://www.di.fm/chillout DI.FM - Chillout] - Online Chillout Radio (free and premium)\n\n[[Category:Chillout Sessions| ]]\n[[Category:Ministry of Sound compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2001 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2002 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2003 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2004 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2005 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2006 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2007 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2008 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2009 compilation albums]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{one source|date=September 2018}}\n{{notability|music|date=September 2018}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2011}}\n\n'''''Chillout Sessions''''' is a series of compilations released by [[Ministry of Sound]] that focus on songs from the [[Chill-out music|chillout]] genre. Songs on Chillout Sessions compilations vary in style from [[Lounge music|lounge]] to [[electronica]] and are released by many different artists.\n\nThe Chillout Out genre of compilations started in the UK and since 2003 Ministry of Sound has released them under different tropes such as \"Chilled\", \"After Hours\", \"The Morning After...\" which has shown MOS to have seemingly ended its branding of the genre as Chillout Sessions.\n\nA similar series started in Australia, where the series changed its name from The Chillout Session to The Chillout Sessions and then simply to Chillout Sessions and continued until 2016 with XIX until the record label rebranded to TMRW following the acquisition of MoS by Sony in the UK.\n\nSome Chillout Sessions albums have become known and distinguishable for the symbol of a turntable (with the Ministry of Sound logo on it) frozen in ice, or in one case (''The Summer Collection 2003'') the turntable itself is made of ice. In the UK this motif is used on the covers of volumes 1, 2, ''The Winter Collection (2003)'', ''The Summer Collection'' 2003, and ''The Very Best of'' album. In Australia, the image is used for volumes 1-6 except on volume 3. The idea of the turntable with the Ministry of Sound logo on had been used on the covers of the Ministry of Sound ''Clubbers Guide'' in prior years (and in ''The Annual IV''), the idea of such turntable on the covers was last used on ''Clubbers Guide'' albums in early 2001 when ''The Chillout Session'' began using the idea.\n\n==History==\nMinistry of Sound, as a label, began in 1993 and its first album was the first volume of a series called ''[[Sessions (compilation series)|Sessions]]''. The series was successful enough for it to generate a spin-off series of ''The Chillout Session'', which began in 2001 with a UK Compilation Chart #1 album. Volume 2 was also very successful. The first and second volumes were released in both the UK and Australia, but the series divided in August 2001, with one series for the UK and the other for Australia.\n\nIn the UK, ''Ibiza Chillout Session'' was released in August 2001. Although not as successful as the prior releases, it received positive reviews, as did the ''Ibiza 2002'' album. Though the four albums released were part of the ''[[Sessions (compilation series)|Sessions]]'' series, the fifth album ''The Chillout Annual 2002'' was part of [[The Annual]] series, which was the Ministry of Sound's second series of mix albums, and likewise had ''Ibiza Annual'' spin-offs beginning in 1998.\n\nFollowing the numbered releases (volumes 1 and 2) and both the ''Ibiza...'' releases, the albums were themed to seasons, starting with ''The Winter Collection 2003'' (actually released in late 2002, as the sort of style ''Chillout Annual 2003''). The Summer 2003 edition reached #10 in the UK Compilations Chart. A third ''Ibiza...'' edition, ''Ibiza Sunsets'', was released shortly afterwards. This series, despite sales success, was suspended in favour of other Ministry of Sound albums in 2003. Its final album ''The Very Best of the Chillout Sessions'' was released in late 2003, but did not sell well and until 2011 was the worst-selling album in the series.\n\nMinistry of Sound started the series again in January 2006, with an album titled simply ''The Chillout Sessions'' (titled to reflect the fact that it was a reboot for the series). This album had good sales but there were no subsequent releases.\n\nIn 2007, Ministry of Sound launched a new series, ''Anthems'', beginning with ''[[Ministry of Sound Anthems|Anthems 1991\u20132008]]''. It sold very well and it generated a spin-off album, ''Chilled 1991\u20132008''. This was followed by a second volume in 2009, a third (suited to acoustic chill-out music) in 2010 and a fourth (''Chilled Afterhours'', similar to the label's ''Late Night Sessions'' albums) in 2011. 2011 was also the year that Ministry of Sound launched its large-scale campaign ''20:20'', to celebrate 20 years of The Ministry of Sound as a club. One of the associated releases was the box set ''XX Twenty Years'', each disc made up of a different dance genre; the final disc in the box set was ''Chillout Sessions''. Around the same time, ''Anthems Collection'' was released, with five discs, each from a different genre, the final one being ''Anthems Chilled''.\n\nAmongst the releases from 2002-2004, Ministry of Sound UK also launched spin-off compilations such as ''Late Night Sessions'' and ''Late Night Sessions: Autumn/Winter Collection''.\nWith the genre tiring somewhat (the same songs were appearing repeatedly) Ministry of Sound has continued to release Chill Out genre compilations under different guises in the UK. By 2016 these were distinctly split between house-based chillout tracks (''Chilled House Sessions 1-7, \"Morning After...'') to more chart-friendly (compared to the eclectic range of earlier releases) compilations (''The Chillout Session (2012), Perfectly Chilled'' and ''Just Chillin'''). 2016-2017 has notably been a key focus on chillout albums from MoS, much like the early 00s when Dance music had reached its zenith, due to the EDM emergence in America that has moved onto producing slower electronic tracks that combine synths with slower house rhythms or hip-hop beats.\n\nIn Australia, the series has been a continued success from Volume 3 in 2002. In a different approach from the UK, the Australian series maintained the numbering system as a suffix in its titles, with only the \"Best of...\" style album ''Chillout Classics'' omitting a number from the title.\n\nIn 2016, the Ministry of Sound UK record label was sold to Sony Music. The label is run as an independent and split between A&R and Compilations. The Compilations team were retained when moving to Sony.\n\nSince 2018, Ministry of Sound exclusively moved their Playlists to Apple Music. Many of their well known compilation brands such as Anthems, Fitness, I Love and Chilled have moved to a Playlist format, which accounts for the limited releases of non-streamable Chilled Compilation albums. A notable example is the Chilled House Session series that ran from 2009 to its final release in 2019 (Chilled House Session 9) and is now an exclusive Playlist on Apple Music.\n\n==List of albums in the Ministry of Sound Chillout Genre==\n\n===UK===\n# ''The Chillout Session'' (2001)\n# ''The Chillout Session 2'' (2001)\n# ''Ibiza Chillout Session'' (2001)\n# ''The Chillout Annual 2002'' (2001)\n# ''The Chillout Session: Ibiza 2002'' (2002)\n# ''The Chillout Session 2003: The Winter Collection'' (2002)\n# ''The Karma Collection'' (2002)\n# ''Late Night Sessions'' (2003)\n# ''The Chillout Session: The Summer Collection 2003'' (2003)\n# ''The Chillout Session: Ibiza Sunsets'' (2003)\n# ''The Very Best of the Chillout Session'' (2003)\n# ''Late Night Sessions Autumn Collection'' (2003)\n# ''The Karma Collection Sunrise'' (2003)\n# ''The Chillout Session'' (2006)\n# ''[[Chilled 1991\u20132008]]'' (2008)\n# ''Chilled II 1991\u20132009'' (2009)\n# ''The Chilled House Session'' (2009)\n# ''Chilled Acoustic'' (2010)\n# ''The Winter Sessions'' (2010)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 2'' (2011)\n# ''Chilled Afterhours'' (2011)\n# ''Chillout Session'' (CD4 in ''XX: Twenty Years'', 2011)\n# ''Late Night Sessions'' (2011)\n# ''Anthems Chilled'' (CD5 in ''[[Ministry of Sound Anthems|Anthems Collection]]'', 2011)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 3'' (2012)\n# ''Chillout Session'' (CD4 in ''XX Volume 2'', 2012)\n# ''The Chillout Session 2012'' (2012)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 4'' (2013)\n# ''Chilled House Classics'' (2013)\n# ''Chilled House Ibiza 2013'' (2013)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 5'' (2014)\n# ''Chilled House Ibiza 2014'' (2014)\n# ''The Morning After The Night Before'' (2014)\n# ''The Chilled House Session 6'' (2015)\n# ''Chilled House Ibiza 2015'' (2015)\n# ''Chilled'' (2015)\n# ''Perfectly Chilled'' (2015)\n# ''The Morning After...''

It is themed to chillout songs which use [[Acoustic music|acoustic guitars]], following the themed ''Anthems Electronic 80s'' release in November 2009.\n\nA printing error was made on every copy of the album. The top half of the Ministry of Sound logo, which appears on the reverse side of the digipack, is accidentally printed upside down. This error, however, has never been corrected for future releases.\n\n==Chillout Afterhours==\nThe fourth installment album in the series was released in May 2011, ''Chilled Afterhours''. It is an album designed for \"after hours\" playing.\n\n==Chilled Sessions==\nReleased on the same day as ''Chilled 1991\u20132008'', a specific download release, titled ''Chilled Sessions'', was released. It can be purchased as an MP3 download on [[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]].\n\nThe album itself is a download replacement for ''Chilled 1991\u20132008'', which was never released as a download. It contains twenty-three of the sixty tracks on the album. Its art work is slightly similar, but there is a light blue background rather than a white one, the image is zoomed-in, and the words \"Chilled Sessions\" appear obviously instead of \"Chilled 1991\u20132008\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chilloutmoments.com chilloutmoments.com] - smooth rain, nature and wave sounds to chill.\n* [http://www.di.fm/chillout DI.FM - Chillout] - Online Chillout Radio (free and premium)\n\n[[Category:Chillout Sessions| ]]\n[[Category:Ministry of Sound compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2001 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2002 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2003 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2004 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2005 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2006 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2007 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2008 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2009 compilation albums]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toSweet Harmony(link changed toSweet Harmony (The Beloved song)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillout_Sessions"}
