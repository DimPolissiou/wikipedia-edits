It is a [[remake]] of the 1933 [[King Kong (1933 film)|film of the same name]] about a giant [[ape]] that is captured and taken to New York City for exhibition. Featuring [[special effects]] by [[Carlo Rambaldi]], it stars [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Charles Grodin]] and [[Jessica Lange]] in her first film role.\n\nThe idea to remake ''King Kong'' was conceived by [[Michael Eisner]], who was then an ABC executive, in 1974. He separately proposed the idea to [[Universal Pictures]] CEO [[Sidney Sheinberg]] and Paramount Pictures CEO [[Barry Diller]]. Dino De Laurentiis quickly acquired the film rights from [[RKO-General]] and subsequently hired television writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] to write the script. John Guillermin was hired as director and filming lasted from January to August 1976. Before the film's release, Universal Pictures sued De Laurentiis and RKO-General alleging a breach of contract and attempted to develop their own remake of ''King Kong''. In response, De Laurentiis and RKO-General filed separate countersuits against Universal Pictures, all of which were withdrawn by January 1976. \n\nThe film was released on December 17, 1976 to mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. Of the three ''King Kong'' main films, it is the only one to feature the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] instead of the [[Empire State Building]]. A sequel titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]'' was released in 1986.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nFred Wilson, an executive of the Petrox Oil Company, forms an expedition based on infrared imagery which reveals a previously undiscovered [[Indian Ocean]] island hidden by a permanent cloud bank. Wilson believes that the island holds vast untapped deposits of oil, a potential fortune which he is determined to secure for Petrox. Unknown to Wilson or the crew, Jack Prescott, a primate [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] who wants to see the island for himself, has stowed away on the expedition's vessel, the ''Petrox Explorer''. Prescott reveals himself when he warns the crew that the cloud bank may be caused by some unknown, and potentially dangerous, phenomenon. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, believing him to be a spy from a rival oil company. \n\nWhile being escorted to lock-up, Prescott spots a life raft which, upon inspection, is found to be carrying a young woman who is unconscious. After conducting a thorough background check on the 'spy', Wilson realizes that he is telling the truth and appoints Prescott as the expedition's official photographer, requesting that, due to his medical training, he be present when the woman revives. When she does regain consciousness, she says her name is Dwan, and states that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director's yacht, which suddenly and inexplicably exploded.\n\nWhen the ''Petrox Explorer'' arrives at the island, the team discovers a primitive tribe of [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] who live within the confines of a gigantic wall. The tribal chief shows an immediate interest in the blonde Dwan, offering to trade several of the native women for her, an offer firmly rejected by Jack. The team then learn that while the island does indeed contain large deposits of oil, it is of such low quality that it is unusable. Later that night, the natives secretly board the ship and kidnap Dwan, drugging her and offering her as a [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] to a giant, monstrous ape known as [[King Kong|Kong]]. Kong encounters and frees Dwan from the stronghold before retreating into the depths of the island. Although he is an awesome and terrifying sight, the kind-hearted Kong quickly becomes infatuated by Dwan, whose rambling monologue both calms and fascinates the great ape, taming his baser, more violent instincts. After Dwan falls into mud, Kong takes her to a waterfall to wash her up and dries her with great gusts of his warm breath.\n\nIn the meantime, Jack and First Mate Carnahan lead several crew members on a rescue mission to save Dwan. The search party soon encounter Kong while crossing a log bridge. Enraged by the intrusion into his territory, Kong starts to roll the huge log, sending Carnahan and all but one of the team plummeting to their deaths, leaving Jack and Crewman Boan as the only surviving ones alive. While Boan returns to the village to alert the others at Jack's insistence, Jack decides to keep looking for Dwan. Meanwhile, Kong takes Dwan to his lair, but as he starts to undress her, a giant [[boa constrictor]] appears and attacks them. While Kong is distracted fighting the giant snake as it coils itself around him, Jack arrives and rescues Dwan. When Kong discovers Jack and Dwan escaping, he violently kills the snake and chases them through the jungle back to the native village. Smashing down the huge gates, Kong falls into a [[Trapping pit|pit trap]] that Wilson and the crew have dug, where he is overwhelmed by [[chloroform]].\n\nAfter learning that the oil cannot be refined, Wilson has instead decided to salvage the expedition by transporting the captive Kong to America as a promotional gimmick for Petrox. Kong is then loaded in the cargo hold, where he is later fed with tons of fruit. Although Dwan and Jack are upset at Kong's treatment, the great ape starts to grow increasingly distressed throughout the journey. One night, Dwan accidentally falls into the cargo hold, only for Kong to catch her. After Dwan is rescued, the captain of the ''Petrox Explorer'' orders the hold to be flooded, but Kong becomes calm and allows Dwan to climb back out. When they finally reach New York City, Kong is put on display, bound in chains with a large cage around his body from the neck down and a large crown on his head. When Kong sees a group of reporters pushing and shoving Dwan for interviews, the ape, thinking that she is being provoked, breaks free of his bonds. A stampede ensues as panic engulfs the throng, with people crushed and trampled by Kong's massive feet as he walks through the crowd searching for Dwan. Wilson, trying to flee, loses his footing and is crushed underfoot by Kong.\n\nJack and Dwan flee across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] to [[Manhattan]] and take refuge in an abandoned bar, where Jack notices a similarity between the Manhattan skyline (notably the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers of the World Trade Center]]) and the mountainous terrain of Kong's island. He runs downstairs to call the mayor's office and agrees to tell them on the condition that Kong is captured alive. When the mayor's office agrees, Jack tells them to let Kong climb to the top of the World Trade Center, where he can be safely captured. Before Jack can return, Kong, using his enhanced senses, discovers Dwan and snatches her from the bar before making his way to the World Trade Center with Jack and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] catching up in pursuit.\n\nKong climbs to the roof of the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] of the World Trade Center, where he is attacked by soldiers armed with [[flamethrower]]s, much to Jack's dismay. Kong manages to evade them with a spectacular leap across to the roof of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]]. He rips off pieces of equipment from the roof and throws them at the soldiers, killing them when he throws a tank of flammable material. After ensuring Dwan's safety, Kong is attacked by helicopters with [[machine gun]]s, but destroys one of them. Dwan desperately pleads for the military to break off their assault and let Kong live, but the pilots only continue to attack the giant ape. Eventually, the relentless shower of bullets finally brings down Kong. As Dwan approaches the wounded Kong and puts out her hand to touch him, he rolls over the edge of the roof to his death, finally crashing to the plaza hundreds of feet below. \n\nDwan rushes down to comfort Kong and tearfully watches him as the giant ape takes his last breath and dies peacefully. An enormous crowd gathers around Dwan and Kong's corpse while Jack fights his way through the crowd to get to Dwan. However, he is stopped short by police as she is surrounded by journalists and paparazzi, despite her cries to him though they were soon married after this and they lived happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jack Prescott\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Dwan\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Fred S.

In December 1974, [[Michael Eisner]], then an executive for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], watched the original film on television and struck on the idea for a remake. He pitched the idea to [[Barry Diller]], the chairman and CEO of [[Paramount Pictures]], who then enlisted veteran producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] to work on the project. However, De Laurentiis claimed the idea to remake ''King Kong'' was solely his own when he saw a ''Kong'' poster in his daughter's bedroom as he woke her up every morning. When Diller suggested doing a monster film with him, De Laurentiis proposed the idea to remake ''King Kong''.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\">{{cite magazine|last=Tobias|first=Andrew|title=The Battle for King Kong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-MCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q=the%20battle%20for%20king%20kong%20new%20york%20magazine|pages=38\u201344|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 23, 1976|accessdate=July 30, 2018|volume=9|issue=8|issn=0028-7369|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> Diller and De Laurentiis provisionally agreed that Paramount would pay half of the film's proposed $12 million budget in return for the distribution rights in the United States and Canada if the former could purchase the film rights of the original film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=150}}\n\nDe Laurentiis later contacted his friend [[Thomas F. O'Neil]], president of [[General Tire and Rubber Company|General Tire]] and [[RKO General|RKO-General]], who informed him that the film rights were indeed available. Later, De Laurentiis and company executive Frederic Sidewater entered formal negotiations with Daniel O'Shea, a semi-retired attorney for RKO-General, who requested a percentage of the film's gross. On May 6, 1975, De Laurentiis paid RKO-General $200,000 plus a percentage of the film's gross.<ref name=\"KingKongBattle\">{{cite news|last=Champlin|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Champlin|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/382721599/|title=A Ding-Dong King Kong Battle|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=Part IV, p. 1|date=November 5, 1975|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-access=subscription|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> After finalizing the agreement with Paramount, De Laurentiis and Sidewater began meeting with foreign distributors and set the film's release for Christmas 1976.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=151}}\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=45%|quote=We made a very deliberate attempt not to be anything like the original movie in tone or mood.

Impressed with his work on the film, De Laurentiis contacted Semple about writing ''King Kong'', in which Semple immediately signed on. During their collaboration on the project, De Laurentiis already had two ideas in mind\u2014that the film would set in present day and the climax would set on top of the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=152}}\n\nBecause of the risen sophistication in audiences' tastes since the original film, Semple sought to maintain a realistic tone, but infuse the script with a sly, ironic sense of humor that the audiences could laugh at. Having settled on the mood, Semple retained the basic plotline and set pieces from the original film, but updated and reworked other elements of the story. Inspired by the [[1970s energy crisis|then-ongoing energy crisis]] and a suggestion from his friend Jerry Brick, Semple changed the expedition to being mounted by Petrox Corporation, a giant petroleum conglomerate whom suspected that Kong's island has unrefined oil reserves. In its original story outline, Petrox would discover Kong's island from a map hidden in the secret archives at the [[Vatican Library]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nIn a notable departure from the original film, Semple dropped the dinosaurs that are present with Kong on the island. The reasons for the dropped subplot was due to the increased attention on Kong and Dwan's love story and financial reasons as De Laurentiis did not want to use [[stop-motion animation]] in the film. Nevertheless, a giant [[boa constrictor]] was incorporated into the film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nA fast writer, Semple completed a forty-page outline within a few days and delivered it in August 1975. While De Laurentiis was pleased with Semple's outline, he expressed displeasure with the Vatican Library subplot, which was immediately dropped. It would later be replaced with Petrox discovering the island through obtained classified photos taken by a United States [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=154\u20135}} Within a month, the 140-page first draft incorporated the character of Dwan (who according to the script was originally named Dawn until she switched the two middle letters to make it more memorable), the updated rendition of Ann Darrow from the 1933 film. For its second draft, the script was reduced to 110 pages.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=155\u20136}} The final draft was completed by December 1975.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=160}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Meryl Streep]] has said that she was considered for the role of Dwan, but was deemed too unattractive by producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]].<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Graham Norton Show|series-link=The Graham Norton Show  |network= [[BBC]]|series-no=16|number=13|title=Meryl Streep's worst audition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvWF20AfNS4|date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> Dwan was also proposed to [[Barbra Streisand]] but she turned it down.<ref>Medved, Michael, and Harry Medved.

De Laurentiis's next choice was director [[John Guillermin]] who had just finished directing ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''.{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=154\u20135}} Guillermin, who was known to have had outbursts from time to time on the set, got into a public shouting match with executive producer Federico De Laurentiis (son of producer Dino De Laurentiis). After the incident, De Laurentiis was reported to have threatened to fire Guillermin if he did not start treating the cast and crew better.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=93}} [[Rick Baker]], who designed and wore the [[ape suit]] in collaboration with [[Carlo Rambaldi]], was extremely disappointed in the final suit, which he felt was not at all convincing.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=209}} He gives all the credit for its passable appearance to cinematographer [[Richard H. Kline]]. The only time that the collaboration of Baker and Rambaldi went smoothly was during the design of the mechanical Kong mask. Baker's design and Rambaldi's cable work combined to give Kong's face a wide range of expression that was responsible for much of the film's emotional impact. Baker gave much of the credit for its effectiveness to Rambaldi and his mechanics.\n\nTo film the scene where the ''Petrox Explorer'' finds Dwan in the life raft, Jessica Lange spent hours in a rubber raft in the freezing cold, drenched and wearing only a slinky black dress. Although Lange was not aware of it, there were [[shark]]s circling the raft the entire time. Shooting of this scene took place in the channel between Los Angeles and Catalina Island during the last week in January 1976.\n\nOn one of the nights of filming Kong's death at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], over 30,000 people showed up at the site to be [[extra (actor)|extra]]s for the scene. Although the crowd was well behaved, the [[Port Authority of New York & New Jersey]] (owner of the World Trade Center complex) became concerned that the weight of so many people would cause the plaza to collapse, and ordered the producers to shut down the filming.  However, the film makers had already got the shot they wanted of the large crowd rushing toward Kong's body.

Shortly after, Universal decided to purchase the property as an opportunity to showcase its new sound system technology, [[Sensurround]], which debuted with the [[disaster film]] ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'', for Kong's roars. On April 5, 1975, Daniel O'Shea, a semi-attorney for RKO-General, had arranged meetings with Arnold Stane, attorney for MCA/Universal, and De Laurentiis and Sidewater for the film rights to ''King Kong''; neither side knew that a rival studio were in negotiation. With a bargain price set $150,000, Stane had negotiated an offer of $200,000 plus 5 percent of the film's net profit. In contrast, De Laurentiis had offered $200,000 plus 3 percent of the film's gross\u2014and 10 percent if the film recouped two and a half its negative cost. In May 1975, the film rights were granted to De Laurentiis.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nIn the wake of the agreement, Shane claimed that O'Shea had verbally accepted Universal's offer although no official paperwork was signed. O'Shea contested, \"I did not make any agreement written or oral ... never told him we had an agreement, nor words to that effect ... never told him that I had the authority ... I am not an employee, agent, or officer at RKO.\"<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" /> A few days later, Universal filed suit against De Laurentiis and RKO-General in [[Los Angeles Superior Court]] for $25 million on charges of breach of contract, fraud, and intentional interference with advantageous business relations. In October 1975, Universal, which was in pre-production with their own remake with [[Hunt Stromberg, Jr.]], as producer and [[Joseph Sargent]] as director, filed suit in a federal district court arguing that the story's \"basic ingredients\" were [[public domain]].<ref name=\"KingKongBattle\" /> Universal had claimed that their remake was based on the two-part serialization by [[Edgar Wallace]] and a novelization by [[Delos W. Lovelace]] adapted from the screenplay that had been published shortly before the film's release in 1933.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nOn November 12, 1975, Universal announced it would start production on ''The Legend of King Kong'' on January 5, 1976 with [[Bo Goldman]] writing the screenplay based on the novelization by Lovelace.<ref>{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Mary|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/166074278/|title=Anjelica's Visage Wins Role|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=Part IV, p. 11|url-access=subscription|via=Newspapers.com|date=November 12, 1975|accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref> On November 20, RKO-General countersued Universal for $5 million alleging that ''The Legend of King Kong'' was an infringement on their copyright, and asked the court to prevent any \"announcements, representations, and statements\" on their proposed film. On December 4, De Laurentiis countersued for $90 million with charges of copyright infringement and \"unfair competition\".{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=162}} In January 1976, both studios agreed to withdraw their legal suits filed against each other. Universal agreed to cancel ''The Legend of King Kong'', but intended to proceed with a remake sometime in the future although on the condition to release it eighteen months after De Laurentiis's remake.<ref>{{cite news|title=Producers Settle Dispute on 'King Kong' Remakes|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/382977325/|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|via=Newspapers.com|url-access=subscription|date=January 30, 1976|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=166}} In September 1976, a federal judge ruled in favor of Universal that Lovelace's novelization had fallen into public domain which cleared the studio to produce a remake.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kong Goes Public|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/398658902/|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Constitution]]|page=2\u2013B|date=September 16, 1976|accessdate=August 2, 2018|url-access=subscription|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Universal would later make its own remake, also titled ''[[King Kong (2005)|King Kong]]'' in 2005.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''King Kong'' was commercially successful, earning [[Paramount Pictures]] back over triple its budget.

[[Pauline Kael]] from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the film, noting \"The movie is a romantic adventure fantasy-colossal, silly, touching, a marvellous [''sic''] Classics Comics movie (and for the whole family). This new ''Kong'' doesn't have the magical primeval imagery of the first ''King Kong'', in 1933, and it doesn't have the [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] fable atmosphere, but it's a happier, livelier entertainment. The first ''Kong'' was a stunt film that was trying to awe you, and its lewd underlay had a carnival hucksterism that made you feel a little queasy.

When ''King Kong'' made its television debut over two nights in October 1978, around 45 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make the film longer, and it had some added or replaced music cues. Additionally, in order to obtain a lower, [[family-friendly]] TV rating, overtly violent or sexual scenes in the theatrical version were trimmed down or replaced with less explicit takes, and all swearing or potentially offensive language was removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=520761|title=King Kong (1976) Theatrical Cut-TV Extended Version Comparison|publisher=Movie-Censorship}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=934778|title=King Kong (1976) Theatrical Cut-TV Extended Version Comparison #2|publisher=Movie-Censorship}}</ref> Further extended broadcasts followed in November 1980 and March 1983.\n\n===Home video===\nThe theatrical version of the film has been released numerous times worldwide on all known home video formats.

It is a [[remake]] of the 1933 [[King Kong (1933 film)|film of the same name]] about a giant [[ape]] that is captured and taken to New York City for exhibition. Featuring [[special effects]] by [[Carlo Rambaldi]], it stars [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Charles Grodin]] and [[Jessica Lange]] in her first film role.\n\nThe idea to remake ''King Kong'' was conceived by [[Michael Eisner]], who was then an ABC executive, in 1974. He separately proposed the idea to [[Universal Pictures]] CEO [[Sidney Sheinberg]] and Paramount Pictures CEO [[Barry Diller]]. Dino De Laurentiis quickly acquired the film rights from [[RKO-General]] and subsequently hired television writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] to write the script. John Guillermin was hired as director and filming lasted from January to August 1976. Before the film's release, Universal Pictures sued De Laurentiis and RKO-General alleging a breach of contract and attempted to develop their own remake of ''King Kong''. In response, De Laurentiis and RKO-General filed separate countersuits against Universal Pictures, all of which were withdrawn by January 1976. \n\nThe film was released on December 17, 1976 to mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. Of the three ''King Kong'' main films, it is the only one to feature the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] instead of the [[Empire State Building]]. A sequel titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]'' was released in 1986.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nFred Wilson, an executive of the Petrox Oil Company, forms an expedition based on infrared imagery which reveals a previously undiscovered [[Indian Ocean]] island hidden by a permanent cloud bank. Wilson believes that the island holds vast untapped deposits of oil, a potential fortune which he is determined to secure for Petrox. Unknown to Wilson or the crew, Jack Prescott, a primate [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] who wants to see the island for himself, has stowed away on the expedition's vessel, the ''Petrox Explorer''. Prescott reveals himself when he warns the crew that the cloud bank may be caused by some unknown, and potentially dangerous, phenomenon. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, believing him to be a spy from a rival oil company. \n\nWhile being escorted to lock-up, Prescott spots a life raft which, upon inspection, is found to be carrying a young woman who is unconscious. After conducting a thorough background check on the 'spy', Wilson realizes that he is telling the truth and appoints Prescott as the expedition's official photographer, requesting that, due to his medical training, he be present when the woman revives. When she does regain consciousness, she says her name is Dwan, and states that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director's yacht, which suddenly and inexplicably exploded.\n\nWhen the ''Petrox Explorer'' arrives at the island, the team discovers a primitive tribe of [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] who live within the confines of a gigantic wall. The tribal chief shows an immediate interest in the blonde Dwan, offering to trade several of the native women for her, an offer firmly rejected by Jack. The team then learn that while the island does indeed contain large deposits of oil, it is of such low quality that it is unusable. Later that night, the natives secretly board the ship and kidnap Dwan, drugging her and offering her as a [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] to a giant, monstrous ape known as [[King Kong|Kong]]. Kong encounters and frees Dwan from the stronghold before retreating into the depths of the island. Although he is an awesome and terrifying sight, the kind-hearted Kong quickly becomes infatuated by Dwan, whose rambling monologue both calms and fascinates the great ape, taming his baser, more violent instincts. After Dwan falls into mud, Kong takes her to a waterfall to wash her up and dries her with great gusts of his warm breath.\n\nIn the meantime, Jack and First Mate Carnahan lead several crew members on a rescue mission to save Dwan. The search party soon encounter Kong while crossing a log bridge. Enraged by the intrusion into his territory, Kong starts to roll the huge log, sending Carnahan and all but one of the team plummeting to their deaths, leaving Jack and Crewman Boan as the only surviving ones alive. While Boan returns to the village to alert the others at Jack's insistence, Jack decides to keep looking for Dwan. Meanwhile, Kong takes Dwan to his lair, but as he starts to undress her, a giant [[boa constrictor]] appears and attacks them. While Kong is distracted fighting the giant snake as it coils itself around him, Jack arrives and rescues Dwan. When Kong discovers Jack and Dwan escaping, he violently kills the snake and chases them through the jungle back to the native village. Smashing down the huge gates, Kong falls into a [[Trapping pit|pit trap]] that Wilson and the crew have dug, where he is overwhelmed by [[chloroform]].\n\nAfter learning that the oil cannot be refined, Wilson has instead decided to salvage the expedition by transporting the captive Kong to America as a promotional gimmick for Petrox. Kong is then loaded in the cargo hold, where he is later fed with tons of fruit. Although Dwan and Jack are upset at Kong's treatment, the great ape starts to grow increasingly distressed throughout the journey. One night, Dwan accidentally falls into the cargo hold, only for Kong to catch her. After Dwan is rescued, the captain of the ''Petrox Explorer'' orders the hold to be flooded, but Kong becomes calm and allows Dwan to climb back out. When they finally reach New York City, Kong is put on display, bound in chains with a large cage around his body from the neck down and a large crown on his head. When Kong sees a group of reporters pushing and shoving Dwan for interviews, the ape, thinking that she is being provoked, breaks free of his bonds. A stampede ensues as panic engulfs the throng, with people crushed and trampled by Kong's massive feet as he walks through the crowd searching for Dwan. Wilson, trying to flee, loses his footing and is crushed underfoot by Kong.\n\nJack and Dwan flee across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] to [[Manhattan]] and take refuge in an abandoned bar, where Jack notices a similarity between the Manhattan skyline (notably the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers of the World Trade Center]]) and the mountainous terrain of Kong's island. He runs downstairs to call the mayor's office and agrees to tell them on the condition that Kong is captured alive. When the mayor's office agrees, Jack tells them to let Kong climb to the top of the World Trade Center, where he can be safely captured. Before Jack can return, Kong, using his enhanced senses, discovers Dwan and snatches her from the bar before making his way to the World Trade Center with Jack and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] catching up in pursuit.\n\nKong climbs to the roof of the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] of the World Trade Center, where he is attacked by soldiers armed with [[flamethrower]]s, much to Jack's dismay. Kong manages to evade them with a spectacular leap across to the roof of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]]. He rips off pieces of equipment from the roof and throws them at the soldiers, killing them when he throws a tank of flammable material. After ensuring Dwan's safety, Kong is attacked by helicopters with [[machine gun]]s, but destroys one of them. Dwan desperately pleads for the military to break off their assault and let Kong live, but the pilots only continue to attack the giant ape. Eventually, the relentless shower of bullets finally brings down Kong. As Dwan approaches the wounded Kong and puts out her hand to touch him, he rolls over the edge of the roof to his death, finally crashing to the plaza hundreds of feet below. \n\nDwan rushes down to comfort Kong and tearfully watches him as the giant ape takes his last breath and dies peacefully. An enormous crowd gathers around Dwan and Kong's corpse while Jack fights his way through the crowd to get to Dwan. However, he is stopped short by police as she is surrounded by journalists and paparazzi, despite her cries to him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jack Prescott\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Dwan\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Fred S.

In December 1974, [[Michael Eisner]], then an executive for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], watched the original film on television and struck on the idea for a remake. He pitched the idea to [[Barry Diller]], the chairman and CEO of [[Paramount Pictures]], who then enlisted veteran producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] to work on the project. However, De Laurentiis claimed the idea to remake ''King Kong'' was solely his own when he saw a ''Kong'' poster in his daughter's bedroom as he woke her up every morning. When Diller suggested doing a monster film with him, De Laurentiis proposed the idea to remake ''King Kong''.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\">{{cite magazine|last=Tobias|first=Andrew|title=The Battle for King Kong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-MCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q=the%20battle%20for%20king%20kong%20new%20york%20magazine|pages=38\u201344|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 23, 1976|accessdate=July 30, 2018|volume=9|issue=8|issn=0028-7369|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> Diller and De Laurentiis provisionally agreed that Paramount would pay half of the film's proposed $12 million budget in return for the distribution rights in the United States and Canada if the former could purchase the film rights of the original film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=150}}\n\nDe Laurentiis later contacted his friend [[Thomas F.

Later, De Laurentiis and company executive Frederic Sidewater entered formal negotiations with Daniel O'Shea, a semi-retired attorney for RKO-General, who requested a percentage of the film's gross.

Impressed with his work on the film, De Laurentiis contacted Semple about writing ''King Kong'', in which Semple immediately signed on. During their collaboration on the project, De Laurentiis already had two ideas in mind\u2014that the film would set in present day and the climax would set on top of the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=152}}\n\nBecause of the risen sophistication in audiences' tastes since the original film, Semple sought to maintain a realistic tone, but infuse the script with a sly, ironic sense of humor that the audiences could laugh at. Having settled on the mood, Semple retained the basic plotline and set pieces from the original film, but updated and reworked other elements of the story. Inspired by the [[1970s energy crisis|then-ongoing energy crisis]] and a suggestion from his friend Jerry Brick, Semple changed the expedition to being mounted by Petrox Corporation, a giant petroleum conglomerate whom suspected that Kong's island has unrefined oil reserves. In its original story outline, Petrox would discover Kong's island from a map hidden in the secret archives at the [[Vatican Library]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nIn a notable departure from the original film, Semple dropped the dinosaurs that are present with Kong on the island. The reasons for the dropped subplot was due to the increased attention on Kong and Dwan's love story and financial reasons as De Laurentiis did not want to use [[stop-motion animation]] in the film. Nevertheless, a giant [[boa constrictor]] was incorporated into the film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nA fast writer, Semple completed a forty-page outline within a few days and delivered it in August 1975. While De Laurentiis was pleased with Semple's outline, he expressed displeasure with the Vatican Library subplot, which was immediately dropped. It would later be replaced with Petrox discovering the island through obtained classified photos taken by a United States [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=154\u20135}} Within a month, the 140-page first draft incorporated the character of Dwan (who according to the script was originally named Dawn until she switched the two middle letters to make it more memorable), the updated rendition of Ann Darrow from the 1933 film. For its second draft, the script was reduced to 110 pages.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=155\u20136}} The final draft was completed by December 1975.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=160}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Meryl Streep]] has said that she was considered for the role of Dwan, but was deemed too unattractive by producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]].<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Graham Norton Show|series-link=The Graham Norton Show  |network= [[BBC]]|series-no=16|number=13|title=Meryl Streep's worst audition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvWF20AfNS4|date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> Dwan was also proposed to [[Barbra Streisand]] but she turned it down.<ref>Medved, Michael, and Harry Medved.

After the incident, De Laurentiis was reported to have threatened to fire Guillermin if he did not start treating the cast and crew better.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=93}} [[Rick Baker]], who designed and wore the [[ape suit]] in collaboration with [[Carlo Rambaldi]], was extremely disappointed in the final suit, which he felt was not at all convincing.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=209}} He gives all the credit for its passable appearance to cinematographer [[Richard H. Kline]]. The only time that the collaboration of Baker and Rambaldi went smoothly was during the design of the mechanical Kong mask. Baker's design and Rambaldi's cable work combined to give Kong's face a wide range of expression that was responsible for much of the film's emotional impact. Baker gave much of the credit for its effectiveness to Rambaldi and his mechanics.\n\nTo film the scene where the ''Petrox Explorer'' finds Dwan in the life raft, Jessica Lange spent hours in a rubber raft in the freezing cold, drenched and wearing only a slinky black dress. Although Lange was not aware of it, there were [[shark]]s circling the raft the entire time. Shooting of this scene took place in the channel between Los Angeles and Catalina Island during the last week in January 1976.\n\nOn one of the nights of filming Kong's death at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], over 30,000 people showed up at the site to be [[extra (actor)|extra]]s for the scene. Although the crowd was well behaved, the [[Port Authority of New York & New Jersey]] (owner of the World Trade Center complex) became concerned that the weight of so many people would cause the plaza to collapse, and ordered the producers to shut down the filming.  However, the film makers had already got the shot they wanted of the large crowd rushing toward Kong's body. They returned to the site days later to finish filming the scene, with a much smaller crowd of paid extras.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|pp=218\u201328}}\n\nAccording to Bahrenburg, five different masks were created by Carlo Rambaldi to convey various emotions.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|p=177}} Separate masks were necessary as there were too many cables and mechanics required for all the expressions to fit in one single mask.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|pp=176\u201377}} To complete the look of a gorilla, Baker wore contact lenses so his eyes would resemble those of a gorilla.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|p=177}}\n\nRambaldi's mechanical Kong was 40&nbsp;ft (12.2 m) tall and weighed 6{{sfrac|1|2}} tons.{{sfn|Bahrenburg|1976|p=204}} It cost \u00a3500,000 to create.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/jul/13/observer-archive-king-kong-expensive-remake|title=From the Observer archive 11 July 1976: King Kong dogged by costly mishaps|last=Foley|first=Charles|date=July 12, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> Despite months of preparation, the final device proved to be impossible to operate convincingly, and is only seen in a series of brief shots totaling less than 15 seconds.\n\nThe roar used for Kong was taken from the film ''[[The Lost World (1960 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1960).\n\n==Music==\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].

Shortly after, Universal decided to purchase the property as an opportunity to showcase its new sound system technology, [[Sensurround]], which debuted with the [[disaster film]] ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'', for Kong's roars. On April 5, 1975, Daniel O'Shea, a semi-attorney for RKO-General, had arranged meetings with Arnold Stane, attorney for MCA/Universal, and De Laurentiis and Sidewater for the film rights to ''King Kong''; neither side knew that a rival studio were in negotiation. With a bargain price set $150,000, Stane had negotiated an offer of $200,000 plus 5 percent of the film's net profit. In contrast, De Laurentiis had offered $200,000 plus 3 percent of the film's gross\u2014and 10 percent if the film recouped two and a half its negative cost. In May 1975, the film rights were granted to De Laurentiis.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nIn the wake of the agreement, Shane claimed that O'Shea had verbally accepted Universal's offer although no official paperwork was signed. O'Shea contested, \"I did not make any agreement written or oral ... never told him we had an agreement, nor words to that effect ... never told him that I had the authority ... I am not an employee, agent, or officer at RKO.\"<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" /> A few days later, Universal filed suit against De Laurentiis and RKO-General in [[Los Angeles Superior Court]] for $25 million on charges of breach of contract, fraud, and intentional interference with advantageous business relations. In October 1975, Universal, which was in pre-production with their own remake with [[Hunt Stromberg, Jr.]], as producer and [[Joseph Sargent]] as director, filed suit in a federal district court arguing that the story's \"basic ingredients\" were [[public domain]].<ref name=\"KingKongBattle\" /> Universal had claimed that their remake was based on the two-part serialization by [[Edgar Wallace]] and a novelization by [[Delos W.

This new ''Kong'' doesn't have the magical primeval imagery of the first ''King Kong'', in 1933, and it doesn't have the [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] fable atmosphere, but it's a happier, livelier entertainment. The first ''Kong'' was a stunt film that was trying to awe you, and its lewd underlay had a carnival hucksterism that made you feel a little queasy.

When ''King Kong'' made its television debut over two nights in October 1978, around 45 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make the film longer, and it had some added or replaced music cues. Additionally, in order to obtain a lower, [[family-friendly]] TV rating, overtly violent or sexual scenes in the theatrical version were trimmed down or replaced with less explicit takes, and all swearing or potentially offensive language was removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=520761|title=King Kong (1976) Theatrical Cut-TV Extended Version Comparison|publisher=Movie-Censorship}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=934778|title=King Kong (1976) Theatrical Cut-TV Extended Version Comparison #2|publisher=Movie-Censorship}}</ref> Further extended broadcasts followed in November 1980 and March 1983.\n\n===Home video===\nThe theatrical version of the film has been released numerous times worldwide on all known home video formats.

In 1936, women comprised 15 percent of the total enrollment.\n\n===Graduate School of Business Administration===\nThe '''Graduate School of Business Administration''' was launched in 1916, and was housed in the NYU's School of Commerce's Wall Street branch.<ref>\"In 1916, the School of Commerce's Wall Street branch became the home of New York University's Graduate School of Business Administration (GBA).\" {{cite book |title=Contemporary Challenges: American Business in a Global Economy\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=081471868X  |isbn=081471868X\n|author=Daniel E Diamond |date=1995}}</ref> Located in New York's downtown business district, the school's \"Wall Street Division\" served both full-time and currently employed students.

In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959\u20131966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970.\n<!--a series of publications followed... HIST/DIF can identify these -->\n\n===Commerce/College of Business and Public Administration===\nThe School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance was renamed the College of Business and Public Administration in 1972. In the same year, Tisch Hall, designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]] (see also: [[Bobst Library]] and Meyer Building) opened at 40 West Fourth Street to house the undergraduate college.\n\n===Stern===\nIn 1988, a $30 million gift from the school's alumnus Leonard N. Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.

In 1913, Jeanette Hamill, J.D., M.A., joined the school's Economics department, becoming its first female faculty member. In 1936, women comprised 15 percent of the total enrollment.\n\n===Graduate School of Business Administration===\nThe '''Graduate School of Business Administration''' was launched in 1916, and was housed in the NYU's School of Commerce's Wall Street branch.<ref>\"In 1916, the School of Commerce's Wall Street branch became the home of New York University's Graduate School of Business Administration (GBA).\" {{cite book |title=Contemporary Challenges: American Business in a Global Economy\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=081471868X  |isbn=081471868X\n|author=Daniel E Diamond |date=1995}}</ref> Located in New York's downtown business district, the school's \"Wall Street Division\" served both full-time and currently employed students.

In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959\u20131966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970.\n<!--a series of publications followed... HIST/DIF can identify these -->\n\n===Commerce/College of Business and Public Administration===\nThe School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance was renamed the College of Business and Public Administration in 1972. In the same year, Tisch Hall, designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]] (see also: [[Bobst Library]] and Meyer Building) opened at 40 West Fourth Street to house the undergraduate college.\n\n===Stern===\nIn 1988, a $30 million gift from the school's alumnus Leonard N. Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.
