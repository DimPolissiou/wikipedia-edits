Despite openly professing his [[Roman Catholic]] faith, he enjoyed the trust of [[Elizabeth I]] and of  successive Lord Deputies of Ireland, and was even forgiven by the English  Crown  for signing a petition against the [[Penal Laws]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was the eldest surviving son of [[Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth (d. 1589)|Christopher, 8th Baron Howth]] and his first wife Elizabeth Plunket  of [[Beaulieu House and Gardens, Co. Louth]] County Louth. His date of birth is often given as 1555, but  was probably some years earlier: Elrington Ball states that he was well into middle age when his father died,<ref name=eball>Ball, F. Elrington ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thoms and Co. Dublin 1902\u20131920</ref> and in 1605 he was described as being \"too old to be likely  to live long\".\n\nHis early life cannot have been   happy, as  his father was notorious for his cruelty to his wife and children.

Although Cavine\u00f1a is still spoken (and still learnt by some children), it is an endangered language.  Guillaume (2004) states that about 1200 people speak the language, out of a population of around 1700.  Nearly all Cavine\u00f1a are bilingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nThe Cavine\u00f1o people live in several communities near the Beni River, which flows north from the Andes.  The nearest towns are Reyes (to the south) and Riberalta (to the north).\n\n==Phonology==\nCavine\u00f1a has the following consonants (Guillaume 2004:27).  Where the practical orthography is different from IPA, it is shown between angled brackets:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|-\n|||bilabial||velar||alveolar|| alveo-palatal||glottal\n|-\n|voiceless stop||p ||k||t|| c {{angbr|ty}}||\n|-\n|voiced stop||b|| ||d||\u025f {{angbr|dy}}|| \n|-\n|labialized stop|| colspan='2'|k\u02b7 {{angbr|kw}}|| || || \n|-\n|voiceless affricate|| || || ts||t\u0361\u0255 {{angbr|ch}}|| \n|-\n|voiceless fricative|| || ||s||\u0255 {{angbr|sh}}||h {{angbr|j}}\n|-\n|liquid|| ||||\u027a {{angbr|r}}||\u028e {{angbr|ry}}|| \n|-\n|nasal||m|| ||n||\u0272 {{angbr|ny}}|| \n|-\n|glide||colspan='2'|w|| ||j {{angbr|y}}||\n|}\n\nIt has the following vowels\n\n{|class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|-\n|||Front||Central||Back\n|-\n|High||i|| ||\n|-\n|Mid||e/\u025b {{angbr|e}}|| ||\u028a {{angbr|u}}\n|-\n|Low|| ||a ||\n|}\n\nExamples in the morphology and syntax sections are written in the practical orthography.\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs do not show agreement with their arguments, but are inflected for tense, aspect, mood, negation, and aktionsart, among other categories.   There are six tense/aspect/mood affixes (Guillaume 2004):\n\n*-ya 'imperfective' (for present, generic, habitual, and near future events)\n*-wa 'perfective' (for events that occurred earlier the same day)\n*-chine 'recent past' (for events that occurred between a day and a year ago)\n*-kware 'remote past' (for events that occurred a year or more ago)\n*-buke 'remote future' (for events far in the future)\n*e-...-u 'potential' (for events that are contingent on other events)\n\nThe following examples show the remote past and perfective affixes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|I-ke=bakwe ||[e-kwe|| e-wane=tsewe] ||kanajara-kware|| [e-kwe tujuri=ju].\n|-\n|1SG-FM =CONTRAST ||1SG-GEN|| 1-wife=ASSOC|| rest-REMOTE.PAST||1SG-GEN mosquito.net=LOC\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\"|'Me, I was resting with my wife in my mosquito net.'\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Pakaka-wa =mi|| [manga=ju=ke].\n|-\n|fall-PERF =2SG(-FM) ||mango.tree=LOC=LIG\n|-\n|colspan='2'|'You fell from the mango tree.'\n|}\n\nAktionsart suffixes include:\n\n*-tere/tirya 'completive'\n*-bisha 'incompletive'\n*-nuka 'repeated/reiterative'\n\nThe following examples show the completive and reiterative suffixes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Shana-tirya-kware ||=tuna||[piya=kwana\n|-\n|leave-COMP-REM.PAST ||=3PL(-ERG)|| arrow=PL\n|-\n|colspan='5'|'(They ran away and) left all their arrows behind.'

Aikhenvald]] (eds) (1990). ''The Amazonian Languages''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. xxvii</ref>\n\n==Syntax==\n\n===Nouns and noun phrases===\n\n====Subtypes of nouns====\nThere are three subtypes of nouns in Cavine\u00f1a (Guillaume 2004:71-73).\n* e-nouns, which are a closed class of about 100 to 150 terms which must take a prefix e-.  (The prefix is realised as y- before the vowel a).\n* kinship nouns, which are a small class of about 30 terms which are obligatorily inflected for their possessor.\n* independent nouns, which are an open class of a couple of thousand terms. Independent nouns do not take any e- prefix nor any possessor inflections.\n\n====Case marking====\nCase marking on noun phrases is shown through a set of clitic postpositions, including the following:\n*=ra 'ergative case'\n*=tsewe 'associative case' (= English 'with')\n*=ja 'dative case'\n*=ja 'genitive case'\n*=ju 'locative case'\n\nThe dative and genitive cases are homophonous.\n\nPronouns (independent or bound) also show these case distinctions.\n\nThe following example (Guillame 2004:526) shows several of the case markers in context:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|I-ke=bakwe ||[e-kwe|| e-wane=tsewe] ||kanajara-kware|| [e-kwe tujuri=ju].\n|-\n|1SG-FM =CONTRAST ||1SG-GEN|| 1-wife=ASSOC|| rest-REMOTE.PAST||1SG-GEN mosquito.net=LOC\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\"|'Me, I was resting with my wife in my mosquito net.'\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Pakaka-wa =mi|| [manga=ju=ke].\n|-\n|fall-PERF =2SG(-FM) ||mango.tree=LOC=LIG\n|-\n|colspan='2'|'You fell from the mango tree.'\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Ai =tu-ke =mi|| mare-wa?\n|-\n|INT =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG)|| shoot-PERF\n|-\n|colspan='2'|'What did you shoot?'\n|} (Guillaume 2004:599)\n\n====Order in noun phrases====\nNoun phrases show the order (Relative Clause)-(Quantifier)-(Possessor)-Noun-(Adjective)-(Plural marker)-(Relative clause) (Guillaume 2004:69).  The following examples show some of these orders.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|E-marikaka|| ebari=kwana\n|-\n|nounprefix-cooking:pot||big=plur\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|'big cooking pots'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|dutya|| tunaja|| etawiki=kwana|| e-tiru=ke\n|-\n|all||3:plur:genitive||bedding=plur||res-burn-ligature\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|'all their bedding that had burnt'\n|}\n(The clitic =ke 'ligature' appears at the end of a relative clause.)\n\n===Pronouns===\nPronouns in Cavine\u00f1a can appear in either independent or bound forms.   The two kinds of pronouns are pronounced almost exactly the same, but the bound pronouns appear in second position, after the first word of the sentence. Independent pronouns tend to be contrastive, and usually appear first in the sentence.\n\nThe following pronouns are found:\n\n{| class='wikitable'\n!colspan='4'|Absolutive pronouns\n|-\n!person|| SG|| DL|| PL\n|-\n|1|| i-\u00d8-ke|| ya-tse|| e-kwana\n|-\n|2 ||mi-\u00d8-ke|| me-tse|| mi-kwana\n|-\n|3|| tu-\u00d8-ke|| ta-tse|| tu-na\n|-\n|3PROX|| ri-\u00d8-ke|| re-tse|| re-na\n|}\n{|class='wikitable'\n!colspan='4'|Ergative pronouns\n|-\n!person|| SG|| DL|| PL\n|-\n|1 ||e-\u00d8-ra|| ya-tse-ra|| e-kwana-ra\n|-\n|2 ||mi-\u00d8-ra|| me-tse-ra|| mi-kwana-ra\n|-\n|3 ||tu-\u00d8-ra|| ta-tse-ra|| tu-na-ra\n|-\n|3PROX ||riya-\u00d8-ra(?)|| re-tse-ra|| re-na-ra\n|}\n{|class='wikitable'\n!colspan='4'|Dative pronouns\n|-\n!person|| SG|| DL|| PL\n|-\n|1 || e-\u00d8-kwe || ya-tse-ja || e-kwana-ja\n|-\n|2 || mi-\u00d8-kwe||  me-tse-ja||  mi-kwana-ja\n|-\n|3 || tu-\u00d8-ja||  ta-tse-ja||  tu-na-ja\n|-\n|3PROX || re-\u00d8-ja || re-tse-ja||  re-na-ja\n|}\n\nGuillaume (2004:597) notes that the formative suffix -ke (of singular absolutive bound pronouns) and the ergative suffix -ra (in ergative bound pronouns) do not show up when absolutive or ergative pronouns occur last among the second position clitics.\n\n===Sentences===\nCavine\u00f1a has ergative case marking on the subject of a transitive verb (Guillaume 2004:527). For sentences with a non-pronominal subject, this is shown with an ergative case clitic /=ra/:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''Iba=ra=tu''|| ''iye-chine''|| ''takure.''\n|-\n|jaguar=ERG=3SG(-FM)|| kill-RECENT.PAST|| chicken\n|-\n|colspan='3'|'The jaguar killed the chicken.'\n|}\n\nFor a sentence with a pronominal subject, there are distinct ergative and absolutive forms of the pronouns:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|I-ke=bakwe|| kwa-kware=dya=jutidya.\n|-\n|1SG(ABS)-FM=CONTR|| go-REM.PAST=FOC=RESTR\n|-\n|colspan='2'|'I just went.'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''E-ra=tu'' ||''[e-kwe'' || ''tata-chi'']|| ''adeba-ya=ama.''\n|-\n|1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) ||1SG-GEN|| father-AFFTN|| know-IMPFV=NEG\n|-\n|colspan='4'|'I do not know my father.' (Guillaume 2004:585)\n|}\n\nVerbs do not inflect for the person of the subject or other arguments in the clause.  Instead, a set of clitic pronouns occurs in the second position of the clause, as in the following examples (Guillaume 2004:595):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''Tume =tuna-ja =tu-ke =\u00d8'' ||''be-ti-wa'' ||''budari.''\n|-\n|then =3PL-DAT =3SG-FM =1SG(-ERG)||bring-GO.TEMP-PERF|| banana\n|-\n|colspan='3'|'I will go and bring bananas for them.'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''Kwadisha-ya =tu-ke =e-ra =e-kwe'' ||''encomienda''||[''e-kwe'' ||''ata=ja=ishu''].\n|-\n|send-IMPERFECTIVE =3SG-FM =1SG-ERG =1SG-DAT ||package||1SG-GEN ||relatives=GEN=PURP.GNL\n|-\n|colspan='5'|'I am sending a packing to my relatives.'\n|}\nThe clitics are ordered so that 3rd person pronouns precede 2nd person pronouns, which precede 1st person pronouns.  (Some of the clitic pronouns in these examples have a formative element /-ke/ after them and some do not.)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Camp, Elizabeth, L. 1985. \u2018Split ergativity in Cavine\u00f1a\u2019, International Journal of American Linguistics, 51.1: 38-58.\n*Camp, Elizabeth, L. and Millicent R.

Although Cavine\u00f1a is still spoken (and still learnt by some children), it is an endangered language.  Guillaume (2004) states that about 1200 people speak the language, out of a population of around 1700.  Nearly all Cavine\u00f1a are bilingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nThe Cavine\u00f1o people live in several communities near the Beni River, which flows north from the Andes.  The nearest towns are Reyes (to the south) and Riberalta (to the north).\n\n==Phonology==\nCavine\u00f1a has the following consonants (Guillaume 2004:27).  Where the practical orthography is different from IPA, it is shown between angled brackets:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|-\n|||bilabial||velar||alveolar|| alveo-palatal||glottal\n|-\n|voiceless stop||p ||k||t|| c {{angbr|ty}}||\n|-\n|voiced stop||b|| ||d||\u025f {{angbr|dy}}|| \n|-\n|labialized stop|| colspan='2'|k\u02b7 {{angbr|kw}}|| || || \n|-\n|voiceless affricate|| || || ts||t\u0361\u0255 {{angbr|ch}}|| \n|-\n|voiceless fricative|| || ||s||\u0255 {{angbr|sh}}||h {{angbr|j}}\n|-\n|liquid|| ||||\u027a {{angbr|r}}||\u028e {{angbr|ry}}|| \n|-\n|nasal||m|| ||n||\u0272 {{angbr|ny}}|| \n|-\n|glide||colspan='2'|w|| ||j {{angbr|y}}||\n|}\n\nIt has the following vowels\n\n{|class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|-\n|||Front||Central||Back\n|-\n|High||i|| ||\n|-\n|Mid||e/\u025b {{angbr|e}}|| ||\u028a {{angbr|u}}\n|-\n|Low|| ||a ||\n|}\n\nExamples in the morphology and syntax sections are written in the practical orthography.\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs do not show agreement with their arguments, but are inflected for tense, aspect, mood, negation, and aktionsart, among other categories.   There are six tense/aspect/mood affixes (Guillaume 2004):\n\n*-ya 'imperfective' (for present, generic, habitual, and near future events)\n*-wa 'perfective' (for events that occurred earlier the same day)\n*-chine 'recent past' (for events that occurred between a day and a year ago)\n*-kware 'remote past' (for events that occurred a year or more ago)\n*-buke 'remote future' (for events far in the future)\n*e-...-u 'potential' (for events that are contingent on other events)\n\nThe following examples show the remote past and perfective affixes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|I-ke=bakwe ||[e-kwe|| e-wane=tsewe] ||kanajara-kware|| [e-kwe tujuri=ju].\n|-\n|1SG-FM =CONTRAST ||1SG-GEN|| 1-wife=ASSOC|| rest-REMOTE.PAST||1SG-GEN mosquito.net=LOC\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\"|'Me, I was resting with my wife in my mosquito net.'\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Pakaka-wa =mi|| [manga=ju=ke].\n|-\n|fall-PERF =2SG(-FM) ||mango.tree=LOC=LIG\n|-\n|colspan='2'|'You fell from the mango tree.'\n|}\n\nAktionsart suffixes include:\n\n*-tere/tirya 'completive'\n*-bisha 'incompletive'\n*-nuka 'repeated/reiterative'\n\nThe following examples show the completive and reiterative suffixes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Shana-tirya-kware ||=tuna||[piya=kwana\n|-\n|leave-COMP-REM.PAST ||=3PL(-ERG)|| arrow=PL\n|-\n|colspan='5'|'(They ran away and) left all their arrows behind.'

(Guillaume 2004:198)\n|}\n\nThis is the only language in the Amazon that has an [[antipassive voice]].<ref name=Amazonian>[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] & [[Alexandra Aikhenvald|Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald]] (eds) (1990). ''The Amazonian Languages''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. xxvii</ref>\n\n==Syntax==\n\n===Nouns and noun phrases===\n\n====Subtypes of nouns====\nThere are three subtypes of nouns in Cavine\u00f1a (Guillaume 2004:71-73).\n* e-nouns, which are a closed class of about 100 to 150 terms which must take a prefix e-.  (The prefix is realised as y- before the vowel a).\n* kinship nouns, which are a small class of about 30 terms which are obligatorily inflected for their possessor.\n* independent nouns, which are an open class of a couple of thousand terms. Independent nouns do not take any e- prefix nor any possessor inflections.\n\n====Case marking====\nCase marking on noun phrases is shown through a set of clitic postpositions, including the following:\n*=ra 'ergative case'\n*=tsewe 'associative case' (= English 'with')\n*=ja 'dative case'\n*=ja 'genitive case'\n*=ju 'locative case'\n\nThe dative and genitive cases are homophonous.\n\nPronouns (independent or bound) also show these case distinctions.\n\nThe following example (Guillame 2004:526) shows several of the case markers in context:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|I-ke=bakwe ||[e-kwe|| e-wane=tsewe] ||kanajara-kware|| [e-kwe tujuri=ju].\n|-\n|1SG-FM =CONTRAST ||1SG-GEN|| 1-wife=ASSOC|| rest-REMOTE.PAST||1SG-GEN mosquito.net=LOC\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\"|'Me, I was resting with my wife in my mosquito net.'\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Pakaka-wa =mi|| [manga=ju=ke].\n|-\n|fall-PERF =2SG(-FM) ||mango.tree=LOC=LIG\n|-\n|colspan='2'|'You fell from the mango tree.'\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Ai =tu-ke =mi|| mare-wa?\n|-\n|INT =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG)|| shoot-PERF\n|-\n|colspan='2'|'What did you shoot?'\n|} (Guillaume 2004:599)\n\n====Order in noun phrases====\nNoun phrases show the order (Relative Clause)-(Quantifier)-(Possessor)-Noun-(Adjective)-(Plural marker)-(Relative clause) (Guillaume 2004:69).  The following examples show some of these orders.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|E-marikaka|| ebari=kwana\n|-\n|nounprefix-cooking:pot||big=plur\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|'big cooking pots'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|dutya|| tunaja|| etawiki=kwana|| e-tiru=ke\n|-\n|all||3:plur:genitive||bedding=plur||res-burn-ligature\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|'all their bedding that had burnt'\n|}\n(The clitic =ke 'ligature' appears at the end of a relative clause.)\n\n===Pronouns===\nPronouns in Cavine\u00f1a can appear in either independent or bound forms.   The two kinds of pronouns are pronounced almost exactly the same, but the bound pronouns appear in second position, after the first word of the sentence. Independent pronouns tend to be contrastive, and usually appear first in the sentence.\n\nThe following pronouns are found:\n\n{| class='wikitable'\n!colspan='4'|Absolutive pronouns\n|-\n!person|| SG|| DL|| PL\n|-\n|1|| i-\u00d8-ke|| ya-tse|| e-kwana\n|-\n|2 ||mi-\u00d8-ke|| me-tse|| mi-kwana\n|-\n|3|| tu-\u00d8-ke|| ta-tse|| tu-na\n|-\n|3PROX|| ri-\u00d8-ke|| re-tse|| re-na\n|}\n{|class='wikitable'\n!colspan='4'|Ergative pronouns\n|-\n!person|| SG|| DL|| PL\n|-\n|1 ||e-\u00d8-ra|| ya-tse-ra|| e-kwana-ra\n|-\n|2 ||mi-\u00d8-ra|| me-tse-ra|| mi-kwana-ra\n|-\n|3 ||tu-\u00d8-ra|| ta-tse-ra|| tu-na-ra\n|-\n|3PROX ||riya-\u00d8-ra(?)|| re-tse-ra|| re-na-ra\n|}\n{|class='wikitable'\n!colspan='4'|Dative pronouns\n|-\n!person|| SG|| DL|| PL\n|-\n|1 || e-\u00d8-kwe || ya-tse-ja || e-kwana-ja\n|-\n|2 || mi-\u00d8-kwe||  me-tse-ja||  mi-kwana-ja\n|-\n|3 || tu-\u00d8-ja||  ta-tse-ja||  tu-na-ja\n|-\n|3PROX || re-\u00d8-ja || re-tse-ja||  re-na-ja\n|}\n\nGuillaume (2004:597) notes that the formative suffix -ke (of singular absolutive bound pronouns) and the ergative suffix -ra (in ergative bound pronouns) do not show up when absolutive or ergative pronouns occur last among the second position clitics.\n\n===Sentences===\nCavine\u00f1a has ergative case marking on the subject of a transitive verb (Guillaume 2004:527). For sentences with a non-pronominal subject, this is shown with an ergative case clitic /=ra/:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''Iba=ra=tu''|| ''iye-chine''|| ''takure.''\n|-\n|jaguar=ERG=3SG(-FM)|| kill-RECENT.PAST|| chicken\n|-\n|colspan='3'|'The jaguar killed the chicken.'\n|}\n\nFor a sentence with a pronominal subject, there are distinct ergative and absolutive forms of the pronouns:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|I-ke=bakwe|| kwa-kware=dya=jutidya.\n|-\n|1SG(ABS)-FM=CONTR|| go-REM.PAST=FOC=RESTR\n|-\n|colspan='2'|'I just went.'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''E-ra=tu'' ||''[e-kwe'' || ''tata-chi'']|| ''adeba-ya=ama.''\n|-\n|1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) ||1SG-GEN|| father-AFFTN|| know-IMPFV=NEG\n|-\n|colspan='4'|'I do not know my father.' (Guillaume 2004:585)\n|}\n\nVerbs do not inflect for the person of the subject or other arguments in the clause.  Instead, a set of clitic pronouns occurs in the second position of the clause, as in the following examples (Guillaume 2004:595):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''Tume =tuna-ja =tu-ke =\u00d8'' ||''be-ti-wa'' ||''budari.''\n|-\n|then =3PL-DAT =3SG-FM =1SG(-ERG)||bring-GO.TEMP-PERF|| banana\n|-\n|colspan='3'|'I will go and bring bananas for them.'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''Kwadisha-ya =tu-ke =e-ra =e-kwe'' ||''encomienda''||[''e-kwe'' ||''ata=ja=ishu''].\n|-\n|send-IMPERFECTIVE =3SG-FM =1SG-ERG =1SG-DAT ||package||1SG-GEN ||relatives=GEN=PURP.GNL\n|-\n|colspan='5'|'I am sending a packing to my relatives.'\n|}\nThe clitics are ordered so that 3rd person pronouns precede 2nd person pronouns, which precede 1st person pronouns.  (Some of the clitic pronouns in these examples have a formative element /-ke/ after them and some do not.)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Camp, Elizabeth, L. 1985. \u2018Split ergativity in Cavine\u00f1a\u2019, International Journal of American Linguistics, 51.1: 38-58.\n*Camp, Elizabeth, L. and Millicent R.

Its antenna is located at the same site of [[KWFN]] and [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]].\n\n==History==\n106.5 FM started as '''KPRI''' in 1960 and broadcast an MOR-Easy Listening format with the slogan \"Island of Capri\" (K-PRI) ; Beginning in December 1967, it began airing a [[Freeform (radio format)|freeform]] format in the overnight hours (Midnight to 3:00 AM), which would become full-time by June 1968, and would later evolve into [[album-oriented rock]] by 1973.\n\nIn January 1984, the station flipped to an Adult Contemporary format as '''KLZZ''', \"Class FM.\" KLZZ switched formats once again in September 1986, to [[classic rock]] as \"California Classics\", retaining the KLZZ callsign.\n\nOn March 5, 1987, at 6 p.m., after KLZZ was purchased by Edens Broadcasting, KLZZ flipped to a dance-leaning [[Top 40]] format, branded as \"Q106\" and adopted the '''KKLQ''' call letters. The first song on \"Q106\" was \"[[Sign o' the Times (song)|Sign o' the Times]]\" by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-03-13.pdf</ref>  KKLQ was also heard on [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]], 600 AM, as part of a [[simulcast]], and later on now-Talk formatted [[KCBQ]].

All 5 stations were [[top 40]] stations. Edens also owned [[WWDE]] (2WD) in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], during this time, but that station was [[Adult Contemporary]]. Q106 competed against [[KFBG (FM)|KFMB-FM]] (\"B100\").\n\nQ106 enjoyed high ratings success, as the station was ranked #1 for 12 continuous ratings periods. However, in April 1990, [[XHITZ-FM]] flipped from classic rock to a dance-leaning CHR format as \"Jammin' Z90\", which took away much of Q106's audience. To counter this, the station shifted towards a more [[mainstream Top 40]] format by early 1991. In 1992, Edens went into receivership, as the company lost large amounts of money due to the fallout of WRBQ from competitor [[WFLZ-FM]].
