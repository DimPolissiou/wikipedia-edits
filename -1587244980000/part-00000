''Madden 08'' brings back some features for its online play; for example, there is the return of Season Mode and tournaments held online.

This mode finds players teaming up with a friend and taking on the CPU or two human opponents.\n\n===Presentation===\nOn the next-generation systems former NFL [[running back]] and ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' cover athlete [[Marshall Faulk]] hosts a segment called ''Marshall's Minute'' in which he discusses key star players and predicts the score prior to the game.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> ''Weapons'' (see below) also get special introductions before games.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Also on next-generation systems, the game features an intro composed by [[David Robidoux]] titled, \"Who Wants It More?\", after the [[Super Bowl XLII]] slogan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apmmusic.com/r-v/david-robidoux |title=David Robidoux |work=[[APM Music]] |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n \nThe soundtrack for ''Madden NFL 08''  featured [[EA Trax]], which included [[The Used]], [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]], [[Mims (rapper)|Mims]], [[Swizz Beatz]], and many more hip hop/rock artists.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Weapons===\nCertain star players are deemed to have \"weapons\" which can enhance their performances and create game-changing plays.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Jon |date=May 18, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/18/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-madden-08 |title=Five Things You Need to Know About Madden 08 |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> For example, players with the \"Smart Quarterback\" weapon are able to read defensive schemes and [[Quarterback#Special tactics|audible]] accordingly. Possession receivers can make tough catches over the middle, Shutdown corners can stay on even the toughest receivers, and Spectacular Catch receivers are able to leap over defenders and make difficult grabs.\n\nAnother added feature is to change players' positions to utilize their individual talents more effectively, such as [[Devin Hester]] (who can be converted from [[cornerback]] to [[wide receiver]]) and [[Brandon Marshall]] (who can be converted from wide receiver to tight end). It is also possible to move around offensive and defensive linemen with little effect to their overall rating. However, on the PlayStation 3 version of the game, player positions are locked and cannot be changed.\n\nThe weapons feature can be turned on or off in the game settings.\n\n===Superstar Mode additions===\nWith the addition of the ''Campus Legend'' mode to the next-gen version of ''[[NCAA Football 08]]'', players are now able to take their player from Campus Legend mode and import him into ''Madden'''s ''Superstar Mode''. In addition, players are able to create a player, take over the careers of select rookies from the [[2007 NFL Draft]] and use them in Superstar Mode.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Also, the superstar's team can be chosen by the user based on what the menu-set \"Favorite Team\" is. Camera angles have also been tweaked for the next gen of ''Madden 08'' after complaints with its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Key attributes of superstars are assigned by players when creating them, rather than generated by random parents.<ref name=\"GSpot\">{{cite web |last=Navarro |first=Alex |date=August 20, 2007 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-08-review/1900-6176958/ |title=Madden NFL 08 Review (GC, PS2, Xbox) |website=GameSpot |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> A number of features have been left out in this year's Wii version, most notably, the ability to edit the game player's superstars appearance as the Superstar Mirror is no longer selectable, and the Barber Shop in the City Map is also no longer selectable. Users are stuck with the random hair combination given to the user while registering their new superstar. Although certain new features have been added as well. For example, a player can have more control over their character while firing agents, while the selection of rookies is more extensive, although it is not available for [[Nintendo DS]].\n\n===Player attributes===\nFor the first time, a player can receive an attribute of 100 only for the best players and only for skill positions. [[Devin Hester]] (speed), [[Peyton Manning]] (awareness), [[Tom Brady]] (awareness), [[Champ Bailey]] (man coverage), Reggie Bush (acceleration), [[Lorenzo Neal]] (impact blocking), [[Larry Allen]] (strength), and [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] (juke move and elusiveness) as well as many of the Hall of Fame (HOF) unlockable players, are the only in the game with such skills.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goldstein |first=Hilary |date=August 6, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/07/madden-08-countdown-player-ratings |title=Madden 08 Countdown: Player Ratings |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> However, if the player's ratings are accessed, these attributes will drop back to 99.\n\n===Player info===\nThere are certain players such as [[Byron Leftwich]], [[Josh Cribbs]], and [[Vernon Davis]] that are from the [[District of Columbia]] whose home state is blank. If the player moves the state, the blank spot is no longer present.\n\n[[Michael Vick]] is featured in the game as the Atlanta Falcons QB for the last time before his suspension from the NFL in August 2007 for violating its player conduct policy. He was removed in the first roster update.\n\n===Trophy room===\nThe trophy room in ''Madden 08'' is similar to the ''My Shrine'' feature in ''[[NCAA Football 08]]''.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Trophies can be earned by completing in-game tasks (such as rushing for over 200 yards) or in other game modes (such as winning a Super Bowl in franchise mode).<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Trophies can also be wagered in online head-to-head contests.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> As skill and experience progresses, the user can earn five EA Challenge rings, which have customizable team logos and colors.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> These features have been left out in the Wii version. Once a ring is unlocked, the player is given a code to buy the ring on Jostens.com.\n\n===Fantasy Challenge===\nIn the current-generation version, the game has a Fantasy challenge mode where the player adds players to an NFL team and plays through three different leagues in a single elimination tournament. Other teams can attempt to trade players and challenge the player to competitions to get players from the player's team. If the player plays well enough they reach the top league which has four fictional teams that play in a special way to win. This mode is similar to Blitz: The League's campaign mode.\n\n===Returning features===\nA number of features missing from the first two next-generation versions of ''Madden'' return in ''Madden 08''. These include ''Owner Mode'', fantasy draft, roster-editing, and cooperative play-New, however, to the Xbox 360. There are also mini games like a QB challenge.\n\n===Other features===\nIn addition to the other versions, the Wii version features online gameplay, a ''Madden'' first for a [[Nintendo]] console, as well as the integration of [[Mii]] avatars, and features a few exclusive game modes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bozon |first1=Mark |last2=Casamassina |first2=Matt |date=June 11, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/madden-nfl-08-wii-interview |title=Madden NFL 08 Wii Interview |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of Madden 08 have a [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]]-type game mode called ''Fantasy Challenge Mode''. In this game mode, players draft the ultimate NFL dream team while advancing through four levels of gameplay.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| DS = true\n|

''Madden 08'' brings back some features for its online play; for example, there is the return of Season Mode and tournaments held online.

This mode finds players teaming up with a friend and taking on the CPU or two human opponents.\n\n===Presentation===\nOn the next-generation systems former NFL [[running back]] and ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' cover athlete [[Marshall Faulk]] hosts a segment called ''Marshall's Minute'' in which he discusses key star players and predicts the score prior to the game.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> ''Weapons'' (see below) also get special introductions before games.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Also on next-generation systems, the game features an intro composed by [[David Robidoux]] titled, \"Who Wants It More?\", after the [[Super Bowl XLII]] slogan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apmmusic.com/r-v/david-robidoux |title=David Robidoux |work=[[APM Music]] |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n \nThe soundtrack for ''Madden NFL 08''  featured [[EA Trax]], which included [[The Used]], [[Atreyu]], [[Mims (rapper)|Mims]], [[Swizz Beatz]], and many more hip hop/rock artists.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Weapons===\nCertain star players are deemed to have \"weapons\" which can enhance their performances and create game-changing plays.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Jon |date=May 18, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/18/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-madden-08 |title=Five Things You Need to Know About Madden 08 |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> For example, players with the \"Smart Quarterback\" weapon are able to read defensive schemes and [[Quarterback#Special tactics|audible]] accordingly. Possession receivers can make tough catches over the middle, Shutdown corners can stay on even the toughest receivers, and Spectacular Catch receivers are able to leap over defenders and make difficult grabs.\n\nAnother added feature is to change players' positions to utilize their individual talents more effectively, such as [[Devin Hester]] (who can be converted from [[cornerback]] to [[wide receiver]]) and [[Brandon Marshall]] (who can be converted from wide receiver to tight end). It is also possible to move around offensive and defensive linemen with little effect to their overall rating. However, on the PlayStation 3 version of the game, player positions are locked and cannot be changed.\n\nThe weapons feature can be turned on or off in the game settings.\n\n===Superstar Mode additions===\nWith the addition of the ''Campus Legend'' mode to the next-gen version of ''[[NCAA Football 08]]'', players are now able to take their player from Campus Legend mode and import him into ''Madden'''s ''Superstar Mode''. In addition, players are able to create a player, take over the careers of select rookies from the [[2007 NFL Draft]] and use them in Superstar Mode.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Also, the superstar's team can be chosen by the user based on what the menu-set \"Favorite Team\" is. Camera angles have also been tweaked for the next gen of ''Madden 08'' after complaints with its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Key attributes of superstars are assigned by players when creating them, rather than generated by random parents.<ref name=\"GSpot\">{{cite web |last=Navarro |first=Alex |date=August 20, 2007 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-08-review/1900-6176958/ |title=Madden NFL 08 Review (GC, PS2, Xbox) |website=GameSpot |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> A number of features have been left out in this year's Wii version, most notably, the ability to edit the game player's superstars appearance as the Superstar Mirror is no longer selectable, and the Barber Shop in the City Map is also no longer selectable. Users are stuck with the random hair combination given to the user while registering their new superstar. Although certain new features have been added as well. For example, a player can have more control over their character while firing agents, while the selection of rookies is more extensive, although it is not available for [[Nintendo DS]].\n\n===Player attributes===\nFor the first time, a player can receive an attribute of 100 only for the best players and only for skill positions. [[Devin Hester]] (speed), [[Peyton Manning]] (awareness), [[Tom Brady]] (awareness), [[Champ Bailey]] (man coverage), Reggie Bush (acceleration), [[Lorenzo Neal]] (impact blocking), [[Larry Allen]] (strength), and [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] (juke move and elusiveness) as well as many of the Hall of Fame (HOF) unlockable players, are the only in the game with such skills.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goldstein |first=Hilary |date=August 6, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/07/madden-08-countdown-player-ratings |title=Madden 08 Countdown: Player Ratings |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> However, if the player's ratings are accessed, these attributes will drop back to 99.\n\n===Player info===\nThere are certain players such as [[Byron Leftwich]], [[Josh Cribbs]], and [[Vernon Davis]] that are from the [[District of Columbia]] whose home state is blank. If the player moves the state, the blank spot is no longer present.\n\n[[Michael Vick]] is featured in the game as the Atlanta Falcons QB for the last time before his suspension from the NFL in August 2007 for violating its player conduct policy. He was removed in the first roster update.\n\n===Trophy room===\nThe trophy room in ''Madden 08'' is similar to the ''My Shrine'' feature in ''[[NCAA Football 08]]''.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Trophies can be earned by completing in-game tasks (such as rushing for over 200 yards) or in other game modes (such as winning a Super Bowl in franchise mode).<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Trophies can also be wagered in online head-to-head contests.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> As skill and experience progresses, the user can earn five EA Challenge rings, which have customizable team logos and colors.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> These features have been left out in the Wii version. Once a ring is unlocked, the player is given a code to buy the ring on Jostens.com.\n\n===Fantasy Challenge===\nIn the current-generation version, the game has a Fantasy challenge mode where the player adds players to an NFL team and plays through three different leagues in a single elimination tournament. Other teams can attempt to trade players and challenge the player to competitions to get players from the player's team. If the player plays well enough they reach the top league which has four fictional teams that play in a special way to win. This mode is similar to Blitz: The League's campaign mode.\n\n===Returning features===\nA number of features missing from the first two next-generation versions of ''Madden'' return in ''Madden 08''. These include ''Owner Mode'', fantasy draft, roster-editing, and cooperative play-New, however, to the Xbox 360. There are also mini games like a QB challenge.\n\n===Other features===\nIn addition to the other versions, the Wii version features online gameplay, a ''Madden'' first for a [[Nintendo]] console, as well as the integration of [[Mii]] avatars, and features a few exclusive game modes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bozon |first1=Mark |last2=Casamassina |first2=Matt |date=June 11, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/madden-nfl-08-wii-interview |title=Madden NFL 08 Wii Interview |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of Madden 08 have a [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]]-type game mode called ''Fantasy Challenge Mode''. In this game mode, players draft the ultimate NFL dream team while advancing through four levels of gameplay.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| DS = true\n|

Established as '''JUI''' (''Jamiat Ulema-e Islam'') in 1945, it is the result of a factional split in 1988, ''F'' standing for the name of its leader, [[Fazal-ur-Rehman (politician)|Fazal-ur-Rehman]].\n\nJUI-F is as of 2013 Pakistan's 5th largest party, winning 3.2% of the popular vote, or 15 out of 272 general seats in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. It is entirely based in southern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and northern parts of [[Baluchistan]].\nThe JUI-S faction, led by [[Samiul Haq]], is of regional significance in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] but has no representation on the national level. The split of JUI into two factions was due to dissent over the policy of president [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] of supporting [[Mujahideen]] outfits in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Afghanistan war]] during the 1980s. A more recent faction known as [[Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam Nazryati|JUI-N]], split off JUI-F in 2008, is also unrepresented at the national level.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe JUI follows the Sunni (deobandi) school. In Pakistan, Deobandis have a presence in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Sindh]], and [[Balochistan]]. The JUI traces its roots to Politically active Deobandi who formed the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]] (JUH), in 1919 in [[British India]]. The JUH was against colonialism and for a united India, opposing the formation of a separate homeland for [[Indian Muslims]]. A faction supporting the [[creation of Pakistan]] parted ways in 1945 to support the [[All Indian Muslim League]]. This faction came to be known as the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/pakistan/islam-and-politics/jamiat-ulema-e-islam-jui|title=Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI)|work=[[Islamopedia Online]]|access-date=29 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226203010/http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/pakistan/islam-and-politics/jamiat-ulema-e-islam-jui|archive-date=26 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===United JUI===\nJUI's first president, [[Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]], broke away from the party in 1947 to form the Markazi Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (MJUI), which played a key position in the passage of the Objectives Resolution of 1949 that laid down the \"Islamic\" foundations of future constitutions in Pakistan.<ref name=ICG-11 /> The JUI became more politically active under [[Mufti Mahmud|Maulana Mufti Mahmood]] (1919\u20131980) who assumed its leadership in 1962. Under Mahmood during the 1960s the party \"developed a strong presence\" and base of support among the \"intensely conservative countryside\" of [[Balochistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (KP).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burki|first1=Shahid Javed|title=Historical Dictionary of Pakistan|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk-sBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA292}}</ref> Mahmood led the JUI against [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]]'s modernization policies.\n\nThe JUI also participated in the 1970 elections with the Islamist [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan]] party and the [[Barelvi]] Sunni religious party [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan]] (JUP). It won seven seats in the National Assembly and nine in the provincial assemblies and became a partner in the NWFP and Balochistan provincial governments.<ref name=ICG-11>[[#ICG|International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan]], p.11</ref> Mufti Mahmood was sworn in as NWFP chief minister. Under him the provincial government established a board to bring all laws in conformity with Islam. He resigned in 1973 over Bhutto\u2019s dismissal of the Balochistan provincial government.\n\n===Split into JUI-F and JUI-S===\nDuring the 1980s, the JUI supported some of [[General Zia ul Haq]]'s policies, including his anti-Soviet [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Jihad in Afghanistan]]. Additionally, official patronage and financial support for [[madrassas]] during the Zia years allowed the JUI to build thousands of madrassas, especially in the NWFP (now KPK), which were instrumental in the [[Taliban's rise to power|formation of the Taliban]]. At the same time the JUI was distrustful of Zia's close ties with the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and joined the anti-Zia and [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]-led Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD).<ref name=ICG-11 />\n\nFollowing the death of Mufti Mehmood Ahmed in 1980s, This dual relationship with Zia's regime eventually led to a split in the party which came to be divided into the JUI-F, headed by [[Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman]] and the JUI-S headed by [[Samiul Haq]], who supported Zia and was a member in his parliament, the [[Majlis-e-Shoora|Majlis-e-Shura]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brecorder.com/2020/03/17/580713/renaming-party-ecp-accepts-application-of-jui-f/|title=Renaming party: ECP accepts application of JUI-F|last=Report|first=Recorder|date=2020-03-17|website=Business Recorder|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n=== JUI-F Gets Renamed as JUI ===\nHowever, after the assassination of JUI-S chief [[Maulana Samiul Haq]] in 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints201802.0034.v1|title=Exact Solutions of Brinkman Type Fluid Between Side Walls Over an In\ufb01nite Plate|last=Islam|first=Saeed|last2=Asif|first2=Muhammad|date=2018-02-05|website=dx.doi.org|access-date=2020-03-17|last3=Haq|first3=Samiul}}</ref> activities of his faction gradually died down.<ref>Special Correspondent (Daily Jang), \"Election Commission accepts JUI(F) plea to get renamed as JUI\", Urdu; (Daily Jang, Rawalpindi, 17 March, 2020)pp12</ref> This lead Moulana Fazal-ur-Rehman to plead before [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] (ECP) for and to get his [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)|JUI-F]] faction renamed as [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam|JUI]] in March, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brecorder.com/2020/03/17/580713/renaming-party-ecp-accepts-application-of-jui-f/|title=Renaming party: ECP accepts application of JUI-F|last=Report|first=Recorder|date=2020-03-17|website=Business Recorder|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Madrassas===\nOver the years the JUI-S has maintained that it is more committed to enforcing [[Sharia]] in the country than the JUI-F faction. JUI-S influence is largely restricted to a few districts of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (KPK) whereas the JUI-F is predominant in the Pashtun areas of [[Balochistan]] and KPK.\n\nBoth factions of the JUI have a large network of madrassas and mosques that provide the main basis of its religious activism and politics. The two JUIs run over 65 per cent of all madrassas in Pakistan.<ref>[[#ICG|International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan]], p.12</ref> About 30,000 Afghan refugee students from JUI-controlled madrassas (both JUI-F and JUI-S) in Pakistan joined the Taliban movement in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"Abbas-67\" />\n\nJUI party workers and leaders are mostly products of the madrassa system, although the JUI-F has often fielded candidates from a mainstream educational background. Both JUI factions have backed other India-oriented Deobandi militant groups, particularly the [[Harkat-ul-Mujahideen]] and its offshoot, the [[Jaish-e-Mohammad]], with JUI madrassas providing recruits for them. They are closely associated with the [[Taliban in Afghanistan]]. The Taliban movement reportedly originated in JUI seminaries. Samiul Haq (of the JUI-S) is the leader of the [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]] madrassa in [[Akora Khattak]], from where many of the top leaders of Taliban commanders and leaders, including its supreme leader the [[Mullah Omar]], graduated.<ref>[[#ICG|International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan]], p.13</ref> In contrast to Maulana Samiul Haq and his JUI-S openly supporting Militarism the JUI-F has a policy of not supporting militant activity and of promoting multi party electoral politics.\n\n===Peace deals===\nThe JUI-F has also played a role in brokering peace deals between the military and militants in Pakistan's tribal belt. For instance, in 2004, two JUI-F national parliamentarians from [[South Waziristan]] arranged a deal (known as the Shakai agreement) with the [[Pakistani Taliban]] leadership and in September 2006 the JUI-F helped broker a similar deal in [[North Waziristan]]. These deals have been criticized for legitimizing \"the status of the local militants as power-brokers\". JUI-F leader Fazlur Rahman is also reportedly involved in negotiating agreements between the Pakistani Taliban and military and the Afghan Taliban and the [[U.S.]] On the political front the JUI-F has been more successful than the JUI-S. Fazlur Rahman, leader of the JUI-F, was appointed as Chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs in the second government of Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] (1993\u201396).\n\n===History since 2002===\nThe JUI-F was also the largest party in the MMA, winning 41 seats in the National Assembly and 29 of the MMA's 48 seats in NWFP in the 2002 elections. Subsequently, Fazlur Rahman became the Leader of the Opposition in 2004 and retained the post till 2007. The JUI-F was also part of the current ruling [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] coalition but left the government amidst charges of corruption against one of its members, an [[information technology]] minister of the federal cabinet. In return for JUI-F support, the PPP-led government appointed Maulana Sherani, a JUI-F senator without any formal academic training in [[Islamic jurisprudence]], as chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology in 2010. Sherani has frequently spoken out against the government\u2019s legislative efforts, particularly those related to women. He opposed a proposed bill on domestic violence stating that domestic violence was not a major issue in Pakistan until women's rights groups appeared and \"created\" it and that any such legislation hinders the creation of a \"true Islamic society\". Currently, even though the JUI-F is no longer a coalition partner, Fazlur Rahman chairs the Kashmir committee and another JUI-F senator, Talha Mahmood Aryan, chairs the standing interior committee of the senate.\n\nBoth factions of the JUI have frequently come together on a common platform to oppose American drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas, viewing it as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. For example, following the 2 May 2011 U.S. raid in [[Abbottabad]] that led to [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s killing, the JUI-F and the JUI-S participated in a multi-party conference in [[Peshawar]], condemning the drone strikes and calling on the government to end logistical support to [[NATO]] troops in Afghanistan.\n\nOn the domestic front, members of the JUI-F have been vocal critics of changes in the [[blasphemy laws]]. Fazlur Rahman remained silent until his party left the ruling coalition in December 2010, after which he criticized proposals to amend the blasphemy law. The JUI-F has also opposed the passage of a bill aimed at preventing domestic violence with its members vowing to fight it \"tooth and nail\" as, according to them, its passage would \"promote [[Western culture]] in the Islamic state.\"\n\nIn 2008, a further (minor) split of JUI-F resulted in the formation of a third faction, known as [[Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam Nazryati|JUI-N]] (\"N\" for ''Nazryati'' \"Ideological\").\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Publications==\n* {{cite book|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/pakistan/islamic-parties-pakistan|title=Islamic Parties in Pakistan|publisher=International Crisis Group|date=12 December 2011|ref=ICG}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://juipak.org.pk/ Official site (in Urdu)]\n\n{{Pakistani political parties}}\n{{Conservatism in Pakistan}}\n\n[[Category:Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Islamic political parties in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Far-right political parties in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Political parties established in 1988]]\n[[Category:Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]]\n[[fr:Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{for|its parent organization|Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam}}\n{{Infobox political party\n| name = Jamiat Ulema-e Islam Pakistan\n| abbreviation = JUI\n| logo = [[File:Jamiat party logo.png|200px|JUI-F Party logo]]\n| president = [[Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman]]\n| leader1_title = Founder\n| leader1_name = [[Shabbir Ahmad Usmani|Maulana Shabbir Ahmed Usmani]] (founded [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam|JUI]])<br>\n| leader2_title = Leader in [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]]\n| leader2_name = [[Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri]]\n| leader3_title = Leader in [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]\n| leader3_name = \n| founded = {{Start date|df=yes|1945}}\n| predecessor = [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]\n| headquarters = [[Dera Ismail Khan]], Pakistan\n| student_wing = [[Jamiat Talba-e-Islam]] (JTI)\n| women_wing = Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Women Wing\n| membership_year = \n| membership = 30 million (approx){{cn|date=November 2019}}\n| ideology = [[Islamism]]<br>[[Clericalism]]<br>[[Social conservatism]]<br>[[Religious conservatism]]\n| position = [[Right-wing]] to [[Far-right politics|far-right]]\n| national = [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]]\n| international = \n| affiliation1_title = \n| affiliation1 = \n| colors = {{Color box|#000000|border=darkgray}}{{Color box|#FFFFFF|border=darkgray}} Black & White\n| colorcode = #696969\n| seats1_title = [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]]\n| seats1 = {{Composition bar|4|104|#696969}}\n| seats2_title = [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]\n| seats2 = {{Composition bar|14|342|#696969}}\n| seats3_title = [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan|Balochistan Assembly]]\n| seats3 = {{Composition bar|11|65|#696969}}\n| seats5_title = [[Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|KPK Assembly]]\n| seats5 = {{Composition bar|15|145|#696969}}\n| seats6_title = [[Provincial Assembly of Sindh|Sindh Assembly]]\n| seats6 = {{Composition bar|0|168|#696969}}\n| seats7_title = [[Provincial Assembly of Punjab|Punjab Assembly]]\n| seats7 = {{Composition bar|0|371|#696969}}\n| seats8_title = [[Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly|Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly]]\n| seats8 = {{Composition bar|1|33|#696969}}\n| seats9_title = [[Azad Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Azad Kashmir Assembly]]\n| seats9 = {{Composition bar|0|49|#696969}}\n| website = {{url|www.juipak.org.pk}}\n| symbol = [[File:Book-Symbol-Jamiat.png|100px|center|Book]]\n| flag = [[File:JUI-Flag1.jpeg|100px]]\n| country = Pakistan\n| footnotes = \n}}\n{{Politics of Pakistan}}\n{{Deobandi}}\n'''Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F)''' ([[Urdu]]: ({{Nastaliq|(\u062c\u0645\u06cc\u0639\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0626\u06d2 \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 (\u0641}}; [[English language|English]]: Assembly of Islamic Clerics;<ref name=\"Abbas-67\">{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Hassan|title=The Taliban Revival: Violence and Extremism on the Pakistan-Afghanistan Frontier|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDuvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA67}}</ref> [[Acronym]]: '''JUI(F)''', '''JUI-F''', or '''JUIF''') is a Sunni [[Deobandi]] [[political party]] in [[Pakistan]]. Established as '''JUI''' (''Jamiat Ulema-e Islam'') in 1945, it is the result of a factional split in 1988, ''F'' standing for the name of its leader, [[Fazal-ur-Rehman (politician)|Fazal-ur-Rehman]].\n\nJUI-F is as of 2013 Pakistan's 5th largest party, winning 3.2% of the popular vote, or 15 out of 272 general seats in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. It is entirely based in southern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and northern parts of [[Baluchistan]].\nThe JUI-S faction, led by [[Samiul Haq]], is of regional significance in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] but has no representation on the national level. The split of JUI into two factions was due to dissent over the policy of president [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] of supporting [[Mujahideen]] outfits in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Afghanistan war]] during the 1980s. A more recent faction known as [[Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam Nazryati|JUI-N]], split off JUI-F in 2008, is also unrepresented at the national level.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe JUI follows the Sunni (deobandi) school. In Pakistan, Deobandis have a presence in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Sindh]], and [[Balochistan]]. The JUI traces its roots to Politically active Deobandi who formed the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]] (JUH), in 1919 in [[British India]]. The JUH was against colonialism and for a united India, opposing the formation of a separate homeland for [[Indian Muslims]]. A faction supporting the [[creation of Pakistan]] parted ways in 1945 to support the [[All Indian Muslim League]]. This faction came to be known as the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/pakistan/islam-and-politics/jamiat-ulema-e-islam-jui|title=Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI)|work=[[Islamopedia Online]]|access-date=29 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226203010/http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/pakistan/islam-and-politics/jamiat-ulema-e-islam-jui|archive-date=26 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===United JUI===\nJUI's first president, [[Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]], broke away from the party in 1947 to form the Markazi Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (MJUI), which played a key position in the passage of the Objectives Resolution of 1949 that laid down the \"Islamic\" foundations of future constitutions in Pakistan.<ref name=ICG-11 /> The JUI became more politically active under [[Mufti Mahmud|Maulana Mufti Mahmood]] (1919\u20131980) who assumed its leadership in 1962. Under Mahmood during the 1960s the party \"developed a strong presence\" and base of support among the \"intensely conservative countryside\" of [[Balochistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (KP).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burki|first1=Shahid Javed|title=Historical Dictionary of Pakistan|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk-sBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA292}}</ref> Mahmood led the JUI against [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]]'s modernization policies.\n\nThe JUI also participated in the 1970 elections with the Islamist [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan]] party and the [[Barelvi]] Sunni religious party [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan]] (JUP). It won seven seats in the National Assembly and nine in the provincial assemblies and became a partner in the NWFP and Balochistan provincial governments.<ref name=ICG-11>[[#ICG|International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan]], p.11</ref> Mufti Mahmood was sworn in as NWFP chief minister. Under him the provincial government established a board to bring all laws in conformity with Islam. He resigned in 1973 over Bhutto\u2019s dismissal of the Balochistan provincial government.\n\n===Split into JUI-F and JUI-S===\nDuring the 1980s, the JUI supported some of [[General Zia ul Haq]]'s policies, including his anti-Soviet [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Jihad in Afghanistan]]. Additionally, official patronage and financial support for [[madrassas]] during the Zia years allowed the JUI to build thousands of madrassas, especially in the NWFP (now KPK), which were instrumental in the [[Taliban's rise to power|formation of the Taliban]]. At the same time the JUI was distrustful of Zia's close ties with the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and joined the anti-Zia and [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]-led Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD).<ref name=ICG-11 />\n\nFollowing the death of Mufti Mehmood Ahmed in 1980s, This dual relationship with Zia's regime eventually led to a split in the party which came to be divided into the JUI-F, headed by [[Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman]] and the JUI-S headed by [[Samiul Haq]], who supported Zia and was a member in his parliament, the [[Majlis-e-Shoora|Majlis-e-Shura]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brecorder.com/2020/03/17/580713/renaming-party-ecp-accepts-application-of-jui-f/|title=Renaming party: ECP accepts application of JUI-F|last=Report|first=Recorder|date=2020-03-17|website=Business Recorder|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n=== JUI-F Gets Renamed as JUI ===\nHowever, after the assassination of JUI-S chief [[Maulana Samiul Haq]] in 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints201802.0034.v1|title=Exact Solutions of Brinkman Type Fluid Between Side Walls Over an In\ufb01nite Plate|last=Islam|first=Saeed|last2=Asif|first2=Muhammad|date=2018-02-05|website=dx.doi.org|access-date=2020-03-17|last3=Haq|first3=Samiul}}</ref> activities of his faction gradually died down.<ref>Special Correspondent (Daily Jang), \"Election Commission accepts JUI(F) plea to get renamed as JUI\", Urdu; (Daily Jang, Rawalpindi, 17 March, 2020)pp12</ref> This lead Moulana Fazal-ur-Rehman to plead before [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] (ECP) for and to get his [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)|JUI-F]] faction renamed as [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam|JUI]] in March, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brecorder.com/2020/03/17/580713/renaming-party-ecp-accepts-application-of-jui-f/|title=Renaming party: ECP accepts application of JUI-F|last=Report|first=Recorder|date=2020-03-17|website=Business Recorder|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Madrassas===\nOver the years the JUI-S has maintained that it is more committed to enforcing [[Sharia]] in the country than the JUI-F faction. JUI-S influence is largely restricted to a few districts of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (KPK) whereas the JUI-F is predominant in the Pashtun areas of [[Balochistan]] and KPK.\n\nBoth factions of the JUI have a large network of madrassas and mosques that provide the main basis of its religious activism and politics. The two JUIs run over 65 per cent of all madrassas in Pakistan.<ref>[[#ICG|International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan]], p.12</ref> About 30,000 Afghan refugee students from JUI-controlled madrassas (both JUI-F and JUI-S) in Pakistan joined the Taliban movement in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"Abbas-67\" />\n\nJUI party workers and leaders are mostly products of the madrassa system, although the JUI-F has often fielded candidates from a mainstream educational background. Both JUI factions have backed other India-oriented Deobandi militant groups, particularly the [[Harkat-ul-Mujahideen]] and its offshoot, the [[Jaish-e-Mohammad]], with JUI madrassas providing recruits for them. They are closely associated with the [[Taliban in Afghanistan]]. The Taliban movement reportedly originated in JUI seminaries. Samiul Haq (of the JUI-S) is the leader of the [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]] madrassa in [[Akora Khattak]], from where many of the top leaders of Taliban commanders and leaders, including its supreme leader the [[Mullah Omar]], graduated.<ref>[[#ICG|International Crisis Group, Islamic Parties in Pakistan]], p.13</ref> In contrast to Maulana Samiul Haq and his JUI-S openly supporting Militarism the JUI-F has a policy of not supporting militant activity and of promoting multi party electoral politics.\n\n===Peace deals===\nThe JUI-F has also played a role in brokering peace deals between the military and militants in Pakistan's tribal belt. For instance, in 2004, two JUI-F national parliamentarians from [[South Waziristan]] arranged a deal (known as the Shakai agreement) with the [[Pakistani Taliban]] leadership and in September 2006 the JUI-F helped broker a similar deal in [[North Waziristan]]. These deals have been criticized for legitimizing \"the status of the local militants as power-brokers\". JUI-F leader Fazlur Rahman is also reportedly involved in negotiating agreements between the Pakistani Taliban and military and the Afghan Taliban and the [[U.S.]] On the political front the JUI-F has been more successful than the JUI-S. Fazlur Rahman, leader of the JUI-F, was appointed as Chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs in the second government of Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] (1993\u201396).\n\n===History since 2002===\nThe JUI-F was also the largest party in the MMA, winning 41 seats in the National Assembly and 29 of the MMA's 48 seats in NWFP in the 2002 elections.

The JUI-F was also part of the current ruling [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] coalition but left the government amidst charges of corruption against one of its members, an [[information technology]] minister of the federal cabinet. In return for JUI-F support, the PPP-led government appointed Maulana Sherani, a JUI-F senator without any formal academic training in [[Islamic jurisprudence]], as chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology in 2010. Sherani has frequently spoken out against the government\u2019s legislative efforts, particularly those related to women. He opposed a proposed bill on domestic violence stating that domestic violence was not a major issue in Pakistan until women's rights groups appeared and \"created\" it and that any such legislation hinders the creation of a \"true Islamic society\".

It was released on May 17, 1999 by [[Mute Records|Mute]] and [[V2 Records]]. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of his fourth album, ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996), which deviated from Moby's electronica style; his goal for ''Play'' was to return to this style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the recording of the album took place at Moby's home studio in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nWhile some of Moby's earlier work garnered critical and commercial success within the [[electronic dance music]] scene, ''Play'' was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. Initially issued to lackluster sales, it topped numerous album charts months after its release and was certified [[Music recording certification|platinum]] in more than 20 countries.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and commercial advertisements. ''Play'' eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/moby-on-new-memoir-the-decade-in-nyc-that-changed-his-life-20160607 |title=Moby on New Memoir, the Decade in NYC That Changed His Life |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |last=Zlatopolsky |first=Ashley}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 341 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=500greatest/><ref name=500greatest2/>\n\n==Background==\nThe second half of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a successful [[techno]] [[Child prodigy|wunderkind]]. The release in 1996 of ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'', a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him considering quitting music altogether and going back to school to study architecture. He explained: \"I was opening for [[Soundgarden]] and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night.\" However, he claimed, \"I got one piece of fan mail from [[Terence Trent D'Arby]] and I got a phone call from [[Axl Rose]] saying he was listening to ''Animal Rights'' on repeat. [[Bono]] told me he loved ''Animal Rights''. So if you're gonna have three pieces of fan mail, that's the fan mail to get.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>\n\nMoby started work on the album in August 1997 and put it on hold several times to complete touring obligations.<ref name=CCD99>{{cite web |url=https://www.chaoscontrol.com/moby-1999/ |title=Moby |work=Chaos Control Digizine |year=1999 |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |last=Gourley |first=Bob}}</ref> Recording sessions took place in Moby's [[Mott Street]] home studio in Manhattan, New York.

A second mixing was completed in an outside studio before attempts in two other studios displayed similar results. After returning home and producing a mix by himself, Moby felt happy with it. In the end, Moby said that he had \"wasted a lot of time and money\".<ref name=CCD99/> Moby recalled a moment from March 1999, after ''Play'' had been mixed and sequenced, where he sat on the grass in [[Sara Delano Roosevelt Park]]: \"I was sitting by the little tire swings that had been chewed apart by the pit bulls [...] thinking to myself, 'When this record comes out, it will be the end of my career. I should start thinking about what else I can do.'\" At that point, he considered returning to school to become an architect.<ref name=RS2002>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mobys-home-made-heaven-57904/ |title=Moby's Home Made Heaven |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 6, 2002 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |last=Fricke |first=David |authorlink=David Fricke}}</ref>\n\nWhen he finished recording, there was no sign that the album would perform any differently than ''Animal Rights''.

Seven of those singles were UK top 40 hits\u2014\"Honey\", the first single, was already in the market in August 1998, nearly ten months before the release of the actual album. The final single choice was \"Find My Baby\", which appeared on some national charts three and a half years after. Twelve music videos were commissioned for a total of eight different singles, produced by a large number of directors, which included [[Jonas \u00c5kerlund]] (\"Porcelain\"), [[Roman Coppola]] (\"Honey\"), [[Joseph Kahn]] (\"South Side\"), and [[David LaChapelle]] (\"Natural Blues\"). The apparent result of the marketing strategy was that the album, after an unremarkable debut, stayed on the charts for several years and broke sales projections for Moby and for the dance music scene, which was not seen to be a dominant commercial genre in the US in the 1990s (as compared with in Europe, where Moby had initially found fame).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn October 2000, a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Play: The B Sides]]'' was released, consisting of tracks released as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] on the album's singles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moby.com/discography/play-the-b-sides/ |title=Play: The B Sides |publisher=Moby.com |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby}}</ref> A [[DVD]] titled ''Play: The DVD'', produced by Moby and [[Handsome Boy Records|Jeff Rogers]], was later released in July 2001 as a companion to ''Play'', featuring most of the accompanying music videos for the album's singles, an 88-minute [[megamix]] of all the remixes created for the album accompanied by visuals created in [[Toronto]] at Crush, led by director Kathi Prosser, a performance on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', a tour diary shot by Moby and edited by Tara Bethune-Leamen entitled ''Give an Idiot a Camcorder'', a DVD-ROM component where users are able to remix two of Moby's songs, and a bonus CD containing the aforementioned megamix.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |others=[[Moby]] |year=2001 |title=Play: The DVD |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Mute Records]] |id=7243 4 92573 9 9}}</ref> The package was later nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Q8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90 |title=Final Nominations For The 44th Annual Grammy Awards |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=3 |location=New York |date=January 19, 2002|pages=90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 84/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref name=\"CST\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s|Christgau's Consumer Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = A+<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVQbszFuEGMC&pg=PA208 |chapter=Moby: Play |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |page=208 |title=[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-312-24560-2}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/06/11/play |title=Play |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York |date=June 11, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Browne |first=David |authorlink=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Grow out the roots |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=May 14, 1999 |last=Simpson |first=Dave}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev6Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |title=Moby \u2013 Play |journal=[[NME]] |location=London |date=May 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 11, 2016 |last=Cigarettes |first=Johnny |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001006122253/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |archivedate=October 6, 2000}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev7score = 5/10<ref name=\"DiCrescenzo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/ |title=Moby: Play |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=DiCrescenzo |first=Brent}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Moby: Play |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |location=London |issue=153 |date=June 1999 |page=109}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/play-19990624 |title=Play |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 24, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Walters |first=Barry}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev10score = 9/10<ref name=\"Aaron\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I5x8l8IaNUMC&pg=PA125#v=onepage |title=The Agony and the Ecstasy |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=15 |issue=7 |location=New York |date=July 1999 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |last=Aaron |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Aaron |pages=125\u201326}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Play'' was met with widespread critical acclaim.

It was released on May 17, 1999 by [[Mute Records|Mute]] and [[V2 Records]]. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of his fourth album, ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996), which deviated from Moby's electronica style; his goal for ''Play'' was to return to this style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the recording of the album took place at Moby's home studio in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nWhile some of Moby's earlier work garnered critical and commercial success within the [[electronic dance music]] scene, ''Play'' was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. Initially issued to lackluster sales, it topped numerous album charts months after its release and was certified [[Music recording certification|platinum]] in more than 20 countries.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and commercial advertisements. ''Play'' eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/moby-on-new-memoir-the-decade-in-nyc-that-changed-his-life-20160607 |title=Moby on New Memoir, the Decade in NYC That Changed His Life |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |last=Zlatopolsky |first=Ashley}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 341 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=500greatest/><ref name=500greatest2/>\n\n==Background==\nThe second half of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a successful [[techno]] [[Child prodigy|wunderkind]]. The release in 1996 of ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'', a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him considering quitting music altogether and going back to school to study architecture. He explained: \"I was opening for [[Soundgarden]] and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night.\" However, he claimed, \"I got one piece of fan mail from [[Terence Trent D'Arby]] and I got a phone call from [[Axl Rose]] saying he was listening to ''Animal Rights'' on repeat. [[Bono]] told me he loved ''Animal Rights''. So if you're gonna have three pieces of fan mail, that's the fan mail to get.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>\n\nMoby started work on the album in August 1997 and put it on hold several times to complete touring obligations.<ref name=CCD99>{{cite web |url=https://www.chaoscontrol.com/moby-1999/ |title=Moby |work=Chaos Control Digizine |date=1999 |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |last=Gourley |first=Bob}}</ref> Recording sessions took place in Moby's [[Mott Street]] home studio in Manhattan, New York. At the time, Moby planned on making the album his last before ending his career.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{cite book |title=[[Porcelain: A Memoir]] |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |year=2016 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby |isbn=1-59420-642-2}}</ref> ''Play'' was delayed due to Moby's dissatisfaction with the initial mix of the album that he had produced at home. A second mixing was completed in an outside studio before attempts in two other studios displayed similar results. After returning home and producing a mix by himself, Moby felt happy with it. In the end, Moby said that he had \"wasted a lot of time and money\".<ref name=CCD99/> Moby recalled a moment from March 1999, after ''Play'' had been mixed and sequenced, where he sat on the grass in [[Sara Delano Roosevelt Park]]: \"I was sitting by the little tire swings that had been chewed apart by the pit bulls [...] thinking to myself, 'When this record comes out, it will be the end of my career. I should start thinking about what else I can do.'\" At that point, he considered returning to school to become an architect.<ref name=RS2002>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mobys-home-made-heaven-57904/ |title=Moby's Home Made Heaven |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 6, 2002 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |last=Fricke |first=David |authorlink=David Fricke}}</ref>\n\nWhen he finished recording, there was no sign that the album would perform any differently than ''Animal Rights''. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label, from [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] to [[Sony Music|Sony]] to [[RCA Records|RCA]], and was rejected every time. After [[V2 Records|V2]] finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to listen to it.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/> According to Moby's manager Eric H\u00e4rle, their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'', Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_EricHaerleInt.html |title=Interview with Eric H\u00e4rle, manager at DEF for Moby, Sonique, R\u00f6yksopp |work=[[HitQuarters]] |date=March 25, 2003 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=Bouwman |first=Kimbel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609212002/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_EricHaerleInt.html |archivedate=June 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Composition and music ==\n''Play'' has been described as primarily a [[downtempo]] album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1999/08-05/0022_endfest__99.html |title=Endfest '99 |work=[[Kitsap Sun]] |last=McCarthy |first=Sean L. |date=August 5, 1999 |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Moby Puts V2 Debut in 'Play' |work=CMJ New Music Report |last=Ciabattoni |first=Steve |volume=58 |issue=619 |number=9 |page=2 |issn=0890-0795 |publisher=CMJ Network, Inc. |date=May 24, 1999 |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref><ref name=complex>{{cite web |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2013/08/the-15-best-songs-from-the-electronica-era/moby-play-2 |title=The 15 Best Songs From the Electronica Era |work=[[Complex.com|Complex]] |author=808SJAKE |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref> ''Complex'' wrote \"Moby's approach featured many live recordings and \"found sound\" (a colloquial term for [[field recording]]s), and the result was an organic downtempo masterpiece.

Moby was introduced to the collection through a friend, Dimitri Ehrlich, who loaned the CDs to him.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/> Most of the samples were short and constantly repeated throughout the songs. For example, \"Honey\" used a sample from [[Bessie Jones (American singer)|Bessie Jones]] that consisted of a conjunction of four verses that was repeated over twenty times.

I was like, 'But the record came out 10 months ago.' That's when I knew, all of a sudden, that things were different. Then it was number one in France, in Australia, in Germany\u2014it just kept piling on. [...] The week ''Play'' was released, it sold, worldwide around 6,000 copies. Eleven months after ''Play'' was released, it was selling 150,000 copies a week. I was on tour constantly, drunk pretty much the entire time and it was just a blur. And then all of a sudden movie stars started coming to my concerts and I started getting invited to fancy parties and suddenly the journalists who wouldn't return my publicist's calls were talking about doing cover stories. It was a really odd phenomenon.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>}}\n\n''Play'' also found its major strengths on the support of its impressive string of eight hit singles, an unprecedented feat for an electronica album. Seven of those singles were UK top 40 hits\u2014\"Honey\", the first single, was already in the market in August 1998, nearly ten months before the release of the actual album. The final single choice was \"Find My Baby\", which appeared on some national charts three and a half years after. Twelve music videos were commissioned for a total of eight different singles, produced by a large number of directors, which included [[Jonas \u00c5kerlund]] (\"Porcelain\"), [[Roman Coppola]] (\"Honey\"), [[Joseph Kahn]] (\"South Side\"), and [[David LaChapelle]] (\"Natural Blues\"). The apparent result of the marketing strategy was that the album, after an unremarkable debut, stayed on the charts for several years and broke sales projections for Moby and for the dance music scene, which was not seen to be a dominant commercial genre in the US in the 1990s (as compared with in Europe, where Moby had initially found fame).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn October 2000, a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Play: The B Sides]]'' was released, consisting of tracks released as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] on the album's singles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moby.com/discography/play-the-b-sides/ |title=Play: The B Sides |publisher=Moby.com |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby}}</ref> A [[DVD]] titled ''Play: The DVD'', produced by Moby and [[Handsome Boy Records|Jeff Rogers]], was later released in July 2001 as a companion to ''Play'', featuring most of the accompanying music videos for the album's singles, an 88-minute [[megamix]] of all the remixes created for the album accompanied by visuals created in [[Toronto]] at Crush, led by director Kathi Prosser, a performance on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', a tour diary shot by Moby and edited by Tara Bethune-Leamen entitled ''Give an Idiot a Camcorder'', a DVD-ROM component where users are able to remix two of Moby's songs, and a bonus CD containing the aforementioned megamix.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |others=[[Moby]] |year=2001 |title=Play: The DVD |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Mute Records]] |id=7243 4 92573 9 9}}</ref> The package was later nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90 |title=Final Nominations For The 44th Annual Grammy Awards |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=3 |location=New York |date=January 19, 2002 |accessdate=May 29, 2019 |pages=90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 84/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref name=\"CST\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s|Christgau's Consumer Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = A+<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVQbszFuEGMC&pg=PA208 |chapter=Moby: Play |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |page=208 |title=[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-312-24560-2}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/06/11/play |title=Play |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York |date=June 11, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Browne |first=David |authorlink=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Grow out the roots |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=May 14, 1999 |last=Simpson |first=Dave}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev6Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |title=Moby \u2013 Play |journal=[[NME]] |location=London |date=May 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 11, 2016 |last=Cigarettes |first=Johnny |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001006122253/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |archivedate=October 6, 2000}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev7score = 5/10<ref name=\"DiCrescenzo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/ |title=Moby: Play |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=DiCrescenzo |first=Brent}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Moby: Play |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |location=London |issue=153 |date=June 1999 |page=109}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/play-19990624 |title=Play |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 24, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Walters |first=Barry}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev10score = 9/10<ref name=\"Aaron\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5x8l8IaNUMC&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Agony and the Ecstasy |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=15 |issue=7 |location=New York |date=July 1999 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |last=Aaron |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Aaron |pages=125\u201326}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Play'' was met with widespread critical acclaim.

[[FM broadcasting|FM]] exposure followed. But the main reason this album will sound familiar the way [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth]] does to a [[classical music|classical]] ignoramus is that little bits of it have seeped into most Americans' brains. For this be grateful, because those bits are intensely pleasurable as melody or texture or sometimes beat, and because Moby has ordered, paced, and segued them and their intimate surroundings into something that suggests a surging and receding whole.

The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation.
