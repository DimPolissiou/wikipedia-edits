Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death. He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

Most of them fix it some way.\" Anthony's suggestion was removed from the final version, a change which shifted focus from the abortion choice to Gloria's concern that a baby would ruin her figure.<ref>{{cite book |last = Cline |first = Sally |author-link= Sally Cline |date= 2003|title= Zelda Fitzgerald: Her Voice in Paradise |url= https://archive.org/details/zeldafitzgeraldh00clin |location=New York |publisher= [[Arcade Publishing]] |pp=125-26 |isbn= 1-55970-688-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last = Milford |first = Nancy |author-link= Nancy Milford |date= 1970|title= Zelda: A Biography  |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NqlaAAAAMAAJ |location=New York |publisher= [[Harper & Row]] |page=88 |isbn= 1-57003-455-9}}</ref> Chapters of the book were serialized in ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' in late 1921, and in March 1922, the book was published.

Like most professional authors at the time, Fitzgerald supplemented his income by writing short stories for such magazines as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', and ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'', and sold his stories and novels to Hollywood studios. This \"whoring\", as Fitzgerald and, subsequently, Hemingway called these sales,<ref name=MoveableFeast1>Hemingway, Ernest \u2013 ''A Moveable Feast'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1964.</ref> was a sore point in the two authors' friendship.

Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again.

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Boston, MA: G.K.

Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death. He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\".

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Boston, MA: G.K.

The current [[Chief of Police]] is Colonel '''Jon Belmar'''. According to the Charter of St. Louis County, the county police chief has all of the criminal law enforcement duties of the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] of St. Louis County, except for the operation of the St. Louis County Jail, which is handled by the St. Louis County Department of Justice Services (civilian), court bailiff and service of civil process. Court bailiff/civil process duties are provided by a court-appointed sheriff and his employees, none of whom have law enforcement powers.\n\nThis change in law enforcement services occurred in 1955, when the St. Louis County Charter was amended by the voters to restrict the duties of the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office. The position of elected sheriff was eliminated. St. Louis County is one of two counties in Missouri that does not have an elected sheriff. With the charter amendment, all law enforcement services were assigned to a new police agency, the St. Louis County Police Department. The department is primarily responsible for law enforcement and investigations within unincorporated St. Louis County and contract municipalities, however, it has full police authority throughout the county, including its 88 municipalities which are also served by 58 local police departments, some of them very small.<ref>New Flordell Hills police force off to rough start as officer is charged with stealing from evidence room; by Jennifer S Mann, 2 October 2014, St Louis Post-Dispatch</ref> Additionally, St. Louis County police officers are authorized to enforce [[Missouri]] law in all counties in the state having a government of the first classification, which includes the independent [[City of St. Louis]]. Chief Jon Belmar was appointed to the position of [[Chief of Police]] on January 31, 2014. He will serve until April 2020 and will be succeed by Lieutenant Colonel Mary Barton who was named to the position March 19, 2020. \n\n==Departmental history==\nThe St. Louis County Police Department was established in 1955. The department was created with 95 officers and 18 civilian employees.<ref name=\"stlouiscountypolice1\">{{cite web|url=https://stlouiscountypolice.com/|title=St. Louis County Government|website=stlouiscountypolice.com}}</ref> The department is divided into four divisions: Patrol, Operational Support, Special Operations, and Criminal Investigation. It is the third largest local police agency in the state, the only [[county police]] department in Missouri and one of only a few in the United States. The SLCPD is accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies]]. CALEA is the only international body that accredits law enforcement agencies. Only seven percent of all U.S. law enforcement agencies are accredited. In 2010, CALEA recognized the St. Louis County Police Department with it distinguished Tri-Arc Award. The Tri-Arc Award is reserved for those police agencies that have successfully accredited their law enforcement services, police academy and communications division. Only six agencies in the world have achieved this status.\n\n== Fallen officers ==\nFrom  October 4, 1871, to October 6, 2016, the Officer Down Memorial Page reported that 13 officers in the St. Louis County Police Department died in the line of duty,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.odmp.org/agency/3689-st-louis-county-police-department-missouri|title=Fallen Officers|work=Officer Down Memorial Page}}</ref>  5 of them from gunfire,<ref name=memorial>{{cite web|url=https://www.odmp.org/agency/3689-st-louis-county-police-department-missouri|title=St. Louis County Police Department, MO|website=The Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP)}}</ref> 5 from automobile-related incidents, 1 from being stabbed, and 2 from heart attacks.<ref name=memorial /> Many families of those killed in the line of duty get support from [[BackStoppers]], a local charity.\n\nThe causes of death are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Each precinct's cars are issued plates with a letter corresponding to the assigned precinct. On November 1, 2010, the SLCPD took command of the City of [[Jennings, Missouri|Jennings]] Police Department under contract. The agency contracts with another 16 municipal governments to provide full-time police protection. Although the agency has full police authority of the sheriff in the entire county, including all municipalities, direct service population for the SLCPD is over 400,000 residents. A majority of these 400,000 residents are located in [[St. Louis County, Missouri#South County|South St. Louis County]] and [[Affton]], both of which are [[Connecticut Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] but heavily populated and suburban. The division fields 33 School Resource Officers (SRO) to various school districts in the county. A volunteer Reserve Police Unit provides uniformed support to the division. The Division of Patrol is commanded by '''Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Ludwig'''.\n\n'''County Police Precincts'''\n* 1st- North County (Plates: A)\n* 2nd- Central County (Plates: B)\n* 3rd- Affton Southwest County (Plates: C)\n* 4th- South County (Plates: D)\n* 5th- City of [[Fenton, Missouri|Fenton]] (Plates: F)\n* 6th- City of [[Wildwood, Missouri|Wildwood]] (Plates: G)\n* 7th- West County (Plates: H)\n* 8th - Jennings (Plates: J)\n\nVehicles marked with plates \"T\" are Tactical Unit vehicles or are used for the Tactical Unit; vehicles with plates \"E\" are for administration, D.A.R.E., K-9 Units, MetroLink, or other special non-patrol units.\n<ref name=\"stlouiscountypolice1\"/>\n\nPatrol Officers are issued the SIG Sauer P229R .40 semi-automatic pistol which replaced the Smith and Wesson 4006 .40 semi-automatic pistol in 2007. Detectives were issued the S&W 4013 .40 and the S&W 4014 .40, but now carry the SIG Sauer P229R .40 like the patrol officers.\n\n==Executive Command Staff==\nThe Chief of Police serves as the senior sworn member of the SLCPD. '''Jon Belmar''' is the 8th individual to hold the post and will retire in April 2020. '''Mary Barton''' has been named his successor and will be the 9th individual to hold the post once sworn in. Prior to 1955 the position was known as the Superintendent of Police and after that Chief of Police.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chief of Police|website=stlouiscountypolice.com|url=http://www.stlouiscountypolice.com/Who-We-Are/Chief-of-Police}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Col.

The current [[Chief of Police]] is Colonel '''Jon Belmar'''. According to the Charter of St. Louis County, the county police chief has all of the criminal law enforcement duties of the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] of St. Louis County, except for the operation of the St. Louis County Jail, which is handled by the St. Louis County Department of Justice Services (civilian), court bailiff and service of civil process. Court bailiff/civil process duties are provided by a court-appointed sheriff and his employees, none of whom have law enforcement powers.\n\nThis change in law enforcement services occurred in 1955, when the St. Louis County Charter was amended by the voters to restrict the duties of the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office. The position of elected sheriff was eliminated. St. Louis County is one of two counties in Missouri that does not have an elected sheriff. With the charter amendment, all law enforcement services were assigned to a new police agency, the St. Louis County Police Department. The department is primarily responsible for law enforcement and investigations within unincorporated St. Louis County and contract municipalities, however, it has full police authority throughout the county, including its 88 municipalities which are also served by 58 local police departments, some of them very small.<ref>New Flordell Hills police force off to rough start as officer is charged with stealing from evidence room; by Jennifer S Mann, 2 October 2014, St Louis Post-Dispatch</ref> Additionally, St. Louis County police officers are authorized to enforce [[Missouri]] law in all counties in the state having a government of the first classification, which includes the independent [[City of St. Louis]]. Chief Jon Belmar was appointed to the position of [[Chief of Police]] on January 31, 2014. He will serve until April 2020 and will be succeed by Lieutenant Colonel Mary Barton who was named to the position March 19, 2020. \n\n==Departmental history==\nThe St. Louis County Police Department was established in 1955. The department was created with 95 officers and 18 civilian employees.<ref name=\"stlouiscountypolice1\">{{cite web|url=https://stlouiscountypolice.com/|title=St. Louis County Government|website=stlouiscountypolice.com}}</ref> The department is divided into four divisions: Patrol, Operational Support, Special Operations, and Criminal Investigation. It is the third largest local police agency in the state, the only [[county police]] department in Missouri and one of only a few in the United States. The SLCPD is accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies]]. CALEA is the only international body that accredits law enforcement agencies. Only seven percent of all U.S. law enforcement agencies are accredited. In 2010, CALEA recognized the St. Louis County Police Department with it distinguished Tri-Arc Award. The Tri-Arc Award is reserved for those police agencies that have successfully accredited their law enforcement services, police academy and communications division. Only six agencies in the world have achieved this status.\n\n== Fallen officers ==\nFrom  October 4, 1871, to October 6, 2016, the Officer Down Memorial Page reported that 13 officers in the St. Louis County Police Department died in the line of duty,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.odmp.org/agency/3689-st-louis-county-police-department-missouri|title=Fallen Officers|work=Officer Down Memorial Page}}</ref>  5 of them from gunfire,<ref name=memorial>{{cite web|url=https://www.odmp.org/agency/3689-st-louis-county-police-department-missouri|title=St. Louis County Police Department, MO|website=The Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP)}}</ref> 5 from automobile-related incidents, 1 from being stabbed, and 2 from heart attacks.<ref name=memorial /> Many families of those killed in the line of duty get support from [[BackStoppers]], a local charity.\n\nThe causes of death are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Each precinct's cars are issued plates with a letter corresponding to the assigned precinct. On November 1, 2010, the SLCPD took command of the City of [[Jennings, Missouri|Jennings]] Police Department under contract. The agency contracts with another 16 municipal governments to provide full-time police protection. Although the agency has full police authority of the sheriff in the entire county, including all municipalities, direct service population for the SLCPD is over 400,000 residents. A majority of these 400,000 residents are located in [[St. Louis County, Missouri#South County|South St. Louis County]] and [[Affton]], both of which are [[Connecticut Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] but heavily populated and suburban. The division fields 33 School Resource Officers (SRO) to various school districts in the county. A volunteer Reserve Police Unit provides uniformed support to the division. The Division of Patrol is commanded by '''Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Ludwig'''.\n\n'''County Police Precincts'''\n* 1st- North County (Plates: A)\n* 2nd- Central County (Plates: B)\n* 3rd- Affton Southwest County (Plates: C)\n* 4th- South County (Plates: D)\n* 5th- City of [[Fenton, Missouri|Fenton]] (Plates: F)\n* 6th- City of [[Wildwood, Missouri|Wildwood]] (Plates: G)\n* 7th- West County (Plates: H)\n* 8th - Jennings (Plates: J)\n\nVehicles marked with plates \"T\" are Tactical Unit vehicles or are used for the Tactical Unit; vehicles with plates \"E\" are for administration, D.A.R.E., K-9 Units, MetroLink, or other special non-patrol units.\n<ref name=\"stlouiscountypolice1\"/>\n\nPatrol Officers are issued the SIG Sauer P229R .40 semi-automatic pistol which replaced the Smith and Wesson 4006 .40 semi-automatic pistol in 2007.

'''Jon Belmar''' is the 8th individual to hold the post and will retire in April 2020. '''Mary Barton''' has been named his successor and will be the 9th individual to hold the post once sworn in.

The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with [[20th Century Fox Television]] and was taped at stage 7 at the [[Metromedia Square|Fox Television Center]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\nThe title of the series was inspired by the [[NBC]] announcement of broadcasts being presented \"[[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|in living color]]\" during the 1960s, prior to mainstream [[color television]]. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast was [[Black people|black]], unlike other sketch comedy shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', whose casts are mostly [[White people|white]]. It was controversial due to the Wayans' decision to portray black humor from the [[ghetto]] in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans.\n\nOther members of the [[Wayans family]]\u2014[[Damon Wayans|Damon]], [[Kim Wayans|Kim]], [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]], and [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]]\u2014had regular roles, while brother [[Dwayne Wayans|Dwayne]] frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors, including [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tommy Davidson]], [[David Alan Grier]], and [[T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h]]. The show introduced [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] as members of ''In Living Color''<nowiki/>'s dance troupe The Fly Girls, with actress [[Rosie Perez]] serving as choreographer. The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons, capturing more than a 10-point [[Nielsen rating]]; in the third and fourth seasons, ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights.\n\nThe series won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series]] in 1990. The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live, special episode as a [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogram]] for the halftime show of U.S. leader [[CBS]]'s live telecast of [[Super Bowl XXVI]], prompting the [[National Football League]] to book A-list acts for future game entertainment, starting with [[Michael Jackson]] the following year.<ref name=trib-goalofspectacle>{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> In 2018, a history of the show, ''Homey Don't Play That!'' by David Peisner, was released by [[37 INK]], an imprint of [[Simon & Schuster]].\n\n== Description and history ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nFollowing Keenen Ivory Wayans' success with ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' and ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] approached Wayans to offer him his own show.<ref name= pokes>{{cite news |title= New Fox Show Pokes Fun at Black Stereotypes |publisher= Greensboro News & Record |location= Greensboro, North Carolina |work= Associated Press |page= B6 |date= April 12, 1990 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB191E9F73E3517&p_docnum=837&p_queryname=3 }}</ref> Wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content.<ref name= ready>{{cite news |title= Is prime time ready for rudeness?

It became renowned for [[parody]], especially of race relations in the [[United States]]. For instance, Carrey was frequently used to ridicule white musicians such as [[Snow (musician)|Snow]] and [[Vanilla Ice]], who performed in genres more commonly associated with black people. The Wayans themselves often played exaggerated black ghetto stereotypes for humor and effect. A sketch parodying ''[[Soul Train]]'' mocked the show as ''Old Train'', suggesting the show (along with its host, [[Don Cornelius]]) was out of touch and only appealed to the elderly and the dead. When asked about the show's use of stereotypes of black culture for comedy, Wayans said, \"Half of comedy is making fun of stereotypes. They only get critical when I do it. [[Woody Allen]] has been having fun with his culture for years, and no one says anything about it. [[Martin Scorsese]], his films basically deal with the Italian community, and no one ever says anything to him. [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], all of his films parody upscale white suburban life. Nobody says anything to him. When I do it, then all of a sudden it becomes a racial issue. You know what I mean? It's my culture, and I'm entitled to poke fun at the stereotypes that I didn't create in the first place. I don't even concern myself with that type of criticism, because it's racist in itself.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Humor is in 'Living Color': Writers Plan to Capitalize on Funny Cultural Stereotypes |work= Daily News of Los Angeles |date= April 15, 1990 |first= Yardena |last= Arar |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EF5BB34E44340CF&p_docnum=863&p_queryname=3 |page= L25 }}</ref>\n\nProminent skits:\n*  \"The Homeboy Shopping Network\", featuring Damon and Keenan as streetwise criminals operating an unlicensed, [[Home Shopping Network]]-style shopping network out of the back of their van to sell stolen goods.\n*  \"Fire Marshal Bill\", featuring Carrey as an incompetent, dangerously inept [[fire marshal]].\n*  \"[[Men on...|Men on Film]]\", featuring Damon and Grier as [[effeminate]] black film critics with exaggerated physical motions, such as \"two snaps up\".\n*  \"Homey D.

However, after the band [[Living Colour]] claimed in a lawsuit that the show stole the band's logo and name,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-08/entertainment/ca-455_1_group-living-colour |title=Living Colour band sues Fox |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 8, 1990 |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}</ref> the logo was changed to one with rather plain-type letters of three colors.  The show title itself is a homage to the [[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|NBC Peacock]] tag line, \"The following program is brought to you in living color\" from the 1960s when television was transitioning from black & white to color TV.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnvDVaiHXjM NBC Peacock clips] (posted to YouTube on Nov 4, 2011)</ref>\n\nIn the first two seasons, the opening sequence was set in a room covered with painters' tarps. Each cast member, wearing black-and-white, played with brightly colored paint in a different way (throwing paintballs at the camera by hand, [[spray painting]] the lens, using a roller to cover the camera lens, etc.). The sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building, where the show's dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let Keenen Ivory Wayans greet a live audience.\n\nFor the third and fourth seasons, an animated sequence and different logo were used. Cast members were superimposed over pictures hanging in an art gallery and interacted with them in different ways (spinning the canvas to put it right-side up, swinging the frame out as if it were a door, etc.). The final image was of the logo on a black canvas, which shattered to begin the show. The fifth season retained the logo, but depicted the cast members on various signs and billboards around a city (either New York or Chicago), ending with the logo displayed on a theater marquee.\n\nThe [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] group [[Heavy D & the Boyz]] performed two different versions of the opening theme. One version was used for the first two seasons and remixed for the fifth, while the other was featured in the third and fourth seasons.\n\n=== Live musical performances ===\n''In Living Color'' was known for its live music performances, which started in Season 2 with [[Queen Latifah]] as their first performer (appearing again in the third season). Additional musical acts who appeared were [[Heavy D]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Kris Kross]], [[En Vogue]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Da Youngsta's]], [[Monie Love]], [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]], [[3rd Bass]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Jodeci]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Father MC]], [[Gang Starr]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[Simple E]], [[Us3]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[Nice & Smooth]], [[Wreckx-n-Effect]], [[A.D.O.R.]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Showbiz and A.G.]], [[Patra (singer)|Patra]], [[Naughty By Nature]], [[Lords of the Underground]], [[Prince Markie Dee]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[Leaders of the New School]].\n\n=== The Fly Girls ===\nThe show employed an in-house dance troupe known as the \"Fly Girls\". The original lineup consisted of [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] (who became a choreographer and judge on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''), Cari French, Deidre Lang, Lisa Marie Todd, Barbara Lumpkin and Michelle Whitney-Morrison. [[Rosie Perez]] was the choreographer for the first four seasons. The most notable former Fly Girl was future actress/singer [[Jennifer Lopez]], who joined the show in its third season.\n\nThroughout the show's run, the Fly Girls frequently performed a dance routine to lead into commercial breaks and/or during the closing credits. In the first two seasons, they also performed a routine that immediately followed the opening sequence. Music was provided by an in-house DJ - [[Shawn Wayans]] (credited as SW-1) in the first two seasons, then [[Leroy \"Twist\" Casey|DJ Twist]] from season 3 onward.\n\nThe Fly Girls would sometimes be used as extras in sketches, or as part of an opening gag. In one sketch, they were shown performing open-heart surgery (in the sketch, the girls are dancing in order to pay their way through medical school). Another routine featured the three original female cast members dancing off-beat during the introduction of the show, when it was revealed that the regular Fly Girls were all bound and gagged and breaking through the door where Keenan Ivory Wayans enters.\n\nThree of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season in 1997.\n\n==Controversies==\nKeenen Ivory Wayans stopped appearing in sketches in 1992 after the end of the third season, over disputes with Fox about the network [[censorship|censoring]] the show's content and rerunning early episodes without his consultation. Wayans feared that Fox would ultimately decrease the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] value of ''In Living Color''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=2007-10-17|edition=9|page=661|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}</ref> \n\nDamon went on to pursue a movie career around the same time, though he made occasional return appearances in the fourth season. During the fourth season (1992\u20131993), Keenen appeared only in the season opener, though he remained the executive producer and thus stayed in the opening credits until the thirteenth episode.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Marlon left shortly after Keenen resigned as producer, and Shawn and Kim both left at the end of the fourth season.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of In Living Color cast members}}\n===Cast members===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Cast member\n!colspan=\"15\"|Seasons\n|-\n!width=\"60\"|1\n!width=\"60\"|2\n!width=\"60\"|3\n!width=\"60\"|4\n!width=\"60\"|5\n|-\n![[Jim Carrey]]\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring\n|-\n![[Kelly Coffield]]\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring\n|\n|-\n![[Kim Coles]]\n|style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring\n|colspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n![[Tommy Davidson]]\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring\n|-\n![[David Alan Grier]]\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring \n|-\n![[T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h]]\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring\n|-\n![[Damon Wayans]]\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring\n|colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n![[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring\n|\n|-\n![[Kim Wayans]]\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring \n|\n|-\n![[Shawn Wayans]]\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ff9999; text-align:center;\" | Featured\n|\n|-\n![[Jamie Foxx]]\n|colspan=\"2\" |\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ff9999; text-align:center;\" | Featured\n|style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring\n|-\n![[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]]\n|colspan=2 |\n|style=\"background:#ff9999; text-align:center;\" | Featured\n|colspan=2 |\n|-\n![[Leroy 'Twist' Casey|DJ Twist]]\n|colspan=2 |\n|colspan=3 style=\"background:#ff9999; text-align:center;\" | Featured\n|-\n![[Marlon Wayans]]\n|colspan=\"3\" |\n|style=\"background:#ff9999; text-align:center;\" | Featured\n|\n|-\n![[Ali Wentworth|Alexandra Wentworth]]\n|colspan=\"3\" |\n|style=\"background:#ff9999; text-align:center;\" | Featured\n|style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring \n|-\n![[Anne-Marie Johnson]]\n|colspan=\"4\" |\n|style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring \n|-\n![[Jay Leggett]]\n|colspan=\"4\" |\n|style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring \n|-\n!Reggie McFadden\n|colspan=\"4\" |\n|style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring \n|-\n!Carol Rosenthal \n|colspan=\"4\" |\n|style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring \n|-\n![[Marc Wilmore]]\n|colspan=\"4\" |\n|style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | Starring \n|-\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In the early years of ''In Living Color'', Rock was parodied as being the only African American cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (despite ''SNL'' also having [[Tim Meadows]] at the time). In an ''SNL'' episode honoring [[Mother's Day]], Rock's mother states that she is disappointed in him for not trying out for ''In Living Color'', to which Rock states he is happy with his job on ''SNL''.\n\nOther recurring guest stars in the fifth season include [[Nick Bakay]] (for ''The Dirty Dozens'' sketches) and [[Peter Marshall (game show host)|Peter Marshall]] (for several editions of ''East [[Hollywood Squares]]''). Rapper [[Biz Markie]] also appeared in various roles as a guest star in the fifth season, such as being in drag as Wanda the Ugly Woman's sister or as \"Dirty Dozens\" contestant Damian \"Foosball\" Franklin. [[Ed O'Neill]] made a cameo appearance as [[Al Bundy]] in a \"Dirty Dozens\" segment.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of In Living Color episodes}}\n\n==Syndication==\nOriginally produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] on Fox, the series was in reruns on local affiliates for a few years, but has since become a longstanding mainstay on Fox's sister cable networks [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[FXX]]. In syndication, the series is distributed by Twentieth Television.\n\nReruns of the show also aired on BET from 2005\u20132008, and returned in 2010. Reruns have also aired on [[MTV2]], [[VH1]], [[nuvoTV]], and on BET-owned [[BET Her|Centric]].\n\nUnlike past runs on FX and the [[Viacom Media Networks]], the FXX cut of episodes are mostly uncut and censored. The music video parodies and spoken references to licensed songs have been reinstated, but the \"Bolt 45\" sketch, the \"drop the soap\" line, and the \"Men on Football\" sketch with the adlibbed lines about Richard Gere's and Carl Lewis's alleged homosexuality are still edited (though the facial ejaculation shot on \"Men on Fitness\" was reinstated), along with a line from the season five sketch \"Fire Marshall Bill at the Magic Show\" that makes reference to the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] (the missing line is, \"That's what they said about the World Trade Center, son.

Hosted by David Alan Grier, it was a retrospective featuring classic sketches, along with cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. The show aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central, after MyNetworkTV's sitcom ''[[Under One Roof (2008 TV series)|Under One Roof]]''.\n\nIn 2017, the show began airing reruns on [[Fusion TV|Fusion]] and Aspire.\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n*1990\u201391: #58 (10.31 rating)\n*1991\u201392: #49 (10.37 rating)\n*1992\u201393: #62 (9.67 rating)\n*1993\u201394: #71 (7.98 rating)\nNote: Ratings data courtesy of TVTango.com\n\n== Crossovers ==\n*At the 2006 [[BET Awards]] when the show returned from one of its commercial breaks, the show's host Damon Wayans played a character very reminiscent to \"Men on ...\" critic Blaine Edwards.\n*''In Living Color'' alums Damon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and David Alan Grier reprised some of their ''In Living Color'' characters on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':\n**Damon Wayans, a featured player during that show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|eleventh season]], hosted an episode from ''SNL'''s 20th season in 1995, where he brought on two of his famous ''In Living Color'' characters: homeless wino Anton Jackson and gay film critic Blaine Edwards.\n**Jim Carrey auditioned to be one of the repertory members on ''SNL'' 's ill-fated [[Saturday Night Live (Season 6)|1980\u20131981 season]], but was dropped in favor of [[Charles Rocket]] (who later appeared in the [[1988 in film|1988]] film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' and the [[1994 in film|1994]] film ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' with Carrey). Carrey also auditioned for the 1985\u20131986 season (season eleven), but backed out after seeing a man threatening to jump from 30 Rockefeller Center, believing that the stress of working on ''Saturday Night Live'' would drive Carrey to suicide. Carrey hosted the season finale of ''SNL'''s 21st season in 1996, where he impersonated [[Fire Marshal Bill]] during the monologue. Carrey's most recent hosting stint, in October 2014, involved a Carrey family reunion sketch in which [[Cecily Strong]] plays Carrey's aunt, who is modeled after Fire Marshal Bill.<ref>{{cite web |title= Did You Get Every Jim Carrey Reference In 'SNL's 'Family Reunion' Sketch? |first= Josh |last= Kurp |date= October 26, 2014 |work= Uproxx |url= http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/10/did-you-get-every-jim-carrey-reference-in-snls-family-reunion-sketch/ }}</ref>\n**David Alan Grier first hosted ''SNL'' during season 21 and reprised his ''In Living Color'' role as \"[[Men on...]]\" critic Antoine Merriweather, which the end of the sketch included a surprise on-set appearance from Damon Wayans as Blaine. Grier hosted ''SNL'' on December 9, 1995 (season 21) and March 18, 1997 (season 22).\n*Jamie Foxx reprised his role as Wanda in a short segment at the 2009 BET Awards.\n* In 1997, three of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season.\n*In the 1997 film ''[[Liar Liar]]'', Jim Carrey reprised his \"Fire Marshal Bill\" character (albeit with no lines) in the background of one of the closing scenes.\n*The February 10, 2001 episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosted by Jennifer Lopez included a sketch where Lopez \"reunited\" with the Fly Girls (played by [[Rachel Dratch]], [[Jerry Minor]] and [[Tracy Morgan]]).\n\n==Home media==\n[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] has released all five seasons of ''In Living Color'' on DVD in Region 1. Due to music licensing issues, some sketches have been edited to remove any and all mention of licensed songs, from characters waxing lyrical to entire performances (including the music video parodies and some of the Fly Girl dancing [[Interstitial program|interstitials]]). Additionally, the \"Bolt 45\" sketch (which aired one-time only on May 5, 1990) was omitted, and the \"soap\" portion of the \"drop the soap\" line in the second \"Men on Film\" sketch has been muted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n|-\n| Season 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n| April 6, 2004\n|-\n| Season 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| September 28, 2004\n|-\n| Season 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n| May 10, 2005\n|-\n| Season 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n| October 25, 2005\n|-\n| Season 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| April 11, 2006\n|}\n\n==Attempted revival==\n[[Image:In Living Color 2012 Logo.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''In Living Color'' 2012 logo.|alt=In Living Color 2012 logo.]]\nIn 2011, there were plans to make a revival of the original series that featured a new cast, characters, and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Deadline.com|date=October 28, 2011|title=Fox to Reboot 'In Living Color' with Keenan Ivory Wayans|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-to-reboot-in-living-color-with-keenan-ivory-wayans|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox44.com/news/hollywood-hookup/new-in-living-color-fly-girls|work=Fox44.com|date=February 29, 2012|title=New 'In Living Color' |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=official>{{cite web|work=Fox.com|url=http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=in-living-color|title='In Living Color'|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] were hosted and executive produced by original series creator and cast member [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]].

[[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] created, wrote and starred in the program. The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with [[20th Century Fox Television]] and was taped at stage 7 at the [[Metromedia Square|Fox Television Center]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\nThe title of the series was inspired by the [[NBC]] announcement of broadcasts being presented \"[[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|in living color]]\" during the 1960s, prior to mainstream [[color television]]. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast was [[Black people|black]], unlike other sketch comedy shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', whose casts are mostly [[White people|white]]. It was controversial due to the Wayans' decision to portray black humor from the [[ghetto]] in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans.\n\nOther members of the [[Wayans family]]\u2014[[Damon Wayans|Damon]], [[Kim Wayans|Kim]], [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]], and [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]]\u2014had regular roles, while brother [[Dwayne Wayans|Dwayne]] frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors, including [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tommy Davidson]], [[David Alan Grier]], and [[T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h]]. The show introduced [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] as members of ''In Living Color''<nowiki/>'s dance troupe The Fly Girls, with actress [[Rosie Perez]] serving as choreographer. The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons, capturing more than a 10-point [[Nielsen rating]]; in the third and fourth seasons, ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights.\n\nThe series won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series]] in 1990. The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live, special episode as a [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogram]] for the halftime show of U.S. leader [[CBS]]'s live telecast of [[Super Bowl XXVI]], prompting the [[National Football League]] to book A-list acts for future game entertainment, starting with [[Michael Jackson]] the following year.<ref name=trib-goalofspectacle>{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> In 2018, a history of the show, ''Homey Don't Play That!'' by David Peisner, was released by [[37 INK]], an imprint of [[Simon & Schuster]].\n\n== Description and history ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nFollowing Keenen Ivory Wayans' success with ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' and ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] approached Wayans to offer him his own show.<ref name= pokes>{{cite news |title= New Fox Show Pokes Fun at Black Stereotypes |publisher= Greensboro News & Record |location= Greensboro, North Carolina |work= Associated Press |page= B6 |date= April 12, 1990 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB191E9F73E3517&p_docnum=837&p_queryname=3 }}</ref> Wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content.<ref name= ready>{{cite news |title= Is prime time ready for rudeness?

It became renowned for [[parody]], especially of race relations in the [[United States]]. For instance, Carrey was frequently used to ridicule white musicians such as [[Snow (musician)|Snow]] and [[Vanilla Ice]], who performed in genres more commonly associated with black people. The Wayans themselves often played exaggerated black ghetto stereotypes for humor and effect. A sketch parodying ''[[Soul Train]]'' mocked the show as ''Old Train'', suggesting the show (along with its host, [[Don Cornelius]]) was out of touch and only appealed to the elderly and the dead. When asked about the show's use of stereotypes of black culture for comedy, Wayans said, \"Half of comedy is making fun of stereotypes. They only get critical when I do it. [[Woody Allen]] has been having fun with his culture for years, and no one says anything about it. [[Martin Scorsese]], his films basically deal with the Italian community, and no one ever says anything to him. [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], all of his films parody upscale white suburban life. Nobody says anything to him. When I do it, then all of a sudden it becomes a racial issue. You know what I mean? It's my culture, and I'm entitled to poke fun at the stereotypes that I didn't create in the first place. I don't even concern myself with that type of criticism, because it's racist in itself.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Humor is in 'Living Color': Writers Plan to Capitalize on Funny Cultural Stereotypes |work= Daily News of Los Angeles |date= April 15, 1990 |first= Yardena |last= Arar |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EF5BB34E44340CF&p_docnum=863&p_queryname=3 |page= L25 }}</ref>\n\nProminent skits:\n*  \"The Homeboy Shopping Network\", featuring Damon and Keenan as streetwise criminals operating an unlicensed, [[Home Shopping Network]]-style shopping network out of the back of their van to sell stolen goods.\n*  \"Fire Marshal Bill\", featuring Carrey as an incompetent, dangerously inept [[fire marshal]].\n*  \"[[Men on...|Men on Film]]\", featuring Damon and Grier as [[effeminate]] black film critics with exaggerated physical motions, such as \"two snaps up\".\n*  \"Homey D.

Each cast member, wearing black-and-white, played with brightly colored paint in a different way (throwing paintballs at the camera by hand, [[spray painting]] the lens, using a roller to cover the camera lens, etc.). The sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building, where the show's dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let Keenen Ivory Wayans greet a live audience.\n\nFor the third and fourth seasons, an animated sequence and different logo were used. Cast members were superimposed over pictures hanging in an art gallery and interacted with them in different ways (spinning the canvas to put it right-side up, swinging the frame out as if it were a door, etc.). The final image was of the logo on a black canvas, which shattered to begin the show. The fifth season retained the logo, but depicted the cast members on various signs and billboards around a city (either New York or Chicago), ending with the logo displayed on a theater marquee.\n\nThe [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] group [[Heavy D & the Boyz]] performed two different versions of the opening theme. One version was used for the first two seasons and remixed for the fifth, while the other was featured in the third and fourth seasons.\n\n=== Live musical performances ===\n''In Living Color'' was known for its live music performances, which started in Season 2 with [[Queen Latifah]] as their first performer (appearing again in the third season). Additional musical acts who appeared were [[Heavy D]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Kris Kross]], [[En Vogue]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Da Youngsta's]], [[Monie Love]], [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]], [[3rd Bass]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Jodeci]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Father MC]], [[Gang Starr]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[Simple E]], [[Us3]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[Nice & Smooth]], [[Wreckx-n-Effect]], [[A.D.O.R.]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Showbiz and A.G.]], [[Patra (singer)|Patra]], [[Naughty By Nature]], [[Lords of the Underground]], [[Prince Markie Dee]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[Leaders of the New School]].\n\n=== The Fly Girls ===\nThe show employed an in-house dance troupe known as the \"Fly Girls\". The original lineup consisted of [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] (who became a choreographer and judge on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''), Cari French, Deidre Lang, Lisa Marie Todd, Barbara Lumpkin and Michelle Whitney-Morrison. [[Rosie Perez]] was the choreographer for the first four seasons. The most notable former Fly Girl was future actress/singer [[Jennifer Lopez]], who joined the show in its third season.\n\nThroughout the show's run, the Fly Girls frequently performed a dance routine to lead into commercial breaks and/or during the closing credits. In the first two seasons, they also performed a routine that immediately followed the opening sequence. Music was provided by an in-house DJ - [[Shawn Wayans]] (credited as SW-1) in the first two seasons, then [[Leroy \"Twist\" Casey|DJ Twist]] from season 3 onward.\n\nThe Fly Girls would sometimes be used as extras in sketches, or as part of an opening gag. In one sketch, they were shown performing open-heart surgery (in the sketch, the girls are dancing in order to pay their way through medical school). Another routine featured the three original female cast members dancing off-beat during the introduction of the show, when it was revealed that the regular Fly Girls were all bound and gagged and breaking through the door where Keenan Ivory Wayans enters.\n\nThree of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season in 1997.\n\n==Controversies==\nKeenen Ivory Wayans stopped appearing in sketches in 1992 after the end of the third season, over disputes with Fox about the network [[censorship|censoring]] the show's content and rerunning early episodes without his consultation. Wayans feared that Fox would ultimately decrease the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] value of ''In Living Color''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=2007-10-17|edition=9|page=661|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}</ref> \n\nDamon went on to pursue a movie career around the same time, though he made occasional return appearances in the fourth season.

In the early years of ''In Living Color'', Rock was parodied as being the only African American cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (despite ''SNL'' also having [[Tim Meadows]] at the time). In an ''SNL'' episode honoring [[Mother's Day]], Rock's mother states that she is disappointed in him for not trying out for ''In Living Color'', to which Rock states he is happy with his job on ''SNL''.\n\nOther recurring guest stars in the fifth season include [[Nick Bakay]] (for ''The Dirty Dozens'' sketches) and [[Peter Marshall (game show host)|Peter Marshall]] (for several editions of ''East [[Hollywood Squares]]''). Rapper [[Biz Markie]] also appeared in various roles as a guest star in the fifth season, such as being in drag as Wanda the Ugly Woman's sister or as \"Dirty Dozens\" contestant Damian \"Foosball\" Franklin. [[Ed O'Neill]] made a cameo appearance as [[Al Bundy]] in a \"Dirty Dozens\" segment.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of In Living Color episodes}}\n\n==Syndication==\nOriginally produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] on Fox, the series was in reruns on local affiliates for a few years, but has since become a longstanding mainstay on Fox's sister cable networks [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[FXX]]. In syndication, the series is distributed by Twentieth Television.\n\nReruns of the show also aired on BET from 2005\u20132008, and returned in 2010. Reruns have also aired on [[MTV2]], [[VH1]], [[nuvoTV]], and on BET-owned [[BET Her|Centric]].\n\nUnlike past runs on FX and the [[Viacom Media Networks]], the FXX cut of episodes are mostly uncut and censored. The music video parodies and spoken references to licensed songs have been reinstated, but the \"Bolt 45\" sketch, the \"drop the soap\" line, and the \"Men on Football\" sketch with the adlibbed lines about Richard Gere's and Carl Lewis's alleged homosexuality are still edited (though the facial ejaculation shot on \"Men on Fitness\" was reinstated), along with a line from the season five sketch \"Fire Marshall Bill at the Magic Show\" that makes reference to the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] (the missing line is, \"That's what they said about the World Trade Center, son. But me and my friend Abdul and a couple of pounds of plastique explosives showed them different.\" Bill's laugh and his catchphrase \"Lemme show ya somethin'\" was also cut abruptly), due to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].\n\n''The Best of In Living Color'' aired on [[MyNetworkTV]] from April 16 to June 18, 2008. Hosted by David Alan Grier, it was a retrospective featuring classic sketches, along with cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. The show aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central, after MyNetworkTV's sitcom ''[[Under One Roof (2008 TV series)|Under One Roof]]''.\n\nIn 2017, the show began airing reruns on [[Fusion TV|Fusion]] and Aspire.\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n*1990\u201391: #58 (10.31 rating)\n*1991\u201392: #49 (10.37 rating)\n*1992\u201393: #62 (9.67 rating)\n*1993\u201394: #71 (7.98 rating)\nNote: Ratings data courtesy of TVTango.com\n\n== Crossovers ==\n*At the 2006 [[BET Awards]] when the show returned from one of its commercial breaks, the show's host Damon Wayans played a character very reminiscent to \"Men on ...\" critic Blaine Edwards.\n*''In Living Color'' alums Damon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and David Alan Grier reprised some of their ''In Living Color'' characters on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':\n**Damon Wayans, a featured player during that show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|eleventh season]], hosted an episode from ''SNL'''s 20th season in 1995, where he brought on two of his famous ''In Living Color'' characters: homeless wino Anton Jackson and gay film critic Blaine Edwards.\n**Jim Carrey auditioned to be one of the repertory members on ''SNL'' 's ill-fated [[Saturday Night Live (Season 6)|1980\u20131981 season]], but was dropped in favor of [[Charles Rocket]] (who later appeared in the [[1988 in film|1988]] film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' and the [[1994 in film|1994]] film ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' with Carrey). Carrey also auditioned for the 1985\u20131986 season (season eleven), but backed out after seeing a man threatening to jump from 30 Rockefeller Center, believing that the stress of working on ''Saturday Night Live'' would drive Carrey to suicide. Carrey hosted the season finale of ''SNL'''s 21st season in 1996, where he impersonated [[Fire Marshal Bill]] during the monologue. Carrey's most recent hosting stint, in October 2014, involved a Carrey family reunion sketch in which [[Cecily Strong]] plays Carrey's aunt, who is modeled after Fire Marshal Bill.<ref>{{cite web |title= Did You Get Every Jim Carrey Reference In 'SNL's 'Family Reunion' Sketch? |first= Josh |last= Kurp |date= October 26, 2014 |work= Uproxx |url= http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/10/did-you-get-every-jim-carrey-reference-in-snls-family-reunion-sketch/ }}</ref>\n**David Alan Grier first hosted ''SNL'' during season 21 and reprised his ''In Living Color'' role as \"[[Men on...]]\" critic Antoine Merriweather, which the end of the sketch included a surprise on-set appearance from Damon Wayans as Blaine. Grier hosted ''SNL'' on December 9, 1995 (season 21) and March 18, 1997 (season 22).\n*Jamie Foxx reprised his role as Wanda in a short segment at the 2009 BET Awards.\n* In 1997, three of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season.\n*In the 1997 film ''[[Liar Liar]]'', Jim Carrey reprised his \"Fire Marshal Bill\" character (albeit with no lines) in the background of one of the closing scenes.\n*The February 10, 2001 episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosted by Jennifer Lopez included a sketch where Lopez \"reunited\" with the Fly Girls (played by [[Rachel Dratch]], [[Jerry Minor]] and [[Tracy Morgan]]).\n\n==Home media==\n[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] has released all five seasons of ''In Living Color'' on DVD in Region 1. Due to music licensing issues, some sketches have been edited to remove any and all mention of licensed songs, from characters waxing lyrical to entire performances (including the music video parodies and some of the Fly Girl dancing [[Interstitial program|interstitials]]). Additionally, the \"Bolt 45\" sketch (which aired one-time only on May 5, 1990) was omitted, and the \"soap\" portion of the \"drop the soap\" line in the second \"Men on Film\" sketch has been muted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n|-\n| Season 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n| April 6, 2004\n|-\n| Season 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| September 28, 2004\n|-\n| Season 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n| May 10, 2005\n|-\n| Season 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n| October 25, 2005\n|-\n| Season 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| April 11, 2006\n|}\n\n==Attempted revival==\n[[Image:In Living Color 2012 Logo.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''In Living Color'' 2012 logo.|alt=In Living Color 2012 logo.]]\nIn 2011, there were plans to make a revival of the original series that featured a new cast, characters, and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Deadline.com|date=October 28, 2011|title=Fox to Reboot 'In Living Color' with Keenan Ivory Wayans|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-to-reboot-in-living-color-with-keenan-ivory-wayans|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox44.com/news/hollywood-hookup/new-in-living-color-fly-girls|work=Fox44.com|date=February 29, 2012|title=New 'In Living Color' |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=official>{{cite web|work=Fox.com|url=http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=in-living-color|title='In Living Color'|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] were hosted and executive produced by original series creator and cast member [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]].

One day, Tim is surprised when an infant wearing a business suit arrives at his house in a taxi, and Ted and Janice call him Tim's little brother. Tim is envious of the attention the day-old baby receives, not to mention suspicion when the infant acts odd around him, but his parents are oblivious.\n\nSoon, Tim learns that the baby can talk like an adult, and he introduces himself as \"The Boss\". Seeing an opportunity to get rid of him, Tim decides to record a conversation between the Boss Baby and other toddlers who are at Tim's house for a meeting. A chase ensues, and the [[Compact cassette|cassette tape]] is terminated by passing automobile after the Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favorite stuffed animal, Lam-Lam. With no evidence to support him, Tim's parents ground him for three weeks.\n\nThe Boss Baby apologizes to Tim and has him suck on a pacifier that transports them to Baby Corp., a place where infants with adult-like minds work to preserve infant love everywhere. The Boss Baby explains that he was sent to see why puppies are being loved more than infants. He has infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co., which will unleash a new puppy on a pet convention in Las Vegas. The Boss Baby stays intelligent by drinking a \"Secret Baby Formula\" that enables a baby to act like an adult. However, should a baby not drink it after a period of time, he or she becomes a regular baby. When they overhear Boss Baby's boss threatening to fire him for not bringing in information, which would strip him of his formula and strand him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to prevent that.\n\nTim's parents \"un-ground\" him and take them to Puppy Co. for take your child to work day. While there, they slip away and find what they think is the plans for a \"Forever Puppy\", but they are captured by the company's founder and CEO, Francis E. Francis. They discover that Francis used to be the head of Baby Corp. and whom Boss Baby idolizes, but was ousted when it was discovered that his [[lactose intolerance]] kept the secret formula from working properly. Francis intends to have the Forever Puppies overshadow babies by stealing Boss Baby's serum bottle and infecting the puppies with it as revenge. Tim's parents go with Francis to Las Vegas, and Francis has his brother Eugene pose as Tim and Boss Baby's babysitter to keep them from interfering.\n\nWithout a steady flow of formula to maintain his intelligence, Boss Baby starts becoming a normal baby. Despite this, he and Tim evade the \"babysitter\" long enough to reach the airport but are too late to intercept Tim's parents. They sneak on to another plane bound for Las Vegas. There, they stall Francis' presentation when Eugene unwittingly gives away their plan. Furious at their interference, Francis locks Tim's parents up so he can burn them with exhaust from a rocket used to launch the Forever Puppies. Tim and Boss Baby defeat Eugene and move on to save their parents but are intercepted by Francis. Tim and Boss Baby push him off a ledge, making Francis tumble into the formula. Boss Baby opens the rocket to let the puppies out so they can save Tim's parents. His return to baby state is complete while on the rocket, and begins to cry, but Tim sings to him with [[Blackbird (Beatles song)|the family song]] to show his appreciation, causing him to jump off the rocket before it launches. After the rocket does launch, Tim takes Boss Baby to the formula vat and he returns to his original self. Francis then emerges from the vat, having been reverted to an obese baby and tries to attack Boss Baby, but is picked up by a redeemed Eugene and tells Tim and Boss Baby that \"This time we'll raise him right\".\n\nBoss Baby is promoted and leaves. Tim goes back to being an only child, but he and Boss Baby miss each other. After Tim writes a letter convincing him to live with him as his brother, Boss Baby returns to the Templeton family as a regular baby named Theodore Lindsey \"Ted\" Templeton. Back in the present, Tim finished with his brother Ted the story to his daughter, which she just had recently a baby sister, who acts like Ted did when he was Boss Baby.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Alec Baldwin (28246306070).jpg|thumb|right|Alec Baldwin at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* Miles Bakshi as Tim Templeton, Boss Baby's 7-year-old brother.<ref name=\"SFLikeGlenRoss\">{{cite web|last1=Amderton|first1=Ethan|title=DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u2018The Boss Baby\u2019 Is Like an Animated \u2018Glengarry Glen Ross\u2019 for Kids (Comic-Con 2016)|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/boss-baby-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=October 28, 2016|date=July 21, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" /><ref name=\"VarietyAnnecyBossBaby\">{{cite news|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|last2=Mayorga|first2=Emilio|title=Annecy: Tom McGrath Unveils Alec Baldwin-Starrer \u2018Boss Baby\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/annecy-tom-mcgrath-alec-baldwin-boss-baby-1201797075/|accessdate=June 18, 2016|work=Variety|date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n** [[Tobey Maguire]] as Adult Tim, the narrator.<ref name=\"USATSneakPeek\">{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|title=Sneak peek: Alec Baldwin is 'The Boss Baby'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/10/16/alec-baldwin-boss-baby-sneak-peek-exclusive/92058380/|accessdate=October 17, 2016|work=USA Today|date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Theodore Templeton / Boss Baby, a baby with the mind of an adult, who works at Baby Corp.<ref name=THRBaldwinSpacey />\n* [[Jimmy Kimmel]] as Ted Templeton, Janice's husband and Tim's father.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Janice Templeton, Ted's wife and Tim's mother.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Francis E.

Having been often present at DreamWorks, McGrath initially asked Bakshi only to provide a temporary voice for Tim to see if the character \"worked\". The producers listened to 30 to 40 children to choose the scratch voice. McGrath explained their decision: \"No one sounded as authentic as Miles did.

One day, Tim is surprised when an infant wearing a business suit arrives at his house in a taxi, and Ted and Janice call him Tim's little brother. Tim is envious of the attention the day-old baby receives, not to mention suspicion when the infant acts odd around him, but his parents are oblivious.\n\nSoon, Tim learns that the baby can talk like an adult, and he introduces himself as \"The Boss\". Seeing an opportunity to get rid of him, Tim decides to record a conversation between the Boss Baby and other toddlers who are at Tim's house for a meeting. A chase ensues, and the [[Compact cassette|cassette tape]] is terminated by passing automobile after the Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favorite stuffed animal, Lam-Lam. With no evidence to support him, Tim's parents ground him for three weeks.\n\nThe Boss Baby apologizes to Tim and has him suck on a pacifier that transports them to Baby Corp., a place where infants with adult-like minds work to preserve infant love everywhere. The Boss Baby explains that he was sent to see why puppies are being loved more than infants. He has infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co., which will unleash a new puppy on a pet convention in Las Vegas. The Boss Baby stays intelligent by drinking a \"Secret Baby Formula\" that enables a baby to act like an adult. However, should a baby not drink it after a period of time, he or she becomes a regular baby. When they overhear Boss Baby's boss threatening to fire him for not bringing in information, which would strip him of his formula and strand him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to prevent that.\n\nTim's parents \"un-ground\" him and take them to Puppy Co. for take your child to work day. While there, they slip away and find what they think is the plans for a \"Forever Puppy\", but they are captured by the company's founder and CEO, Francis E. Francis. They discover that Francis used to be the head of Baby Corp. and whom Boss Baby idolizes, but was ousted when it was discovered that his [[lactose intolerance]] kept the secret formula from working properly. Francis intends to have the Forever Puppies overshadow babies by stealing Boss Baby's serum bottle and infecting the puppies with it as revenge. Tim's parents go with Francis to Las Vegas, and Francis has his brother Eugene pose as Tim and Boss Baby's babysitter to keep them from interfering.\n\nWithout a steady flow of formula to maintain his intelligence, Boss Baby starts becoming a normal baby. Despite this, he and Tim evade the \"babysitter\" long enough to reach the airport but are too late to intercept Tim's parents. They sneak on to another plane bound for Las Vegas. There, they stall Francis' presentation when Eugene unwittingly gives away their plan. Furious at their interference, Francis locks Tim's parents up so he can burn them with exhaust from a rocket used to launch the Forever Puppies. Tim and Boss Baby defeat Eugene and move on to save their parents but are intercepted by Francis. Tim and Boss Baby push him off a ledge, making Francis tumble into the formula. Boss Baby opens the rocket to let the puppies out so they can save Tim's parents. His return to baby state is complete while on the rocket, and begins to cry, but Tim sings to him with [[Blackbird (Beatles song)|the family song]] to show his appreciation, causing him to jump off the rocket before it launches. After the rocket does launch, Tim takes Boss Baby to the formula vat and he returns to his original self. Francis then emerges from the vat, having been reverted to an obese baby and tries to attack Boss Baby, but is picked up by a redeemed Eugene and tells Tim and Boss Baby that \"This time we'll raise him right\".\n\nBoss Baby is promoted and leaves. Tim goes back to being an only child, but he and Boss Baby miss each other. After Tim writes a letter convincing him to live with him as his brother, Boss Baby returns to the Templeton family as a regular baby named Theodore Lindsey \"Ted\" Templeton. Back in the present, Tim finished with his brother Ted the story to his daughter, which she just had recently a baby sister, who acts like Ted did when he was Boss Baby.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Alec Baldwin (28246306070).jpg|thumb|right|Alec Baldwin at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* Miles Bakshi as Tim Templeton, Boss Baby's 7-year-old brother.<ref name=\"SFLikeGlenRoss\">{{cite web|last1=Amderton|first1=Ethan|title=DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u2018The Boss Baby\u2019 Is Like an Animated \u2018Glengarry Glen Ross\u2019 for Kids (Comic-Con 2016)|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/boss-baby-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=October 28, 2016|date=July 21, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" /><ref name=\"VarietyAnnecyBossBaby\">{{cite news|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|last2=Mayorga|first2=Emilio|title=Annecy: Tom McGrath Unveils Alec Baldwin-Starrer \u2018Boss Baby\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/annecy-tom-mcgrath-alec-baldwin-boss-baby-1201797075/|accessdate=June 18, 2016|work=Variety|date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n** [[Tobey Maguire]] as Adult Tim, the narrator.<ref name=\"USATSneakPeek\">{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|title=Sneak peek: Alec Baldwin is 'The Boss Baby'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/10/16/alec-baldwin-boss-baby-sneak-peek-exclusive/92058380/|accessdate=October 17, 2016|work=USA Today|date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Theodore Templeton / Boss Baby, a baby with the mind of an adult, who works at Baby Corp.<ref name=THRBaldwinSpacey />\n* [[Jimmy Kimmel]] as Ted Templeton, Janice's husband and Tim's father.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Janice Templeton, Ted's wife and Tim's mother.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Francis E.

Having been often present at DreamWorks, McGrath initially asked Bakshi only to provide a temporary voice for Tim to see if the character \"worked\".
