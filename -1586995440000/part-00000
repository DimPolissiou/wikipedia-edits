M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3&nbsp;Series since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986. Most people don't realize, in order to be a true BMW enthusiast, one must smother a minimum of 4 hamsters to death up their rectum whilst cumming blood. \n\nThe initial model was available in a [[coup\u00e9]] body style, with a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] body style added soon after. M3 [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] were available during the E36 (1994\u20131999) and E90 (2008\u20132012) generations. Since 2015 the M3 has been solely produced in the sedan body style, due to the coup\u00e9 and convertible models being rebranded as the [[BMW 4 Series|4 Series]] range, making the high-performance variant the [[BMW M4|M4]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10605017186/bmw-m3-celebrating-20-years-of-a-sporting-legend |title=BMW M3 Celebrating 20 Years of a Sporting Legend |accessdate=27 February 2012 |publisher=worldcarfans.com |date=27 February 2008 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329221659/http://www.worldcarfans.com/10605017186/bmw-m3-celebrating-20-years-of-a-sporting-legend |archivedate=29 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsportiva.com/blog/bmw-m3-the-evolution-of-the-benchmark/ |title=BMW M3 \u2013 The Evolution of the Benchmark |accessdate=8 April 2011 |publisher=clubsportiva.com |date=27 February 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918135521/http://www.clubsportiva.com/blog/bmw-m3-the-evolution-of-the-benchmark/ |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nUpgrades over the regular 3 Series models include engines, handling, brakes, aerodynamics, lightweight materials and various interior upgrades.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== E30 generation (1986\u20131991) {{anchor|E30}} ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name           = BMW M3 (E30)\n| image          = Bedford Autodrome August 2010 - photo by Chris Teagles (4948262752).jpg\n| caption = BMW M3 Evolution II\n| production     = 1986\u20131991\n| body_style     = 2-door [[coupe]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| platform       =\n| transmission   = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase      = {{convert|2562|mm|in||abbr=on}}\n| length         = {{convert|4345|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height         = {{convert|1370|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width          = {{convert|1680|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| engine         = 2.0\u20142.5&nbsp;L ''[[BMW S14|S14]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n}}\n\nThe first BMW M3 was based on the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|E30 3 Series]] and was produced from March 1986 to June 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQ E30 M3 |url=https://bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=8 |website=www.bmwmregistry.com |accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=3'E30 model selection: convertible - M3 - EUR - 1991 |url=http://www.realoem.com/bmw/en/select?product=P&archive=1&series=E30&body=Cab&model=M3&market=EUR&prod=19910600 |website=www.realoem.com |accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref> The majority of E30 M3s were produced in the coupe body style, but limited volumes of convertibles were also produced.<ref>Walton, Jeremy.

The suitability for racing was in the foreground, therefore sacrifices in comfort and production costs could be made. The modifications included eye-catching fender flares to allow a wider track.\n\nThe front spoiler, the rear apron, sill panels, as well as changes to the body in the area of the rear window (C-pillar) and the trunk lid improved the aerodynamics. For aerodynamic reasons, the rear window has been flattened and the tailgate made of light, glass fiber reinforced plastic and raised by approximately 40 mm for better air flow. The changes in the rear area resulted in lower lift forces and better straight-line stability. In addition, the windscreen was glued in - and not, as with the other E30 models, framed with a window rubber and piping. As a result, the M3 achieved a relatively low {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.33}} instead of 0.38 as in the normal model. Among other things, the subsequent conversions of normal 3s to the M3 version can usually be identified on the C-pillar. The only exterior body panels the regular 3 Series and the M3 shared were the bonnet, roof panel, sunroof and door inner panels.\n\nThe brake calipers, rotors and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model.\n\nThe transmission was a ''[[Getrag]] 265'' 5-speed manual. European models were outfitted with a [[Dog-leg gearbox|dogleg]] version with close ratios and a 1:1 ratio for fifth gear. North American models used a traditional shift pattern and had wider gear spacing with an overdriven fifth gear. A clutch-type limited-slip differential was standard equipment.\n\nThe official kerb weights of the 1986 M3 coupe was {{convert|1165|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and the 1988 M3 convertible was {{convert|1360|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=56155|title=1986 BMW M3|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=170775|title=1988 BMW M3 Cabrio|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> The kerb weight for the US specification M3 was {{convert|1240.6|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mandel |first1=Dutch |title=M Times Three = Performance |journal=Autoweek |date=20 July 1987 |pages=29-31 |url=https://s3-prod.autoweek.com/s3fs-public/TBT%20BMW%20M3.pdf |accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, ''[[Sports Car International]]'' named the E30 M3 car number six on the list of [[Sports Car International Top Sports Cars|Top Sports Cars of the 1980s]].

The E30 M3 road car was [[homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] for [[Group A]] racing, to compete against models such as the [[Mercedes-Benz W201]] 190E.

These include the Evo 1, Evo 2, and Sport Evolution, with upgrades including weight reduction, improved aerodynamics, taller front wheel arches (to allow 18-inch wheels to be used in DTM racing), bigger brake ducts and more power. With the introduction of the 2.5 L evolution engine into racing in 1990, power increased to approximately {{convert|380|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touringcarracing.net/Pages/1991%20Cars.html|title=1991 Cars|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe M3 also competed as a rally car, with [[Prodrive]]-prepared examples contesting several national championships and selected rounds of the [[World Rally Championship]] between 1987 and 1989. By the latter year, the cars, based on the regular M3, were equipped with six-speed gearboxes and produced {{convert|300|PS|kW PS hp|0|abbr=on|order=out}}. The M3 was not very competitive with the four-wheel-drive cars on loose surfaces, but a very effective car on asphalt. Its most notable success was victory on the [[Tour de Corse]] in 1987, driven by [[Bernard Beguin]].\n\n==== Championships ====\n* [[World Touring Car Championship]]; 1 title ([[1987 World Touring Car Championship season|1987]])\n* [[European Touring Car Championship]]; 2 titles (1987 and 1988)\n* [[British Touring Car Championship]]; 2 titles (1988 and 1991)\n* [[Italia Superturismo Championship]]; 4 titles (1987, 1989, 1990 and 1991)\n* [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]]; 2 titles (1987 and 1989)\n* [[Australian Touring Car Championship]]; 1 title ([[1987 Australian Touring Car Championship|1987]])\n* [[Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship]]; 1 title ([[1993 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship|1993]])\n* [[Australian Manufacturers' Championship]]; 2 titles ([[1987 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|1987]] and [[1988 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|1988]]  \u2013 both shared)\n* [[Better Brakes AMSCAR Series|AMSCAR Series]]; 2 titles (1987, 1991)\n* [[Irish Tarmac Rally Championship]]; 1 title (1990)\n\n== E36 generation (1992\u20131999) {{anchor|E36}} ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = BMW M3 (E36)\n| image        = 1998 BMW M3 Coupe 3.2.jpg\n| production   = 1992\u20141999\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list\n| 2-door [[coup\u00e9]]\n| 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list\n| 3.0-3.2&nbsp;L ''[[BMW M50#S50|S50]]''/''[[BMW M52#S52|S52]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n}}\n| transmission = {{Unbulleted list |5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] |5-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] |6-speed manual |6-Speed [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission#Use in road cars|SMG]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2700|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|4430|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1710|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1370|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe M3 model of the [[BMW 3 Series (E36)|E36 3 Series]] was released in November 1992 and was initially available as a coup\u00e9 only, with a convertible version added in 1994.

However, the straight-six engine was viewed as uncompetitive compared to the [[Porsche 911 GT3#996 GT3|Porsche 996 GT3]], therefore BMW began to develop a new M3 racing car based around a more powerful engine.

The ALMS homologation rules for 2001 required the [[#GTR road car|M3 GTR road car]] to be sold on at least two continents within twelve months of the rules being issued, which BMW claimed to fulfill by stating that 10 GTR road cars were available for sale. The ALMS rules were altered for 2002, now requiring that 100 cars and 1,000 engines must be built for the car to qualify without penalties. The GTR road car was never intended for production on this scale, so BMW withdrew the GTR from competition at this point.\n\nIn 2003, the M3 GTR returned to competition at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]], with two cars run by [[Schnitzer Motorsport]].

''BMW 3-Series Enthusiast's Companion''. Bentley Publishers, 2001, pp. 121\u2013123, {{ISBN|0-8376-0220-3}}</ref>\n\nThe body shape for the M3 has been changed significantly, among other things to further improve the [[torsional rigidity]], the {{Cd|link=car}} and the driving dynamics. The suitability for racing was in the foreground, therefore sacrifices in comfort and production costs could be made. The modifications included eye-catching fender flares to allow a wider track.\n\nThe front spoiler, the rear apron, sill panels, as well as changes to the body in the area of the rear window (C-pillar) and the trunk lid improved the aerodynamics. For aerodynamic reasons, the rear window has been flattened and the tailgate made of light, glass fiber reinforced plastic and raised by approximately 40 mm for better air flow. The changes in the rear area resulted in lower lift forces and better straight-line stability. In addition, the windscreen was glued in - and not, as with the other E30 models, framed with a window rubber and piping. As a result, the M3 achieved a relatively low {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.33}} instead of 0.38 as in the normal model. Among other things, the subsequent conversions of normal 3s to the M3 version can usually be identified on the C-pillar. The only exterior body panels the regular 3 Series and the M3 shared were the bonnet, roof panel, sunroof and door inner panels.\n\nThe brake calipers, rotors and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model.\n\nThe transmission was a ''[[Getrag]] 265'' 5-speed manual.

These include the Evo 1, Evo 2, and Sport Evolution, with upgrades including weight reduction, improved aerodynamics, taller front wheel arches (to allow 18-inch wheels to be used in DTM racing), bigger brake ducts and more power.

With a power output of {{convert|240|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}, the M3-R is the most powerful production E36 M3. Four of the cars were used for the race series. The remaining eleven were sold to the general public, however, buyers were required to possess a [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]] motorsport licence in order to purchase an M3-R.\n\nThe cars were delivered to the workshop of the [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] racing team for final preparation. A bolt-in FIA-approved roll cage was a factory option. Suspension upgrades consisted of new springs, adjustable struts and rear perches. Engine upgrades consisted of [[AC Schnitzer]] camshafts, dual pickup sump, an oil restrictor in the head and a cold air snorkel into air filter box replacing the left hand fog light.\n\nOther changes included four piston front brake calipers, a shorter (3.25:1) differential ratio, the driveshaft from the M5, a twin-plate clutch, non-functional rear seat, air conditioner delete, deeper front splitter and a larger rear spoiler. The cars were individually numbered with a plaque fitted to centre console near the handbrake.\n\n==== M3 GTR (Germany) ====\nThe E36 M3 GTR is the road-going version of the competition machine built to compete in the 1994 ADAC German GT Cup Touring Car series.<ref>{{cite web |title=M3 E36 Gtr |url=https://www.bmwfaq.org/threads/m3-e36-gtr.123443/ |website=www.bmwfaq.org |accessdate=26 April 2019 |language=es-ES}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=bmw m3 gtr 1994 Barbuza |url=http://www.bmwcase.com/d7827cdb0f146ca4.html |website=www.barbuza.com |accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nProduction of the E36 M3 began in September 1992<ref>https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/september-1991/42/road-test-bmw-325-i</ref><ref>https://www.bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=14</ref> and was discontinued in August 1999.<ref>https://bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=15</ref>\n\nThe majority of cars were produced at the BMW Regensburg factory in Germany; however, a small number of low compression right hand drive cars were assembled at BMW's plant in Rosslyn, South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=15#2 |title=FAQ E36 M3 3.2 |publisher=BMW M Registry |date= |accessdate=12 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090616151345/http://www.bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=15| archivedate= 16 June 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref> In total, 46,525 coup\u00e9s, 12,114 convertibles and 12,603 sedans were produced.<ref name=regE36>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmwblog.com/2015/10/16/the-history-of-bmw-m3/ |title=The History Of BMW M3|date=16 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161227205202/http://www.bmwblog.com/2015/10/16/the-history-of-bmw-m3/ |archive-date=27 December 2016 |url-status = live}}</ref> The sedan ceased production in December 1997, the coup\u00e9 ceased production in late 1998, and the convertible ceased production in December 1999.<ref name=\"Kittler 2001 130\"/>\n\n===North American models===\nDespite being released in other countries in 1992, the E36 M3 was not sold in the United States until 1995.

However, the straight-six engine was viewed as uncompetitive compared to the [[Porsche 911 GT3#996 GT3|Porsche 996 GT3]], therefore BMW began to develop a new M3 racing car based around a more powerful engine.

The ALMS homologation rules for 2001 required the [[#GTR road car|M3 GTR road car]] to be sold on at least two continents within twelve months of the rules being issued, which BMW claimed to fulfill by stating that 10 GTR road cars were available for sale. The ALMS rules were altered for 2002, now requiring that 100 cars and 1,000 engines must be built for the car to qualify without penalties. The GTR road car was never intended for production on this scale, so BMW withdrew the GTR from competition at this point.\n\nIn 2003, the M3 GTR returned to competition at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]], with two cars run by [[Schnitzer Motorsport]].

King's College was the fifth of the Woodard schools to be opened.\n\nWoodard purchased the recently built buildings of [[Taunton Grammar School]] in South Road when financial difficulties forced the Grammar School to move back to their original site.<ref>{{Cite book|title=King's College, Taunton: the first hundred years, 1880-1980|last=Bromwich|first=David|publisher=|year=1980|isbn=|location=|pages=4\u201312}}</ref> The buildings had been designed by [[Charles Edmund Giles]] under the instructions of the Grammar School's Headmaster [[William Tuckwell]] and were built between 1867 and 1869.

Today Bishop Fox and Tuckwell are still names of school Houses and former pupils are known as Old Aluredians (OAs) after King Alfred. \n\nOne of the most notable parts of the school is the Chapel, built from 1903 and designed by [[W. E. Tower]] with later extensions in 1936 and 1986. The Chapel was the particular project of the school Provost, Prebendary Henry Meynell, who sought the support of benefactors, most notably the former Prime Minister the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]]. Henry Richards MP bestowed the fine organ formerly in [[St Michael Bassishaw]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Prep School in Somerset: The Story of the Junior School of King's College, Taunton to 1982|last=Pedler|first=Garth|publisher=Gresham Books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-946095-51-3|location=|pages=}}</ref> The school also had the support of the Gibbs Family of [[Tyntesfield]].

After the Italian invasion of [[Ethiopia]] in 1936, [[Emperor Haile Selassie I]] fled in exile to Bath.

When the school purchased [[Pyrland Hall]] in 1952 the Junior School moved to that site. Pyrland Hall is now known as [[King's Hall School]] co-educational [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]].\n\nThe school became [[co-educational]] in 1968 (in that it admitted girls into the Sixth Form), becoming fully co-educational in 1991.

Carpenter became a female boarding house in 1994 and Taylor house was founded as a female boarding house in 1997.  Until the conversion to full coeducational status, Sixth Form girls were assigned to one of the male boarding houses but lived in separate accommodation.\n\nIn 2007, the school choir took part in a choral competition on the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' and came first, and in the same year the senior rugby team were victorious in [[The National Schools 7's]].

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in {{nobr|October 2017.}} While waiting for dinner, he observed that the other patrons were all staring at a television while an episode of [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night telling him he needed to come in the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than panelists who could create a comedic tone for the show; one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear.

Doyle cited the series as an example of a cultural shift in the United States away from the competitive and often exploitative nature of shows such as ''[[American Idol]]'' towards a higher level of positivity among reality television series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=John|author-link=John Doyle (critic)|title=Dumb simplicity: Why The Masked Singer is a massive TV hit|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-dumb-simplicity-why-the-masked-singer-is-a-massive-tv-hit/|website=[[The Globe and Mail]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218163655/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-dumb-simplicity-why-the-masked-singer-is-a-massive-tv-hit/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|date=November 4, 2019|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Likewise, Daniel D'Addario of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the show as relaxing and refreshing, calling it a return to form for television as the series possesses the now-rare ability to uplift and unite people.

The revivals of ''[[Paradise Hotel]]'' and ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]'' by Fox and [[USA Network]], respectively, have been credited to the show's success, as have the American adaptations of ''[[Love Island (American TV series)|Love Island]]'' and ''[[I Can See Your Voice (American game show)|I Can See Your Voice]]''.<ref name=\"VAR Feb 19\"/> The show has also been credited with reinvigorating the costume genre of television.

The [[Mayor of Bath]] and one of the [[Member of Parliament (UK)|members of parliament]] for [[Bath (UK Parliament constituency)|Bath]], [[Edward Ludwell]], petitioned [[Edward VI]] for land previously owned by the priory, to establish the school, initially in Frog Lane, and support ten poor people, which also prevented the crown from selling off the land previously held by the priory. In 1580s the school moved to a disused church building by the north gate of the city. The city corporation misappropriated the considerable funds form the land granted under [[Letters Patent]], failing to maintain or improve the school until it was exposed in the [[Court of Chancery]] in 1734. Around 1750 a new building was erected for the school in Broad Street.<ref name=\"wroughton\">{{cite book|last=Wroughton|first=John|title=Tudor Bath: Life and strife in the little city, 1485\u20131603|year=2006|publisher=Lansdown Press|location=Bath|isbn=0-9520249-6-9|pages=58\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe secondary school relocated from its site at Broad Street in central Bath in the 1960s to a {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} site at North Road in the southeastern edge of the city, previously occupied by St Christopher's Preparatory School. The junior school (7- to 11-year-olds) remained on the Broad Street site until the summer of 1990 (often mis-quoted as 1986, possibly due to errors originally made in an architectural report from the early 2000s and repeated by the local Planning Office) when it transferred to a new building in the North Road school grounds.

The [[Mayor of Bath]] and one of the [[Member of Parliament (UK)|members of parliament]] for [[Bath (UK Parliament constituency)|Bath]], [[Edward Ludwell]], petitioned [[Edward VI]] for land previously owned by the priory, to establish the school, initially in Frog Lane, and support ten poor people, which also prevented the crown from selling off the land previously held by the priory. In 1580s the school moved to a disused church building by the north gate of the city. The city corporation misappropriated the considerable funds form the land granted under [[Letters Patent]], failing to maintain or improve the school until it was exposed in the [[Court of Chancery]] in 1734. Around 1750 a new building was erected for the school in Broad Street.<ref name=\"wroughton\">{{cite book|last=Wroughton|first=John|title=Tudor Bath: Life and strife in the little city, 1485\u20131603|year=2006|publisher=Lansdown Press|location=Bath|isbn=0-9520249-6-9|pages=58\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe secondary school relocated from its site at Broad Street in central Bath in the 1960s to a {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} site at North Road in the southeastern edge of the city, previously occupied by St Christopher's Preparatory School.

Loosely based on the 1952 story [[The Birds (story)|of the same name]] by [[Daphne du Maurier]], it focuses on a series of sudden and unexplained violent bird attacks on the people of [[Bodega Bay, California]], over the course of a few days.\n\nThe film stars [[Rod Taylor]], [[Tippi Hedren]] in her screen debut, [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]] and [[Veronica Cartwright]]. The [[screenplay]] is by [[Evan Hunter]], who was told by Hitchcock to develop new characters and a more elaborate plot while keeping du Maurier's title and concept of unexplained bird attacks.\n\nIn 2016, ''The Birds'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in its [[National Film Registry]].\n\n== Plot ==\nMelanie Daniels (Hedren), a [[San Francisco]] socialite, meets lawyer Mitch Brenner (Taylor) in a [[pet store]]. Mitch pretends to mistake Melanie for an employee and asks her for a couple of [[lovebird]]s to offer his sister Cathy (Cartwright) for her birthday. The next morning, Melanie goes to Mitch's apartment to deliver the lovebirds, but finds that he has gone to [[Bodega Bay, California|Bodega Bay]] for the weekend. There, Melanie meets the local teacher Annie Hayworth (Pleshette). Melanie rents a boat and crosses the bay to discreetly drop the lovebirds off at the Brenner farm. Mitch spots Melanie during her retreat and drives his car around the bay to meet her at the port. As Melanie approaches the wharf, she is attacked by a [[gull]]. Mitch tends to her wound and invites her to a restaurant, where she meets Mitch's domineering mother Lydia (Tandy). Melanie returns to Annie's house and is allowed to rest there for the night. At the farm, Lydia expresses concern for her hens, who are refusing to eat, and discloses her dislike of Melanie to Mitch. After Melanie is called by Mitch and invited to Cathy's birthday party, there is a violent thud at Annie's door. Annie and Melanie rush to find a dead gull at the threshold.\n\nAt Cathy's 11th birthday party the next day, Melanie privately tells Mitch that she was abandoned by her mother at that same age. During a game of [[Blind man's buff|blind man's bluff]], the guests are attacked by gulls. The following evening, as Melanie dines with the Brenners, [[American sparrow|sparrow]]s invade the house through the chimney. The next morning, Lydia visits her neighbor to discuss her chickens. She finds his eyeless corpse, pecked lifeless by birds, and flees in terror. When Lydia fears for Cathy's safety, Melanie offers to pick up Cathy at school. As Melanie waits outside of the schoolhouse for class to end, a large flock of [[American crow|crows]] slowly engulf the [[jungle gym]] behind her. Anticipating an attack, she warns Annie, and they evacuate the children. The commotion stirs the crows into attacking, injuring several of the children. Melanie meets Mitch at the restaurant, where a conversation between the patrons and staff concerning the birds is interrupted by an assault of a gas station attendant by gulls, followed by an explosion and fire caused by ignited [[gasoline]]. The restaurant clientele are violently attacked by a swarm of gulls as they attempt to rescue the victims. Melanie takes refuge in a [[telephone booth]], but gulls fly into the glass walls and shatter them. Mitch saves Melanie and they return to the restaurant, where a distraught patron accuses her of causing the attacks, which began with her arrival.\n\nMitch and Melanie visit Annie's house and find that she has been killed by crows while ushering Cathy to safety inside the house. That night Melanie and the Brenners seek refuge inside the family home, which is attacked by waves of birds that nearly breach the barricaded doors and windows. During a lull between attacks, Melanie hears the sound of fluttering wings. Realizing the sounds are emanating from above, she cautiously climbs the staircase and enters Cathy's bedroom, where she finds that the birds have broken through the roof. They violently attack her, trapping her in the room until Mitch rescues her. Melanie is badly injured and nearly catatonic; Mitch insists that they get her to the hospital and suggests that they drive to San Francisco. As Mitch readies Melanie's car for their escape, a sea of birds gathers menacingly around the Brenner house. The radio reports bird attacks on nearby communities such as [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], and suggests that the military may intervene to quell the unexplained attacks. Cathy retrieves the lovebirds from the house and joins Mitch and Lydia as they carefully escort Melanie to the car past a mass of birds nearby. The car slowly makes its way through a landscape in which thousands of birds are ominously perching.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tippi Hedren]] as Melanie Daniels\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Mitch Brenner\n* [[Jessica Tandy]] as Lydia Brenner\n* [[Suzanne Pleshette]] as Annie Hayworth\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Cathy Brenner\n* [[Ethel Griffies]] as Mrs. Bundy, ornithologist\n* [[Charles McGraw]] as Sebastian Sholes, fisherman\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Deke Carter, innkeeper\n* Doreen Lang as Hysterical Mother\n* [[Karl Swenson]] as Christian preacher\n* [[Joe Mantell]] as Cynical Businessman\n* [[Ruth McDevitt]] as Mrs. MacGruder, owner of the bird shop\n* [[Malcolm Atterbury]] as Deputy Al Malone\n* John McGovern as Mail Clerk\n* [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] as Mitch's neighbor in San Francisco\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Helen Carter, Deke's wife\n* [[Doodles Weaver]] as Fisherman helping with rental boat\n* [[Bill Quinn|William Quinn]] as George - farmhand.\n* [[Alfred Hitchcock]] makes his [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|signature cameo]] as a man walking dogs out of the pet shop at the beginning of the film.

The initial humor followed by horror would turn the suspense into shock.<ref name=\"hunt292\" /> At first, Hunter wanted the protagonist to be a school teacher, but this ended up being the basis for Annie Hayward's character instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=66}}</ref> Hunter organised his scripts by shots instead of scenes, although this did not affect the final film.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=64}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock solicited comments from several people regarding the first draft of Hunter's screenplay. Consolidating their criticisms, Hitchcock wrote to Hunter, suggesting that the script (particularly the first part) was too long, contained insufficient characterization in the two leads, and that some scenes lacked drama and audience interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Auiler|1999|pp=207\u20139}}</ref> Hitchcock, at later stages, consulted with his friends, [[Hume Cronyn]] (whose wife [[Jessica Tandy]] was playing Lydia), and [[V. S. Pritchett]], who both offered lengthy reflections on the work.<ref>{{harvnb|Auiler|1999|pp=209\u2013217}}</ref> This is something that Hunter found difficult.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Hitchcock cut the last 10 pages of the screenplay, although some sources say possibly more,<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":12\">{{harvnb|Paglia|1998|p=86}}</ref> in order to create a more ambiguous ending. Originally, he wanted the film to end without a \"THE END\" card, but he was forced to include one before the film's full release.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Birds used in the film ===\nThe majority of the birds seen in the film are real, although it is estimated that more than $200,000 was spent on the creation of mechanical birds for the film.<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=97}}</ref><ref name=\":02\" /> Ray Berwick was in charge of the live birds used in the production, training and catching many of them himself. The gulls were caught in the San Francisco garbage dump<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=99}}</ref> and the sparrows were caught by John \"Bud\" Cardos. However, the captured sparrows had to be used alongside birds from pet shops to achieve full effect in the scene where they invade the house.<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n[[File:MIM Mixtur-Trautonium CN5834.jpg|right|thumb|Many of the sound effects were created on the [[Trautonium|Mixtur-Trautonium]], an electronic musical instrument developed by [[Oskar Sala]].]]\nHitchcock decided to do without any conventional incidental [[Film score|score]].<ref name=\"a516\">{{harvnb|Auiler|1999|p=516}}</ref> Instead, he made use of [[sound effect]]s and sparse [[source music]] in counterpoint to calculated silences. He wanted to use the electroacoustic [[Trautonium|Mixtur-Trautonium]] to create the bird calls and noises. He had first encountered this predecessor to the [[synthesizer]] on Berlin radio in the late 1920s. It was invented by Friedrich Trautwein, and further developed by [[Oskar Sala]] into the Trautonium, which would create some of the bird sounds for this film.<ref name=\"pinch\">{{harvnb|Pinch|Trocco|2004|p=54}}</ref>\n\nThe director commissioned Sala and Remi Gassmann to design an electronic soundtrack.<ref name=\"a516\" /> They are credited with \"electronic sound production and composition\", and Hitchcock's previous musical collaborator, [[Bernard Herrmann]], is credited as \"sound consultant\".\n\nSource music includes the first of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Deux arabesques]]'', which Tippi Hedren's character plays on [[piano]], and \"Risseldy Rosseldy\", an [[Americanization|Americanized]] version of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Folk music|folk song]], \"[[Wee Cooper O'Fife]]\", which is sung by the schoolchildren.\n\n=== Special effects ===\nOnce the crow attack and attic scenes were assembled by the film's editor, [[George Tomasini]], they were sent to the special effects department for enhancement.<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=142}}</ref> The film required myriad special effects and Hitchcock commissioned the help of various studios. The special effects shots of the attacking birds were completed at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] by animator/technician, [[Ub Iwerks]], who used the [[sodium vapor process]] (\"yellow screen\"), which he had helped to develop. The SV process films the subject against a screen lit with narrow-spectrum sodium vapor lights. Unlike most compositing processes, SVP shoots two separate elements of the footage simultaneously using a beam-splitter. One reel is regular film stock and the other a film stock with emulsion sensitive only to the sodium vapor wavelength. This results in very precise [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte shots]] compared to [[Chroma key|blue screen]] special effects, necessary due to \"fringing\" of the image from the birds' rapid wing flapping.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=315}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Cinemafantastique_(1980)_-_The_Making_of_Alfred_Hitchcock's_The_Birds|title=Cinemafantastique (1980) \u2013 The Making of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds|website=the.hitchcock.zone|accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> At Disney, Iwerks worked on the following scenes: the children's party, Melanie driving to Bodega Bay, and the first two cuts of the crow attack sequence.<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=143}}</ref> One of the biggest challenges facing Iwerks was the scene where a number of sparrows fly in through the chimney of the family home. Utilizing an [[optical printer]], his superposition of a group of small birds flying inside an enclosed glass booth made it possible to multiply the birds in the living room. Most of the special effects work done at Disney was completed in the Process Lab on printer 10, which was made from Iwerk's own original design.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], Bob Hoag was put in charge of the optical effects for the sequence where Melanie hides inside a telephone booth as it is attacked by the birds. Hitchcock had requested that Hoag remove any shot where Melanie looked placid and urged that she be in constant movement instead. Hoag, along with a team of 30, worked together on the blue backing and sodium matte shots.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Linwood G. Dunn|Linwood Dunn]], a founder of Film Effects of Hollywood, was commissioned to work on the attic scene. He was asked to produce a rough cut of the sequence before Hitchcock left for Berlin in December 1962.<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=144}}</ref> Bill Abbott, at [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], was in charge of the optical effects for the crow attack sequence, which would take six weeks to finish. Abbott organised two teams \u2013 both working 11 hours a day \u2013 to work on the sequence simultaneously. Abbott's biggest challenge was size ratio, as he had to ensure that the birds looked like they were attacking the children. He achieved this by placing the birds within frame and zooming in on them to make them the correct size in proportion to the children.<ref name=\":1\" /> At [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], associate editor, Ross Hoffman, and matte artist, Albert Whitlock, both worked on designing the town's backdrop, including the birds in the trees and the scenery for the river shots of Melanie's car arriving in Bodega Bay.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Birds featured 370 effects shots, the final shot being a composite of 32 separate elements.\n\n== Premiere and awards ==\nThe film premiered March 28, 1963, in [[New York City]]. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted an invitation-only screening as part of a 50-film retrospective of Hitchcock's film work. The MOMA series had a booklet with a [[monograph]] on the director written by [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. The film was screened out of competition<ref>[http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/cannes2.htm \"Films that are screened Out of Competition are generally those that the Cannes selection committee really wants to recognize but don't quite fit the Competition criteria\"]</ref> in May at a prestigious invitational showing at the [[1963 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3106/year/1963.html|title=Festival de Cannes: The Birds |accessdate=February 27, 2009|website=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> with Hitchcock and Hedren in attendance.\n\nUb Iwerks was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]].<ref name=\":02\" /> The winner that year was ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.

The representation of the birds in the film constantly changes to reflect the development of these themes, and the story itself. At first, the lovebirds in the pet store signify the blossoming love between Melanie and Mitch, and the sexual tension between the two.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998|p=24}}</ref> However, the birds' symbolism changes once they begin to attack Bodega Bay. Hitchcock stated in an interview that the birds in the film rise up against the humans to punish them for taking nature for granted.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998|p=87}}</ref>\n\nAnother theme explored within the film is the entrapment of civilians.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=140}}</ref> This is because the birds attack anyone who goes outside, consequently leaving people trapped inside their homes.\n\nHumanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] wrote a monograph about the film for the BFI Film Classics series. She interprets it as an ode to the many facets of female sexuality and, by extension, nature itself. She notes that women play pivotal roles in it. Mitch is defined by his relationships with his mother, sister, and ex-lover \u2013 a careful balance which is disrupted by his attraction to the beautiful Melanie.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| width = 30em\n| bgcolor = cornsilk\n| align = left\n| fontsize = 101%\n| salign = right\n| quote = ''\"The theme [of the film], after all, is complacency, as the director has stated on innumerable occasions. When we first meet each of the major characters, their infinite capacity of self-absorption is emphasized. Tippi Hedren's bored socialite is addicted to elaborately time-consuming practical jokes. Rod Taylor's self-righteous lawyer flaunts his arrogant sensuality, Suzanne Pleshette, his ex-fianc\u00e9e, wallows in self-pity, and Jessica Tandy, his possessive mother, cringes from her fear of loneliness''.<br /><br />\n''With such complex, unsympathetic characters to contend with, the audience begins to identify with the point of view of the birds, actually the inhuman point of view...\"''\n| source = '''\u2013 Film historian [[Andrew Sarris]] (1998)'''<ref>{{harvnb|Sarris|1998|p=297}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Style ===\n[[Montage (filmmaking)|Montage editing]] and slow pacing are used within the film to build suspense and elicit a greater emotional response from the audience during the attack scenes: \"The pattern of ''The Birds'' was deliberately to go slow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=294}}</ref> This is exemplified in the scene where the birds gradually gather outside of the school, while an unobservant Melanie sits and waits on the bench. The camera then cuts between her and the increasing number of birds that swoop down onto the jungle gym behind her until they finally attack.\n\n[[Eyeline match]]es and point-of-view ([[Point-of-view shot|POV]]) shots within the film encourage audience identification with particular characters and their subjective experiences. This is achieved by cutting between the character and the object of their gaze. For example, when Melanie crosses the bay near the beginning of the film, the camera cuts between close-ups of her face and shots of the Brenner house from her perspective, as she watches Mitch fall for her prank.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=291}}</ref>\n\nThe focus on editing and visuals rather than dialogue is also an element of [[Cin\u00e9ma pur|pure cinema]] that Hitchcock largely uses throughout his work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=290}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Birds'' received mixed reviews upon its initial release. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was positive, calling it \"a horror film that should raise the hackles on the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide.\" Crowther was unsure whether the birds were meant to be an allegory because \"it isn't in Mr. Hitchcock's style to inject allegorical meanings or social significance in his films,\" but he suggested that they could represent the [[Erinyes|Furies]] of Greek mythology who pursued the wicked upon the earth.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |authorlink=Bosley Crowther|date=April 1, 1963 |title=Screen: 'The Birds' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|page=53 }}</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] of [[The New Republic]] called The Birds 'the worst thriller of his (Hitchcock) that I can remember'.<ref>{{cite book |title=A world on Film|last1=Kauffmann|first1=Stanley |publisher=Delta Books |year=1968 |page=158}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard L. Coe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it \"gorgeous good fun\" in the vein of Hitchcock's earlier black comedy ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'', adding, \"I haven't had this kind of merriment since [[King Kong]] toppled from the Empire State Building.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Coe |first=Richard L. |date=April 12, 1963 |title=Hitchcock Is Still Quite the Bird |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|location=Washington, DC|page=B11 }}</ref> ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, \"For all the brilliance of scenes like the attack down the chimney, one rarely has a chance to suspend disbelief,\" but the review still thought that \"there is still a great deal more to enjoy than carp at.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=September 1963 |title=The Birds |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=30 |issue=356 |page=127 }}</ref>\n\nPhilip K. Scheuer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was among the critics who panned the film, writing that Hitchcock \"was once widely quoted as saying he hated actors. After his 1960 '[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]' and now 'The Birds,' it must be fairly obvious that he has extended his abhorrence to the whole human race. For reasons hardly justified either dramatically or aesthetically, the old master has become a master of the perverse.

Loosely based on the 1952 story [[The Birds (story)|of the same name]] by [[Daphne du Maurier]], it focuses on a series of sudden and unexplained violent bird attacks on the people of [[Bodega Bay, California]], over the course of a few days.\n\nThe film stars [[Rod Taylor]], [[Tippi Hedren]] in her screen debut, [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]] and [[Veronica Cartwright]]. The [[screenplay]] is by [[Evan Hunter]], who was told by Hitchcock to develop new characters and a more elaborate plot while keeping du Maurier's title and concept of unexplained bird attacks.\n\nIn 2016, ''The Birds'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in its [[National Film Registry]].\n\n== Plot ==\nMelanie Daniels (Hedren), a [[San Francisco]] socialite, meets lawyer Mitch Brenner (Taylor) in a [[pet store]]. Mitch pretends to mistake Melanie for an employee and asks her for a couple of [[lovebird]]s to offer his sister Cathy (Cartwright) for her birthday. The next morning, Melanie goes to Mitch's apartment to deliver the lovebirds, but finds that he has gone to [[Bodega Bay, California|Bodega Bay]] for the weekend. There, Melanie meets the local teacher Annie Hayworth (Pleshette). Melanie rents a boat and crosses the bay to discreetly drop the lovebirds off at the Brenner farm. Mitch spots Melanie during her retreat and drives his car around the bay to meet her at the port. As Melanie approaches the wharf, she is attacked by a [[gull]]. Mitch tends to her wound and invites her to a restaurant, where she meets Mitch's domineering mother Lydia (Tandy). Melanie returns to Annie's house and is allowed to rest there for the night. At the farm, Lydia expresses concern for her hens, who are refusing to eat, and discloses her dislike of Melanie to Mitch. After Melanie is called by Mitch and invited to Cathy's birthday party, there is a violent thud at Annie's door. Annie and Melanie rush to find a dead gull at the threshold.\n\nAt Cathy's 11th birthday party the next day, Melanie privately tells Mitch that she was abandoned by her mother at that same age. During a game of [[Blind man's buff|blind man's bluff]], the guests are attacked by gulls. The following evening, as Melanie dines with the Brenners, [[American sparrow|sparrow]]s invade the house through the chimney. The next morning, Lydia visits her neighbor to discuss her chickens. She finds his eyeless corpse, pecked lifeless by birds, and flees in terror. When Lydia fears for Cathy's safety, Melanie offers to pick up Cathy at school. As Melanie waits outside of the schoolhouse for class to end, a large flock of [[American crow|crows]] slowly engulf the [[jungle gym]] behind her. Anticipating an attack, she warns Annie, and they evacuate the children. The commotion stirs the crows into attacking, injuring several of the children. Melanie meets Mitch at the restaurant, where a conversation between the patrons and staff concerning the birds is interrupted by an assault of a gas station attendant by gulls, followed by an explosion and fire caused by ignited [[gasoline]]. The restaurant clientele are violently attacked by a swarm of gulls as they attempt to rescue the victims. Melanie takes refuge in a [[telephone booth]], but gulls fly into the glass walls and shatter them. Mitch saves Melanie and they return to the restaurant, where a distraught patron accuses her of causing the attacks, which began with her arrival.\n\nMitch and Melanie visit Annie's house and find that she has been killed by crows while ushering Cathy to safety inside the house. That night Melanie and the Brenners seek refuge inside the family home, which is attacked by waves of birds that nearly breach the barricaded doors and windows. During a lull between attacks, Melanie hears the sound of fluttering wings. Realizing the sounds are emanating from above, she cautiously climbs the staircase and enters Cathy's bedroom, where she finds that the birds have broken through the roof. They violently attack her, trapping her in the room until Mitch rescues her. Melanie is badly injured and nearly catatonic; Mitch insists that they get her to the hospital and suggests that they drive to San Francisco. As Mitch readies Melanie's car for their escape, a sea of birds gathers menacingly around the Brenner house. The radio reports bird attacks on nearby communities such as [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], and suggests that the military may intervene to quell the unexplained attacks. Cathy retrieves the lovebirds from the house and joins Mitch and Lydia as they carefully escort Melanie to the car past a mass of birds nearby. The car slowly makes its way through a landscape in which thousands of birds are ominously perching.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tippi Hedren]] as Melanie Daniels\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Mitch Brenner\n* [[Jessica Tandy]] as Lydia Brenner\n* [[Suzanne Pleshette]] as Annie Hayworth\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Cathy Brenner\n* [[Ethel Griffies]] as Mrs. Bundy, ornithologist\n* [[Charles McGraw]] as Sebastian Sholes, fisherman\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Deke Carter, innkeeper\n* Doreen Lang as Hysterical Mother\n* [[Karl Swenson]] as Christian preacher\n* [[Joe Mantell]] as Cynical Businessman\n* [[Ruth McDevitt]] as Mrs. MacGruder, owner of the bird shop\n* [[Malcolm Atterbury]] as Deputy Al Malone\n* John McGovern as Mail Clerk\n* [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] as Mitch's neighbor in San Francisco\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Helen Carter, Deke's wife\n* [[Doodles Weaver]] as Fisherman helping with rental boat\n* [[Bill Quinn|William Quinn]] as George - farmhand.\n* [[Alfred Hitchcock]] makes his [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|signature cameo]] as a man walking dogs out of the pet shop at the beginning of the film.

The initial humor followed by horror would turn the suspense into shock.<ref name=\"hunt292\" /> At first, Hunter wanted the protagonist to be a school teacher, but this ended up being the basis for Annie Hayward's character instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=66}}</ref> Hunter organised his scripts by shots instead of scenes, although this did not affect the final film.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=64}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock solicited comments from several people regarding the first draft of Hunter's screenplay. Consolidating their criticisms, Hitchcock wrote to Hunter, suggesting that the script (particularly the first part) was too long, contained insufficient characterization in the two leads, and that some scenes lacked drama and audience interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Auiler|1999|pp=207\u20139}}</ref> Hitchcock, at later stages, consulted with his friends, [[Hume Cronyn]] (whose wife [[Jessica Tandy]] was playing Lydia), and [[V.

The gulls were caught in the San Francisco garbage dump<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=99}}</ref> and the sparrows were caught by John \"Bud\" Cardos. However, the captured sparrows had to be used alongside birds from pet shops to achieve full effect in the scene where they invade the house.<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n[[File:MIM Mixtur-Trautonium CN5834.jpg|right|thumb|Many of the sound effects were created on the [[Trautonium|Mixtur-Trautonium]], an electronic musical instrument developed by [[Oskar Sala]].]]\nHitchcock decided to do without any conventional incidental [[Film score|score]].<ref name=\"a516\">{{harvnb|Auiler|1999|p=516}}</ref> Instead, he made use of [[sound effect]]s and sparse [[source music]] in counterpoint to calculated silences. He wanted to use the electroacoustic [[Trautonium|Mixtur-Trautonium]] to create the bird calls and noises. He had first encountered this predecessor to the [[synthesizer]] on Berlin radio in the late 1920s. It was invented by Friedrich Trautwein, and further developed by [[Oskar Sala]] into the Trautonium, which would create some of the bird sounds for this film.<ref name=\"pinch\">{{harvnb|Pinch|Trocco|2004|p=54}}</ref>\n\nThe director commissioned Sala and Remi Gassmann to design an electronic soundtrack.<ref name=\"a516\" /> They are credited with \"electronic sound production and composition\", and Hitchcock's previous musical collaborator, [[Bernard Herrmann]], is credited as \"sound consultant\".\n\nSource music includes the first of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Deux arabesques]]'', which Tippi Hedren's character plays on [[piano]], and \"Risseldy Rosseldy\", an [[Americanization|Americanized]] version of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Folk music|folk song]], \"[[Wee Cooper O'Fife]]\", which is sung by the schoolchildren.\n\n=== Special effects ===\nOnce the crow attack and attic scenes were assembled by the film's editor, [[George Tomasini]], they were sent to the special effects department for enhancement.<ref>{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=142}}</ref> The film required myriad special effects and Hitchcock commissioned the help of various studios. The special effects shots of the attacking birds were completed at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] by animator/technician, [[Ub Iwerks]], who used the [[sodium vapor process]] (\"yellow screen\"), which he had helped to develop. The SV process films the subject against a screen lit with narrow-spectrum sodium vapor lights. Unlike most compositing processes, SVP shoots two separate elements of the footage simultaneously using a beam-splitter. One reel is regular film stock and the other a film stock with emulsion sensitive only to the sodium vapor wavelength. This results in very precise [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte shots]] compared to [[Chroma key|blue screen]] special effects, necessary due to \"fringing\" of the image from the birds' rapid wing flapping.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=315}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Cinemafantastique_(1980)_-_The_Making_of_Alfred_Hitchcock's_The_Birds|title=Cinemafantastique (1980) \u2013 The Making of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds|website=the.hitchcock.zone|accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> At Disney, Iwerks worked on the following scenes: the children's party, Melanie driving to Bodega Bay, and the first two cuts of the crow attack sequence.<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=143}}</ref> One of the biggest challenges facing Iwerks was the scene where a number of sparrows fly in through the chimney of the family home. Utilizing an [[optical printer]], his superposition of a group of small birds flying inside an enclosed glass booth made it possible to multiply the birds in the living room. Most of the special effects work done at Disney was completed in the Process Lab on printer 10, which was made from Iwerk's own original design.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], Bob Hoag was put in charge of the optical effects for the sequence where Melanie hides inside a telephone booth as it is attacked by the birds. Hitchcock had requested that Hoag remove any shot where Melanie looked placid and urged that she be in constant movement instead. Hoag, along with a team of 30, worked together on the blue backing and sodium matte shots.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Linwood G. Dunn|Linwood Dunn]], a founder of Film Effects of Hollywood, was commissioned to work on the attic scene. He was asked to produce a rough cut of the sequence before Hitchcock left for Berlin in December 1962.<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=144}}</ref> Bill Abbott, at [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], was in charge of the optical effects for the crow attack sequence, which would take six weeks to finish. Abbott organised two teams \u2013 both working 11 hours a day \u2013 to work on the sequence simultaneously. Abbott's biggest challenge was size ratio, as he had to ensure that the birds looked like they were attacking the children. He achieved this by placing the birds within frame and zooming in on them to make them the correct size in proportion to the children.<ref name=\":1\" /> At [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], associate editor, Ross Hoffman, and matte artist, Albert Whitlock, both worked on designing the town's backdrop, including the birds in the trees and the scenery for the river shots of Melanie's car arriving in Bodega Bay.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Birds featured 370 effects shots, the final shot being a composite of 32 separate elements.\n\n== Premiere and awards ==\nThe film premiered March 28, 1963, in [[New York City]]. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted an invitation-only screening as part of a 50-film retrospective of Hitchcock's film work. The MOMA series had a booklet with a [[monograph]] on the director written by [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. The film was screened out of competition<ref>[http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/cannes2.htm \"Films that are screened Out of Competition are generally those that the Cannes selection committee really wants to recognize but don't quite fit the Competition criteria\"]</ref> in May at a prestigious invitational showing at the [[1963 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3106/year/1963.html|title=Festival de Cannes: The Birds |accessdate=February 27, 2009|website=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> with Hitchcock and Hedren in attendance.\n\nUb Iwerks was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]].<ref name=\":02\" /> The winner that year was ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.

The representation of the birds in the film constantly changes to reflect the development of these themes, and the story itself. At first, the lovebirds in the pet store signify the blossoming love between Melanie and Mitch, and the sexual tension between the two.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998|p=24}}</ref> However, the birds' symbolism changes once they begin to attack Bodega Bay. Hitchcock stated in an interview that the birds in the film rise up against the humans to punish them for taking nature for granted.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998|p=87}}</ref>\n\nAnother theme explored within the film is the entrapment of civilians.<ref>{{harvnb|Raubicheck|Srebnick|2011|p=140}}</ref> This is because the birds attack anyone who goes outside, consequently leaving people trapped inside their homes.\n\nHumanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] wrote a monograph about the film for the BFI Film Classics series. She interprets it as an ode to the many facets of female sexuality and, by extension, nature itself. She notes that women play pivotal roles in it. Mitch is defined by his relationships with his mother, sister, and ex-lover \u2013 a careful balance which is disrupted by his attraction to the beautiful Melanie.<ref>{{harvnb|Paglia|1998}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| width = 30em\n| bgcolor = cornsilk\n| align = left\n| fontsize = 101%\n| salign = right\n| quote = ''\"The theme [of the film], after all, is complacency, as the director has stated on innumerable occasions. When we first meet each of the major characters, their infinite capacity of self-absorption is emphasized. Tippi Hedren's bored socialite is addicted to elaborately time-consuming practical jokes. Rod Taylor's self-righteous lawyer flaunts his arrogant sensuality, Suzanne Pleshette, his ex-fianc\u00e9e, wallows in self-pity, and Jessica Tandy, his possessive mother, cringes from her fear of loneliness''.<br /><br />\n''With such complex, unsympathetic characters to contend with, the audience begins to identify with the point of view of the birds, actually the inhuman point of view...\"''\n| source = '''\u2013 Film historian [[Andrew Sarris]] (1998)'''<ref>{{harvnb|Sarris|1998|p=297}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Style ===\n[[Montage (filmmaking)|Montage editing]] and slow pacing are used within the film to build suspense and elicit a greater emotional response from the audience during the attack scenes: \"The pattern of ''The Birds'' was deliberately to go slow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=294}}</ref> This is exemplified in the scene where the birds gradually gather outside of the school, while an unobservant Melanie sits and waits on the bench. The camera then cuts between her and the increasing number of birds that swoop down onto the jungle gym behind her until they finally attack.\n\n[[Eyeline match]]es and point-of-view ([[Point-of-view shot|POV]]) shots within the film encourage audience identification with particular characters and their subjective experiences. This is achieved by cutting between the character and the object of their gaze. For example, when Melanie crosses the bay near the beginning of the film, the camera cuts between close-ups of her face and shots of the Brenner house from her perspective, as she watches Mitch fall for her prank.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=291}}</ref>\n\nThe focus on editing and visuals rather than dialogue is also an element of [[Cin\u00e9ma pur|pure cinema]] that Hitchcock largely uses throughout his work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Gottlieb|1997|p=290}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Birds'' received mixed reviews upon its initial release. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was positive, calling it \"a horror film that should raise the hackles on the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide.\" Crowther was unsure whether the birds were meant to be an allegory because \"it isn't in Mr. Hitchcock's style to inject allegorical meanings or social significance in his films,\" but he suggested that they could represent the [[Erinyes|Furies]] of Greek mythology who pursued the wicked upon the earth.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |authorlink=Bosley Crowther|date=April 1, 1963 |title=Screen: 'The Birds' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|page=53 }}</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] of [[The New Republic]] called The Birds 'the worst thriller of his (Hitchcock) that I can remember'.<ref>{{cite book |title=A world on Film|last1=Kauffmann|first1=Stanley |publisher=Delta Books |year=1968 |page=158}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard L.

Scheuer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was among the critics who panned the film, writing that Hitchcock \"was once widely quoted as saying he hated actors. After his 1960 '[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]' and now 'The Birds,' it must be fairly obvious that he has extended his abhorrence to the whole human race.

The current building is a restoration of a largely 19th century structure, burnt out in 1981. \n\nKilleen was built as one of a pair of castles either side of a major roadway north, the other being the extant [[Dunsany Castle]].<ref name=\"StoryKilleen\">Dunsany, County Meath, April 1991: Carty/Lynch - The History of Killeen Castle; Mary Rose Carty, {{ISBN|0-9517382-0-8}}</ref>  Its estate was occupied continuously by the Cusack, and then after a marriage, Plunkett, families, from 1172 to 1951.\n\n==History==\n===The Cusacks===\n[[File:deCusack_Castle.jpg|thumbnail|right|Killeen Castle, County Meath]]\nThe original structure at Killeen Castle is said to have been a [[Normans|Norman]] fortification, perhaps wooden, built for the de Lacy magnates, and held from 1172 by the [[Cusack]] family, beginning with Geoffrey de Cusack.  The stone castle was built by Geoffrey de Cusack around 1181.<ref name=\"Skryne\">Skryne and the Early Normans by E.Hickey 1994 p.93</ref> The date is carved above the doorway.<ref name=\"Cusack\">Cusack.Fr.P.(1981) The Cusacks of Killeen, Co. Meath. O.Cist.</ref>. Killeen Castle was the seat of the de Cusacks for over 250 years, from Geoffrey de Cusack (1172) until Lady Joan de Cusack (1441), who with her husband, Sir Christoper Plunkett, \"caused the church to be built beside the castle.\".<ref>Dr Beryl F.E.Moore, p.27</ref>\n\nThis Chantry Church is now a national monument <ref>Annals of St Mary's CSMii, p. 275</ref>\n\nAn early recorded description of the castle and its interior<ref name=\"Cusack\">Cusack.Fr.P.(1981) The Cusacks of Killeen, Co. Meath. O.Cist.</ref> reads - ''The date is Aug 1st (the feast of St. Peter's Chains). As we approach the castle we are faced by four tall battlemented towers with five storeys of slit openings linking the curtain walls of the building. The castle is set on a slight mound. We enter by a steep wooden stairway, and find ourselves, having passed through the considerable thickness of the wall from the narrow doorway, into the Great Hall on the first floor. Rushes cover the stone flags, and besides the usual furniture, such as a trestle-table, benches and the straight-backed, carved, oaken armchair of the Lord of the Manor, we note on our left a heavy green and white curtain covering one wall of the Hall. Opposite us with its sloping stone hood is the fireplace with logs burning in the grate. The right hand wall is hung with the Lord's war harness, his morion, hunting trophies and feathered lure used in falconry. It is a costly piece with a perch and gilt borders''.\n\nIn such surroundings the de Cusacks, Lords of Killeen, lived, made war, and expanded their fiefdoms for 225 years until the castle passed to the Plunketts through the marriage of Lady Joan de Cusack to Christopher Plunkett of Rathregan in 1399.\n\n===The Plunketts===\nThe first Plunkett to hold the castle, Sir Christopher, became the 1st [[Baron Killeen]], and divided his estate between his elder two sons, the second son taking possession of sister castle, [[Dunsany Castle and Demesne|Dunsany]], and later becoming the 1st [[Baron Dunsany]].  The elder branch continued as [[Baron Killeen|Barons of Killeen]], and later [[Earl of Fingall|Earls of Fingall]].  The third, [[Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket|Sir Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket]], married heiress Mary Ann Cruice of Rathmore, daughter of Sir Christopher Cruice of Cruicetown, Moydorrah and Rathmore Castle - a crucifix in their honour is located on the [[demesne]]. The fourth and sixth sons founded other landed houses. [[Dunsoghly Castle]], one of the few intact fifteenth-century castles in Ireland, was built by  the family of Sir Robert Plunket, the fourth son, between 1450 and 1480. An additional title, as [[Baron Fingall]], in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]], was acquired in 1831.  While the titles survived, the Killeens were the premier Catholic peers of Ireland.<ref name=\"StoryKilleen\"/>\n\nThe castle was developed over time, and by the fifteenth century was a mid-size fortified [[tower house]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe two branches of the original family remained close through the centuries and during the worst of the [[Penal law (Britain)|Penal Laws]], the Dunsany branch, having survived transportation to [[Connacht]] under Cromwell and other difficulties, converted to the [[Church of Ireland]], and held Killeen in trust for the elder branch, which remained [[Roman Catholic]].  Unlike some arrangements of this sort, Killeen was formally returned when the legal situation changed.<ref name=\"StoryKilleen\"/>\n\nThe castle fell into disrepair in the late 17th century, was leased out, and was not restored until around 1779, when parts of the demesne were landscaped and some of the estate features were added.\n\nSignificant reworking was carried out from 1803 to 1813 under the supervision of [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]], and in 1841, much of the castle was demolished and rebuilt (using much existing material) by [[Arthur Plunkett, 9th Earl of Fingall|The 9th Earl of Fingall]], in the style of a small [[Windsor Castle]].  The two towers added have the dates 1181 and 1841 inscribed, and at the time of completion, it was said that Killeen had 365 windows.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===After the Plunketts===\n[[Earl of Fingall#Earl of Fingall (1628)|The 12th Earl of Fingall]] (1896-1984), the last to hold the [[earldom]], sold Killeen Castle and its remaining estate in 1951, to [[Sir Victor Sassoon]]. The Earl remained as manager of the stud farm established near the castle.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  In 1953, the Earl and Countess moved to a modern house built on the lands, and most of the house contents were sold.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  Sassoon died in 1961 and his heirs sold the estate on in 1963, to French [[art dealer]] and major racehorse owner, [[Daniel Wildenstein]].\n\nThe last Earl moved from the estate to Corballis on the Dunsany Estate, then The Commons.  He died in 1984 and is buried at Dunsany Church.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn 1978, the castle and estate were sold to advertiser Basil Brindley, who continued the stud farm operation. On 16 May 1981, the castle was burnt out in an arson attack, being left abandoned for many years. The lands and buildings were sold again in 1989.\n\n===New development===\nIn 1989, a new development plan was proposed, and later revised, with multiple applications for permission, including the conversion of the castle into a high-end hotel, the installation of a championship standard [[golf course]] and the construction of more than one hundred units of luxury housing on the estate.  With successive modifications and discussions, plans were approved, with conditions to protect parts of the demesne landscape, and estate features, including a holy well.

The current building is a restoration of a largely 19th century structure, burnt out in 1981. \n\nKilleen was built as one of a pair of castles either side of a major roadway north, the other being the extant [[Dunsany Castle]].<ref name=\"StoryKilleen\">Dunsany, County Meath, April 1991: Carty/Lynch - The History of Killeen Castle; Mary Rose Carty, {{ISBN|0-9517382-0-8}}</ref>  Its estate was occupied continuously by the Cusack, and then after a marriage, Plunkett, families, from 1172 to 1951.\n\n==History==\n===The Cusacks===\n[[File:deCusack_Castle.jpg|thumbnail|right|Killeen Castle, County Meath]]\nThe original structure at Killeen Castle is said to have been a [[Normans|Norman]] fortification, perhaps wooden, built for the de Lacy magnates, and held from 1172 by the [[Cusack]] family, beginning with Geoffrey de Cusack.  The stone castle was built by Geoffrey de Cusack around 1181.<ref name=\"Skryne\">Skryne and the Early Normans by E.Hickey 1994 p.93</ref> The date is carved above the doorway.<ref name=\"Cusack\">Cusack.Fr.P.(1981) The Cusacks of Killeen, Co. Meath. O.Cist.</ref>. Killeen Castle was the seat of the de Cusacks for over 250 years, from Geoffrey de Cusack (1172) until Lady Joan de Cusack (1441), who with her husband, Sir Christoper Plunkett, \"caused the church to be built beside the castle.\"<ref>Dr Beryl F.E.Moore, p.27</ref>.\n\nThis Chantry Church is now a national monument <ref>Annals of St Mary's CSMii, p. 275</ref>\n\nAn early recorded description of the castle and its interior<ref name=\"Cusack\">Cusack.Fr.P.(1981) The Cusacks of Killeen, Co. Meath. O.Cist.</ref> reads - ''The date is Aug 1st (the feast of St. Peter's Chains). As we approach the castle we are faced by four tall battlemented towers with five storeys of slit openings linking the curtain walls of the building. The castle is set on a slight mound. We enter by a steep wooden stairway, and find ourselves, having passed through the considerable thickness of the wall from the narrow doorway, into the Great Hall on the first floor. Rushes cover the stone flags, and besides the usual furniture, such as a trestle-table, benches and the straight-backed, carved, oaken armchair of the Lord of the Manor, we note on our left a heavy green and white curtain covering one wall of the Hall. Opposite us with its sloping stone hood is the fireplace with logs burning in the grate. The right hand wall is hung with the Lord's war harness, his morion, hunting trophies and feathered lure used in falconry. It is a costly piece with a perch and gilt borders''.\n\nIn such surroundings the de Cusacks, Lords of Killeen, lived, made war, and expanded their fiefdoms for 225 years until the castle passed to the Plunketts through the marriage of Lady Joan de Cusack to Christopher Plunkett of Rathregan in 1399.\n\n===The Plunketts===\nThe first Plunkett to hold the castle, Sir Christopher, became the 1st [[Baron Killeen]], and divided his estate between his elder two sons, the second son taking possession of sister castle, [[Dunsany Castle and Demesne|Dunsany]], and later becoming the 1st [[Baron Dunsany]].  The elder branch continued as [[Baron Killeen|Barons of Killeen]], and later [[Earl of Fingall|Earls of Fingall]].  The third, [[Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket|Sir Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket]], married heiress Mary Ann Cruice of Rathmore, daughter of Sir Christopher Cruice of Cruicetown, Moydorrah and Rathmore Castle - a crucifix in their honour is located on the [[demesne]]. The fourth and sixth sons founded other landed houses. [[Dunsoghly Castle]], one of the few intact fifteenth-century castles in Ireland, was built by  the family of Sir Robert Plunket, the fourth son, between 1450 and 1480. An additional title, as [[Baron Fingall]], in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]], was acquired in 1831.  While the titles survived, the Killeens were the premier Catholic peers of Ireland.<ref name=\"StoryKilleen\"/>\n\nThe castle was developed over time, and by the fifteenth century was a mid-size fortified [[tower house]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe two branches of the original family remained close through the centuries and during the worst of the [[Penal law (Britain)|Penal Laws]], the Dunsany branch, having survived transportation to [[Connacht]] under Cromwell and other difficulties, converted to the [[Church of Ireland]], and held Killeen in trust for the elder branch, which remained [[Roman Catholic]].  Unlike some arrangements of this sort, Killeen was formally returned when the legal situation changed.<ref name=\"StoryKilleen\"/>\n\nThe castle fell into disrepair in the late 17th century, was leased out, and was not restored until around 1779, when parts of the demesne were landscaped and some of the estate features were added.\n\nSignificant reworking was carried out from 1803 to 1813 under the supervision of [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]], and in 1841, much of the castle was demolished and rebuilt (using much existing material) by [[Arthur Plunkett, 9th Earl of Fingall|The 9th Earl of Fingall]], in the style of a small [[Windsor Castle]].  The two towers added have the dates 1181 and 1841 inscribed, and at the time of completion, it was said that Killeen had 365 windows.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===After the Plunketts===\n[[Earl of Fingall#Earl of Fingall (1628)|The 12th Earl of Fingall]] (1896-1984), the last to hold the [[earldom]], sold Killeen Castle and its remaining estate in 1951, to [[Sir Victor Sassoon]]. The Earl remained as manager of the stud farm established near the castle.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  In 1953, the Earl and Countess moved to a modern house built on the lands, and most of the house contents were sold.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  Sassoon died in 1961 and his heirs sold the estate on in 1963, to French [[art dealer]] and major racehorse owner, [[Daniel Wildenstein]].\n\nThe last Earl moved from the estate to Corballis on the Dunsany Estate, then The Commons.  He died in 1984 and is buried at Dunsany Church.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn 1978, the castle and estate were sold to advertiser Basil Brindley, who continued the stud farm operation. On 16 May 1981, the castle was burnt out in an arson attack, being left abandoned for many years. The lands and buildings were sold again in 1989.\n\n===New development===\nIn 1989, a new development plan was proposed, and later revised, with multiple applications for permission, including the conversion of the castle into a high-end hotel, the installation of a championship standard [[golf course]] and the construction of more than one hundred units of luxury housing on the estate.  With successive modifications and discussions, plans were approved, with conditions to protect parts of the demesne landscape, and estate features, including a holy well.  Work began in 2005.\n\nIn August 2006 it was announced that Killeen Castle would open in 2009 as a 179-room luxury golf and spa hotel under the [[Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide|Starwood Luxury Collection]] brand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/article.php?story=20060802112944844&query=wta |title=Starwood lines up third Irish hotel |publisher=Breaking Travel News |date=2 August 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-26 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, in early 2009, Starwood withdrew from the project after plans were scaled down by developers Snowbury following a downturn in the tourism and leisure industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/meathsouth/articles/2009/05/06/39240-starwood-pulls-out-of-killeen-hotel-project/ |title=Starwood pulls out of Killeen hotel project |publisher=[[Meath Chronicle]] |date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>\n\n====Golf====\nOn 14 December 2006, after over a year of bidding, Killeen Castle was chosen as the host venue for the [[2011 Solheim Cup|2011]]  [[Solheim Cup]], the first time Ireland had ever hosted this event, despite the fact that the golf course had yet to be constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/golf/ireland-beats-off-challengers-to-capture-2011-solheim-cup-64691.html |title=Ireland beats off challengers to capture 2011 Solheim Cup |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> The 18-hole championship course was designed by [[Jack Nicklaus]] and opened in 2008; it hosted the revived [[Ladies Irish Open]] on the [[Ladies European Tour]] in August [[2010 Ladies European Tour|2010]] and [[2011 Ladies European Tour|2011]] in the run up to the Solheim Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=Killeen Castle to Host the 2010 AIB Ladies Irish Open supported by Failte Ireland on August 6-8, 2010|url=http://www.ladieseuropeantour.com/content/let_content_news.php?Id=24039|publisher=Ladies European Tour|accessdate=19 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n'''Dave Pelz Scoring Game School''' opened at Killeen Castle estate in June 2008, with a focus on the game within {{convert|100|yd|m}} of the hole.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pelzgolf.com/golfschools/aboutlocation.aspx?location=killeen |title=Dave Pelz Instruction at Killeen Castle |publisher=Dave Pelz Golf Schools |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==Contents==\nThe demesne contains the castle itself, a substantial stable yard, a church (sometimes, incorrectly, called \"Killeen Abbey\"), a holy well (the \"Lady Well\"), a pond, a walled garden and other features.\n\nThe church, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, was erected around 1425, is in the Gothic style and has an adjacent cemetery.

Before each performance, a video package will tease clues to their identity with the celebrity narrating aspects of their biography in a disguised voice.

The contestants are then voted on by the audience to see who is safe and continues, or who will compete in a further round of singing in that episode, and possibly elimination.\n\n==Production==\nThe third season featured 18 new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.

Before each performance, a video package will tease clues to their identity with the celebrity narrating aspects of their biography in a disguised voice. After each performs in their own voice, the panelists will attempt to guess who is the masked singer. The contestants are then voted on by the audience to see who is safe and continues, or who will compete in a further round of singing in that episode, and possibly elimination.\n\n==Production==\nThe third season featured 18 new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.

Further, passionate fans of the show had been able to work out identities of the singers from early clue packages, so more difficult clue packages were created for the celebrities in the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/masked-singer-season-3-cast-contestants-clues-1203448727/|title=''The Masked Singer'' Season 3: New Changes, Tougher Clues and \u2018Big Names\u2019 in the Cast|first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|date=December 19, 2019|access-date=February 20, 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n==Panelists and host==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width   = 420\n| align         = left\n| direction     = horizontal\n| header        = Season 3 panelists and host\n| image1        = Robin Thicke 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| caption1      = [[Robin Thicke]]\n| image2        = Jenny McCarthy at E3 2006.jpg\n| caption2      = [[Jenny McCarthy]]\n| image3        = Ken Jeong March 2015.jpg\n| caption3      = [[Ken Jeong]]\n| image4        = Nicole Scherzinger 2012.jpg\n| caption4      = [[Nicole Scherzinger]]\n| image5        = Nick Cannon by David Shankbone.jpg\n| caption5      = [[Nick Cannon]] \n}}\n\n[[Nick Cannon]], singer-songwriter [[Robin Thicke]], television personality [[Jenny McCarthy]], actor and comedian [[Ken Jeong]], and recording artist [[Nicole Scherzinger]] will return for their third season as host and panelists.<ref name=\"Season 3 EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/12/30/what-we-know-the-masked-singer-season-3/|title=What we know (so far) about ''The Masked Singer'' season 3: New costumes, 18 contestants, and more|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Rachel Yang |date=December 30, 2019|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGuest panelists included [[Jamie Foxx]] during the first episode, [[Jason Biggs]] in the second episode, [[Leah Remini]] in the third episode, [[Gabriel Iglesias]] in the fifth episode, season 1 winner, [[T-Pain]], in the sixth episode, [[Joel McHale]] in the eighth episode, [[Will Arnett]] in the ninth episode, [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] in the eleventh episode, [[Sharon Osbourne]] in the twelfth episode,<ref name=\"TFC E12\"/> and [[Gordon Ramsay]] in the thirteenth episode.<ref name=\"TFC E13\"/>\n\n==Contestants==\nDuring the season, eighteen contestants will compete.<ref name=\"Season 3 EW\" /> \n\nThe competitors are said to have a combined 69 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations, 88 [[RIAA certification|gold records]], 11 [[Super Bowl]] appearances, three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], hundreds of tattoos, and one title in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>{{cite web|website=[[TVGuide]]|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/the-masked-singer-season-3-jamie-foxx/|title=The Masked Singer Season 3 Adds Jamie Foxx as Guest Panelist|author= Amanda Bell|date= January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; \"\n|- \n! rowspan=\"3\" | Stage name<ref>{{cite web |title=From the Banana to the Taco, \u2018The Masked Singer\u2019 Season 3 Costumes Have Been Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/masked-singer-season-3-costumes-first-look-photos-1203485426/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=January 31, 2020|date=January 29, 2020}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"3\"| Celebrity\n! rowspan=\"3\"| Occupation\n! colspan=\"13\"| Episodes\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\" |1\n! colspan=\"1\" |2\n! colspan=\"1\" |3\n! colspan=\"1\" |4\n! colspan=\"1\" |5\n! colspan=\"1\" |6\n! colspan=\"1\" |7\n! colspan=\"1\" |8\n! colspan=\"1\" |9\n! rowspan=\"2\" |10\n! rowspan=\"2\" |11\n! rowspan=\"2\" |12\n! rowspan=\"2\" |13\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| Group A\n! colspan=\"3\"| Group B\n! colspan=\"3\"| Group C\n|-\n!
