{"title_page": "Bidet", "text_new": "{{short description|plumbing fixture or type of sink intended for washing the genitalia and anus of the human body}}\n[[File:Bidet Ego Kolo.jpg|thumb|A modern bidet]]\n[[File:Bidet weiss.jpg|thumb|A modern bidet of the traditional type]]\n\nA '''bidet''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-bidet.ogg|us|b|\u1d7b|\u02c8|d|e\u026a}} or {{IPAc-en|uk|\u02c8|b|i\u02d0|d|e\u026a}}) is a bowl or receptacle designed to be sat on for the purpose of [[washing]] the human [[Sex organ|genitalia]], [[perineum]], inner [[buttocks]], and [[human anus|anus]]. The modern variety includes a plumbed-in water supply and a drainage opening, and is thus a type of [[plumbing fixture]] subject to local hygiene regulations. The bidet is designed to promote personal hygiene, and is used after defecation, and before and after sexual intercourse. In several European countries, a bidet is today required by law to be present in every bathroom containing a [[toilet|toilet bowl]]. It was originally located in the bedroom, near the chamber-pot and the marital bed, but in modern times is located near the toilet bowl in the bathroom. Fixtures that combine a [[toilet seat]] with a washing facility include the [[electronic bidet]]. \n\nOpinions as to the necessity of the bidet vary widely over different nationalities and cultures, with anglophone nations traditionally shunning it and finding its mere existence a notorious and proverbial source of personal embarrassment and bewilderment. To those world cultures which use it habitually, such as the Islamic world, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Europe and the French, it is an essential and indispensable tool in maintaining good personal hygiene. \"Bidet\" is a [[French language|French]] [[loanword]] meaning \"little horse\" due to the [[List of human positions#Riding positions|straddling position]] adopted in its usage.\n\n==Applications==\nBidets are primarily used to wash and clean the genitalia, perineum, inner buttocks, and anus. Some bidets have a vertical jet intended to give easy access for washing and rinsing the perineum and anal area. The traditional separate bidet is like a wash-basin which is filled with clean water, and may then used for many other purposes such as washing feet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/01/why-wont-prudish-brits-recognise-the-bidets-brilliance |title=Why won't prudish Brits recognise the bidet's brilliance? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 May 2017 |author=Michelle Hanson |accessdate= 13 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28237337 |title=The imaginative ways readers use bidets|website=BBC |date=15 July 2014  |author= |accessdate= 13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Bidet shower ===\n{{main|Bidet shower}}\n[[File:Bidee shower.jpg|upright|thumb|A Finnish bidet shower]]\nA [[bidet shower]] (also known as \"bidet spray\", \"bidet sprayer\", or \"health faucet\") is a hand-held triggered nozzle, similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer, that delivers a spray of water to assist in [[anal cleansing]] and cleaning the genitals after defecation and urination. In contrast to a bidet that is integrated with the toilet, a bidet shower has to be held by the hands, and cleaning does not take place automatically. Bidet showers are common in countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing.\n\nDrawbacks include the possibility of wetting a user's clothing if used carelessly. In addition, a user must be reasonably mobile and flexible to use a hand-held bidet shower.\n\n=== Conventional or standalone bidet===\n[[File:Bidet side.jpg|thumb|upright|A 20th century standalone bidet (foreground)]]\nA bidet is a plumbing fixture that is installed as a separate unit in the bathroom besides toilet, shower and sink, which users have to straddle. Some bidets resemble a large hand basin, with taps and a stopper so they can be filled up; other designs have a [[nozzle]] that squirts a jet of water to aid in cleansing.\n\n===  Add-on bidets  ===\n[[File:SB-BidetIntegrated.jpg|thumb|237px|An add-on bidet.]]\nThere are bidets that are attachable to toilet bowls, saving space and without the need to plumb in an additional unit. A bidet may be a movable or fixed nozzle attached to an existing toilet on back or side toilet rim, or replacing the toilet seat. In these cases, their use is restricted to cleaning the anus and genitals. Some bidets of this type produce a vertical water jet and others a more-or-less oblique one. Other bidets have one nozzle on the side rim aimed at both anal and genital areas, and other designs have two nozzles on the back rim. The shorter one, called the \"family nozzle\", is used for washing the area around the anus, and the longer one (\"bidet nozzle\") is designed for washing the vulva.\n\nSuch attachable bidets (also called \"combined toilets\", \"bidet attachments\", or \"add-on bidets\") are controlled either mechanically, by turning a valve, or electronically. Electronic bidets are controlled with waterproof electrical switches rather than a manual valve. There are models that have a [[Electrical element|heating element]] which blows warm air to dry the user after washing, that offer heated seats, wireless [[remote control]]s, illumination through built in [[night light]]s, or built in [[deodorizer]]s and [[activated carbon]] filters to remove odors. Further refinements include adjustable water pressure, temperature compensation, and directional spray control. Where bathroom appearance is of concern, under-the-seat mounting types have become more popular.\n\nAn add-on bidet typically connects to the existing water supply of a toilet via the addition of a [[Piping and plumbing fitting#Tee|threaded tee pipe adapter]], and requires no [[soldering]] or other [[plumbing]] work.<ref name=\"Manjoo\" /> Electronic add-on bidets also require a [[GFCI]] protected grounded electrical outlet.\n\n==Usage and health ==\nPersonal hygiene is improved and maintained more accurately and easily with the use of both toilet paper and a bidet as compared to the use of toilet paper alone.<ref>{{cite news |last= Rickett |first= Oscar |date= 11 February 2018 |title= The bottom line: why it's time the bidet made a comeback |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/11/the-bottom-line-why-its-time-the-bidet-made-a-comeback |work= The Guardian |access-date= 29 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cohen-Mansfield |first1=J. |last2=Biddison |first2=J.

The modern variety includes a plumbed-in water supply and a drainage opening, and is thus a type of [[plumbing fixture]] subject to local hygiene regulations. The bidet is designed to promote personal hygiene, and is used after defecation, and before and after sexual intercourse. In several European countries, a bidet is today required by law to be present in every bathroom containing a [[toilet|toilet bowl]]. It was originally located in the bedroom, near the chamber-pot and the marital bed, but in modern times is located near the toilet bowl in the bathroom. Fixtures that combine a [[toilet seat]] with a washing facility include the [[electronic bidet]]. \n\nOpinions as to the necessity of the bidet vary widely over different nationalities and cultures, with anglophone nations traditionally shunning it and finding its mere existence a notorious and proverbial source of personal embarrassment and bewilderment. To those world cultures which use it habitually, such as the Islamic world, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Europe and the French, it is an essential and indispensable tool in maintaining good personal hygiene. \"Bidet\" is a [[French language|French]] [[loanword]] meaning \"little horse\" due to the [[List of human positions#Riding positions|straddling position]] adopted in its usage.\n\n==Applications==\nBidets are primarily used to wash and clean the genitalia, perineum, inner buttocks, and anus. Some bidets have a vertical jet intended to give easy access for washing and rinsing the perineum and anal area. The traditional separate bidet is like a wash-basin which is filled with clean water, and may then used for many other purposes such as washing feet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/01/why-wont-prudish-brits-recognise-the-bidets-brilliance |title=Why won't prudish Brits recognise the bidet's brilliance? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 May 2017 |author=Michelle Hanson |accessdate= 13 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28237337 |title=The imaginative ways readers use bidets|website=BBC |date=15 July 2014  |author= |accessdate= 13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Bidet shower ===\n{{main|Bidet shower}}\n[[File:Bidee shower.jpg|upright|thumb|A Finnish bidet shower]]\nA [[bidet shower]] (also known as \"bidet spray\", \"bidet sprayer\", or \"health faucet\") is a hand-held triggered nozzle, similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer, that delivers a spray of water to assist in [[anal cleansing]] and cleaning the genitals after defecation and urination. In contrast to a bidet that is integrated with the toilet, a bidet shower has to be held by the hands, and cleaning does not take place automatically. Bidet showers are common in countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing.\n\nDrawbacks include the possibility of wetting a user's clothing if used carelessly. In addition, a user must be reasonably mobile and flexible to use a hand-held bidet shower.\n\n=== Conventional or standalone bidet===\n[[File:Bidet side.jpg|thumb|upright|A 20th century standalone bidet (foreground)]]\nA bidet is a plumbing fixture that is installed as a separate unit in the bathroom besides toilet, shower and sink, which users have to straddle. Some bidets resemble a large hand basin, with taps and a stopper so they can be filled up; other designs have a [[nozzle]] that squirts a jet of water to aid in cleansing.\n\n===  Add-on bidets  ===\n[[File:SB-BidetIntegrated.jpg|thumb|237px|An add-on bidet.]]\nThere are bidets that are attachable to toilet bowls, saving space and without the need to plumb in an additional unit. A bidet may be a movable or fixed nozzle attached to an existing toilet on back or side toilet rim, or replacing the toilet seat. In these cases, their use is restricted to cleaning the anus and genitals. Some bidets of this type produce a vertical water jet and others a more-or-less oblique one. Other bidets have one nozzle on the side rim aimed at both anal and genital areas, and other designs have two nozzles on the back rim. The shorter one, called the \"family nozzle\", is used for washing the area around the anus, and the longer one (\"bidet nozzle\") is designed for washing the vulva.\n\nSuch attachable bidets (also called \"combined toilets\", \"bidet attachments\", or \"add-on bidets\") are controlled either mechanically, by turning a valve, or electronically. Electronic bidets are controlled with waterproof electrical switches rather than a manual valve. There are models that have a [[Electrical element|heating element]] which blows warm air to dry the user after washing, that offer heated seats, wireless [[remote control]]s, illumination through built in [[night light]]s, or built in [[deodorizer]]s and [[activated carbon]] filters to remove odors. Further refinements include adjustable water pressure, temperature compensation, and directional spray control. Where bathroom appearance is of concern, under-the-seat mounting types have become more popular.\n\nAn add-on bidet typically connects to the existing water supply of a toilet via the addition of a [[Piping and plumbing fitting#Tee|threaded tee pipe adapter]], and requires no [[soldering]] or other [[plumbing]] work.<ref name=\"Manjoo\" /> Electronic add-on bidets also require a [[GFCI]] protected grounded electrical outlet.\n\n==Usage and health ==\nPersonal hygiene is improved and maintained more accurately and easily with the use of both toilet paper and a bidet as compared to the use of toilet paper alone.<ref>{{cite news |last= Rickett |first= Oscar |date= 11 February 2018 |title= The bottom line: why it's time the bidet made a comeback |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/11/the-bottom-line-why-its-time-the-bidet-made-a-comeback |work= The Guardian |access-date= 29 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cohen-Mansfield |first1=J. |last2=Biddison |first2=J.

During the opening title sequence, the original 1970 version of the theme song \"[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show opening sequence#Theme song|Love Is All Around]]\" is played and then switches to the 1996 version recorded by [[Joan Jett|Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]].\n\n==Plot==\nMary Richards-Cronin returns to [[New York City]] after spending four months in [[Europe]] (\u201cItaly, mostly,\u201d she tells a cabdriver) following the death of her [[Member of Congress|Congressman]] husband, Steven Cronin, in a rock-climbing accident. Rhoda Morgenstern-Rousseau also returns to her native New York to make a fresh start as a [[photographer]] after having lived in [[Paris]] for several years, where she has recently divorced her second husband, Jean-Pierre Rousseau.\n\nAfter decades of separation, Mary and Rhoda start to look for each other and eventually reunite outside Mary's apartment building in the Upper West Side of Manhattan (\u201c84th and Central Park West,\u201d Mary tells a cabdriver in an opening scene, though 415 Central Park West, at West 101st Street, was used for the building's exterior shots). The old friends visit Manhattan together and share the events of their lives over the intervening years; Mary then invites Rhoda, just returned to New York, to stay with her in her duplex apartment.\n\nMary reveals that following her departure from WJM-TV in Minneapolis as a news producer, she earned a master's degree in journalism and worked as a studio producer for [[ABC News]] in New York, until her daughter, Rose, was 12 and she decided to quit her job (eight years previously) to spend more time at home. Both Mary's and Rhoda's daughters are now in college \u2014 Mary's Rose is an English major at [[New York University|NYU]] and Rhoda's Meredith is a [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] student and living in residence at [[Barnard College]] \u2014 and are trying to build lives of their own, independent of their mothers.\n\nMary and Rhoda must also each revive their careers, as Rhoda is newly divorced and Mary has learned that her late husband of 20 years spent much of their money on his congressional campaign(s). Both women dread their prospects, as Mary is now 60 and Rhoda is around 58 and lacks confidence in her work as a photographer.\n\nMary finds a job as a segment producer for WNYT in New York, where she works under the station founder, Jonah Seimeier, who is little more than half Mary's age, and comes into conflict with the ethics of a vain anchor/field reporter, Cecile Andrews; Rhoda finds work as a fashion photographer's assistant, where, in addition to \u201cschlepping\", she mothers the young models and begins to take on more responsibility in the studio, as well as to exhibit her own photography independently; Rose suddenly quits school to try her hand at stand-up comedy, with a poor initial reception; and Meredith breaks off from her boyfriend.\n\nUltimately, all four women learn to conquer challenges in work and relationships, to forge their own identities and stand up for themselves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mary Tyler Moore]] as [[Mary Richards|Mary Richards-Cronin]]\n* [[Valerie Harper]] as [[Rhoda Morgenstern|Rhoda Morgenstern-Rousseau]]\n* [[Elon Gold]] as Jonah Seimeier \n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as Cecile Andrews \n* [[Bethany Joy Lenz]] as Rose Cronin \n* [[Marisa Ryan]] as Meredith Rousseau\n\n==Viewer reaction and reception==\nThe film's producers reportedly wanted to make the characters \u201ccurrent\", and as a result, little time was spent in the characters discussing their former life in Minneapolis. This disappointed a number of longtime fans, as did the fact that former ''Mary Tyler Moore Show'' characters [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]], [[Ted Baxter]], [[Murray Slaughter]], [[Phyllis Lindstrom]], [[List of minor characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Georgette Baxter]] and [[Sue Ann Nivens]] were never directly referred to, nor were Rhoda's sister, Brenda Morgenstern, or her father, [[List of minor characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Martin Morgenstern]]. (Indeed, Rhoda is shown staying at the \u201cChester Hotel\u201d when she first returns to New York, although she presumably still has family and friends in the city other than her daughter.) The only characters from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''Rhoda'' to be mentioned was [[List of minor characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Ida Morgenstern]], Rhoda's mother, and Dottie Richards, Mary's mother, though not by their names.\n\nCritical reaction was largely negative.  Phil Gallo of Variety wrote \"Taking characters from a great sitcom and moving them into this feel-good drama is a tough task, one that the script isn\u2019t up to...Fans of the great sitcom will certainly ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the humor?\u201d\".<ref>https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/mary-and-rhoda-1117778646/</ref>  Terry Keleher of People singled out Rhoda's subplot as \"nearly laughless\", and summed up ''Mary and Rhoda'' with the comment \"Bottom Line: Can\u2019t measure up to the memories.\".<ref>https://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-mary-and-rhoda-vol-53-no-5/</ref> Howard Rosenberg of The Los Angeles Times opined that ''Mary and Rhoda'' felt like \"a hologram with no center...\nthe tone here is much less witty than wistful, and re-bottling magic is difficult, perhaps even impossible, especially 25 or so years afterward.\"  Rosenberg was especially critical of the movie's \"preachy, smugly self-righteous ending.\".<ref>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-feb-07-ca-61798-story.html</ref> James Enderst of The Hartford Courant was particularly scathing, writing: \"The script is so stale, the plot so uninspired and the two hours so bereft of comedy ...

{"title_page": "Particle physics and representation theory", "text_new": "{{Short description|Connection between properties of elementary particles and mathematical structure of Lie groups and Lie algebras}}\n{{Lie groups |Physics}}\n\nThere is a natural connection between [[particle physics]] and [[representation theory]], as first noted in the 1930s by [[Eugene Wigner]].<ref>Wigner received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1963 \"for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\"; see also [[Wigner's theorem]], [[Wigner's classification]].</ref> It links the properties of [[elementary particle]]s to the structure of [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s. According to this connection, the different [[quantum state]]s of an elementary particle give rise to an [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]]. Moreover, the properties of the various particles, including their [[energy spectrum|spectra]], can be related to representations of Lie algebras, corresponding to \"approximate symmetries\" of the universe.\n\n== General picture ==\n===Symmetries of a quantum system===\n{{Main|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], any particular one-particle state is represented as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[Hilbert space]] <math>\\mathcal H</math>. To help understand what types of particles can exist, it is important to classify the possibilities for <math>\\mathcal H</math> allowed by [[Wigner's theorem#Symmetry transformations|symmetries]], and their properties. Let <math>\\mathcal H</math> be a Hilbert space describing a particular quantum system and let <math>G</math> be a group of symmetries of the quantum system. In a relativistic quantum system, for example, <math>G</math> might be the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], while for the hydrogen atom, <math>G</math> might be the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The particle state is more precisely characterized by the associated [[projective Hilbert space]] <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>, also called [[Wigner's theorem#Rays and ray space|ray space]], since two vectors that differ by a nonzero scalar factor correspond to the same physical [[quantum state]] represented by a ''ray'' in Hilbert space, which is an [[equivalence class]] in <math>\\mathcal H</math> and, under the natural projection map <math>\\mathcal H \\rightarrow \\mathrm P \\mathcal H</math>, an element of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>.\n\nBy definition of a symmetry of a quantum system, there is a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] on <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. For each <math>g\\in G</math>, there is a corresponding transformation <math>V(g)</math> of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. More specifically, if <math>g</math> is some symmetry of the system (say, rotation about the x-axis by 12\u00b0), then the corresponding transformation <math>V(g)</math> of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> is a map on ray space. For example, when rotating a ''stationary'' (zero momentum) spin-5 particle about its center, <math>g</math> is a rotation in 3D space (an element of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math>), while <math>V(g)</math> is an operator whose domain and range are each the space of possible quantum states of this particle, in this example the projective space <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> associated with an 11-dimensional complex Hilbert space <math>\\mathcal H</math>.\n\nEach map <math>V(g)</math> preserves, by definition of symmetry, the [[Wigner's theorem#Symmetry transformations|ray product]] on <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> induced by the inner product on <math>\\mathcal H</math>; according to [[Wigner's theorem]], this transformation of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> comes from a unitary or anti-unitary transformation <math>U(g)</math> of <math>\\mathcal H</math>. Note, however, that the <math>U(g)</math> associated to a given <math>V(g)</math> is not unique, but only unique ''up to a phase factor''. The composition of the operators <math>U(g)</math> should, therefore, reflect the composition law in <math>G</math>, but only up to a phase factor:\n\n:<math>U(gh)=e^{i\\theta}U(g)U(h)</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> will depend on <math>g</math> and <math>h</math>. Thus, the map sending <math>g</math> to <math>U(g)</math> is a [[projective representation|''projective unitary representation'']] of <math>G</math>, or possibly a mixture of unitary and anti-unitary, if <math>G</math> is disconnected. In practice, anti-unitary operators are always associated with [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Ordinary versus projective representations===\n\nIt is important physically that in general <math>U(\\cdot)</math> does not have to be an ordinary representation of <math>G</math>; it may not be possible to choose the phase factors in the definition of <math>U(g)</math> to eliminate the phase factors in their composition law. An electron, for example, is a spin-one-half particle; its Hilbert space consists of wave functions on <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> with values in a two-dimensional spinor space. The action of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math> on the spinor space is only projective: It does not come from an ordinary representation of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math>. There is, however, an associated ordinary representation of the universal cover <math>\\mathrm{SU(2)}</math> of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math> on spinor space. <ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 4.7</ref>\n\nFor many interesting classes of groups <math>G</math>, [[Projective representation#Infinite-dimensional projective unitary representations: Bargmann's theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] tells us that every projective unitary representation of <math>G</math> comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover <math>\\tilde{G}</math> of <math>G</math>. Actually, if <math>\\mathcal H</math> is finite dimensional, then regardless of the group <math>G</math>, every projective unitary representation of <math>G</math> comes from an ordinary unitary representation of <math>\\tilde{G}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 16.47</ref> If <math>\\mathcal H</math> is infinite dimensional, then to obtain the desired conclusion, some algebraic assumptions must be made on <math>G</math> (see below). In this setting the result is a [[Projective_representation#Bargmann's_theorem_on_infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations|theorem of Bargmann]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bargmann | first1 = V. | year = 1954 | title = On unitary ray representations of continuous groups | url = | journal = Ann. of Math. | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1\u201346 | doi=10.2307/1969831}}</ref> Fortunately, in the crucial case of the Poincar\u00e9 group, Bargmann's theorem applies.<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|1995}} Chapter 2, Appendix A and B.</ref> (See [[Wigner's classification]] of the representations of the universal cover of the Poincar\u00e9 group.)\n\nThe requirement referred to above is that the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> does not admit a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension. This is the case if and only if the [[Lie algebra extension#second cohomology group|second cohomology group]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is trivial. In this case, it may still be true that the group admits a central extension by a ''discrete'' group. But extensions of <math>G</math> by discrete groups are covers of <math>G</math>. For instance, the universal cover <math>\\tilde G</math> is related to <math>G</math> through the quotient <math>G \\approx \\tilde G/\\Gamma</math> with the central subgroup <math>\\Gamma</math> being the center of <math>\\tilde G</math> itself, isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] of the covered group.\n\nThus, in favorable cases, the quantum system will carry a unitary representation of the universal cover <math>\\tilde{G}</math> of the symmetry group <math>G</math>. This is desirable because <math>\\mathcal H</math> is much easier to work with than the non-vector space <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. If the representations of <math>\\tilde{G}</math> can be classified, much more information about the possibilities and properties of <math>\\mathcal H</math> are available.\n\n===The Heisenberg case===\nAn example in which Bargmann's theorem does not apply comes from a quantum particle moving in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>. The group of translational symmetries of the associated phase space, <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, is the commutative group <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. In the usual quantum mechanical picture, the <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math> symmetry is not implement by a unitary representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. After all, in the quantum setting, translations in position space and translations in momentum space do not commute. This failure to commute reflects the failure of the position and momentum operators\u2014which are the infinitesimal generators of translations in momentum space and position space, respectively\u2014to commute. Nevertheless, translations in position space and translations in momentum space ''do'' commute up to a phase factor. Thus, we have a well-defined projective representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, but it does not come from an ordinary representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, even though <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math> is simply connected. \n\nIn this case, to obtain an ordinary representation, one has to pass to the [[Heisenberg group]], which is a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>.\n\n== Poincar\u00e9 group ==\n{{main|Wigner's classification}}\n\nThe group of translations and [[Lorentz transformations]] form the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], and this group should be a symmetry of a relativistic quantum system (neglecting [[general relativity]] effects, or in other words, in [[flat space]]). [[Representation theory of the Poincar\u00e9 group|Representations of the Poincar\u00e9 group]] are in many cases characterized by a nonnegative [[mass]] and a half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (see [[Wigner's classification]]); this can be thought of as the reason that particles have quantized spin. (Note that there are in fact other possible representations, such as [[tachyon]]s, [[infraparticle]]s, etc., which in some cases do not have quantized spin or fixed mass.)\n\n== Other symmetries ==\n[[File:Standard Model charges.svg|300px|right|thumb|The pattern of [[weak isospin]]s, [[weak hypercharge]]s, and [[color charge|color]] charges (weights) of all known elementary particles in the [[Standard Model]], rotated by the [[weak mixing angle]] to show electric charge roughly along the vertical.]]\n\nWhile the [[spacetime symmetries]] in the Poincar\u00e9 group are particularly easy to visualize and believe, there are also other types of symmetries, called [[internal symmetry|internal symmetries]]. One example is [[color charge|color]] [[SU(3)]], an exact symmetry corresponding to the continuous interchange of the three [[quark]] colors.\n\n==Lie algebras versus Lie groups==\nMany (but not all) symmetries or approximate symmetries form [[Lie groups]]. Rather than study the [[Representation theory#Lie groups|representation theory]] of these Lie groups, it is often preferable to study the closely related [[Representation theory#Lie algebras|representation theory]] of the corresponding Lie algebras, which are usually simpler to compute.\n\nNow, representations of the Lie algebra correspond to representations of the [[Covering group|universal cover]] of the original group.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 5.7</ref> In the [[Projective_representation#Finite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations|finite-dimensional case]]\u2014and the infinite-dimensional case, provided that [[Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] applies\u2014irreducible projective representations of the original group correspond to ordinary unitary representations of the universal cover. In those cases, computing at the Lie algebra level is appropriate. This is the case, notably, for studying the irreducible projective representations of the rotation group SO(3). These are in one-to-one correspondence with the ordinary representations of the [[Rotation group SO(3)#Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)|universal cover SU(2) of SO(3)]]. The representations of the SU(2) are then in one-to-one correspondence with the representations of its Lie algebra su(2), which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3). \n\nThus, to summarize, the irreducible projective representations of SO(3) are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible ordinary representations of its Lie algebra so(3). The two-dimensional \"spin 1/2\" representation of the Lie algebra so(3), for example, does not correspond to an ordinary (single-valued) representation of the group SO(3). (This fact is the origin of statements to the effect that \"if you rotate the wave function of an electron by 360 degrees, you get the negative of the original wave function.\") Nevertheless, the spin 1/2 representation does give rise to a well-defined ''projective'' representation of SO(3), which is all that is required physically.\n\n== Approximate symmetries ==\nAlthough the above symmetries are believed to be exact, other symmetries are only approximate.\n\n===Hypothetical example===\nAs an example of what an approximate symmetry means, suppose an experimentalist lived inside an infinite [[ferromagnet]], with magnetization in some particular direction. The experimentalist in this situation would find not one but two distinct types of electrons: one with spin along the direction of the magnetization, with a slightly lower energy (and consequently, a lower mass), and one with spin anti-aligned, with a higher mass. Our usual [[SO(3)]] rotational symmetry, which ordinarily connects the spin-up electron with the spin-down electron, has in this hypothetical case become only an ''approximate'' symmetry, relating ''different types of particles'' to each other.\n\n===General definition===\nIn general, an approximate symmetry arises when there are very strong interactions that obey that symmetry, along with weaker interactions that do not. In the electron example above, the two \"types\" of electrons behave identically under the [[strong force|strong]] and [[weak force]]s, but differently under the [[electromagnetic force]].\n\n===Example: isospin symmetry===\n{{main|Isospin}}\nAn example from the real world is [[isospin|isospin symmetry]], an [[SU(2)]] group corresponding to the similarity between [[up quark]]s and [[down quark]]s. This is an approximate symmetry: While up and down quarks are identical in how they interact under the [[strong force]], they have different masses and different electroweak interactions. Mathematically, there is an abstract two-dimensional vector space\n:<math>\\text{up quark} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad \\text{down quark} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nand the laws of physics are ''approximately'' invariant under applying a determinant-1 [[unitary transformation]] to this space:<ref name=Thomson>[http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~thomson/partIIIparticles/handouts/Handout_7_2011.pdf Lecture notes by Prof. Mark Thomson]</ref>\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto A \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\text{where } A \\text{ is in } SU(2)</math>\nFor example, <math>A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0&1 \\\\ -1&0 \\end{pmatrix}</math> would turn all up quarks in the universe into down quarks and vice versa. Some examples help clarify the possible effects of these transformations:\n*When these unitary transformations are applied to a [[proton]], it can be transformed into a [[neutron]], or into a superposition of a proton and neutron, but not into any other particles. Therefore, the transformations move the proton around a two-dimensional space of quantum states. The proton and neutron are called an \"[[isospin multiplet|isospin doublet]]\", mathematically analogous to how a [[spin-\u00bd]] particle behaves under ordinary rotation.\n*When these unitary transformations are applied to any of the three [[pion]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Pion-}}), it can change any of the pions into any other, but not into any non-pion particle. Therefore, the transformations move the pions around a three-dimensional space of quantum states. The pions are called an \"[[isospin multiplet|isospin triplet]]\", mathematically analogous to how a spin-1 particle behaves under ordinary rotation.\n*These transformations have no effect at all on an [[electron]], because it contains neither up nor down quarks. The electron is called an isospin singlet, mathematically analogous to how a spin-0 particle behaves under ordinary rotation.\n\nIn general, particles form [[isospin multiplet]]s, which correspond to irreducible representations of the [[Special unitary group#Lie algebra|Lie algebra SU(2)]]. Particles in an isospin multiplet have very similar but not identical masses, because the up and down quarks are very similar but not identical.\n\n===Example: flavour symmetry===\n{{main|eightfold way (physics)}}\n\nIsospin symmetry can be generalized to [[flavour symmetry]], an [[SU(3)]] group corresponding to the similarity between [[up quark]]s, [[down quark]]s, and [[strange quark]]s.<ref name=Thomson/> This is, again, an approximate symmetry, violated by quark mass differences and electroweak interactions\u2014in fact, it is a poorer approximation than isospin, because of the strange quark's noticeably higher mass.\n\nNevertheless, particles can indeed be neatly divided into groups that form irreducible representations of the [[Special unitary group#Lie algebra|Lie algebra SU(3)]], as first noted by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and independently by [[Yuval Ne'eman]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Charge (physics)]]\n*[[Representation theory]]:\n**[[Representation theory#Lie algebras|Of Lie algebras]]\n**[[Representation theory#Lie groups|Of Lie groups]]\n*[[Projective representation]]\n*[[Special unitary group]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Coleman, Sidney (1985) ''Aspects of Symmetry: Selected Erice Lectures of Sidney Coleman''.

According to this connection, the different [[quantum state]]s of an elementary particle give rise to an [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]]. Moreover, the properties of the various particles, including their [[energy spectrum|spectra]], can be related to representations of Lie algebras, corresponding to \"approximate symmetries\" of the universe.\n\n== General picture ==\n===Symmetries of a quantum system===\n{{Main|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], any particular one-particle state is represented as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[Hilbert space]] <math>\\mathcal H</math>. To help understand what types of particles can exist, it is important to classify the possibilities for <math>\\mathcal H</math> allowed by [[Wigner's theorem#Symmetry transformations|symmetries]], and their properties. In a relativistic quantum system, for example, <math>G</math> might be the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], while for the hydrogen atom, <math>G</math> might be the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The particle state is more precisely characterized by the associated [[projective Hilbert space]] <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>, also called [[Wigner's theorem#Rays and ray space|ray space]], since two vectors that differ by a nonzero scalar factor correspond to the same physical [[quantum state]] represented by a ''ray'' in Hilbert space, which is an [[equivalence class]] in <math>\\mathcal H</math> and, under the natural projection map <math>\\mathcal H \\rightarrow \\mathrm P \\mathcal H</math>, an element of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>.\n\nLet <math>\\mathcal H</math> be a Hilbert space describing a particular quantum system and let <math>G</math> be a group of symmetries of the quantum system. By definition of a symmetry of a quantum system, there is a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] on <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. For each <math>g\\in G</math>, there is a corresponding transformation <math>V(g)</math> of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. More specifically, if <math>g</math> is some symmetry of the system (say, rotation about the x-axis by 12\u00b0), then the corresponding transformation <math>V(g)</math> of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> is a map on ray space. For example, when rotating a ''stationary'' (zero momentum) spin-5 particle about its center, <math>g</math> is a rotation in 3D space (an element of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math>), while <math>V(g)</math> is an operator whose domain and range are each the space of possible quantum states of this particle, in this example the projective space <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> associated with an 11-dimensional complex Hilbert space <math>\\mathcal H</math>.\n\nEach map <math>V(g)</math> preserves, by definition of symmetry, the [[Wigner's theorem#Symmetry transformations|ray product]] on <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> induced by the inner product on <math>\\mathcal H</math>; according to [[Wigner's theorem]], this transformation of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> comes from a unitary or anti-unitary transformation <math>U(g)</math> of <math>\\mathcal H</math>. Note, however, that the <math>U(g)</math> associated to a given <math>V(g)</math> is not unique, but only unique ''up to a phase factor''. The composition of the operators <math>U(g)</math> should, therefore, reflect the composition law in <math>G</math>, but only up to a phase factor:\n\n:<math>U(gh)=e^{i\\theta}U(g)U(h)</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> will depend on <math>g</math> and <math>h</math>. Thus, the map sending <math>g</math> to <math>U(g)</math> is a [[projective representation|''projective unitary representation'']] of <math>G</math>, or possibly a mixture of unitary and anti-unitary, if <math>G</math> is disconnected. In practice, anti-unitary operators are always associated with [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Ordinary versus projective representations===\n\nIt is important physically that in general <math>U(\\cdot)</math> does not have to be an ordinary representation of <math>G</math>; it may not be possible to choose the phase factors in the definition of <math>U(g)</math> to eliminate the phase factors in their composition law. An electron, for example, is a spin-one-half particle; its Hilbert space consists of wave functions on <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> with values in a two-dimensional spinor space. The action of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math> on the spinor space is only projective: It does not come from an ordinary representation of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math>. There is, however, an associated ordinary representation of the universal cover <math>\\mathrm{SU(2)}</math> of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math> on spinor space. <ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 4.7</ref>\n\nFor many interesting classes of groups <math>G</math>, [[Projective representation#Infinite-dimensional projective unitary representations: Bargmann's theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] tells us that every projective unitary representation of <math>G</math> comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover <math>\\tilde{G}</math> of <math>G</math>. Actually, if <math>\\mathcal H</math> is finite dimensional, then regardless of the group <math>G</math>, every projective unitary representation of <math>G</math> comes from an ordinary unitary representation of <math>\\tilde{G}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 16.47</ref> If <math>\\mathcal H</math> is infinite dimensional, then to obtain the desired conclusion, some algebraic assumptions must be made on <math>G</math> (see below). In this setting the result is a [[Projective_representation#Bargmann's_theorem_on_infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations|theorem of Bargmann]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bargmann | first1 = V. | year = 1954 | title = On unitary ray representations of continuous groups | url = | journal = Ann. of Math. | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1\u201346 | doi=10.2307/1969831}}</ref> Fortunately, in the crucial case of the Poincar\u00e9 group, Bargmann's theorem applies.<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|1995}} Chapter 2, Appendix A and B.</ref> (See [[Wigner's classification]] of the representations of the universal cover of the Poincar\u00e9 group.)\n\nThe requirement referred to above is that the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> does not admit a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension. This is the case if and only if the [[Lie algebra extension#second cohomology group|second cohomology group]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is trivial. In this case, it may still be true that the group admits a central extension by a ''discrete'' group. But extensions of <math>G</math> by discrete groups are covers of <math>G</math>. For instance, the universal cover <math>\\tilde G</math> is related to <math>G</math> through the quotient <math>G \\approx \\tilde G/\\Gamma</math> with the central subgroup <math>\\Gamma</math> being the center of <math>\\tilde G</math> itself, isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] of the covered group.\n\nThus, in favorable cases, the quantum system will carry a unitary representation of the universal cover <math>\\tilde{G}</math> of the symmetry group <math>G</math>. This is desirable because <math>\\mathcal H</math> is much easier to work with than the non-vector space <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. If the representations of <math>\\tilde{G}</math> can be classified, much more information about the possibilities and properties of <math>\\mathcal H</math> are available.\n\n===The Heisenberg case===\nAn example in which Bargmann's theorem does not apply comes from a quantum particle moving in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>. The group of translational symmetries of the associated phase space, <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, is the commutative group <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. In the usual quantum mechanical picture, the <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math> symmetry is not implement by a unitary representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. After all, in the quantum setting, translations in position space and translations in momentum space do not commute. This failure to commute reflects the failure of the position and momentum operators\u2014which are the infinitesimal generators of translations in momentum space and position space, respectively\u2014to commute. Nevertheless, translations in position space and translations in momentum space ''do'' commute up to a phase factor. Thus, we have a well-defined projective representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, but it does not come from an ordinary representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, even though <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math> is simply connected. \n\nIn this case, to obtain an ordinary representation, one has to pass to the [[Heisenberg group]], which is a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>.\n\n== Poincar\u00e9 group ==\n{{main|Wigner's classification}}\n\nThe group of translations and [[Lorentz transformations]] form the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], and this group should be a symmetry of a relativistic quantum system (neglecting [[general relativity]] effects, or in other words, in [[flat space]]). [[Representation theory of the Poincar\u00e9 group|Representations of the Poincar\u00e9 group]] are in many cases characterized by a nonnegative [[mass]] and a half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (see [[Wigner's classification]]); this can be thought of as the reason that particles have quantized spin. (Note that there are in fact other possible representations, such as [[tachyon]]s, [[infraparticle]]s, etc., which in some cases do not have quantized spin or fixed mass.)\n\n== Other symmetries ==\n[[File:Standard Model charges.svg|300px|right|thumb|The pattern of [[weak isospin]]s, [[weak hypercharge]]s, and [[color charge|color]] charges (weights) of all known elementary particles in the [[Standard Model]], rotated by the [[weak mixing angle]] to show electric charge roughly along the vertical.]]\n\nWhile the [[spacetime symmetries]] in the Poincar\u00e9 group are particularly easy to visualize and believe, there are also other types of symmetries, called [[internal symmetry|internal symmetries]]. One example is [[color charge|color]] [[SU(3)]], an exact symmetry corresponding to the continuous interchange of the three [[quark]] colors.\n\n==Lie algebras versus Lie groups==\nMany (but not all) symmetries or approximate symmetries form [[Lie groups]]. Rather than study the [[Representation theory#Lie groups|representation theory]] of these Lie groups, it is often preferable to study the closely related [[Representation theory#Lie algebras|representation theory]] of the corresponding Lie algebras, which are usually simpler to compute.\n\nNow, representations of the Lie algebra correspond to representations of the [[Covering group|universal cover]] of the original group.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 5.7</ref> In the [[Projective_representation#Finite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations|finite-dimensional case]]\u2014and the infinite-dimensional case, provided that [[Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] applies\u2014irreducible projective representations of the original group correspond to ordinary unitary representations of the universal cover. In those cases, computing at the Lie algebra level is appropriate. This is the case, notably, for studying the irreducible projective representations of the rotation group SO(3). These are in one-to-one correspondence with the ordinary representations of the [[Rotation group SO(3)#Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)|universal cover SU(2) of SO(3)]]. The representations of the SU(2) are then in one-to-one correspondence with the representations of its Lie algebra su(2), which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3). \n\nThus, to summarize, the irreducible projective representations of SO(3) are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible ordinary representations of its Lie algebra so(3). The two-dimensional \"spin 1/2\" representation of the Lie algebra so(3), for example, does not correspond to an ordinary (single-valued) representation of the group SO(3). (This fact is the origin of statements to the effect that \"if you rotate the wave function of an electron by 360 degrees, you get the negative of the original wave function.\") Nevertheless, the spin 1/2 representation does give rise to a well-defined ''projective'' representation of SO(3), which is all that is required physically.\n\n== Approximate symmetries ==\nAlthough the above symmetries are believed to be exact, other symmetries are only approximate.\n\n===Hypothetical example===\nAs an example of what an approximate symmetry means, suppose an experimentalist lived inside an infinite [[ferromagnet]], with magnetization in some particular direction.
