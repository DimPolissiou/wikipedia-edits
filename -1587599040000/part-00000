The characters were turned into plush [[teddy bear]]s in 1983, and soon after appeared in the TV specials ''[[The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings]]'' and ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]''. They appeared in a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]] from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987).\n\nEach Care Bear is a different color and has a special \"belly badge\" that represents its personality.  Adding to the Care Bear family are the \"Care Bear Cousins\", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, lamb, dog, cat, and horse created in the same style as the Care Bears.\n\nIn 2002, new versions of the bears were manufactured by Play-Along Toys; these new Care Bears appeared in three [[Computer animation|computer animated]] films: ''[[Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot]]'' (2004), ''[[The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie]]'' (2005), and ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' (2007).\n\nA revival TV series titled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]'' aired on [[Discovery Family#As The Hub/Hub Network (2010\u20132014)|The Hub]] in 2012 for one season; a continuation with the same characters, ''Care Bears and Cousins'', was commissioned by [[Netflix]] and premiered in 2015. That year, toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figurines, and blind bag collectibles) based on the series. Kacee loves beavers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Development===\nThe Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of American Greetings. [[Jack Chojnacki]], the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear, to businessmen from American Greeting Cards and from the toy company [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: \"It had a high aaaaaah factor.\"<ref name=aaah>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rfEPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mIwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3720,590789&dq=care+bears+movie&hl=en |last=Connelly |first=Sherryl |agency=[[New York Daily News]] |title=High 'aaah\" factor has meant millions |date=April 2, 1985 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=[[Boca Raton News]] |page=4B}}</ref>\n\nArtist [[Muriel Fahrion]], who helped create [[Strawberry Shortcake]]'s look, was also among the franchise's first concept artists.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXBZAAAAMAAJ&q=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears&dq=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears |author1=Ligue fran\u00e7aise de l'enseignement et de l'\u00e9ducation permanente |author2=Union fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres la\u00efques d'\u00e9ducation par l'image et le son |title=La Revue du cin\u00e9ma |volume=418 |chapter=Les Bisounours (The Care Bears Movie) |language=French |page=26 |year=1986 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Ligue fran\u00e7aise de l'enseignement et de l'\u00e9ducation permanente |quote=Scn. : Peter Sauder, d'apr\u00e8s les personnages cr\u00e9\u00e9s pour Those Characters from Cleveland par Linda Edwards, Muriel Fahrion, Elena Kucharik, Dave Polter, Tom Schneider, Ralph Shaffer, Clark Willey.}}</ref> Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Fabrion designed the first six bears, creating greeting card themes for their belly graphics.

Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (the home of the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to them as \"the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents{{sic}} of what we used to know as [[guardian angel]]s: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen.\n\nAccompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot.\n\nThe 10 original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.\n\nFor the 2007 TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the TV series. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the film, Oopsy Bear, a Care Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.\n\nSome elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of [[King Arthur]]. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary [[Camelot]] castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, [[Sir Lancelot]]'s name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.<ref name=cbsite />\n\nThroughout the films and various TV series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC TV series, they battled against [[Professor Coldheart]], his assistant [[Frostbite (Care Bears)|Frostbite]], and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced the wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant [[Beastly (Care Bears)|Beastly]], and his ill-tempered niece [[Shreeky]], and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the films, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', [[Dark Heart (Care Bears)|Dark Heart]] in ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'', The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim and Dum in ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', and the Rat King and the Evil Vizier in ''Care Bears Nutcracker Suite''. Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the film ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'', while ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persist into the TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''.\n\n===Magic spells===\nThe Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the \"Care Bear Stare\", in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the tummy being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Care Bears and/or Care Bear Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The films ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' do not feature the Care Bear Stare, but it does return in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]''. In the new TV series, ''Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot'', the Care Bear Stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates.\n\nIn the original animated specials and the DiC TV series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears...prepare to stare!\" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears Countdown!\"\n\nAlthough commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC TV series to cure Care Bears and humans who were under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in ''Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot'', when it was used to temporarily cheer up Grumpy Bear in the episode \"Tell-Tale Tummy\".\n\nIn addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their tummy symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges, and sending out a distress signal.\n\nUsually a tummy symbol\u2019s power is initiated by will, but in ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', a Care Bear has to rub their tummy in order to activate it. By ''Welcome to Care-a-lot'', the belly badges activate by will once again, though the bears may rub their belly to activate it on occasion.\n\n===Caring Meter===\nShown prominently in most of the ''Care Bears'' films and original TV series, the Caring Meter (renamed the Care-O-Meter in ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'') is typically in the center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the films and original TV series, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'', the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Care Bears or Care Bear Cousins see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on \"caring missions\" to try to get more people to care or for the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as [[thunderstorms]], buildings and rainbows crumbling, or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white. If the meter were to reach all the way to zero, then Care-a-lot would be gone forever, along with everyone and everything in it.\n\n==Merchandise==\nApart from toys, books, greeting cards, and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in [[merchandising]] as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods.<ref name=\"cbfaq\" /> During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and [[Spencer Gifts]].<ref name=\"cbfaq\" />\n\nWhen the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two Care Bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.<ref name=\"cbsite\" />\n\nIn his 1986 essay, ''The Shortcake Strategy'', Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as \"highly specialized\" toys. \"So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality\", he stated. \"Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit.\"<ref name=pantheon>{{cite book|last=Engelhardt |first=Tom |editor1-last=Gitlin |editor1-first=Todd |title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture |chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy |page=[https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/98 98] |isbn=0-394-74651-1 |year=1986 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]]) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/98 }}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n{{Main|List of Care Bears books}}\nMany children's books have been based on, and featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include ''Meet the Care Bear Cousins'', ''Sweet Dreams for Sally'', ''The Witch Down the Street'', ''The Trouble with Timothy'', and ''A Sister for Sam''. All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s.<ref name=\"cbhistory\" /> As of 2006, [[Scholastic Press]] has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the Bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the Bears in the past.\n\nIn ''Playing by Different Rules'', a 1988 book chronicling the [[Parker Brothers]]/[[General Mills]] merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) \"were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects\u2014and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?\"<ref name=rules>{{cite book |last=Wojahn |first=Ellen |title=Playing by Different Rules |chapter=Fold |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingbydiffere0000woja/page/217 217] |isbn=0-8144-5861-0 |year=1988 |publisher=American Management Association (amacom) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/playingbydiffere0000woja/page/217 }}</ref>\n\n==Comics==\nBetween November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]]; the books were drawn by [[DC Comics]] artist Howard Post.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Care Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover ''Care Bear Annual'' books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the U.S. comic series.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|List of Care Bears albums}}\nDuring the 1980s, [[Kid Stuff Records]] released several LPs based on the franchise. In 1983 five LPs were introduced: ''Introducing the Care Bears'', ''The Care Bears Care For You'', ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'', ''The Care Bears' Birthday Party'', and ''The Care Bears' Christmas''. In 1986 ''Friends Make Everything Better'' was released as a promotion with [[Novartis|Trianimic]] cough medicine. They also released the soundtrack albums for the first films. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during this time.<ref name=\"cbhistory\" />\n\nAll of the albums from 1983 (except for ''Birthday Party'') featured writing, production, and performance credits from [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]]. The soundtrack album from ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' featured songs by [[Carole King]] and [[John Sebastian]].\n\nIn the 2002 revival, [[Madacy Entertainment|Madacy Kids]] released a new Care Bear CDs.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 2004, ''Meet the Care Bears'', ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'', ''Care Bears Christmas Eve'', and the ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' soundtrack album was released.

They appeared in a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]] from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987).\n\nEach Care Bear is a different color and has a special \"belly badge\" that represents its personality.  Adding to the Care Bear family are the \"Care Bear Cousins\", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, lamb, dog, cat, and horse created in the same style as the Care Bears.\n\nIn 2002, new versions of the bears were manufactured by Play-Along Toys; these new Care Bears appeared in three [[Computer animation|computer animated]] films: ''[[Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot]]'' (2004), ''[[The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie]]'' (2005), and ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''

Also, Champ Bear's colors were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.\n\nDuring this revival Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Kmart]], [[Toys \"R\" Us]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[KB Toys]], and [[Mervyns]].<ref name=cbfaq>{{cite web |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307224518/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |archivedate=March 7, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings}}</ref> The new merchandise included the Bears doing [[aerobics]]; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304010508/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |title=New & Now |archivedate=March 4, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |url-status=dead }}</ref> Over 70 million {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Elizabeth |title=Care Bears Receive 'Gentle' Makeover |date=February 9, 2007 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |volume=249 |number=33 |page=B3}}</ref> In addition, [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] and subsidiary [[Family Home Entertainment|FHE Pictures]], in association with Nelvana, have made two direct-to-DVD computer-animated films, ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' in 2004 and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' in 2005.\n\nNew versions of the Care Bear Cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13 inch plush toys in the 2000s, and the Care Bear Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.\n\n===2007 relaunch===\nIn 2007, American Greetings, DIC AudioVisual, CBS and SD Entertainment relaunched the Care Bears again, first with a series of plush toys, then a new film, ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'', and a new TV series ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''. The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears smaller body structures and redesigned tummy symbols, which are now called belly badges.\n\nAs part of the franchise's 25th anniversary celebrations, the Bears were redesigned by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, as was the logo of the franchise. The line consists of fifteen of the thirty-nine bears (as seen in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'').

Also, the Care Bears have, up until the point of the first direct-to-DVD release for the new franchise (''Grizzle-ly Adventures''), never had humans visit Care-a-lot, and a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-lot and nothing else) was introduced.

Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (the home of the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to them as \"the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents{{sic}} of what we used to know as [[guardian angel]]s: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen.\n\nAccompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot.\n\nThe 10 original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.\n\nFor the 2007 TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the TV series. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the film, Oopsy Bear, a Care Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.\n\nSome elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of [[King Arthur]]. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary [[Camelot]] castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, [[Sir Lancelot]]'s name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.<ref name=cbsite />\n\nThroughout the films and various TV series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC TV series, they battled against [[Professor Coldheart]], his assistant [[Frostbite (Care Bears)|Frostbite]], and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced the wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant [[Beastly (Care Bears)|Beastly]], and his ill-tempered niece [[Shreeky]], and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the films, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', [[Dark Heart (Care Bears)|Dark Heart]] in ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'', The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim and Dum in ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', and the Rat King and the Evil Vizier in ''Care Bears Nutcracker Suite''. Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the film ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'', while ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persist into the TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''.\n\n===Magic spells===\nThe Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the \"Care Bear Stare\", in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the tummy being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Care Bears and/or Care Bear Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The films ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' do not feature the Care Bear Stare, but it does return in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]''. In the new TV series, ''Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot'', the Care Bear Stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates.\n\nIn the original animated specials and the DiC TV series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears...prepare to stare!\" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears Countdown!\"\n\nAlthough commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC TV series to cure Care Bears and humans who were under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in ''Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot'', when it was used to temporarily cheer up Grumpy Bear in the episode \"Tell-Tale Tummy\".\n\nIn addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their tummy symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges, and sending out a distress signal.\n\nUsually a tummy symbol\u2019s power is initiated by will, but in ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', a Care Bear has to rub their tummy in order to activate it. By ''Welcome to Care-a-lot'', the belly badges activate by will once again, though the bears may rub their belly to activate it on occasion.\n\n===Caring Meter===\nShown prominently in most of the ''Care Bears'' films and original TV series, the Caring Meter (renamed the Care-O-Meter in ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'') is typically in the center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the films and original TV series, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'', the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Care Bears or Care Bear Cousins see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on \"caring missions\" to try to get more people to care or for the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as [[thunderstorms]], buildings and rainbows crumbling, or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white. If the meter were to reach all the way to zero, then Care-a-lot would be gone forever, along with everyone and everything in it.\n\n==Merchandise==\nApart from toys, books, greeting cards, and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in [[merchandising]] as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods.<ref name=\"cbfaq\" /> During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and [[Spencer Gifts]].<ref name=\"cbfaq\" />\n\nWhen the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two Care Bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.<ref name=\"cbsite\" />\n\nIn his 1986 essay, ''The Shortcake Strategy'', Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as \"highly specialized\" toys. \"So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality\", he stated. \"Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit.\"<ref name=pantheon>{{cite book|last=Engelhardt |first=Tom |editor1-last=Gitlin |editor1-first=Todd |title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture |chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy |page=[https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/98 98] |isbn=0-394-74651-1 |year=1986 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]]) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/98 }}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n{{Main|List of Care Bears books}}\nMany children's books have been based on, and featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include ''Meet the Care Bear Cousins'', ''Sweet Dreams for Sally'', ''The Witch Down the Street'', ''The Trouble with Timothy'', and ''A Sister for Sam''. All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s.<ref name=\"cbhistory\" /> As of 2006, [[Scholastic Press]] has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the Bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the Bears in the past.\n\nIn ''Playing by Different Rules'', a 1988 book chronicling the [[Parker Brothers]]/[[General Mills]] merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) \"were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects\u2014and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?\"<ref name=rules>{{cite book |last=Wojahn |first=Ellen |title=Playing by Different Rules |chapter=Fold |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingbydiffere0000woja/page/217 217] |isbn=0-8144-5861-0 |year=1988 |publisher=American Management Association (amacom) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/playingbydiffere0000woja/page/217 }}</ref>\n\n==Comics==\nBetween November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]]; the books were drawn by [[DC Comics]] artist Howard Post.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Care Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover ''Care Bear Annual'' books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the U.S. comic series.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|List of Care Bears albums}}\nDuring the 1980s, [[Kid Stuff Records]] released several LPs based on the franchise. In 1983 five LPs were introduced: ''Introducing the Care Bears'', ''The Care Bears Care For You'', ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'', ''The Care Bears' Birthday Party'', and ''The Care Bears' Christmas''. In 1986 ''Friends Make Everything Better'' was released as a promotion with [[Novartis|Trianimic]] cough medicine. They also released the soundtrack albums for the first films. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during this time.<ref name=\"cbhistory\" />\n\nAll of the albums from 1983 (except for ''Birthday Party'') featured writing, production, and performance credits from [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]]. The soundtrack album from ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' featured songs by [[Carole King]] and [[John Sebastian]].\n\nIn the 2002 revival, [[Madacy Entertainment|Madacy Kids]] released a new Care Bear CDs.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 2004, ''Meet the Care Bears'', ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'', ''Care Bears Christmas Eve'', and the ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' soundtrack album was released.

A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, ''Let's Have a Ball!'' was released. In the same year they were featured in ''Care Bears: A Lesson in Caring'' for the [[V.Smile]] educational game console.\n\nIn 2005, they appeared in ''Catch a Star'' (also for the PC)<ref>{{cite news |title=Entertainment briefs column |date=October 15, 2005 |work=[[Ventura County Star]]}}</ref> and ''Care Bears: Care Quest'' (for the [[Game Boy Advance]]).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Teachers' Picks: Best New Tech |date=May 1, 2006 |journal=Scholastic Parent and Child |publisher=Scholastic Press |volume=13 |number=6 |page=20}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2008 a new game, ''Care Bears Play Day'', was released for the [[V.Smile]] Baby Infant Development System.\n\nA new interactive toy, ''Care Bears Share-A-Story'', was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a [[Teddy Ruxpin]]. The head, mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'', ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', and ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]''.

{"title_page": "Personal Storage Table", "text_new": "In [[computing]], a '''Personal Storage Table''' ('''.pst''') is an open proprietary file format used to store copies of messages, calendar events, and other items within [[Microsoft]] software such as [[Microsoft Exchange Client]], [[Windows Messaging]], and [[Microsoft Outlook]]. The open format is controlled by Microsoft who provide free specifications and free irrevocable technology licensing.\n\nThe file format may also be known as a '''Personal Folders (File)''' or '''Post Office File'''. When functioning in its capacity as a cache for Outlook's Cached Exchange Mode feature, it may be called an '''Off-line Storage Table''' ('''.ost''') or an '''Off-line Folders (File)'''.\n\n==Overview==\nIn [[Microsoft Exchange Server]], the messages, the calendar, and other data items are delivered to and stored on the [[Server (computing)|server]]. [[Microsoft Outlook]] stores these items in a personal-storage-table (.pst) or off-line-storage-table (.ost) files that are located on the local computer. Most commonly, the .pst files are used to store archived items and the .ost files to maintain off-line availability of the items. This is an essential feature of Microsoft Outlook. \n \nThe size of these files no longer counts against the size of the mailbox used; by moving files from a server mailbox to .pst files, users can free storage space on their mailservers.<ref name=\"Introduction\">{{cite web\n| url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HA012308901033.aspx#1b\n| title=Introduction to Personal Folders files (.pst)\n| publisher= Microsoft.com\n| accessdate=2008-10-04}}</ref> To use the .pst files from another location the user needs to be able to access the files directly over a network from his mail client.  While it is possible to open and use a .pst file from over a network, this is unsupported, and Microsoft advises against it, as .pst files are prone to corruption when used in this manner.<ref name=\"Personal folder files are unsupported over a LAN or WAN link\">{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/297019 | title=Personal folder files are unsupported over a LAN or WAN link| publisher=Microsoft.com}}</ref>\n\nBoth the .pst and .ost files use a fixed-block-based allocation scheme; the file is enlarged by a fixed amount of bytes, and the file internally maintains information about the allocated and non-allocated blocks.  So, when data files like email messages are added to a .pst file, its file size is automatically adjusted by the mail client (if necessary). When mail is deleted from a .pst file, the size of the .pst file will stay the same, marking the space as unallocated so that it will hold future data items. Recently removed data items can actually be recovered from .pst and .ost files.\n\nTo reduce the size of .pst files, the user needs to compact them.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Reduce-the-size-of-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-E4C6A4F1-D39C-47DC-A4FA-ABE96DC8C7EF\n| title=Reduce the size of a .pst file\n| publisher=Microsoft.com\n| accessdate=2015-10-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Data access ==\nPassword protection can be used to protect the content of the .pst files.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HA012308911033.aspx#2\n| title=Create a .pst file in Outlook 2003/Office Outlook 2007 format\n| publisher=Microsoft.com\n| accessdate=2008-10-04 }}</ref> However, Microsoft admits that the password adds very little protection, due to the existence of commonly available tools which can remove or simply bypass the password protection.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/143241\n| title=XCLN: Improving the Security of PST Files\n| publisher=Microsoft.com\n| accessdate=2009-08-12 }}</ref> The password to access the table is stored without the first and last XOR [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC-32]] integer representation of itself\nin the .pst file.

Coal is valued for its [[Energy value of coal|energy content]] and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. [[Steel]] and [[cement]] industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from [[iron ore]] and for cement production. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Africa]], a coal mine and its structures are a '''colliery''', a coal mine \u2013 a '''pit''', and the above-ground structures \u2013 a ''[[pit head]]''. In [[Australia]], \"colliery\" generally refers to an underground coal mine. In the [[United States]], \"colliery\" has been used{{when|reason=No clear timeframe specified, \"nowadays\" is also unclear.|date=October 2019}} to describe a coal mine operation, but this usage is less common today.\n\nCoal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large [[Open-pit mining|open cut]] and [[Longwall mining|long wall]] mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of [[Dragline excavator|draglines]], trucks, [[conveyor]]s, [[hydraulic jack]]s and shearers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of coal mining}}\n[[File:Boats hauling coal.jpg|thumb|Ships have been used to haul coal since Roman times.]]\nSmall-scale mining of surface deposits dates back thousands of years. For example, in [[Roman Britain]], the Romans were exploiting most of the major coalfields by the late 2nd century AD.<ref name = \"Smith 1997, 322\u2013324\">Smith, A. H. V. (1997): \"Provenance of Coals from Roman Sites in England and Wales\", ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia]]'', Vol. 28, pp. 297\u2013324 (322\u20134).</ref>\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded rapidly when coal-fed steam engines were built for the railways and steamships.\n\nUntil the late nineteenth-century coal was mined underground using a pick and shovel, and children were often employed underground in dangerous conditions.<ref>National Archives, UK. [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/lesson21.htm \"19th Century Mining Disaster.\"]</ref> Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s. By 1912, [[surface mining]] was conducted with [[steam shovel]]s designed for coal mining.\n\nMineworkers used rodents (mostly mice) and birds (canaries) underground to track the amount of concentrated carbon monoxide in the shafts. Small animals were more sensitive to danger. Miners kept an eye on mice, and any strange behaviors,  such as becoming lethargic or, on the contrary, making their way out of the shaft at the top speed, were a sign of coming troubles.<ref>Thomas Andrews \"Killing for Coal\" Harvard University Press(2008), pp. 129\u2013135</ref>\n\n==Methods of extraction==\nCoal extraction methods vary depending on whether the mine is an underground mine or a surface (also called open cast) mine. Additionally coal seam thickness and geology are factors in selection of a mining method. The most economical method of coal extraction for surface mines is the electric shovel or drag line. The most economical form of underground mining is the long wall, which is a shear blade that runs along sections of the coal seam.  Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a [[coal preparation plant]]. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; [[overburden]] characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; groundwater conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.<ref>[http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ \"Methods of Coal Mining\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318121002/http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ |date=18 March 2012 }} ''Great Mining'' (2003) accessed 19 December 2011</ref>\n\nSurface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden, and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately {{convert|180|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, are usually surface mined.\n\nCoal that occurs at depths of {{convert|180|to|300|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam {{convert|60|\u2013|90|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5|order=flip}}. Coals occurring below {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on||round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\">Christman, R.C., J. Haslbeck, B. Sedlik, W. Murray, and W. Wilson. 1980. ''Activities, effects and impacts of the coal fuel cycle for a 1,000-MWe electric power generating plant''. Washington, DC: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ref> However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to {{convert|1000|\u2013|1500|ft|m|abbr=off|-1|order=flip}} below ground level, for instance [[Tagebau Hambach]] in Germany.\n\n===Surface mining===\n[[File:Cerrejonmine1.png|thumb|right|Trucks loaded with coal at the [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] coal mine in [[Colombia]]]]\nWhen coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using [[open cut]] (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the [[stratum|strata]] may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\nMost open cast mines in the United States extract [[bituminous coal]]. In Canada (BC), Australia and South Africa, [[open cast mining]] is used for both [[thermal coal|thermal]] and [[metallurgical coal]]s. In [[New South Wales]] open casting for steam coal and [[anthracite]] is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\n====Strip mining====\nStrip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam. This earth to be removed is referred to as 'overburden' and is removed in long strips. The overburden from the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and referred to as out-of-pit dumping. Overburden from subsequent strips is deposited in the void left from mining the coal and overburden from the previous strip. This is referred to as in-pit dumping.\n\nIt is often necessary to fragment the overburden by use of explosives. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the overburden, filling the holes with explosives, and detonating the explosive. The overburden is then removed, using large earth-moving equipment, such as [[dragline]]s, [[Power shovel|shovel]] and trucks, [[excavator]] and trucks, or [[Bucket-wheel excavator|bucket-wheels]] and conveyors. This overburden is put into the previously mined (and now empty) strip. When all the overburden is removed, the\nunderlying coal seam will be exposed (a 'block' of coal). This block of coal may be drilled and blasted (if hard) or otherwise loaded onto trucks or conveyors for transport to the coal preparation (or wash) plant. Once this strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created next to it. This method is most suitable for areas with flat terrain.\n\nEquipment to be used depends on geological conditions. For example, to remove overburden that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator might be the most productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\">U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (1987). ''Surface coal mining reclamation: 10 years of progress, 1977\u20131987''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\n\n====Contour mining====\nThe contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, a variety of methods were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} wide is often intentionally left at the outer edge of the mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill.\n\nThe limitations of contour strip mining are both economic and technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, it may not be technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.\n\n====Mountaintop removal mining====\n{{Main|Mountaintop removal}}\nMountaintop coal mining is a surface mining practice involving removal of mountaintops to expose coal seams, and disposing of associated mining overburden in adjacent \"valley fills.\" Valley fills occur in steep terrain where there are limited disposal alternatives.\n\n[[Mountaintop removal]] combines area and contour strip mining methods. In areas with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring near the top of a ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts. Overburden is\ndeposited in nearby valleys and hollows. This method usually leaves the ridge and hilltops as flattened plateaus.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\"/> The process is highly controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice of\ncreating ''head-of-hollow-fills'', or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029154012/http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archivedate=2005-10-29|title=Mountain Justice Summer \u2013 What is Mountain Top Removal Mining?|date=29 October 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Philadelphia, PA (2005). [http://www.epa.gov/region3/mtntop/eis2005.htm \"Mountaintop mining/valley fills in Appalachia: Final programmatic environmental impact statement.\"]</ref>\n\nSpoil is placed at the head of a narrow, steep-sided valley or hollow. In preparation for filling this area, vegetation and soil are removed and a rock drain constructed down the middle of the area to be filled, where a natural drainage course previously existed. When the fill is completed, this underdrain will form a continuous water runoff system from the upper end of the valley to the lower end of the fill. Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced to create permanently stable slopes.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\"/>\n\n===Underground mining===\n{{Main|Underground mining (soft rock)}}\n[[File:Coal Washer.JPG|thumb|right|Coal wash plant in [[Clay County, Kentucky|Clay County]], [[Kentucky]]]]\nMost coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/> In deep mining, the [[room and pillar|room and pillar or bord and pillar]] method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or [[retreat mining]], is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.\n\nModern pillar sections use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, which can prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment have left a work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile roof supports leave an area.\n\n[[File:Continuous Miner.jpg|thumb|Remote Joy HM21 Continuous Miner used underground]]\nThere are six principal methods of underground mining:\n* [[Longwall mining]] accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\" />\n* [[Continuous mining]] utilizes a Continuous Miner Machine with a large rotating steel drum equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a \"room and pillar\" (also known as \"bord and pillar\") system&mdash;where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30-foot (5\u201310 m) \"rooms\" or work areas cut into the coalbed&mdash;it can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. [[Conveyor system|Conveyors]] transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|0}} (or a bit more with [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]] permission) (12 meters or roughly 40&nbsp;ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the \"continuous\" miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the \"continuous\" label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Room and pillar|Room and pillar mining]] consists of coal deposits that are mined by cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind in order to keep up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent of the ''in situ'' coal.

This process consists of a series of operations that begins with \u201ccutting\u201d the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Shortwall mining]], a method currently accounting for less than 1 percent of deep coal production, involves the use of a continuous mining machine with movable roof supports, similar to longwall.

Although there is some evidence of [[mine reclamation|reclamation]] of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of [[abandoned mined land]], which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface [[subsidence]] (6\u201312 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for [[Aquaculture in China|aquaculture]] ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no [[air pollution]] control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.\n\n===Colombia===\nSome of the world's largest coal reserves are located in South America, and an opencast mine at [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] in [[Colombia]] is one of the world's largest [[open pit]] mines.

Cerrej\u00f3n contributed about half of Colombia's coal exports of 52 million tons that year, with Colombia ranked sixth among major coal exporting nations. The company planned to expand production to 32 million tons by 2008. The company has its own 150&nbsp;km standard-gauge railroad, connecting the mine to its coal-loading terminal at Puerto Bol\u00edvar on the Caribbean coast. There are two 120-car unit trains, each carrying 12,000 tons of coal per trip. The round-trip time for each train, including loading and unloading, is about 12 hours. The coal facilities at the port are capable of loading 4,800 tons per hour onto vessels of up to 175,000 tons of dead weight. The mine, railroad and port\noperate 24 hours per day. Cerrej\u00f3n directly employs 4,600 workers, with a further 3,800 employed by contractors. The reserves at Cerrej\u00f3n are low-sulfur, low-ash, bituminous coal. The coal is mostly used for electric power generation, with some also used in [[steel]] manufacture. The surface mineable reserves for the current contract are 330 million tons. However, total proven reserves to a depth of 300 metres are 3,000 million tons.\n\nThe expansion of the Cerrej\u00f3n mine has been blamed for the forced displacement of local communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c04a21_55722707895847839433655205a851ff.pdf|title=DIGGING DEEPER: THE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS OF COAL IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|title=Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n y Responsabilidad Social: Una revisi\u00f3n independiente de los impactos y del objetivo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174624/http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|archive-date=15 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Ende Gel\u00e4nde 2017 CHB 23 (cropped).jpg|thumb|An [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] coal mine in the [[Rhineland]] lignite mining area ([[Germany]]).]]\nGermany has a long history of coal mining, going back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Coal mining greatly increased during the [[industrial revolution]] and the following decades. The main mining areas were around [[Aachen]], the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]] area, along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany.\nThese areas grew and were shaped by coal mining and coal processing, and this is still visible even after the end of the coal mining.\n\nCoal mining reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. After 1950, the coal producers started to struggle financially. In 1975, a subsidy was introduced (''Kohlepfennig''). In 2007, the [[Bundestag]] decided to end subsidies by 2018. As a consequence, [[RAG AG]], the owner of the two remaining coal mines in Germany, announced it would close all mines by 2018, thus ending coal mining in Germany.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|Jharia coal mine]]\n{{Main|Coal mining in India}}\nCoal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and [[Suetonius Grant Heatly]] of the [[East India Company]] in the [[Raniganj Coalfield]] along the Western bank of [[Damodar River]]. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Daikodo of Horonai Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|The Daik\u014dd\u014d, the first [[adit]] of the [[Hokutan Horonai coal mine|Horonai mine]], dug in 1879.]]\n{{Main|List of coal mines in Japan}}\n\nThe richest Japanese coal deposits have been found on [[Hokkaido]] and [[Kyushu]].\n\nJapan has a long history of coal mining dating back into the [[Sengoku period|Japanese Middle Ages]].

Coal is valued for its [[Energy value of coal|energy content]] and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. [[Steel]] and [[cement]] industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from [[iron ore]] and for cement production. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Africa]], a coal mine and its structures are a '''colliery''', a coal mine \u2013 a '''pit''', and the above-ground structures \u2013 a ''[[pit head]]''. In [[Australia]], \"colliery\" generally refers to an underground coal mine. In the [[United States]], \"colliery\" has been used{{when|reason=No clear timeframe specified, \"nowadays\" is also unclear.|date=October 2019}} to describe a coal mine operation, but this usage is less common today.\n\nCoal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large [[Open-pit mining|open cut]] and [[Longwall mining|long wall]] mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of [[Dragline excavator|draglines]], trucks, [[conveyor]]s, [[hydraulic jack]]s and shearers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of coal mining}}\n[[File:Boats hauling coal.jpg|thumb|Ships have been used to haul coal since Roman times.]]\nSmall-scale mining of surface deposits dates back thousands of years. For example, in [[Roman Britain]], the Romans were exploiting most of the major coalfields by the late 2nd century AD.<ref name = \"Smith 1997, 322\u2013324\">Smith, A. H. V. (1997): \"Provenance of Coals from Roman Sites in England and Wales\", ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia]]'', Vol. 28, pp. 297\u2013324 (322\u20134).</ref>\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded rapidly when coal-fed steam engines were built for the railways and steamships.\n\nUntil the late nineteenth-century coal was mined underground using a pick and shovel, and children were often employed underground in dangerous conditions.<ref>National Archives, UK. [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/lesson21.htm \"19th Century Mining Disaster.\"]</ref> Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s. By 1912, [[surface mining]] was conducted with [[steam shovel]]s designed for coal mining.\n\nMineworkers used rodents (mostly mice) and birds (canaries) underground to track the amount of concentrated carbon monoxide in the shafts. Small animals were more sensitive to danger. Miners kept an eye on mice, and any strange behaviors,  such as becoming lethargic or, on the contrary, making their way out of the shaft at the top speed, were a sign of coming troubles.<ref>Thomas Andrews \"Killing for Coal\" Harvard University Press(2008), pp. 129\u2013135</ref>\n\n==Methods of extraction==\nCoal extraction methods vary depending on whether the mine is an underground mine or a surface (also called open cast) mine. Additionally coal seam thickness and geology are factors in selection of a mining method. The most economical method of coal extraction for surface mines is the electric shovel or drag line. The most economical form of underground mining is the long wall, which is a shear blade that runs along sections of the coal seam.  Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a [[coal preparation plant]]. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; [[overburden]] characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; groundwater conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.<ref>[http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ \"Methods of Coal Mining\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318121002/http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ |date=18 March 2012 }} ''Great Mining'' (2003) accessed 19 December 2011</ref>\n\nSurface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden, and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately {{convert|180|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, are usually surface mined.\n\nCoal that occurs at depths of {{convert|180|to|300|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam {{convert|60|\u2013|90|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5|order=flip}}. Coals occurring below {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on||round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\">Christman, R.C., J. Haslbeck, B. Sedlik, W. Murray, and W. Wilson. 1980. ''Activities, effects and impacts of the coal fuel cycle for a 1,000-MWe electric power generating plant''. Washington, DC: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ref> However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to {{convert|1000|\u2013|1500|ft|m|abbr=off|-1|order=flip}} below ground level, for instance [[Tagebau Hambach]] in Germany.\n\n===Surface mining===\n[[File:Cerrejonmine1.png|thumb|right|Trucks loaded with coal at the [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] coal mine in [[Colombia]]]]\nWhen coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using [[open cut]] (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the [[stratum|strata]] may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\nMost open cast mines in the United States extract [[bituminous coal]]. In Canada (BC), Australia and South Africa, [[open cast mining]] is used for both [[thermal coal|thermal]] and [[metallurgical coal]]s. In [[New South Wales]] open casting for steam coal and [[anthracite]] is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\n====Strip mining====\nStrip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam. This earth to be removed is referred to as 'overburden' and is removed in long strips. The overburden from the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and referred to as out-of-pit dumping. Overburden from subsequent strips is deposited in the void left from mining the coal and overburden from the previous strip. This is referred to as in-pit dumping.\n\nIt is often necessary to fragment the overburden by use of explosives. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the overburden, filling the holes with explosives, and detonating the explosive. The overburden is then removed, using large earth-moving equipment, such as [[dragline]]s, [[Power shovel|shovel]] and trucks, [[excavator]] and trucks, or [[Bucket-wheel excavator|bucket-wheels]] and conveyors. This overburden is put into the previously mined (and now empty) strip. When all the overburden is removed, the\nunderlying coal seam will be exposed (a 'block' of coal). This block of coal may be drilled and blasted (if hard) or otherwise loaded onto trucks or conveyors for transport to the coal preparation (or wash) plant. Once this strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created next to it. This method is most suitable for areas with flat terrain.\n\nEquipment to be used depends on geological conditions. For example, to remove overburden that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator might be the most productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\">U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (1987). ''Surface coal mining reclamation: 10 years of progress, 1977\u20131987''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\n\n====Contour mining====\nThe contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, a variety of methods were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} wide is often intentionally left at the outer edge of the mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill.\n\nThe limitations of contour strip mining are both economic and technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, it may not be technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.\n\n====Mountaintop removal mining====\n{{Main|Mountaintop removal}}\nMountaintop coal mining is a surface mining practice involving removal of mountaintops to expose coal seams, and disposing of associated mining overburden in adjacent \"valley fills.\" Valley fills occur in steep terrain where there are limited disposal alternatives.\n\n[[Mountaintop removal]] combines area and contour strip mining methods. In areas with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring near the top of a ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts. Overburden is\ndeposited in nearby valleys and hollows. This method usually leaves the ridge and hilltops as flattened plateaus.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\"/> The process is highly controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice of\ncreating ''head-of-hollow-fills'', or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029154012/http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archivedate=2005-10-29|title=Mountain Justice Summer \u2013 What is Mountain Top Removal Mining?|date=29 October 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Philadelphia, PA (2005). [http://www.epa.gov/region3/mtntop/eis2005.htm \"Mountaintop mining/valley fills in Appalachia: Final programmatic environmental impact statement.\"]</ref>\n\nSpoil is placed at the head of a narrow, steep-sided valley or hollow. In preparation for filling this area, vegetation and soil are removed and a rock drain constructed down the middle of the area to be filled, where a natural drainage course previously existed. When the fill is completed, this underdrain will form a continuous water runoff system from the upper end of the valley to the lower end of the fill. Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced to create permanently stable slopes.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\"/>\n\n===Underground mining===\n{{Main|Underground mining (soft rock)}}\n[[File:Coal Washer.JPG|thumb|right|Coal wash plant in [[Clay County, Kentucky|Clay County]], [[Kentucky]]]]\nMost coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/> In deep mining, the [[room and pillar|room and pillar or bord and pillar]] method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or [[retreat mining]], is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.\n\nModern pillar sections use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, which can prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment have left a work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile roof supports leave an area.\n\n[[File:Continuous Miner.jpg|thumb|Remote Joy HM21 Continuous Miner used underground]]\nThere are six principal methods of underground mining:\n* [[Longwall mining]] accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\" />\n* [[Continuous mining]] utilizes a Continuous Miner Machine with a large rotating steel drum equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a \"room and pillar\" (also known as \"bord and pillar\") system&mdash;where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30-foot (5\u201310 m) \"rooms\" or work areas cut into the coalbed&mdash;it can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. [[Conveyor system|Conveyors]] transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|0}} (or a bit more with [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]] permission) (12 meters or roughly 40&nbsp;ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the \"continuous\" miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the \"continuous\" label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Room and pillar|Room and pillar mining]] consists of coal deposits that are mined by cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind in order to keep up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent of the ''in situ'' coal. However, this can be extracted at a later stage (''see'' [[retreat mining]]).<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\">{{cite web|title=Coal Mining.

This process consists of a series of operations that begins with \u201ccutting\u201d the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Shortwall mining]], a method currently accounting for less than 1 percent of deep coal production, involves the use of a continuous mining machine with movable roof supports, similar to longwall. The continuous miner shears coal panels {{convert|150|to|200|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5}} wide and more than a half-mile (1&nbsp;km) long, having regard to factors such as geological strata.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Retreat mining]] is a method in which the pillars or coal ribs used to hold up the mine roof are extracted; allowing the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance. This is one of the most dangerous forms of mining, owing to imperfect predictability of when the roof will collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Top 5 Coal Producing Countries.png|thumb|Coal production trends 1980\u20132012 in the top five coal-producing countries (US EIA)]]\n[[File:Coal mine in Inner Mongolia 002.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[China]]]]\n[[File:Loy Yang open cut brown coal mine and dredgers.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[Australia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Major coal producing regions}}\nCoal is mined commercially in over 50 countries.

In some mining countries black lung is still common, with 4,000 new cases of black lung every year in the US (4 percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.2 percent of workers).<ref>[http://www.abelard.org/briefings/fossil_fuel_disasters.php Abelard.org], \"Fossil fuel disasters\".</ref> The use of water sprays in mining equipment reduces the risk to miners' lungs.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacquelyn L.

Exposure to excessive noise can lead to [[noise-induced hearing loss]]. Hearing loss developed as a result of occupational exposures is coined [[occupational hearing loss]]. To protect miners' hearing, the US [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]'s (MSHA) guidelines for noise place a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for noise at 90 dBA time-weighted over 8 hours. A lower cutoff, 85 dBA, is set for a worker to fall into the MSHA Action Level which dictates that workers be placed into hearing conservation programs.\n\nNoise exposures vary depending on the method of extraction. For example, a study has found that among surface coal mine operations, dragline equipment produced the loudest sound at a range of 88\u2013112 dBA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=ER|date=April 2004|title=Worker exposure and equipment noise in large surface coal mines.|url=|journal=Min Eng|volume=56|pages=49\u201354|via=}}</ref> Within longwall sections, stageloaders used to transport coal from the mining face and shearers used for extraction represent some of the highest noise exposures.  Auxiliary fans (up to 120 dBA), continuous mining machines (up to 109 dBA), and roof bolters (up to 103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment within continuous mining sections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet1107.html|title=Summary of Longwall and Continuous Miner Section Noise Studies in Underground Coal Mines|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> Exposures to noise exceeding 90 dBA can lead to adverse effects on workers' hearing. The use of [[administrative controls]] and [[engineering controls]] can be used to reduce noise exposures.\n\n===Dangers from mining waste===\nIn the 1966 [[Aberfan disaster]] in Wales, a colliery [[spoil tip]] collapsed, engulfing a school and killing 116 children and 28 adults. Other accidents involving coal waste include the [[Martin County coal slurry spill]] (USA, 2000) and the [[Obed Mountain coal mine spill]] (Canada, 2013).\n\n===Safety Improvements===\n[[File:Make it Safer with Roof Screen.webm|thumb|A video on the use of roof screens in underground coal mines]]\nImprovements in mining methods (e.g. longwall mining), hazardous gas monitoring (such as [[safety-lamp]]s or more modern electronic gas monitors), gas drainage, [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|electrical equipment]], and ventilation have reduced many of the risks of rock falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with [[gas engines]].<ref>[http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/coal-gas/ Coal Gas Utilisation], www.clarke-energy.com</ref> Another innovation in recent years is the use of [[Self-contained self-rescue device|closed circuit escape respirator]]s, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/08/07/super-workplace/ |title = The Importance of Occupational Safety and Health: Making for a \"Super\" Workplace |date = 7 August 2013 |accessdate = 15 January 2015 |first1 = Jaclyn |last1 = Krah |first2 = Richard L. |last2 = Unger |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref> Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor's [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds.

''Permanent Regulatory Program Implementing Section 501(b) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977: Environmental Impact Statement''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of the Interior.</ref> This often results in a scarred landscape with no scenic value. Of greater concern, the movement, storage, and redistribution of soil during mining can disrupt the community of [[soil microbiology|soil microorganisms]] and consequently [[nutrient cycling]] processes. Rehabilitation or reclamation mitigates some of these concerns and is required by US Federal Law, specifically the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]].\n\nMine dumps ([[tailings]]) could produce [[acid mine drainage]] which can seep into [[waterways]] and [[aquifers]], with consequences on [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[human health]].\n\nIf underground mine tunnels collapse, they cause [[subsidence]] of the ground above. Subsidence can damage buildings, and disrupt the flow of streams and rivers by interfering with the natural [[drainage]].\n\nCoal production is a major contributor to [[global warming]]: burning coal generates large quantities of [[carbon dioxide]] and mining operations can release [[methane]], a known [[greenhouse gas]], into the atmosphere.

An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1595235,00.html \"Where The Coal Is Stained With Blood.\"] ''Time'', 2 March 2007.</ref> Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of [[mine reclamation|reclamation]] of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of [[abandoned mined land]], which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface [[subsidence]] (6\u201312 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for [[Aquaculture in China|aquaculture]] ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no [[air pollution]] control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.\n\n===Colombia===\nSome of the world's largest coal reserves are located in South America, and an opencast mine at [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] in [[Colombia]] is one of the world's largest [[open pit]] mines. Output of the mine in 2004 was 24.9 million tons (compared to total global hard coal production of 4,600 million tons). Cerrej\u00f3n contributed about half of Colombia's coal exports of 52 million tons that year, with Colombia ranked sixth among major coal exporting nations. The company planned to expand production to 32 million tons by 2008. The company has its own 150&nbsp;km standard-gauge railroad, connecting the mine to its coal-loading terminal at Puerto Bol\u00edvar on the Caribbean coast. There are two 120-car unit trains, each carrying 12,000 tons of coal per trip. The round-trip time for each train, including loading and unloading, is about 12 hours. The coal facilities at the port are capable of loading 4,800 tons per hour onto vessels of up to 175,000 tons of dead weight. The mine, railroad and port\noperate 24 hours per day. Cerrej\u00f3n directly employs 4,600 workers, with a further 3,800 employed by contractors. The reserves at Cerrej\u00f3n are low-sulfur, low-ash, bituminous coal. The coal is mostly used for electric power generation, with some also used in [[steel]] manufacture. The surface mineable reserves for the current contract are 330 million tons. However, total proven reserves to a depth of 300 metres are 3,000 million tons.\n\nThe expansion of the Cerrej\u00f3n mine has been blamed for the forced displacement of local communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c04a21_55722707895847839433655205a851ff.pdf|title=DIGGING DEEPER: THE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS OF COAL IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|title=Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n y Responsabilidad Social: Una revisi\u00f3n independiente de los impactos y del objetivo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174624/http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|archive-date=15 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Ende Gel\u00e4nde 2017 CHB 23 (cropped).jpg|thumb|An [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] coal mine in the [[Rhineland]] lignite mining area ([[Germany]]).]]\nGermany has a long history of coal mining, going back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Coal mining greatly increased during the [[industrial revolution]] and the following decades. The main mining areas were around [[Aachen]], the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]] area, along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany.\nThese areas grew and were shaped by coal mining and coal processing, and this is still visible even after the end of the coal mining.\n\nCoal mining reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. After 1950, the coal producers started to struggle financially. In 1975, a subsidy was introduced (''Kohlepfennig''). In 2007, the [[Bundestag]] decided to end subsidies by 2018. As a consequence, [[RAG AG]], the owner of the two remaining coal mines in Germany, announced it would close all mines by 2018, thus ending coal mining in Germany.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|Jharia coal mine]]\n{{Main|Coal mining in India}}\nCoal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and [[Suetonius Grant Heatly]] of the [[East India Company]] in the [[Raniganj Coalfield]] along the Western bank of [[Damodar River]]. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Daikodo of Horonai Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|The Daik\u014dd\u014d, the first [[adit]] of the [[Hokutan Horonai coal mine|Horonai mine]], dug in 1879.]]\n{{Main|List of coal mines in Japan}}\n\nThe richest Japanese coal deposits have been found on [[Hokkaido]] and [[Kyushu]].\n\nJapan has a long history of coal mining dating back into the [[Sengoku period|Japanese Middle Ages]].

In November 2011, he announced that he would not seek reelection when his current term ended in January 2013.\n\nIn 1998, Meeks led a movement to \"dry up\" Roseland Community by collecting votes to close 26 liquor stores. He also created a mentoring program called \"It Takes a Village\n\" which provides support and assistance to pregnant youth and young mothers.\n\nMeeks was also concerned with issues of housing affordability. He sponsored a bill which would make permanent a 2003 Executive Order that established a task force to develop Annual Comprehensive Housing Plans to address critical housing issues. The bill focuses its attention on vulnerable groups, including those at risk of homelessness and low income people with disabilities.\n\nAnother bill sponsored by Meeks addressed law enforcement and racial profiling. The bill would allow police departments to apply for grants to purchase cameras for police cars.

Meeks believes that this is a civil rights violation of the students and has demanded that the Illinois Attorney General look into the violation.

Leonard]], ''Baptists in America'', Columbia University Press, USA, 2005, p. 2</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 2002, Meeks became the first state senator to be elected as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]. He won re-election in 2006 as a Democrat. In November 2011, he announced that he would not seek reelection when his current term ended in January 2013.\n\nIn 1998, Meeks led a movement to \"dry up\" Roseland Community by collecting votes to close 26 liquor stores. He also created a mentoring program called \"It Takes a Village\n\" which provides support and assistance to pregnant youth and young mothers.\n\nMeeks was also concerned with issues of housing affordability. He sponsored a bill which would make permanent a 2003 Executive Order that established a task force to develop Annual Comprehensive Housing Plans to address critical housing issues. The bill focuses its attention on vulnerable groups, including those at risk of homelessness and low income people with disabilities.\n\nAnother bill sponsored by Meeks addressed law enforcement and racial profiling. The bill would allow police departments to apply for grants to purchase cameras for police cars. Meeks believes that cameras in police cars protects everyone involved in a traffic stop, arguing that it provides security for both the driver and the law enforcement officer, and that it may also help reduce instances of racial profiling.\n\nMeeks was the Chairperson of the Housing and Community Affairs Committee and Vice Chairperson of the Commerce and Economic Development Committee. Additionally, he was a member of the Senate Commerce; Appropriations I; Education; Higher Education; and Senate Education Funding Reform Committees.\n\nDuring his speech supporting the removal of [[Rod Blagojevich]] from office, Meeks reprised the governor's now-infamous quote about [[Barack Obama]]'s Senate seat, saying, \"We have this thing called impeachment and it's bleeping golden, and we've used it the right way.\"<ref>[http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2009/01/blagojevich-to-give-impeachment-speech-in-a-few-hours.html Senate removes Blagojevich from office].

The June 2006 findings of the Education Trust and Illinois Education Research Council showed that Chicago's worst schools are getting the worst teachers{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.  Meeks believes that this is a civil rights violation of the students and has demanded that the Illinois Attorney General look into the violation. Meeks and a large group of parents also marched on city hall to meet with Mayor Daley in hopes that he could change the teacher hiring system. Meeks came up with a proposal to solve the teacher inequalities; he says top-notch teachers should be offered a $25,000 signing bonus and an additional $5,000 a year for five years to work in failing schools.

The [[ZIP Code]] is 66442.\n\n==Namesake==\nFort Riley is named in honor of [[Major general|Major General]] [[Bennet C. Riley]], who led the first military escort along the [[Santa Fe Trail]]. The fort was established in 1853 as a military post to protect the movement of people and trade over the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], [[California Trail|California]], and Santa Fe trails. In the years after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Fort Riley served as a major United States Cavalry post and school for [[cavalry tactics]] and practice. The post was a base for skirmishes with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] after the Civil War ended in 1865, during which time [[George Armstrong Custer|George A. Custer]] was stationed at the fort.\n\n==United States Cavalry School==\nIn 1887, Fort Riley became the site of the United States Cavalry School. The famous all-black [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th]] Cavalry Regiments, the soldiers of which were called \"[[Buffalo Soldier]]s\", were stationed at Fort Riley at various times in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During [[World War I]], the fort was home to 50,000 soldiers, and it is sometimes identified as [[ground zero]] for the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish flu pandemic]], which its soldiers were said to have spread all over the world. Since the end of [[World War II]], various infantry divisions have been assigned there. Most notably, from 1955 to 1996 the post was home to the famed [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], also called \"Big Red One\". Between 1999\u20132006, the post was headquarters to the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) and known as \"America's Warfighting Center\". In August 2006, the Big Red One relocated its headquarters to Fort Riley from Leighton Barracks, [[Germany]].\n\nCamp Whitside is named in honor of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Samuel Whitside|Samuel M. Whitside]], who served as commander of Company B, [[6th Cavalry Regiment]], at Fort Riley, between the years of 1871 and 1874.\n\n== Stationed units ==\n1st Infantry Division<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riley.army.mil/Units/1stInfantryDivision.aspx|title=1st Infantry Division|author=|date=|website=www.riley.army.mil|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n* 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team\n* 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team\n* 1st Infantry Division Artillery (DIVARTY)\n* 1st Combat Aviation Brigade\n* 1st Sustainment Brigade\n* Division Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion\n\nGarrison<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riley.army.mil/Units/GarrisonCommand.aspx|title=Garrison Command|author=|date=|website=www.riley.army.mil|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n* 97th Military Police Battalion\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, U.S. Army Garrison\n\nPartners\n* 10th Air Support Operations Squadron, USAF\n* 407th Army Field Support Brigade\n* 902nd Military Intelligence Group\n* Det. 2, 3rd Weather Squadron, USAF\n* Irwin Army Community Hospital\n* Warrior Transition Battalion\n* [[1st Signal Command (United States)|1st Signal Command]], inactive 1969\n* 630th Ordnance Company (Explosive Ordnance Disposal)\n* 774th Ordnance Company (Explosive Ordnance Disposal)\n* 923rd Contracting Battalion\n*[[121st Signal Battalion (United States)]], inactivated 1995\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Kansas}}\n\n===Origins===\nThe early history of Fort Riley is closely tied to the movement of people and trade along the Oregon and Santa Fe trails. These routes, a result of then-popular United States doctrine of \"[[manifest destiny]]\" in the middle of the 19th century, prompted increased American military presence for the protection of American interests in this largely unsettled territory. During the 1850s, a number of military posts were established at strategic points to provide protection along these arteries of emigration and commerce.\n\n[[Image:Fort-Riley-Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Riley's former division headquarters and current garrison headquarters]]\nIn the fall of 1852, a surveying party under the command of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Robert H. Chilton]], [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st U.S. Dragoons]], selected the junction of the [[Republican River|Republican]] and [[Smoky Hill River]]s as a site for one of these forts. This location, approved by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in January 1853, offered an advantageous location from which to organize, train and equip troops in protecting the overland trails.\n\nSurveyors believed the location near the center of the United States and named the site, Camp Center. During the late spring, three companies of the 6th Infantry occupied the camp and began construction of temporary quarters.\n\nOn June 27, 1853, Camp Center became Fort Riley&nbsp;\u2014 named in honor of Maj. Gen. [[Bennet C. Riley]], who had led the first military escort along the Santa Fe Trail in 1829. The \"fort\" took shape around a broad plain that overlooked the Kansas River valley.\n\nThe fort's design followed the standard frontier post configuration: buildings were constructed of the most readily available material&nbsp;\u2014 in this case, native limestone.\n\nIn the spring, troops were dispatched to escort mail trains and protect travel routes across the plains. At the fort, additional buildings were constructed under the supervision of Capt. Edmund Ogden.\n\nAnticipating greater utilization of the post, [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized appropriations in the spring of 1855 to provide additional quarters and stables for the Dragoons. Ogden again marshaled resources and arrived from Leavenworth in July with 50 6-mule teams<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lowe|first1=Percival|title=Five Years a Dragoon|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0806110899|pages=144}}</ref> loaded with materials, craftsmen and laborers.\n\nWork had progressed for several weeks when [[cholera]] broke out among the workers. The epidemic lasted only a few days but claimed 70 lives, including Ogden's. Work gradually resumed and buildings were readied for the arrival in October of the 2nd Dragoons.\n\nAs the fort began to take shape, an issue soon to dominate the national scene was debated during the brief territorial legislative session which met at Pawnee in the present area of Camp Whitside, named for Col. [[Warren Whitside]].\n\nThe first territorial legislature met there in July 1855. Slavery was a fact of life and an issue within the garrison just as it was in the rest of the country. The seeds of sectional discord were emerging that would lead to \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" and, eventually, Civil War.\n\nIncreased tension and bloodshed between pro and anti-slavery settlers resulted in the use of the Army to \"police\" the troubled territory. They also continued to guard and patrol the Santa Fe Trail in 1859 and 1860 due to increased Indian threats.\n\nThe outbreak of hostilities between the North and South in 1861 disrupted garrison life. Regular units returned east to participate in the Civil War while militia units from Kansas and other states used Riley as a base from which to launch campaigns to show the flag and offer a degree of protection to trading caravans using the Santa Fe Trail. In the early stages of the war, the fort was used to confine Confederate prisoners.\n\n=== George A. Custer ===\nThe conclusion of the Civil War in 1865 witnessed Fort Riley again assuming an importance in providing protection to railroad lines being built across Kansas. Evidence of this occurred in the summer and fall of 1866 when the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]] was mustered-in at Riley and the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] reached the fort. Brevet Major General George A. Custer arrived in December to take charge of the new regiment. Soldiers from the Kansas Volunteer regiments, \"Jenison's Jayhawks\", that were wounded in the [[Battle of Westport]] were brought to Fort Riley for recovery.\n\nThe following spring, Custer and the 7th left Fort Riley to participate in a campaign on the high plains of western Kansas and eastern Colorado.\n\nThe campaign proved inconclusive but resulted in Custer's court martial and suspension from the Army for one year\u2014in part\u2014for returning to Fort Riley to see his wife without permission.\n\nAs the line of settlement extended westward each spring, the fort lost some of its importance. Larger concentrations of troops were stationed at [[Fort Larned National Historic Site|Fort Larned]] and [[Fort Hays]], where they spent the summer months on patrol and wintered in garrison.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1871, a school of light artillery was conducted at Fort Riley by the 4th Artillery Battery. Instruction was of a purely practical nature, and regular classes were not conducted. Critiques were delivered during or following the exercise. This short-lived school closed in March 1871 as the War Department imposed economy measures, which included cutting a private's monthly pay from $12 to $9.\n\nDuring the next decade, various regiments of the infantry and cavalry were garrisoned at Riley. The spring and summer months usually witnessed a skeletal complement at the fort while the remainder of the troops were sent to Forts Hays, [[Fort Wallace|Wallace]], and Dodge in western Kansas. With the approach of winter, these troops returned to Riley. Regiments serving here during this time included the 5th, 6th, and 9th Cavalry and the 16th Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe lessening of hostilities with the Indian tribes of the Great Plains resulted in the closing of many frontier forts. Riley escaped this fate when Lt. Gen. Philip Sheridan recommended in his 1884 annual report to Congress to make the fort \"Cavalry Headquarters of the Army.\"\n\nFort Riley was also used by state militia units for encampments and training exercises. The first such maneuver occurred in the fall of 1902 with subsequent ones held in 1903, 1904, 1906\u20131908 and 1911. These exercises gave added importance to the fort as a training facility and provided reserve units a valuable opportunity for sharpening their tactical skills.\n\n===Buffalo Soldiers===\nThe 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments&nbsp;\u2014 the famed \"Buffalo Soldiers\", so called by the indigenous peoples for the similarity to the short curly haired buffalo that roamed the plains&nbsp;\u2014 have been stationed at Fort Riley several times during their history. Shortly after their formation in 1866, the 9th Cavalry passed through here en route to permanent stations in the southwest. They returned during the early 1880s and the early part of the 20th century before being permanently assigned as troop cadre for the Cavalry School during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe 10th Cavalry was stationed here in 1868 and 1913.\n\nOn the eve of World War II, the 9th and 10th Cavalry became part of the 2nd Cavalry Division, which was briefly stationed at Fort Riley.\n\nThe following two decades have been described as the golden age of the cavalry. Certainly it was, in terms of refining the relationship between horse and rider. Army horsemen and the training they received at the [[United States Army Cavalry School]] made them among the finest mounted soldiers in the world and the School's reputation ranked with the French and Italian Cavalry Schools. Horse shows, hunts and polo matches&nbsp;\u2013 long popular events on Army post&nbsp;\u2013 were a natural outgrowth of cavalry training.\n\nThe Cavalry School Hunt was officially organized in 1921 and provided a colorful spectacle on Sunday mornings. These activities gave rise to the perception of a special quality of life at Fort Riley that came to be known as the \"Life of Riley.\" The technological advances demonstrated on the battlefields of Europe and World War I&nbsp;\u2013 most notable the tank and machine gun&nbsp;\u2013 raised questions in the inter-war years over the future of cavalry. By the late 1920s, the War Department directed development of a tank force by the Army. This was followed by activation of the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized) at [[Fort Knox]], Kentucky, in the fall of 1936 to make-up the 2nd Regiment of this brigade.\n\nIn October 1938, the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mech.) marched from Fort Knox to Fort Riley and took part in large-scale combine maneuvers of horse and mechanized units. These exercises helped prove the effectiveness of mechanical doctrine.\n\n===World War I===\n[[Image:CampFunstonKS-InfluenzaHospital.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from Fort Riley ill with [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish influenza]] at a hospital ward at [[Camp Funston]], Kansas, in 1918.]]\nAmerica's entry into [[World War I]] resulted in many changes at Fort Riley. Facilities were greatly expanded, and a [[cantonment]] named [[Camp Funston]] was built 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) east of the permanent post during the summer and fall of 1917. This training site was one of 16 across the country and could accommodate from 30,000 to 50,000 men.\n\nThe first division to train at Camp Funston, the 89th, sailed for France in the spring of 1918. The 10th Division also received training at Funston but the armistice came before the unit was sent overseas.\n\nThe camp was commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Leonard Wood]]. A Military Officers Training Camp was established in the Camp Whitside area to train doctors and other medical personnel.\n\nFollowing the war, the War Department directed service schools be created for all arms of service. As a result, in 1919, the Mounted Service School, as it was known since 1907 and which had ceased to function during the war, was re-designated as the United States Army Cavalry School. The change was sudden and abrupt. The new school met the need for courses both broader in scope and more general in character. The Cavalry unit at camp Funston was the 2nd cavalry Regiment who provide the training and cavalry tactics to new cavalry officers. The current post headquarters was in the 1920s post hospital.\n\n===World War II===\nGathering war clouds in Europe and Asia during the late 1930s caused some military planners to prepare for possible U. S. involvement. This led to several important developments at Fort Riley. The first was the rebuilding of Camp Funston and the stationing of the 2nd Cavalry Division there in December 1940. Barracks were built in the area known as Republican Flats and renamed Camp Forsyth. In addition, 32,000 acres (13,000&nbsp;ha) were added to the post for training purposes. These efforts were brought into sharp focus with America's entry into World War II.\n\nOver the next four years, approximately 125,000 soldiers were trained at these facilities. Notable trainees included heavyweight boxing champion, [[Joe Louis]], Indy car driver [[Walt Faulkner]],and motion picture stars such as [[Mickey Rooney]]. The post also received a presidential visit by Franklin Roosevelt on Easter Sunday 1943.\n\nThe [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]] was organized here in July 1942 and after its deployment, Camp Funston was used as a German prisoner of war camp. Fort Riley had branch POW camps, a large branch Camp Phillips in [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], and 12 smaller branch camps in Kansas and Missouri: [[Council Grove, Kansas|Council Grove]], [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], [[Eskridge, Kansas|Eskridge]], [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Neodesha, Kansas|Neodesha]], [[Ottawa, Kansas|Ottawa]], [[Peabody, Kansas|Peabody]], [[Wadsworth, Kansas|Wadsworth]], [[Grand Pass, Missouri|Grand Pass]], [[Lexington, Missouri|Lexington]], [[Liberty, Missouri|Liberty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentracer.org/powcampsKS.html |title=List of Prisoner Of War (POW) Camps in Kansas |publisher=Gentracer.org |date= |access-date=2013-02-16}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of victory in Europe and Japan during the spring and summer of 1945, were joyous occasions, but they also spelled new realities and directions for the Army and Fort Riley.\n\n===Korean War===\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the fort experienced a period of transition. The Cavalry School ceased operation in November 1946, and the last tactical horse unit inactivated the following March. Replacing the Cavalry School was the Ground General School, which trained newly commissioned officers in basic military subjects. An officer's candidate course was conducted along with training officers and enlisted men in intelligence techniques and methods. The [[10th Mountain Division]] was activated July 1, 1948, at Fort Riley, Kansas. The 16-week basic military program conducted by this division prepared soldiers for infantry combat and duty with other infantry units.\n\nThe invasion of South Korea by North Korean forces in June 1950, once again brought attention to Fort Riley as an important training facility. Over the next few years, recruits from all over the United States came to Fort Riley and received basic training.\n\nThe [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]], made up of units from the Ohio National Guard, was also stationed here during the conflict. While they were not sent overseas, their presence was a continuing reinforcement of the fort's importance as a training post.\n\n===Cold War===\nThe uneasy truce that settled on the Korean peninsula after 1953 was indicative of a cold war that had come to characterize relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. This would affect Fort Riley.\n\nIn 1955, the fort's utilization changed from training and educational center to that of being the home base for a major infantry division. In that year, the 10th Division rotated to Germany as part of \"Operation Gyroscope\" and was replaced by the 1st Infantry Division. Elements of the Big Red One began arriving in July 1955 and over the next four years the remaining units arrived, the last being the 2nd Battle Group, 8th Infantry, in December, 1959. The initial units occupied barracks located in Camp Funston, until new barracks were built on Custer Hill. Ultimately, the 1st Battle Group, 5th Infantry would be stationed at Funston, with the other units of the division divided between Custer Hill, Forsythe and Main post.\n\n;Operation Long Thrust\nConsistent with President Kennedy's August 1961 directive to augment U.S. Berlin Brigade, in 1962\u20131963 1st Infantry Division rotated four Infantry Battle Group Task Forces (reinforced by Big Red One Artillery and Transportation units) from Fort Riley to West Germany from where they motor marched through communist East Germany to surrounded West Berlin. 1st Division units involved were 2nd Battle Group, 12th Infantry; 1st Battle Group, 13th Infantry; 1st Battle Group, 28th Infantry; & 2nd Battle Group, 26th Infantry. 2/12th was in Berlin during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 1/28th greeted President Kennedy on 26 June 1963, the day of his memorable \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech.\n\nThe influx of troops and dependents placed new demands on the fort's infrastructure. Work began on Custer Hill where new quarters, barracks and work areas were constructed. A new hospital, named in honor of Major General B. J. D. Irwin, was constructed to provide medical care.\n\nIn the decade following, 1st Infantry Division units trained to respond to any threat that might arise in Europe or other parts of the world. Construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and Cuban Missile Crisis the following year witnessed heightened alert for soldiers stationed at Fort Riley.\n\nAn additional 50,000 acres (20,000&nbsp;ha) were also acquired in 1966, which enabled the Army to have an adequate training area for the division's two brigades.\n\n===Vietnam===\nIncreased guerrilla insurgency in South Vietnam during the mid-1960s, led to the deployment of the 1st Infantry Division to Southeast Asia. The leading element, the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry, left in July 1965 with the Division Headquarters arriving in South Vietnam in September. During this same year, a provisional basic combat training brigade was organized at Fort Riley and in February 1966, the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] was reactivated and followed the 1st Infantry Division into combat.\n\nFort Riley's use as a divisional post was maintained with the arrival of the 24th Infantry Division. The division remained in Germany until September 1968, when it redeployed two brigades to Fort Riley as part of the [[Exercise Reforger|REFORGER]] (Return of Forces to Germany) program. One brigade was maintained in Germany.\n\nFollowing nearly five years of combat in Vietnam, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley in April 1970 and assumed the NATO commitment. The division's 3rd Brigade was stationed in West Germany. During the 1970s and the 1980s, 1st Infantry Division soldiers were periodically deployed on REFORGER exercises.\n\nReserve Officer Training Corps summer camps were also held at the fort, which permitted troops to demonstrate and teach their skills to aspiring second lieutenants. The fort also hosted the model U. S. Army Correctional Brigade, housed in Camp Funston, and the 3rd ROTC Region Headquarters until their inactivation in 1992.\n\n===The Gulf War===\nIn August 1990, Iraq invaded its neighbor, Kuwait. The resulting international outcry led to the largest U.S. troop build-up and deployment overseas since the Vietnam War. In the fall of that year, Fort Riley was notified to begin mobilization of troops and equipment for deployment to the Persian Gulf. Between November 1990 and January 1991, soldiers and equipment were deployed overseas.\n\nIn addition to the 1st Infantry Division, 27 non-divisional units were deployed and twenty-four reserve components were mobilized. This amounted to 15,180 soldiers being sent overseas via 115 aircraft. Over 2,000 rail cars transported 3,000 short tons of equipment which were then shipped to theater on 18 vessels.\n\nOnce in theater, the soldiers and equipment were readied for combat. This commenced in late February 1991, and over the course of the \"hundred hours\" combat of Operation Desert Storm, these soldiers carried out their orders and executed their missions that resulted in the crushing of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guards. Later that spring, the soldiers returned to Fort Riley.\n\n===The 1990s and beyond===\nFollowing Operation Desert Storm, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley. But the winds of change were once again blowing across the Army and affected the post. The Cold War of the past four decades was being replaced by new realities in Eastern Europe with the crumbling of the Iron Curtain. Budget cuts and revised strategic thinking resulted in troop cutbacks.\n\nIn the spring of 1995, the headquarters of the 1st Infantry Division was transferred from Fort Riley to Germany. The 1st Brigade of the Big Red One remained at the post, along with 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division and the 937th Engineer Group.\n\nOn June 5, 1999, Fort Riley once again became a Division Headquarters with the reactivation of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). The 24th Infantry Division (Mech.) is the Headquarters for three enhanced Separate Brigades (eSBs) of the Army National Guard. Under the integrated Active Component/Reserve Component concept, the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] (Mech.) consists of an active component headquarters at Fort Riley and three enhanced Separate Brigades: 30th Heavy Separate Brigade at Clinton, North Carolina, 218th Heavy Separate Brigade at Columbia, South Carolina, and the 48th Separate Infantry Brigade in Macon, Georgia. These units were on eight-year training cycles that culminate in a National Training Center rotation. They also back-fill active duty units for Major Theater War contingencies and provide units for Stabilization Force rotations in Bosnia.\n\nOn April 21, 2003, the 3rd Brigade 1st Armored Division deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 3rd Brigade conducted combat operation in and around Baghdad, Iraq in support of the 1st Armored Divisions mission to secure and stabilize the city of Baghdad. Over the next 9 years, Fort Riley units supported combat operations both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nOn June 1, 2006, Fort Riley began training Military Transition Teams, or MiTTs. These 10-15 man teams from across the Army, Navy and Air Force train at Fort Riley's Camp Funston for 60 days. Transition Team training is focused training preparing teams to train, mentor and advise Iraqi and Afghan security forces. Training is based on core competencies\u2014combat skills, force protection, team support processes, technical and tactical training, adviser skills, counter insurgency operations and understanding the culture.\n\nSoldiers from Fort Riley continue to be deployed to areas in all corners of the world. From Southwest Asia to the Caribbean and the Balkans, Fort Riley soldiers have been engaged in numerous peacekeeping and nation-building missions. They continue to hone their skills by periodic deployments to the National Training Center located at Fort Irwin, California and the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana.\n\n===Return of the 1st Infantry Division===\n[[File:1st Infantry Division Make-A-Wish foundation activity.jpg|thumb|Ian Field, 7, stands with his squad during a farewell award ceremony April 15, 2011, at Barlow Theater on Fort Riley. The Soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division worked with the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] to grant Ian's wish to become a soldier]]\nOn August 1, 2006, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley and replaced the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] as the post's main Division.\n\nIn October 2006, the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, assumed command and control of the [[Military transition team|Military Transition Team]] training mission. The entire division took the lead on this mission for the military. The mission was moved from Fort Riley to Fort Polk, LA, in the summer of 2009.\n\n==Environmental contamination==\nThe Fort Riley site has [[Groundwater pollution|contaminated groundwater]] stemming from years of improper waste disposal. Wastes at the site include pesticides, [[vinyl chloride]], solvents, [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethylene]] (PCE) and other volatile organic compounds. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] listed Fort Riley as a [[Superfund]] site in 1990. Major cleanup activities at the site took place in the 1990s, while environmental monitoring of the site continues as of 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.topics&id=0700743 |title=Fort Riley, Junction City, KS |author=<!-- Not stated --> |date=2017-04-29 |website=Superfund Site |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency}}</ref>\n\n==Irwin Army Community Hospital==\nA year after the post was established in 1853, a temporary hospital was constructed near the present day Post/Cavalry Museum and Patton Hall on the main post. A permanent hospital, which is now the Post/Cavalry Museum, was built in 1855 with a clock tower added in 1890. The second hospital replaced the 1855 hospital in 1888 and is now Post Headquarters. A third hospital was built in 1941 at Camp Whitside and named Cantonment Hospital, later Station Hospital. The second hospital remained as an annex until 1957. The current and fourth hospital was dedicated in 1958. The fourth and current hospital was named after [[Bernard J. D. Irwin|Brigadier General Bernard John Dowling Irwin]] \"The Fighting Doctor\" who won the [[Medal of Honor]] for distinguished gallantry in action during an engagement with the Chiricahua Indians near Apache Pass Arizona in February 1861.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iach.amedd.army.mil/history.asp |title=Irwin ACH - History |publisher=Iach.amedd.army.mil |date= |access-date=2013-02-16}}</ref> As of 2016 the hospital has 47 beds and is staffed by 45 physicians.<ref>[https://www.ourmilitary.com/bases/irwin-army-community-hospital/ Irwin Army Community Hospital]</ref>\n\n==Fort Riley Museums==\n[[File:7th Field Artillery \"Old Glory\".jpg|thumb|7th Field Artillerymen fire \"Old Glory\", a replica of a [[Field artillery in the American Civil War#3-inch rifle|Civil War]] field piece, at a 2012 ceremony at Fort Riley.]]\n* [[U.S. Cavalry Museum]]&nbsp;\u2014 housed in the building used as headquarters by George A.

The fort was established in 1853 as a military post to protect the movement of people and trade over the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], [[California Trail|California]], and Santa Fe trails. In the years after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Fort Riley served as a major United States Cavalry post and school for [[cavalry tactics]] and practice. The post was a base for skirmishes with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] after the Civil War ended in 1865, during which time [[George Armstrong Custer|George A. Custer]] was stationed at the fort.\n\n==United States Cavalry School==\nIn 1887, Fort Riley became the site of the United States Cavalry School. The famous all-black [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th]] Cavalry Regiments, the soldiers of which were called \"[[Buffalo Soldier]]s\", were stationed at Fort Riley at various times in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During [[World War I]], the fort was home to 50,000 soldiers, and it is sometimes identified as [[ground zero]] for the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish flu pandemic]], which its soldiers were said to have spread all over the world. Since the end of [[World War II]], various infantry divisions have been assigned there. Most notably, from 1955 to 1996 the post was home to the famed [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], also called \"Big Red One\". Between 1999\u20132006, the post was headquarters to the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) and known as \"America's Warfighting Center\". In August 2006, the Big Red One relocated its headquarters to Fort Riley from Leighton Barracks, [[Germany]].\n\nCamp Whitside is named in honor of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Samuel Whitside|Samuel M. Whitside]], who served as commander of Company B, [[6th Cavalry Regiment]], at Fort Riley, between the years of 1871 and 1874.\n\n== Stationed units ==\n1st Infantry Division<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riley.army.mil/Units/1stInfantryDivision.aspx|title=1st Infantry Division|author=|date=|website=www.riley.army.mil|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n* 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team\n* 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team\n* 1st Infantry Division Artillery (DIVARTY)\n* 1st Combat Aviation Brigade\n* 1st Sustainment Brigade\n* Division Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion\n\nGarrison<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riley.army.mil/Units/GarrisonCommand.aspx|title=Garrison Command|author=|date=|website=www.riley.army.mil|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n* 97th Military Police Battalion\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, U.S. Army Garrison\n\nPartners\n* 10th Air Support Operations Squadron, USAF\n* 407th Army Field Support Brigade\n* 902nd Military Intelligence Group\n* Det. 2, 3rd Weather Squadron, USAF\n* Irwin Army Community Hospital\n* Warrior Transition Battalion\n* [[1st Signal Command (United States)|1st Signal Command]], inactive 1969\n* 630th Ordnance Company (Explosive Ordnance Disposal)\n* 774th Ordnance Company (Explosive Ordnance Disposal)\n* 923rd Contracting Battalion\n*[[121st Signal Battalion (United States)]], inactivated 1995\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Kansas}}\n\n===Origins===\nThe early history of Fort Riley is closely tied to the movement of people and trade along the Oregon and Santa Fe trails. These routes, a result of then-popular United States doctrine of \"[[manifest destiny]]\" in the middle of the 19th century, prompted increased American military presence for the protection of American interests in this largely unsettled territory. During the 1850s, a number of military posts were established at strategic points to provide protection along these arteries of emigration and commerce.\n\n[[Image:Fort-Riley-Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Riley's former division headquarters and current garrison headquarters]]\nIn the fall of 1852, a surveying party under the command of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Robert H. Chilton]], [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st U.S. Dragoons]], selected the junction of the [[Republican River|Republican]] and [[Smoky Hill River]]s as a site for one of these forts. This location, approved by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in January 1853, offered an advantageous location from which to organize, train and equip troops in protecting the overland trails.\n\nSurveyors believed the location near the center of the United States and named the site, Camp Center. During the late spring, three companies of the 6th Infantry occupied the camp and began construction of temporary quarters.\n\nOn June 27, 1853, Camp Center became Fort Riley&nbsp;\u2014 named in honor of Maj. Gen. [[Bennet C. Riley]], who had led the first military escort along the Santa Fe Trail in 1829. The \"fort\" took shape around a broad plain that overlooked the Kansas River valley.\n\nThe fort's design followed the standard frontier post configuration: buildings were constructed of the most readily available material&nbsp;\u2014 in this case, native limestone.\n\nIn the spring, troops were dispatched to escort mail trains and protect travel routes across the plains. At the fort, additional buildings were constructed under the supervision of Capt. Edmund Ogden.\n\nAnticipating greater utilization of the post, [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized appropriations in the spring of 1855 to provide additional quarters and stables for the Dragoons. Ogden again marshaled resources and arrived from Leavenworth in July with 50 6-mule teams<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lowe|first1=Percival|title=Five Years a Dragoon|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0806110899|pages=144}}</ref> loaded with materials, craftsmen and laborers.\n\nWork had progressed for several weeks when [[cholera]] broke out among the workers. The epidemic lasted only a few days but claimed 70 lives, including Ogden's. Work gradually resumed and buildings were readied for the arrival in October of the 2nd Dragoons.\n\nAs the fort began to take shape, an issue soon to dominate the national scene was debated during the brief territorial legislative session which met at Pawnee in the present area of Camp Whitside, named for Col. [[Warren Whitside]].\n\nThe first territorial legislature met there in July 1855. Slavery was a fact of life and an issue within the garrison just as it was in the rest of the country. The seeds of sectional discord were emerging that would lead to \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" and, eventually, Civil War.\n\nIncreased tension and bloodshed between pro and anti-slavery settlers resulted in the use of the Army to \"police\" the troubled territory. They also continued to guard and patrol the Santa Fe Trail in 1859 and 1860 due to increased Indian threats.\n\nThe outbreak of hostilities between the North and South in 1861 disrupted garrison life. Regular units returned east to participate in the Civil War while militia units from Kansas and other states used Riley as a base from which to launch campaigns to show the flag and offer a degree of protection to trading caravans using the Santa Fe Trail. In the early stages of the war, the fort was used to confine Confederate prisoners.\n\n=== George A. Custer ===\nThe conclusion of the Civil War in 1865 witnessed Fort Riley again assuming an importance in providing protection to railroad lines being built across Kansas. Evidence of this occurred in the summer and fall of 1866 when the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]] was mustered-in at Riley and the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] reached the fort. Brevet Major General George A. Custer arrived in December to take charge of the new regiment. Soldiers from the Kansas Volunteer regiments, \"Jenison's Jayhawks\", that were wounded in the [[Battle of Westport]] were brought to Fort Riley for recovery.\n\nThe following spring, Custer and the 7th left Fort Riley to participate in a campaign on the high plains of western Kansas and eastern Colorado.\n\nThe campaign proved inconclusive but resulted in Custer's court martial and suspension from the Army for one year\u2014in part\u2014for returning to Fort Riley to see his wife without permission.\n\nAs the line of settlement extended westward each spring, the fort lost some of its importance. Larger concentrations of troops were stationed at [[Fort Larned National Historic Site|Fort Larned]] and [[Fort Hays]], where they spent the summer months on patrol and wintered in garrison.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1871, a school of light artillery was conducted at Fort Riley by the 4th Artillery Battery. Instruction was of a purely practical nature, and regular classes were not conducted. Critiques were delivered during or following the exercise. This short-lived school closed in March 1871 as the War Department imposed economy measures, which included cutting a private's monthly pay from $12 to $9.\n\nDuring the next decade, various regiments of the infantry and cavalry were garrisoned at Riley. The spring and summer months usually witnessed a skeletal complement at the fort while the remainder of the troops were sent to Forts Hays, [[Fort Wallace|Wallace]], and Dodge in western Kansas. With the approach of winter, these troops returned to Riley. Regiments serving here during this time included the 5th, 6th, and 9th Cavalry and the 16th Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe lessening of hostilities with the Indian tribes of the Great Plains resulted in the closing of many frontier forts. Riley escaped this fate when Lt. Gen. Philip Sheridan recommended in his 1884 annual report to Congress to make the fort \"Cavalry Headquarters of the Army.\"\n\nFort Riley was also used by state militia units for encampments and training exercises. The first such maneuver occurred in the fall of 1902 with subsequent ones held in 1903, 1904, 1906\u20131908 and 1911. These exercises gave added importance to the fort as a training facility and provided reserve units a valuable opportunity for sharpening their tactical skills.\n\n===Buffalo Soldiers===\nThe 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments&nbsp;\u2014 the famed \"Buffalo Soldiers\", so called by the indigenous peoples for the similarity to the short curly haired buffalo that roamed the plains&nbsp;\u2014 have been stationed at Fort Riley several times during their history. Shortly after their formation in 1866, the 9th Cavalry passed through here en route to permanent stations in the southwest. They returned during the early 1880s and the early part of the 20th century before being permanently assigned as troop cadre for the Cavalry School during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe 10th Cavalry was stationed here in 1868 and 1913.\n\nOn the eve of World War II, the 9th and 10th Cavalry became part of the 2nd Cavalry Division, which was briefly stationed at Fort Riley.\n\nThe following two decades have been described as the golden age of the cavalry. Certainly it was, in terms of refining the relationship between horse and rider. Army horsemen and the training they received at the [[United States Army Cavalry School]] made them among the finest mounted soldiers in the world and the School's reputation ranked with the French and Italian Cavalry Schools. Horse shows, hunts and polo matches&nbsp;\u2013 long popular events on Army post&nbsp;\u2013 were a natural outgrowth of cavalry training.\n\nThe Cavalry School Hunt was officially organized in 1921 and provided a colorful spectacle on Sunday mornings. These activities gave rise to the perception of a special quality of life at Fort Riley that came to be known as the \"Life of Riley.\" The technological advances demonstrated on the battlefields of Europe and World War I&nbsp;\u2013 most notable the tank and machine gun&nbsp;\u2013 raised questions in the inter-war years over the future of cavalry. By the late 1920s, the War Department directed development of a tank force by the Army. This was followed by activation of the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized) at [[Fort Knox]], Kentucky, in the fall of 1936 to make-up the 2nd Regiment of this brigade.\n\nIn October 1938, the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mech.) marched from Fort Knox to Fort Riley and took part in large-scale combine maneuvers of horse and mechanized units. These exercises helped prove the effectiveness of mechanical doctrine.\n\n===World War I===\n[[Image:CampFunstonKS-InfluenzaHospital.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from Fort Riley ill with [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish influenza]] at a hospital ward at [[Camp Funston]], Kansas, in 1918.]]\nAmerica's entry into [[World War I]] resulted in many changes at Fort Riley. Facilities were greatly expanded, and a [[cantonment]] named [[Camp Funston]] was built 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) east of the permanent post during the summer and fall of 1917. This training site was one of 16 across the country and could accommodate from 30,000 to 50,000 men.\n\nThe first division to train at Camp Funston, the 89th, sailed for France in the spring of 1918. The 10th Division also received training at Funston but the armistice came before the unit was sent overseas.\n\nThe camp was commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Leonard Wood]]. A Military Officers Training Camp was established in the Camp Whitside area to train doctors and other medical personnel.\n\nFollowing the war, the War Department directed service schools be created for all arms of service. As a result, in 1919, the Mounted Service School, as it was known since 1907 and which had ceased to function during the war, was re-designated as the United States Army Cavalry School. The change was sudden and abrupt. The new school met the need for courses both broader in scope and more general in character. The Cavalry unit at camp Funston was the 2nd cavalry Regiment who provide the training and cavalry tactics to new cavalry officers. The current post headquarters was in the 1920s post hospital.\n\n===World War II===\nGathering war clouds in Europe and Asia during the late 1930s caused some military planners to prepare for possible U. S. involvement. This led to several important developments at Fort Riley. The first was the rebuilding of Camp Funston and the stationing of the 2nd Cavalry Division there in December 1940. Barracks were built in the area known as Republican Flats and renamed Camp Forsyth. In addition, 32,000 acres (13,000&nbsp;ha) were added to the post for training purposes. These efforts were brought into sharp focus with America's entry into World War II.\n\nOver the next four years, approximately 125,000 soldiers were trained at these facilities. Notable trainees included heavyweight boxing champion, [[Joe Louis]], Indy car driver [[Walt Faulkner]],and motion picture stars such as [[Mickey Rooney]]. The post also received a presidential visit by Franklin Roosevelt on Easter Sunday 1943.\n\nThe [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]] was organized here in July 1942 and after its deployment, Camp Funston was used as a German prisoner of war camp. Fort Riley had branch POW camps, a large branch Camp Phillips in [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], and 12 smaller branch camps in Kansas and Missouri: [[Council Grove, Kansas|Council Grove]], [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], [[Eskridge, Kansas|Eskridge]], [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Neodesha, Kansas|Neodesha]], [[Ottawa, Kansas|Ottawa]], [[Peabody, Kansas|Peabody]], [[Wadsworth, Kansas|Wadsworth]], [[Grand Pass, Missouri|Grand Pass]], [[Lexington, Missouri|Lexington]], [[Liberty, Missouri|Liberty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentracer.org/powcampsKS.html |title=List of Prisoner Of War (POW) Camps in Kansas |publisher=Gentracer.org |date= |access-date=2013-02-16}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of victory in Europe and Japan during the spring and summer of 1945, were joyous occasions, but they also spelled new realities and directions for the Army and Fort Riley.\n\n===Korean War===\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the fort experienced a period of transition. The Cavalry School ceased operation in November 1946, and the last tactical horse unit inactivated the following March. Replacing the Cavalry School was the Ground General School, which trained newly commissioned officers in basic military subjects. An officer's candidate course was conducted along with training officers and enlisted men in intelligence techniques and methods. The [[10th Mountain Division]] was activated July 1, 1948, at Fort Riley, Kansas. The 16-week basic military program conducted by this division prepared soldiers for infantry combat and duty with other infantry units.\n\nThe invasion of South Korea by North Korean forces in June 1950, once again brought attention to Fort Riley as an important training facility. Over the next few years, recruits from all over the United States came to Fort Riley and received basic training.\n\nThe [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]], made up of units from the Ohio National Guard, was also stationed here during the conflict. While they were not sent overseas, their presence was a continuing reinforcement of the fort's importance as a training post.\n\n===Cold War===\nThe uneasy truce that settled on the Korean peninsula after 1953 was indicative of a cold war that had come to characterize relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. This would affect Fort Riley.\n\nIn 1955, the fort's utilization changed from training and educational center to that of being the home base for a major infantry division. In that year, the 10th Division rotated to Germany as part of \"Operation Gyroscope\" and was replaced by the 1st Infantry Division. Elements of the Big Red One began arriving in July 1955 and over the next four years the remaining units arrived, the last being the 2nd Battle Group, 8th Infantry, in December, 1959. The initial units occupied barracks located in Camp Funston, until new barracks were built on Custer Hill. Ultimately, the 1st Battle Group, 5th Infantry would be stationed at Funston, with the other units of the division divided between Custer Hill, Forsythe and Main post.\n\n;Operation Long Thrust\nConsistent with President Kennedy's August 1961 directive to augment U.S. Berlin Brigade, in 1962\u20131963 1st Infantry Division rotated four Infantry Battle Group Task Forces (reinforced by Big Red One Artillery and Transportation units) from Fort Riley to West Germany from where they motor marched through communist East Germany to surrounded West Berlin. 1st Division units involved were 2nd Battle Group, 12th Infantry; 1st Battle Group, 13th Infantry; 1st Battle Group, 28th Infantry; & 2nd Battle Group, 26th Infantry. 2/12th was in Berlin during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 1/28th greeted President Kennedy on 26 June 1963, the day of his memorable \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech.\n\nThe influx of troops and dependents placed new demands on the fort's infrastructure. Work began on Custer Hill where new quarters, barracks and work areas were constructed. A new hospital, named in honor of Major General B. J. D. Irwin, was constructed to provide medical care.\n\nIn the decade following, 1st Infantry Division units trained to respond to any threat that might arise in Europe or other parts of the world. Construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and Cuban Missile Crisis the following year witnessed heightened alert for soldiers stationed at Fort Riley.\n\nAn additional 50,000 acres (20,000&nbsp;ha) were also acquired in 1966, which enabled the Army to have an adequate training area for the division's two brigades.\n\n===Vietnam===\nIncreased guerrilla insurgency in South Vietnam during the mid-1960s, led to the deployment of the 1st Infantry Division to Southeast Asia. The leading element, the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry, left in July 1965 with the Division Headquarters arriving in South Vietnam in September. During this same year, a provisional basic combat training brigade was organized at Fort Riley and in February 1966, the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] was reactivated and followed the 1st Infantry Division into combat.\n\nFort Riley's use as a divisional post was maintained with the arrival of the 24th Infantry Division. The division remained in Germany until September 1968, when it redeployed two brigades to Fort Riley as part of the [[Exercise Reforger|REFORGER]] (Return of Forces to Germany) program. One brigade was maintained in Germany.\n\nFollowing nearly five years of combat in Vietnam, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley in April 1970 and assumed the NATO commitment. The division's 3rd Brigade was stationed in West Germany. During the 1970s and the 1980s, 1st Infantry Division soldiers were periodically deployed on REFORGER exercises.\n\nReserve Officer Training Corps summer camps were also held at the fort, which permitted troops to demonstrate and teach their skills to aspiring second lieutenants. The fort also hosted the model U. S. Army Correctional Brigade, housed in Camp Funston, and the 3rd ROTC Region Headquarters until their inactivation in 1992.\n\n===The Gulf War===\nIn August 1990, Iraq invaded its neighbor, Kuwait. The resulting international outcry led to the largest U.S. troop build-up and deployment overseas since the Vietnam War. In the fall of that year, Fort Riley was notified to begin mobilization of troops and equipment for deployment to the Persian Gulf. Between November 1990 and January 1991, soldiers and equipment were deployed overseas.\n\nIn addition to the 1st Infantry Division, 27 non-divisional units were deployed and twenty-four reserve components were mobilized. This amounted to 15,180 soldiers being sent overseas via 115 aircraft. Over 2,000 rail cars transported 3,000 short tons of equipment which were then shipped to theater on 18 vessels.\n\nOnce in theater, the soldiers and equipment were readied for combat. This commenced in late February 1991, and over the course of the \"hundred hours\" combat of Operation Desert Storm, these soldiers carried out their orders and executed their missions that resulted in the crushing of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guards. Later that spring, the soldiers returned to Fort Riley.\n\n===The 1990s and beyond===\nFollowing Operation Desert Storm, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley. But the winds of change were once again blowing across the Army and affected the post. The Cold War of the past four decades was being replaced by new realities in Eastern Europe with the crumbling of the Iron Curtain. Budget cuts and revised strategic thinking resulted in troop cutbacks.\n\nIn the spring of 1995, the headquarters of the 1st Infantry Division was transferred from Fort Riley to Germany. The 1st Brigade of the Big Red One remained at the post, along with 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division and the 937th Engineer Group.\n\nOn June 5, 1999, Fort Riley once again became a Division Headquarters with the reactivation of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). The 24th Infantry Division (Mech.) is the Headquarters for three enhanced Separate Brigades (eSBs) of the Army National Guard. Under the integrated Active Component/Reserve Component concept, the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] (Mech.) consists of an active component headquarters at Fort Riley and three enhanced Separate Brigades: 30th Heavy Separate Brigade at Clinton, North Carolina, 218th Heavy Separate Brigade at Columbia, South Carolina, and the 48th Separate Infantry Brigade in Macon, Georgia. These units were on eight-year training cycles that culminate in a National Training Center rotation. They also back-fill active duty units for Major Theater War contingencies and provide units for Stabilization Force rotations in Bosnia.\n\nOn April 21, 2003, the 3rd Brigade 1st Armored Division deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 3rd Brigade conducted combat operation in and around Baghdad, Iraq in support of the 1st Armored Divisions mission to secure and stabilize the city of Baghdad. Over the next 9 years, Fort Riley units supported combat operations both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nOn June 1, 2006, Fort Riley began training Military Transition Teams, or MiTTs. These 10-15 man teams from across the Army, Navy and Air Force train at Fort Riley's Camp Funston for 60 days. Transition Team training is focused training preparing teams to train, mentor and advise Iraqi and Afghan security forces. Training is based on core competencies\u2014combat skills, force protection, team support processes, technical and tactical training, adviser skills, counter insurgency operations and understanding the culture.\n\nSoldiers from Fort Riley continue to be deployed to areas in all corners of the world. From Southwest Asia to the Caribbean and the Balkans, Fort Riley soldiers have been engaged in numerous peacekeeping and nation-building missions. They continue to hone their skills by periodic deployments to the National Training Center located at Fort Irwin, California and the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana.\n\n===Return of the 1st Infantry Division===\n[[File:1st Infantry Division Make-A-Wish foundation activity.jpg|thumb|Ian Field, 7, stands with his squad during a farewell award ceremony April 15, 2011, at Barlow Theater on Fort Riley. The Soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division worked with the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] to grant Ian's wish to become a soldier]]\nOn August 1, 2006, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley and replaced the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] as the post's main Division.\n\nIn October 2006, the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, assumed command and control of the [[Military transition team|Military Transition Team]] training mission. The entire division took the lead on this mission for the military. The mission was moved from Fort Riley to Fort Polk, LA, in the summer of 2009.\n\n==Environmental contamination==\nThe Fort Riley site has [[Groundwater pollution|contaminated groundwater]] stemming from years of improper waste disposal. Wastes at the site include pesticides, [[vinyl chloride]], solvents, [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethylene]] (PCE) and other volatile organic compounds. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] listed Fort Riley as a [[Superfund]] site in 1990. Major cleanup activities at the site took place in the 1990s, while environmental monitoring of the site continues as of 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.topics&id=0700743 |title=Fort Riley, Junction City, KS |author=<!-- Not stated --> |date=2017-04-29 |website=Superfund Site |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency}}</ref>\n\n==Irwin Army Community Hospital==\nA year after the post was established in 1853, a temporary hospital was constructed near the present day Post/Cavalry Museum and Patton Hall on the main post. A permanent hospital, which is now the Post/Cavalry Museum, was built in 1855 with a clock tower added in 1890. The second hospital replaced the 1855 hospital in 1888 and is now Post Headquarters. A third hospital was built in 1941 at Camp Whitside and named Cantonment Hospital, later Station Hospital. The second hospital remained as an annex until 1957. The current and fourth hospital was dedicated in 1958. The fourth and current hospital was named after [[Bernard J. D. Irwin|Brigadier General Bernard John Dowling Irwin]] \"The Fighting Doctor\" who won the [[Medal of Honor]] for distinguished gallantry in action during an engagement with the Chiricahua Indians near Apache Pass Arizona in February 1861.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iach.amedd.army.mil/history.asp |title=Irwin ACH - History |publisher=Iach.amedd.army.mil |date= |access-date=2013-02-16}}</ref> As of 2016 the hospital has 47 beds and is staffed by 45 physicians.<ref>[https://www.ourmilitary.com/bases/irwin-army-community-hospital/ Irwin Army Community Hospital]</ref>\n\n==Fort Riley Museums==\n[[File:7th Field Artillery \"Old Glory\".jpg|thumb|7th Field Artillerymen fire \"Old Glory\", a replica of a [[Field artillery in the American Civil War#3-inch rifle|Civil War]] field piece, at a 2012 ceremony at Fort Riley.]]\n* [[U.S. Cavalry Museum]]&nbsp;\u2014 housed in the building used as headquarters by George A.

The film was directed by [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]] and stars [[Danny Aiello]] (as Ruby), [[Sherilyn Fenn]] (as Sheryl Ann DuJean a.k.a. Candy Cane), and [[Arliss Howard]]. It is based on a play written by British screenwriter [[Stephen Davis (screenwriter)|Stephen Davis]].  ''Ruby'' was released three months after [[Oliver Stone]]'s movie [[JFK (film)|''JFK'']].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with Jack Ruby narrating, \"Lookin' back at it now. What can you say? It feels like it was a dream. Yeah, that's it, a dream. Maybe none of it never happened. Because when I look back on it today, this is the best sense I can make of it.\" Then the scene shows a murder; a corpse, dressed in a suit, is being drained of blood, having been hung on a meat hook. It is readily apparent that the corpse has been tortured, and it is implied that the presentation of the body is intended to be a brutal message.\n\nThe next scene switches location to the Carousel Club of [[Dallas]], Texas in 1962, a burlesque club owned by Jack Ruby. It is a slow night at the club, with only a sparse audience for the featured performer, and few bar patrons. The featured dancer, named Telephone Trixie, is unprepared for the show, unenthusiastic, and well beyond her glory days. Ruby regretfully watches her lackluster performance and ruefully observes the disappointing state of his business. Near closing, Ruby leaves the Carousel through a rear/side exit in order to make a rendezvous with two corrupt officers from the Dallas Police Department in order to supply them with narcotics. The next scene shows an attractive young blond woman sitting in front of a mirror applying make-up to a facial bruise; the scene strongly suggests that her sleeping husband or significant other has been abusing her.\n\nThe next set of scenes follows Ruby as he closes the Carousel Club and makes a stop at an all-night diner which is adjacent to a bus station. Inside the diner, Ruby observes the young blond from the previous scene and stops to speak with her and offer a meal and a place to stay. In the course of discussion between the young woman and Ruby, it is made clear that Jack is not making a sexual advance, and is instead offering lodging in a gesture of platonic friendship. Destitute, desperate, and homeless, the young Sheryl Ann DuJean then accompanies Ruby back to Carousel Club, where Ruby gives her lodging in an apartment in the area above the club.\n\nThe next day, Ruby has a conversation on the state of Carousel with his bartender, who is established to be a young Cuban exile named Diego. Ruby's troubles are further amplified by the appearance cancellation of the next featured dancer who was scheduled to appear on stage. Having heard Ruby's conversation about the cancellation, Sheryl Ann offers to perform for Ruby during his police appreciation show that night. Ruby, reluctant to believe that the innocent and demure Sheryl Ann is stripper material, is desperate and left with no other choice than to allow her to dance. Sheryl Ann adopts the stage name Candy Cane and then takes the stage only to wow the law enforcement crowd with her skilled and enthusiastic performance. Even the jaded Jack Ruby is surprised by her expertise, and realizes she is experienced as a stripper. The crowd reacts enthusiastically, and things begin to look up for Jack Ruby as he has a showstopper as a featured dancer, and a chance at revitalizing his business. Ruby and Candy Cane come to understanding that they be truthful, and a friendship develops between the two.\n\nShortly after the upswing in business, Jack is contacted by one of his former mob associates, named Louie Vitali, about performing a [[black bag job]] in Cuba which the murder victim, Action Jackson, seen in the opening scene, was originally assigned to. Ruby confers with Candy Cane and he ends up inviting her to go along with him to communist Cuba. Once in Cuba, Ruby meets with Vitali and they meet with the elderly and imprisoned Sicilian mobster Santos Alicante, who has been in jail in Cuba since the 1959 communist takeover after his casino hotel was closed down. Vitali tells Ruby that they are to spring Santos from Cuba to put him back in place in the US as part of a complex operation plan. However, after their visit, Vitali accompanies Ruby back to his and Candy's hotel room where he secretly tells him the real reason for this assignment; he wants Ruby to kill Santos because the people that Vitali works for feel that Santos has outgrown his usefulness to them. Vitali gives Ruby an 8&nbsp;mm film camera that has a pistol encased in it to carry out the killing. But that evening, Ruby instead kills Vitali on the dock near the prison and springs Santos from his cell by bribing the guards, and then he, Santos, and Candy flee Cuba aboard Vitali's boat back to America. After arriving in New Orleans, Ruby makes contact with David Ferrie, an old friend from his days in Chicago, to supply him with the necessary papers enabling Santos to re-enter the country. Shortly after, Ruby and Candy return to Dallas, while Santos goes off on his own.\n\nSeveral months later, Ruby, still managing the Carousel Club in which Candy is now the star attraction, has an encounter one evening when Candy's estranged and abusive husband, Hank, shows up and confronts her after the show in her apartment, wanting her to return to him. Ruby beats up Candy/Sheryl Ann's husband and warns him never to come back to the club.\n\nThe next day, a mysterious man, identifying himself only by his name of 'Maxwell', pays a visit to Ruby at the currently closed club to talk with him about the killing of Vitali and of the release of Santos from Cuba. With a clearly implied threat of arrest and incarceration, Maxwell wants Ruby to redeem himself to the people that Maxwell works for by being an informant for him on Santos, who has since opened up a new hotel and casino in Las Vegas since his return to the United States as well as Santos' affiliates. Maxwell supplies Ruby with a mini-tape recorder to assist, and Ruby makes the assumption that Maxwell works for the CIA, which Maxwell neither denies or admits.\n\nRuby and Candy travel to Las Vegas and check into Santos' new hotel, where a gala event is taking place that involves a stage performance by singer Tony Montana. Ruby is also suspicious when a helicopter arrives and drops off the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, who is attending the event. Candy attends the event with David Ferrie, who sits with her at the table where the President is sitting, while Ruby sits with Santos and several like-minded people who are clearly connected to organized crime. Recording the conversation, the men want Ruby to smuggle into Cuba \"special cigars\" for [[Fidel Castro]] to assassinate him for the loss of all their casinos and business since the 1959 takeover. When Ruby excuses himself to go outside, he meets with Maxwell in the hotel parking lot, where he drives Ruby outside the city and reveals another assignment for him to partake in the assassination of a prominent official, implying it to be Castro.\n\nThe next day, Candy tells Ruby that the people that Santos works with want her to stay in Las Vegas to perform as a singer in their hotels, thanks to some presidential connections that she managed to get hold of. Ruby returns to Dallas alone, while he makes use of free time by shooting at watermelons and other targets from a distance in preparation for his next assassination assignment.\n\nSometime later, Ruby talks with Lenny, an old friend of his, about assignments for CIA associates and Lenny tells Ruby that to take out a \"target\" relies on two or more rifle marksmen and a \"patsy\" or \"[[fall guy]]\" to be caught in order to place all the blame for the crime to divert suspicion away from the investigating authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Diego the bartender meets with David Ferrie. They travel to New Orleans and make contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, whom they ask to talk about going in on a job.\n\nBack in Dallas, Ruby meets with Santos, Sam Giaccana, and their men at another meeting where Giaccana tells Ruby that his assignment to take out Castro has been canceled because another matter has come up. Giaccana tells Ruby that the CIA has been having troubles with President Kennedy over the Cuba issue and wanting to reveal the CIA's true nature. After Ruby leaves, Giaccana meets with Maxwell for a talk.\n\nReturning to his club, Ruby sees Candy there, who tells him that she quit her career tour which included performances for the President because she felt they were taking advantage of her and her charms. It is implied that Candy had shared some intimate time with Kennedy and possibly others. While Ruby and Candy decide to revise the club with a new classy act as a singing club, he begins to figure out what Maxwell and the mob associates are doing: planning a high-level assassination. Ruby tells his boss, Proby, that from his views and experiences in the past several months, the CIA and the Mafia work together to stage and carry out [[contract killing]]s, and get away with it by subcontracting third parties to carry out the work. Proby has some doubts, but he tells Ruby to leave the matter alone for he cannot blow the lid on a complex conspiracy such as this.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, JFK arrives in Dallas, where Maxwell meets with Oswald, Diego, and two other henchmen, where he tells them their assignments. While Ruby is at a newspaper office to file a new listing for his club, Candy is watching the President's limo convoy ride through the city. It is shown that Diego, with Oswald as the handler, shoots Kennedy from the sixth-floor window of the Dallas Book Depository, while the second assassin, and his handler, fire the fatal shot, killing Kennedy from the grassy knoll section near the building to the building.\n\nAfter watching the events on a TV set, a distraught Ruby returns to his club, where Proby is rummaging through his desk to look for the audio tape of the recording of the conversation Ruby had in Las Vegas with Santos and his associates, but the tape is gone. Ruby tells Proby, who has not heard about the assassination, that their enemies have won. The following day, David Ferrie pays a visit to Ruby at the club where they watch a TV broadcast about the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald and that he also was arrested for killing Officer Tippit, a regular customer at the club. Ferrie tells Ruby to forget that they ever met and that he shouldn't do anything stupid for he calls Ruby only a \"small time hood\". Ruby vows he will make the world understand.\n\nThe next day, Ruby goes to the Dallas county jail where Oswald is being transferred and fatally shoots him. Ruby is immediately arrested by the police\u2014just as he wanted them to. In jail, Ruby refuses to give a statement to his lawyer about his motivation and demands that he be taken to Washington to testify before a Senate committee about what he knows. At Ruby's trial, he refuses to offer an insanity defense for the murder of Oswald and is convicted and sentenced to death. Ruby sees Maxwell as one of the spectators during the trial and knows that Maxwell had some hand in work behind the scenes that has led to his conviction. Ruby appeals the verdict, but aware that the conspirators are monitoring his visits, continues to demand that he be taken to Washington to testify, but he is refused.\n\nSeveral months later, while still in prison awaiting an appeal, Candy visits Ruby to offer him moral support for his actions, while he tells her not to visit him again and to move far away so the members of the conspiracy will not find her. After Candy leaves Ruby for good, he remains in jail while over the next several months, he believes that the conspirators are slowly killing him inside when he is forcibly given injections. In a final disclaimer, it is said that Ruby died from cancer in jail in 1967 and that his request to testify before a Senate hearing was never granted.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as [[Jack Ruby]]\n* [[Sherilyn Fenn]] as Sheryl Ann DuJean (Candy Cane)\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[David Ferrie]]\n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Louis Vitali\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Maxwell\n* [[Richard C.

The film was directed by [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]] and stars [[Danny Aiello]] (as Ruby), [[Sherilyn Fenn]] (as Sheryl Ann DuJean a.k.a. Candy Cane), and [[Arliss Howard]]. It is based on a play written by British screenwriter [[Stephen Davis (screenwriter)|Stephen Davis]].  ''Ruby'' was released three months after [[Oliver Stone]]'s movie [[JFK (film)|''JFK'']].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with Jack Ruby narrating, \"Lookin' back at it now. What can you say? It feels like it was a dream. Yeah, that's it, a dream. Maybe none of it never happened. Because when I look back on it today, this is the best sense I can make of it.\" Then the scene shows a murder; a corpse, dressed in a suit, is being drained of blood, having been hung on a meat hook. It is readily apparent that the corpse has been tortured, and it is implied that the presentation of the body is intended to be a brutal message.\n\nThe next scene switches location to the Carousel Club of [[Dallas]], Texas in 1962, a burlesque club owned by Jack Ruby. It is a slow night at the club, with only a sparse audience for the featured performer, and few bar patrons. The featured dancer, named Telephone Trixie, is unprepared for the show, unenthusiastic, and well beyond her glory days. Ruby regretfully watches her lackluster performance and ruefully observes the disappointing state of his business. Near closing, Ruby leaves the Carousel through a rear/side exit in order to make a rendezvous with two corrupt officers from the Dallas Police Department in order to supply them with narcotics. The next scene shows an attractive young blond woman sitting in front of a mirror applying make-up to a facial bruise; the scene strongly suggests that her sleeping husband or significant other has been abusing her.\n\nThe next set of scenes follows Ruby as he closes the Carousel Club and makes a stop at an all-night diner which is adjacent to a bus station. Inside the diner, Ruby observes the young blond from the previous scene and stops to speak with her and offer a meal and a place to stay. In the course of discussion between the young woman and Ruby, it is made clear that Jack is not making a sexual advance, and is instead offering lodging in a gesture of platonic friendship. Destitute, desperate, and homeless, the young Sheryl Ann DuJean then accompanies Ruby back to Carousel Club where Ruby gives her lodging in an apartment in the area above the club.\n\nThe next day, Ruby has a conversation on the state of Carousel with his bartender, who is established to be a young Cuban exile named Diego. Ruby's troubles are further amplified by the appearance cancellation of the next featured dancer who was scheduled to appear on stage. Having heard Ruby's conversation about the cancellation, Sheryl Ann offers to perform for Ruby during his police appreciation show that night. Ruby, reluctant to believe that the innocent and demure Sheryl Ann is stripper material, is desperate and left with no other choice than to allow her to dance. Sheryl Ann adopts the stage name Candy Cane and then takes the stage only to wow the law enforcement crowd with her skilled and enthusiastic performance. Even the jaded Jack Ruby is surprised by her expertise, and realizes she is experienced as a stripper. The crowd reacts enthusiastically, and things begin to look up for Jack Ruby as he has a showstopper as a featured dancer, and a chance at revitalizing his business. Ruby and Candy Cane come to understanding that they be truthful, and a friendship develops between the two.\n\nShortly after the upswing in business, Jack is contacted by one of his former mob associates, named Louie Vitali, about performing a [[black bag job]] in Cuba which the murder victim, Action Jackson, seen in the opening scene, was originally assigned to. Ruby confers with Candy Cane and he ends up inviting her to go along with him to communist Cuba. Once in Cuba, Ruby meets with Vitali and they meet with the elderly and imprisoned Sicilian mobster Santos Alicante, who has been in jail in Cuba since the 1959 communist takeover after his casino hotel was closed down. Vitali tells Ruby that they are to spring Santos from Cuba to put him back in place in the USA as part of a complex operation plan. However, after their visit, Vitali accompanies Ruby back to his and Candy's hotel room where he secretly tells him the real reason for this assignment; he wants Ruby to kill Santos because the people that Vitali works for feel that Santos has outgrown his usefulness to them. Vitali gives Ruby an 8&nbsp;mm film camera that has a pistol encased in it to carry out the killing. But that evening, Ruby instead kills Vitali on the dock near the prison and springs Santos from his cell by bribing the guards, and then he, Santos, and Candy flee Cuba aboard Vitali's boat back to America. After arriving in New Orleans, Ruby makes contact with David Ferrie, an old friend from his days in Chicago, to supply him with the necessary papers enabling Santos to re-enter the country. Shortly after, Ruby and Candy return to Dallas, while Santos goes off on his own.\n\nSeveral months later, Ruby, still managing the Carousel Club in which Candy is now the star attraction, has an encounter one evening when Candy's estranged and abusive husband, Hank, shows up and confronts her after the show in her apartment, wanting her to return to him. Ruby beats up Candy/Sheryl Ann's husband and warns him never to come back to the club.\n\nThe next day, a mysterious man, identifying himself only by his name of 'Maxwell', pays a visit to Ruby at the currently closed club to talk with him about the killing of Vitali and of the release of Santos from Cuba. With a clearly implied threat of arrest and incarceration, Maxwell wants Ruby to redeem himself to the people that Maxwell works for by being an informant for him on Santos, who has since opened up a new hotel and casino in Las Vegas since his return to the United States as well as Santos' affiliates. Maxwell supplies Ruby with a mini-tape recorder to assist, and Ruby makes the assumption that Maxwell works for the CIA, which Maxwell neither denies or admits.\n\nRuby and Candy travel to Las Vegas and check into Santos' new hotel, where a gala event is taking place that involves a stage performance by singer Tony Montana. Ruby is also suspicious when a helicopter arrives and drops off the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, who is attending the event. Candy attends the event with David Ferrie, who sits with her at the table where the president is sitting, while Ruby sits with Santos and several like-minded people who are clearly connected to organized crime. Recording the conversation, the men want Ruby to smuggle into Cuba \"special cigars\" for [[Fidel Castro]] to assassinate him for the loss of all their casinos and business since the 1959 takeover. When Ruby excuses himself to go outside, he meets with Maxwell in the hotel parking lot, where he drives Ruby outside the city and reveals another assignment for him to partake in the assassination of a prominent official, implying it to be Castro.\n\nThe next day, Candy tells Ruby that the people that Santos works with want her to stay in Las Vegas to perform as a singer in their hotels, thanks to some presidential connections that she managed to get hold of. Ruby returns to Dallas alone, while he makes use of free time by shooting at watermelons and other targets from a distance in preparation for his next assassination assignment.\n\nSometime later, Ruby talks with Lenny, an old friend of his, about assignments for CIA associates and Lenny tells Ruby that to take out a \"target\" relies on two or more rifle marksmen and a \"patsy\" or \"[[fall guy]]\" to be caught in order to place all the blame for the crime to divert suspicion away from the investigating authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Diego the bartender meets with David Ferrie.
