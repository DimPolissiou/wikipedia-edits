It served as the colonial capital of the then Warri Province. It shares boundaries with [[Ughelli]]/[[Agbarho]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Okpe]], [[Udu]] and [[Uvwie]] although most of these places, notably Udu, Okpe and Uvwie, have been integrated to the larger cosmopolitan Warri. [[Osubi]] houses an airport that serves the city. [[Effurun]] serves as the gateway to and the economic nerve of the city.\n\nThe name ''Warri province'' was once applicable to the part of an area now called [[Delta State]] under the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria]]. Its boundary in the Northeast was Sapele/Udu creek near Ughelli and [[Aboh]], with [[For\u00e7ados River]] in the Southeast and Jameson Creek in the Southwest which later changed to [[Niger Delta Basin|Delta Province]]. Warri city is one of the major hubs of [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|petroleum activities and businesses in the southern Nigeria]]. It is a commercial capital city of Delta State, with a population of over 311,970 people according to the national population census figures for 2006.<ref name=\"nigeria gov\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.population.gov.ng/images/Vol%2003%20Table%20DSx%20LGAPop%20by%20SDistrict-PDF.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075911/http://www.population.gov.ng/images/Vol%2003%20Table%20DSx%20LGAPop%20by%20SDistrict-PDF.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city is one of cosmopolitan cities in southern Nigeria comprising originally of [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]], [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] people. Warri is predominantly Christian with mixture of African traditional religions like most of the Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique [[Nigerian Pidgin|Pidgin English]].\n\n==History==\n\nWarri was once a provincial capital to British rule. The Lagos and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria was formally united as Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria on 28 February 1906 and Walter Egerton was appointed as the Governor of new Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, holding office until 1912.[3] In the new Southern Nigeria, the old Lagos Colony became the Western Province, and the former Southern Nigerian Protectorate was split into a Central Province with capital at Warri and an Eastern Province with capital at Calabar.\n\nWarri sits on the bank of River Warri which joined River Forcados and River Escravos through Jones Creek in the lower Niger Delta Region. The city has a modern seaport which serves as the cargo transit point between the [[Niger River]] and the Atlantic Ocean for import and export. The city's history dates back to the 15th century, when it was visited by Portuguese missionaries. Subsequently, it served as the base for Portuguese and Dutch [[slave traders]]. Warri became a more important port city during the late 19th century, when it became a centre for the [[palm oil]] trade and other major items such as [[rubber]], palm products, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnut]]s, hides, and skins.<ref name=\"greatest cities\">http://www.greatestcities.com/Africa/Nigeria/Warri_city.html</ref>\n\nWarri was then established as a provincial headquarters by the British in the early 20th century.<ref name=ekeh>{{Cite book|last= Ekeh|first=Peter Palmer |title=Warri City and British Colonial Rule in Western Niger Delta |year=2005 |publisher=Urhobo Historical Society |isbn=978-064-924-7 |pages=31 |authorlink= Peter Palmer Ekeh}}</ref> There have been a tremendous growth in the population; it has grown from being a rural area to an urban area.\n\n==Demographics==\nWarri is regarded as a modern metropolitan area with expanded infrastructural development in other local government areas such as [[Uvwie]], [[Udu]], and [[Okpe]] in recent years, with various road networks linking these places into one. Each of these areas has its own administrative structure.  Warri City is residence to four monarchs namely the Olu of Warri (Itsekiri), Orosuen (Ovie) of the Okere-Urhobo Kingdom (Urhobo), the Ovie of Agbarha Kingdom (Urhobo) and the Pere of Ogbe Ijaw Kingdom (Ijaw).\n\nThe major people in Warri comprise the [[Urhobo people|Urhobos]], [[Ijaw people|Ijaws]] and [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiris]]. However, due to its urban status, there is a large influx of people from all over the country, most notably the Igbos.\n\n==Climate==\nThe region experiences moderate rainfall and moderate humidity for most part of the year. The climate is monsoonal and is marked by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool \"harmattan\" dusty haze from the north-east winds. The rainy season spans May to October with a brief dry spell in August, but it frequently rains even in the dry season. The area is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 32.8&nbsp;\u00b0C and annual rainfall amount of 2768.8&nbsp;mm. There are high temperatures of 28&nbsp;\u00b0C and 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. The natural vegetation is of rain forest with swamp forest in some areas. The forest is rich in timber trees, palm trees, as well as fruit trees.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Warri\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high C = 31.5\n|Feb high C = 32.2\n|Mar high C = 32.4\n|Apr high C = 32.2\n|May high C = 31.5\n|Jun high C = 30.0\n|Jul high C = 28.4\n|Aug high C = 28.4\n|Sep high C = 28.8\n|Oct high C = 30.0\n|Nov high C = 31.4\n|Dec high C = 31.5\n|year high C = 30.7\n|Jan mean C = 26.8\n|Feb mean C = 27.5\n|Mar mean C = 27.9\n|Apr mean C = 28.0\n|May mean C = 27.3\n|Jun mean C = 26.3\n|Jul mean C = 25.2\n|Aug mean C = 25.3\n|Sep mean C = 25.5\n|Oct mean C = 26.3\n|Nov mean C = 27.1\n|Dec mean C = 26.8\n|year mean C = 26.7\n|Jan low C = 22.1\n|Feb low C = 22.9\n|Mar low C = 23.5\n|Apr low C = 23.8\n|May low C = 23.1\n|Jun low C = 22.6\n|Jul low C = 21.0\n|Aug low C = 22.3\n|Sep low C = 22.3\n|Oct low C = 22.6\n|Nov low C = 22.9\n|Dec low C = 22.2\n|year low C = 22.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 30\n|Feb precipitation mm = 58\n|Mar precipitation mm = 127\n|Apr precipitation mm = 201\n|May precipitation mm = 270\n|Jun precipitation mm = 367\n|Jul precipitation mm = 474\n|Aug precipitation mm = 324\n|Sep precipitation mm = 457\n|Oct precipitation mm = 325\n|Nov precipitation mm = 104\n|Dec precipitation mm = 31\n|year precipitation mm = 2768\n|source 1 = Climate-Data.Org<ref name = Climate-Data.Org>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://en.climate-data.org/location/513/\n| title = Climate: Warri\n| publisher = [[Climate-Data.org]]\n| accessdate = 29 October 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\nThere is the Warri Refinery and Petrochemicals located at Ekpan with the majority of international and local oil companies operating in Nigeria having their operational offices close by.

It served as the colonial capital of the then Warri Province. It shares boundaries with [[Ughelli]]/[[Agbarho]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Okpe]], [[Udu]] and [[Uvwie]] although most of these places, notably Udu, Okpe and Uvwie, have been integrated to the larger cosmopolitan Warri. [[Osubi]] houses an airport that serves the city. [[Effurun]] serves as the gateway to and the economic nerve of the city.\n\nThe name ''Warri province'' was once applicable to the part of an area now called [[Delta State]] under the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria]]. Its boundary in the Northeast was Sapele/Udu creek near Ughelli and [[Aboh]], with [[For\u00e7ados River]] in the Southeast and Jameson Creek in the Southwest which later changed to [[Niger Delta Basin|Delta Province]]. Warri city is one of the major hubs of [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|petroleum activities and businesses in the southern Nigeria]]. It is a commercial capital city of Delta State, with a population of over 311,970 people according to the national population census figures for 2006.<ref name=\"nigeria gov\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.population.gov.ng/images/Vol%2003%20Table%20DSx%20LGAPop%20by%20SDistrict-PDF.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075911/http://www.population.gov.ng/images/Vol%2003%20Table%20DSx%20LGAPop%20by%20SDistrict-PDF.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city is one of cosmopolitan cities in southern Nigeria comprising originally of [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]], [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] people. Warri is predominantly Christian with mixture of African traditional religions like most of the Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique [[Nigerian Pidgin|Pidgin English]].\n\n==History==\n\nWarri was once a provincial capital to British rule. The Lagos and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria was formally united as Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria on 28 February 1906 and Walter Egerton was appointed as the Governor of new Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, holding office until 1912.[3] In the new Southern Nigeria, the old Lagos Colony became the Western Province, and the former Southern Nigerian Protectorate was split into a Central Province with capital at Warri and an Eastern Province with capital at Calabar.\n\nWarri sits on the bank of River Warri which joined River Forcados and River Escravos through Jones Creek in the lower Niger Delta Region. The city has a modern seaport which serves as the cargo transit point between the [[Niger River]] and the Atlantic Ocean for import and export. The city's history dates back to the 15th century, when it was visited by Portuguese missionaries. Subsequently, it served as the base for Portuguese and Dutch [[slave traders]]. Warri became a more important port city during the late 19th century, when it became a centre for the [[palm oil]] trade and other major items such as [[rubber]], palm products, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnut]]s, hides, and skins.<ref name=\"greatest cities\">http://www.greatestcities.com/Africa/Nigeria/Warri_city.html</ref>\n\nWarri was then established as a provincial headquarters by the British in the early 20th century.<ref name=ekeh>{{Cite book|last= Ekeh|first=Peter Palmer |title=Warri City and British Colonial Rule in Western Niger Delta |year=2005 |publisher=Urhobo Historical Society |isbn=978-064-924-7 |pages=31 |authorlink= Peter Palmer Ekeh}}</ref> There have been a tremendous growth in the population; it has grown from being a rural area to an urban area.\n\n==Demographics==\nWarri is regarded as a modern metropolitan area with expanded infrastructural development in other local government areas such as [[Uvwie]], [[Udu]], and [[Okpe]] in recent years, with various road networks linking these places into one. Each of these areas has its own administrative structure.  Warri City is residence to four monarchs namely the Olu of Warri (Itsekiri), Orosuen (Ovie) of the Okere-Urhobo Kingdom (Urhobo), the Ovie of Agbarha Kingdom (Urhobo) and the Pere of Ogbe Ijaw Kingdom (Ijaw).\n\nThe major people in Warri comprise the [[Urhobo people|Urhobos]], [[Ijaw people|Ijaws]] and [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiris]]. However, due to its urban status, there is a large influx of people from all over the country, most notably the Igbos.\n\n==Climate==\nThe region experiences moderate rainfall and moderate humidity for most part of the year. The climate is monsoonal and is marked by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool \"harmattan\" dusty haze from the north-east winds. The rainy season spans May to October with a brief dry spell in August, but it frequently rains even in the dry season. The area is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 32.8&nbsp;\u00b0C and annual rainfall amount of 2768.8&nbsp;mm. There are high temperatures of 28&nbsp;\u00b0C and 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. The natural vegetation is of rain forest with swamp forest in some areas. The forest is rich in timber trees, palm trees, as well as fruit trees.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Warri\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high C = 31.5\n|Feb high C = 32.2\n|Mar high C = 32.4\n|Apr high C = 32.2\n|May high C = 31.5\n|Jun high C = 30.0\n|Jul high C = 28.4\n|Aug high C = 28.4\n|Sep high C = 28.8\n|Oct high C = 30.0\n|Nov high C = 31.4\n|Dec high C = 31.5\n|year high C = 30.7\n|Jan mean C = 26.8\n|Feb mean C = 27.5\n|Mar mean C = 27.9\n|Apr mean C = 28.0\n|May mean C = 27.3\n|Jun mean C = 26.3\n|Jul mean C = 25.2\n|Aug mean C = 25.3\n|Sep mean C = 25.5\n|Oct mean C = 26.3\n|Nov mean C = 27.1\n|Dec mean C = 26.8\n|year mean C = 26.7\n|Jan low C = 22.1\n|Feb low C = 22.9\n|Mar low C = 23.5\n|Apr low C = 23.8\n|May low C = 23.1\n|Jun low C = 22.6\n|Jul low C = 21.0\n|Aug low C = 22.3\n|Sep low C = 22.3\n|Oct low C = 22.6\n|Nov low C = 22.9\n|Dec low C = 22.2\n|year low C = 22.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 30\n|Feb precipitation mm = 58\n|Mar precipitation mm = 127\n|Apr precipitation mm = 201\n|May precipitation mm = 270\n|Jun precipitation mm = 367\n|Jul precipitation mm = 474\n|Aug precipitation mm = 324\n|Sep precipitation mm = 457\n|Oct precipitation mm = 325\n|Nov precipitation mm = 104\n|Dec precipitation mm = 31\n|year precipitation mm = 2768\n|source 1 = Climate-Data.Org<ref name = Climate-Data.Org>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://en.climate-data.org/location/513/\n| title = Climate: Warri\n| publisher = [[Climate-Data.org]]\n| accessdate = 29 October 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\nThere is the Warri Refinery and Petrochemicals located at Ekpan with the majority of international and local oil companies operating in Nigeria having their operational offices close by.

The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

The area is crossed with rivers and the city itself is only {{convert|15|km}} north of [[Lake Skadar]]. The [[Mora\u010da River|Mora\u010da]] and [[Ribnica River|Ribnica]] rivers flow through the city, while the [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Cijevna River|Cijevna]], [[Sitnica River|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] flow nearby. ''Mora\u010da'' is the largest river in the city, being {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide near downtown, and having carved a {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} deep canyon for the length of its course through the city. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Except for the Mora\u010da and Zeta, other rivers have an appearance of small creeks. The richness in bodies of water is a major feature of the city.\n\nIn contrast to most of Montenegro, Podgorica lies in a mainly flat area at the northern end of the Zeta plain, at an elevation of {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The only exceptions are hills which overlook the city. The most significant is {{convert|130.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high '''Gorica Hill''' ({{IPA-sh|\u02c8\u0261\u01d2rit\u035csa|pron}}), city's namesake, which rises above the city centre. The other hills include ''Malo brdo'' (\"little hill\", {{convert|205.4|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), ''Velje brdo'' (\"big hill\", {{convert|283|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), ''Ljubovi\u0107'' ({{convert|101|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and ''Dajbapska gora'' ({{convert|172|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). For the most part, these are too steep for development and thus limit the city's expansion, especially to the north. However, urbanization has been encroaching on the lower slopes of the hills since the 1990s. \nPodgorica city proper has an area of {{convert|108|km2|sqmi}}, while actual urbanized area is much smaller.\n\n<gallery>\nPodgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(14).jpg|[[Mora\u010da]] river canyon.\nLago Skadar, Montenegro, 2014-04-14, DD 01.JPG|[[Lake Skadar]]\nNijagara_-_panoramio.jpg|River Cijevna waterfalls near Podgorica\nZagoric.JPG|Podgorica panoramic view.\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Podgorica, piazza repubblica.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Republic Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]].]]\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Podgorica has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' instead of ''Csa''), since there is only one summer month with less than {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} of precipitation,<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

Although the city is only some {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[Adriatic Sea]], an arm of the Mediterranean, [[Rumija]] mountain acts as a natural [[Dinaric Alps]] barrier, separating Skadar Lake basin and Podgorica area from the sea, thus limiting temperate maritime influence on the local climate.\n\nThe mean annual rainfall is {{convert|1659|mm|in|abbr=on}}, making Podgorica by far wettest capital in Europe, [[Ljubljana]] being second with {{convert|1362|mm|in|abbr=on}}. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The temperature exceeds {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} on about 135 days each year and the median daily temperature is {{convert|15.6|\u00b0C|1}}. The number of rainy days is about 120, and those with a strong wind around 60. An occasional strong northerly wind influences the climate in the winter, with a [[wind chill]] effect lowering the perceived temperature by a few degrees. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe all-time maximum snowfall record was beaten on 11 February 2012, when {{convert|58|cm|0|abbr=on}} of snowfall were measured.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west.

Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments.

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961.

This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there. According to the 2011 census, there are 185,937 people in Podgorica Capital City, which is analogous to metropolitan area, and includes the small towns of [[Tuzi]] and [[Golubovci]], while 150,977 people live within the city proper.\n\nOut of the total population of Podgorica, 48.73% are male, while 51.27% are female. The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority. [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] won 17 seats, [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|SNP]] won 8 seats, while coalition made of [[Positive Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]] won 5 seats. After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica.

In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education.

The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]].

The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport.

The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west. Residential and infrastructural developments in the SFRY era have mostly shaped the layout of today's Podgorica, and accommodated the unprecedented population growth that followed World War II. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nSaborniHram.JPG|[[Roman Square (Podgorica)|Roman Square]] and [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].\nMost_Bla\u017ea_Jovanovi\u0107a.jpg|[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107 Bridge]] over the Mora\u010da.\nPodgorica_EKIP_and_Prva_TV_IMG_1286_82_Bulevar_D%C5%BEord%C5%BEa_Va%C5%A1ingtona.JPG|Office building at George Washington Street\nBlok_5_i_6.jpg|Highrise housing in Podgorica.\nDelta City - panoramio.jpg|[[Delta Holding|Delta Shopping Mall]].\nBulevar Svetog Petra Cetinjskog, 2019.jpg|[[Peter I of Montenegro|St Peter of Cetinje]] Boulevard\nAerodromPodgorica.jpg|[[Podgorica Airport]]\nMora\u010da Sports Center.jpg|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]]\n</gallery>\n\nA major advance in Podgorica architecture began in the late 1990s and, since then, the face of the city has changed rapidly. Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments. New landmarks include the ''Hristovog Vaskrsenja'' [[Orthodox temple (church)|orthodox temple]] and the [[Millennium Bridge, Podgorica|Millennium Bridge]], the main feature of the Podgorica skyline. \n{{wide image|Dva_mosta_Podgorica_banner.jpg|1400px|A panoramic view of the [[Moscow bridge]] (right) and the [[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]] (left).

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.\n* The [[Marko Miljanov]] Museum (''Muzej Marka Miljanova'') in [[Medun]] shows life in 19th century Montenegro. \n* The Natural History Museum (''Prirodnja\u010dki muzej'') displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there.

The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority.

After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica. It is home to the [[University of Montenegro]], the country's most significant such institution. The following faculties are in Podgorica:\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Faculty of Electrical Engineering]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology|Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Political Sciences|Faculty of Political Sciences]]\n* Faculty of [[Civil Engineering]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n* Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]] and [[Mathematics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Biotechnology|Faculty of Biotechnology]]\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe university's scientific research institutes are in the city:\n* Institute of Foreign Languages\n* Institute of Biotechnology\n* Institute of History\n\nThe [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] is in Podgorica, as is the [[Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts|DANU]] cultural organization.\n\nThe [[Mediterranean University]] was founded 2006 as first private university in Montenegro. In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education. The Radosav Ljumovi\u0107 National Library is considered the most comprehensive in Montenegro.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:PGWelcome.jpg|thumb|left|Northern entrance to Podgorica ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]).]]\n[[File:Millennium Bridge in Podgorica, Montenegro 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]].]]\nPublic transport in Podgorica consists of 11 urban and 16 suburban bus lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |title=Saobra\u0107aj |publisher=Podgorica.me |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325043642/http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |archivedate=25 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city-owned ''AD Gradski saobra\u0107aj'' public transport company used to be the sole bus operator until the 1990s, when private carriers were introduced. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]]. The [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway|Belgrade\u2013Bar]] line converges with the [[Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway|line to Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway|line to Shkod\u00ebr]] at the [[Podgorica Rail Station]]. The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport. The airport is locally known as Golubovci Airport (\u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 / Aerodrom Golubovci), as it is located within the administrative boundaries of the town of [[Golubovci]]. The IATA code of the airport is still TGD because Podgorica was named Titograd, during which time the airport opened.

With McGrady and Hill together, the Magic were expected to be a force in the East. However, Hill was limited to 4 games because of an ankle injury. McGrady blossomed into a star during the season, becoming one of the NBA's top scorers. With the addition of [[Mike Miller (basketball player)|Mike Miller]] from the draft, the Magic compiled a 43\u201339 record, which included a nine-game winning streak, and once again made the playoffs.

However, led by the erratic play of Francis, the Magic also lost to league teams with losing records. Howard showed great promise, becoming one of the few players to average a double-double. Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season. In addition, Nelson, after a slow start, developed into a talented player, taking over the starting point guard position. Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game. Hill was chosen an All-Star starter by NBA fans for the 2005 All-Star Game, and Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson were named to the All-Rookie first and second teams, respectively.

Grant Hill was supposedly finally healed from his multiple ankle surgeries. [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Jameer Nelson]] showed excellent progress during summer-league play. Second round draft pick [[Travis Diener]] showed excellent shooting and decision making during the summer. And the free agent signing of [[Keyon Dooling]] showed that the club was going to continue making progress. Then trouble began. Hill, despite his ankle apparently being healed, suffered a painful sports hernia injury that would hamper his play throughout the entire season. After playing in three preseason games, he underwent surgery to correct the hernia and would not appear during the regular season until mid-December, to which he lasted a month before attempting to make another comeback in February and early March, however he only played sporadically. Then a foot injury to Nelson forced him to sit out over a month.\n\nOn February 15, 2006, the Magic announced that they had acquired [[Darko Mili\u010di\u0107]] and [[Carlos Arroyo]] from the [[Detroit Pistons]] in exchange for [[Kelvin Cato]] and a [[2007 NBA draft|2007]] top-five protected first-round draft pick. One week later, on February 22, the Magic announced that they had traded [[Steve Francis]] to the [[New York Knicks]] in exchange for [[Anfernee Hardaway]] (whom they waived two days later) and [[Trevor Ariza]]. With a set starting rotation of Battie, Howard, T\u00fcrko\u011flu, [[DeShawn Stevenson]], and Nelson, the Magic mounted a surprising run at the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, including an 8-game winning streak and 12 consecutive home wins. The streak included wins against NBA powerhouses Detroit, San Antonio, Dallas and Miami, as well as a game against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in which Howard recorded 28 points and a career-high 26 rebounds. Despite their efforts they did not make the playoffs.\n\n====2006\u20132010: Return to the NBA Finals====\n[[File:J. J. Redick.jpg|thumb|right|[[JJ Redick]] in 2008]]\nWith the 11th overall pick in the [[2006 NBA draft]], the Magic took the former Duke star [[JJ Redick]]. Even with the fan support to get him playing time he averaged just over 11 minutes a game. After beginning the season strong with a 13\u20134 record, the Orlando Magic began to suffer in the standings as the result of multiple losses, due in large part to the injuries of Tony Battie, Keyon Dooling, and Grant Hill. The Magic were also hampered with the sporadic play of many of their young stars, who on multiple occasions showed their propensity for streaky shooting and the team's lack of a solid scoring two-guard. Despite the team's poor play, Dwight Howard continued to develop and blossom in his third year in the league, culminating in his first selection to the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The final few weeks of the season saw the Magic build momentum and confidence with an impressive late push towards the Playoffs. On April 15, 2007, with an 88\u201386 victory over the [[Boston Celtics]], the Magic secured its first berth in the NBA Playoffs since 2003 by locking up the 8th seed in the Eastern Conference. This marked the first time that the team had made the playoffs while posting a losing record. Nevertheless, their Playoff run ended on April 28, 2007 after they were swept in the first round by first seeded [[Detroit Pistons]] whose experience, veteran leadership and ability to consistently make the clutch basket proved far too much for the undermanned and overwhelmed Magic to overcome. It was announced on May 23, 2007, that [[Brian Hill (basketball coach)|Brian Hill]] had been fired as head coach of the Magic.\n\nOn June 1, 2007, the Magic signed [[Billy Donovan]] to be their head coach for five years. The next day, Donovan wished to be released from the contract and the Magic agreed several days later. On June 6, 2007, the Magic signed a 4-year contract with [[Stan Van Gundy]]. In the [[free agent]] market, the Magic signed [[Rashard Lewis]] of the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] to a six-year league-maximum contract believed to be worth over $110 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2932827|title=Sonics, Magic complete sign-and-trade for Rashard Lewis|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> At the NBA China Games, the Magic swept the three games in China, twice against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and once against the Chinese national team in games held in Shanghai and in [[Macau]].\n\nOn November 15, 2007, Bob Vander Weide, the son-in-law of Richard DeVos, officially took over as owner of the team, although ownership is still split evenly amongst Richard DeVos' other children as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/basketball/magic/orl-mnotes1507nov15,0,15219.story|title=Magic's Vander Weide officially takes over reins from owner Rich DeVos|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Magic started the [[2007\u201308 NBA season]] with an impressive 16\u20134 record in their first 20 games, which included wins over the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. Through the next few months, the Magic were not so successful, splitting their next 36 games with 18 wins and 18 losses. At the start of March, the Magic seemed to pick up speed again, finishing the month with 10 wins, the first time since November that they won 10 or more in a month. The Magic clinched the [[Southeast Division (NBA)|Southeast Division]] title when the [[Washington Wizards]] were routed at [[Utah Jazz|Utah]] 129\u201387 on March 31, 2008. It was the Magic's third division title, but only their first since 1995\u201396 season, as well as their first since the Southeast Division was formed. They also earned their 50th win of the season against the [[Chicago Bulls]] on April 13, which had not happened since the 1995\u201396 season. The Magic finished the regular season 52\u201330, their best season since 1995\u201396. With the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference, they were matched up in their first round playoff series against the [[Toronto Raptors]]. The Magic had home court advantage for the first time since the 1998\u201399 season.\n\nOn April 28, 2008, at [[Amway Arena]], the Magic eliminated the Raptors with a 4\u20131 series victory in the first round. It was the first playoff series victory for the Magic in 12 years after 6 straight first round exits. The run of success did not last long as they fell 4\u20131 to the experienced [[Detroit Pistons]] in the second round. With the Magic already down in the series, controversy erupted after the Pistons' Game 2 victory. At the conclusion of the 3rd quarter, [[Chauncey Billups]] of the Pistons made a three-point shot giving the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped just as the play began. NBA rules prohibit officials from using instant replay or any timing device to determine how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay allowed to be viewed from the time of the malfunction to when the play ends, when the game clock has not expired. Because of the rule, the officials then estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, and because there were 5.1 seconds remaining when play began, the field goal was allowed to be counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket in question should not have counted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3384577|title=After review, NBA says Billups' 3-pointer should not have counted|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> The Pistons went on to win Game 2. The Magic were able to win Game 3, with the Pistons' Chauncey Billups out for most of the game with an injury, but were unable to take advantage of his absence and defeat the Pistons in Games 4 and 5, which ended the Magic's playoff run in 2008.\n\nThe first half of the [[2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season|2008\u201309 season]] went very well for the Magic. After 41 games, the Magic were 33\u20138, leading the Southeast Division, as well as having one of the top four records in the league. At the start of February, [[Jameer Nelson]], their all-star starting point guard, went down with a shoulder injury. He was expected to miss the remainder of the season. After trading for [[Rafer Alston]], the Magic finished the regular season with a 59\u201323 record, it was the most games the team had won in a season since the 1995\u201396 season in which they had 60 wins. In the playoffs, the Magic beat the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the first round of the [[2009 NBA playoffs|playoffs]] and then the defending champions, the [[Boston Celtics]], in the Eastern Conference semifinals, behind assistant coach [[Patrick Ewing]]'s guarantee that they would win Game 7 of that series.<ref name=\"Magic Moment: Orlando beats Boston to advance\"/> In their first conference finals since 1996, the Magic beat the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], which were led by the season's MVP, [[LeBron James]]. After dropping the first two games in the [[2009 NBA Finals|Finals]] against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], the Magic finally won their first ever game in the Finals in Game 3. Despite Nelson's return to the team for the Finals, the Lakers won the series and the championship by beating the Magic in five games.\n\nIn the 2009 off-season, Orlando traded [[Rafer Alston]], [[Tony Battie]], and [[Courtney Lee]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in exchange for eight-time [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] [[Vince Carter]] and [[Ryan Anderson (basketball, born 1988)|Ryan Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4287197|title=New Jersey Nets ship Vince Carter to Orlando Magic for Rafer Alston, rookie Courtney Lee|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]], as part of a [[sign-and-trade]], was sent to the [[Toronto Raptors]].

Carter's injury turned out to be not too serious, but caused him to miss the next five games. Another setback came in mid-November, when [[Jameer Nelson]] injured his left knee, which required arthroscopic surgery to repair. Nelson would be out for five weeks. Despite all of this, the Magic had a 23\u20138 record at the end of December.\n\nOrlando lost seven of their first ten games in January, but recovered well enough to post a winning record for the month by winning six of their next seven. Following the All-Star break, the Magic went on a roll, winning 23 of their 28 remaining games, clinching their fourth consecutive playoff berth and winning their third consecutive division championship in the process. The Magic finished the regular season with a 59\u201323 record, matching their record from the 2008\u201309 season, and finishing with not only the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, but the second-best record in the entire league. The team became one of the only teams in NBA history to beat all of the other 29 teams at least once during the regular season. The Magic swept the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] and the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the first two rounds of the [[2010 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], respectively. They then faced the [[Boston Celtics]] in the conference finals. After losing the first three games of the series, Orlando managed to win the next two games, but lost on the road in Game 6, ending their season.\n\n====2010\u20132012: \"Dwightmare\" saga====\n[[File:Scott Skiles bench cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Scott Skiles coached the Magic in the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].]]\nIn anticipation of the team's move to [[Amway Center]], the Magic updated its logo. They retained the streaking ball logo, but changed the wordmark taken from their current uniforms. The Magic hosted the NBA All-Star Game in 2012. The Magic also unveiled black alternate uniforms.\n\nIn the summer of 2010 the Orlando Magic signed [[Chris Duhon]], formerly of the New York Knicks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehoops.com/blog/?p=6157 |title=Magic sign Chris Duhon |publisher=InsideHoops |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref> and [[Quentin Richardson]], formerly of the Miami Heat.\n\nOn December 18, 2010, having lost five of their last six games, the Magic made a blockbuster trade deal with the [[Phoenix Suns]] and the [[Washington Wizards]]. They traded [[Vince Carter]], [[Marcin Gortat]] and [[Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus]] to Phoenix for [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] (who led them into the 2009 NBA Finals when they lost 4\u20131 against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]), [[Jason Richardson]] and [[Earl Clark]]. [[Rashard Lewis]] was traded to Washington for 3-time All-Star [[Gilbert Arenas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5932861 |title=Sources: Magic trade for Gilbert Arenas |date=December 18, 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Magic finished the season with 52 victories, good for 2nd in the Southeast Division. But they were ousted in six games by the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the first round of the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]], the first time head coach [[Stan Van Gundy]] was eliminated early in the playoffs.\n\nIn a shortened 2012 season, due to the NBA Lockout, the Magic started the offseason on a rocky note, with their All-Star center, [[Dwight Howard]], requesting a trade to either the [[New Jersey Nets]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]], or [[Dallas Mavericks]]. Overlooking the trade request the Magic did a sign and trade with the Boston Celtics for [[Glen Davis (basketball)|Glen Davis]] and [[Von Wafer]] in exchange for [[Brandon Bass]]. The Magic also amnestied [[Gilbert Arenas]] and signed [[Larry Hughes]], [[Justin Harper (basketball)|Justin Harper]], and [[DeAndre Liggins]]. The Magic started the season on Christmas Day in [[Oklahoma City]] against the [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]]. They lost the season opener 89\u201397. During the month of February, the Magic waived Hughes and signed [[Ish Smith]]. On February 26, Orlando hosted the 2012 All-Star Game. The Magic struggled to win games consistently, with concerns about the uncertainty of Dwight Howard's future with the franchise. However, after Dwight rescinded his trade demand and signed a one-year deal in March, the Magic seemed to find their footing again. But then in early April, shortly after it became public that Howard requested coach Van Gundy to be replaced, the center was diagnosed with a herniated disk and forced to have back surgery, thus ending his season. The Magic clinched the sixth seed in the east with a 37\u201329 record. The Magic were faced with the third seeded Pacers in the first round. Despite winning the first game of the series the Magic were defeated 4\u20131.\n\nOn May 21, 2012, it was reported that general manager [[Otis Smith (basketball)|Otis Smith]] and head coach [[Stan Van Gundy]] would part ways with the organization.

It was originally known as the Orlando Arena, or the \"O-Rena\", during its first 10 years. In 1999, TD Waterhouse purchased the naming rights and named the venue the TD Waterhouse Centre.

The logo, featuring a basketball crowded by stars and the wordmark \"Magic\" with a star replacing the A, was created following meetings with Walt Disney World artists and over 5000 suggestions sent from around the country.<ref name=logo/> Stars would remain a primary feature of the logo once it was redesigned in 2000 to feature a comet-like basketball.

Beginning with the 2019\u201320 season, the black uniform became the \"Icon\" uniform while a new blue uniform served as the \"Statement\" uniform. The uniform was inspired from the different sets the Magic wore through the years, such as the silver star and black stripes with white pinstripes from the 1989\u201398 set, and the cleaner look of the 2003\u201308 set.

Another ingredient to the rivalry was the high-caliber players on both teams such as Orlando's [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]] to Miami's [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Tim Hardaway]]. The two had met each other in the NBA playoffs for the first time in [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]], with Miami beating Orlando 3\u20132, they have not met in the playoffs since.\n\nThe rivalry intensified with the rising stardom of Miami's and Orlando's [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Dwight Howard]], along with Miami's acquiring high-caliber stars such [[LeBron James]] from the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Chris Bosh]] from the [[Toronto Raptors]] and in 2010, resulting in fierce competition between the two.\n\nWhen Dwight Howard departed from the Magic to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in August 2012, the rivalry softened. The Orlando Magic are undergoing a process of rebuilding, however, competition still remains tense.\n\n===Atlanta Hawks===\nThe [[Atlanta Hawks]] and the Orlando Magic had an intense rivalry, mostly stemming from playoff competitions and the rising stardom of [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Josh Smith]], both from the [[2004 NBA draft]] and who were both raised in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\nThe two teams faced each other three times in the [[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]], and [[2011 NBA Playoffs|2011 NBA playoffs]]. The Magic defeated the Hawks in the second round of the 1996 playoffs 4\u20131, and swept the second round series 4\u20130 in the 2010 playoffs, while the Hawks eliminated the Magic 4\u20132 in the first round of the corresponding 2011 playoffs.\n\n==Media==\n{{main|List of Orlando Magic broadcasters}}\n\n===Television===\nThe current television announce team for the Orlando Magic is play-by-play announcer [[David Steele (sports announcer)|David Steele]] and color analyst [[Jeff Turner]]. Turner played for the Magic from its inaugural 1989 season to 1996. [[Paul Kennedy (broadcaster)|Paul Kennedy]] and Dante Marchetelli serve as courtside reporters, while Marchetelli, former coach Brian Hill, and former Magic player [[Nick Anderson]] host the pre-game, halftime and post-game shows. Television broadcasts were split in 2007\u201308 between [[Fox Sports Florida]] and Sun Sports (now [[Fox Sports Sun]]). In the 18 years before then, broadcasts were split between Sun Sports (formerly known as the Sunshine Network) and local television stations, originally [[WKCF]] and, later, [[WRBW]].\n\nThere was a controversy with moving broadcasts to Fox Sports Florida since Orlando's largest cable TV provider, [[Bright House Networks]], did not carry the network. Pressure increased for the cable provider to pick up FS Florida in time for the 2007\u201308 NBA season but this did not happen. The Magic persisted with airing games on FS Florida into the 2008\u201309 season despite Bright House's refusal to pick up the channel in all of its affiliates. Bright House and FS Florida came to an agreement on January 1, 2009 and began airing the channel as part of its standard cable package. However, Bright House airs the channel using a digital signal that only allows customers who own the Digital cable box to receive the channel. The customers do not have to pay any additional costs to get the channel with their Digital cable box.\n\nAs of the 2012\u201313 season, all Magic games are now on Fox Sports Florida.\n\n===Radio===\nThe current radio announce team for the Orlando Magic is play-by-play announcer [[Dennis Neumann]] and color analyst [[Richie Adubato]], another former Magic head coach. Games are produced by Magic Radio Network flagship AM 580 [[WDBO (AM)|WDBO]] in Orlando, and also broadcast on AM 1380 [[WELE]] in Daytona Beach, 99.5 FM [[WGMW]] \"The Star\" in Gainesville and Ocala, AM 1290 [[WPCF]] in Panama City, AM 1590 [[WPSL (AM)|WPSL]] in Port St. Lucie and AM 1450 [[WSTU]] in Stuart. The affiliate in Tallahassee is AM 1270 \"My 94.3\" [[WTLY]]. The immediate Tampa Bay area has no affiliate although AM 1340 in Clearwater [[WTAN]] is listed on the team's website.\n\nThe flagship broadcast was simulcast on [[WDBO-FM]] during the 2011\u201312 NBA season while that station moved from AM to FM. When WDBO-AM re-formatted from [[talk radio]] to [[sports radio]], it retained the flagship status. However, WDBO-FM still simulcasts Magic games in Central Florida.\n\nJoey Colon and Ram\u00f3n Rivas do Spanish-language commentary on AM 1030 [[WONQ]] \"La Grande\" in Orlando.\n\n===Podcasts===\nThe official Orlando Magic website features a collection of podcasts available on [[iTunes]], including \"Magic Overtime with Dante and Galante\".\n\n===Final Notes===\nThe Orlando Magic are one of the most supported teams and according to head coach of the San Antonio Spurs, Greg Popovich \"The [Orlando] Magic have an incredible batch of young stars, including Fultz, Isaac and Gordon, who, I believe, will be the future of the franchise and if given the right tools may one day become stars themselves\".\n\n==Leaders==\n===Franchise leaders===\n'''Bold''' denotes still active with

However, led by the erratic play of Francis, the Magic also lost to league teams with losing records. Howard showed great promise, becoming one of the few players to average a double-double. Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season. In addition, Nelson, after a slow start, developed into a talented player, taking over the starting point guard position. Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game.

Grant Hill was supposedly finally healed from his multiple ankle surgeries. [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Jameer Nelson]] showed excellent progress during summer-league play. Second round draft pick [[Travis Diener]] showed excellent shooting and decision making during the summer. And the free agent signing of [[Keyon Dooling]] showed that the club was going to continue making progress. Then trouble began. Hill, despite his ankle apparently being healed, suffered a painful sports hernia injury that would hamper his play throughout the entire season. After playing in three preseason games, he underwent surgery to correct the hernia and would not appear during the regular season until mid-December, to which he lasted a month before attempting to make another comeback in February and early March, however he only played sporadically. Then a foot injury to Nelson forced him to sit out over a month.\n\nOn February 15, 2006, the Magic announced that they had acquired [[Darko Mili\u010di\u0107]] and [[Carlos Arroyo]] from the [[Detroit Pistons]] in exchange for [[Kelvin Cato]] and a [[2007 NBA draft|2007]] top-five protected first-round draft pick. One week later, on February 22, the Magic announced that they had traded [[Steve Francis]] to the [[New York Knicks]] in exchange for [[Anfernee Hardaway]] (whom they waived two days later) and [[Trevor Ariza]]. With a set starting rotation of Battie, Howard, T\u00fcrko\u011flu, [[DeShawn Stevenson]], and Nelson, the Magic mounted a surprising run at the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, including an 8-game winning streak and 12 consecutive home wins. The streak included wins against NBA powerhouses Detroit, San Antonio, Dallas and Miami, as well as a game against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in which Howard recorded 28 points and a career-high 26 rebounds. Despite their efforts they did not make the playoffs.\n\n====2006\u20132010: Return to the NBA Finals====\n[[File:J. J. Redick.jpg|thumb|right|[[JJ Redick]] in 2008]]\nWith the 11th overall pick in the [[2006 NBA draft]], the Magic took the former Duke star [[JJ Redick]]. Even with the fan support to get him playing time he averaged just over 11 minutes a game. After beginning the season strong with a 13\u20134 record, the Orlando Magic began to suffer in the standings as the result of multiple losses, due in large part to the injuries of Tony Battie, Keyon Dooling, and Grant Hill. The Magic were also hampered with the sporadic play of many of their young stars, who on multiple occasions showed their propensity for streaky shooting and the team's lack of a solid scoring two-guard. Despite the team's poor play, Dwight Howard continued to develop and blossom in his third year in the league, culminating in his first selection to the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The final few weeks of the season saw the Magic build momentum and confidence with an impressive late push towards the Playoffs. On April 15, 2007, with an 88\u201386 victory over the [[Boston Celtics]], the Magic secured its first berth in the NBA Playoffs since 2003 by locking up the 8th seed in the Eastern Conference. This marked the first time that the team had made the playoffs while posting a losing record. Nevertheless, their Playoff run ended on April 28, 2007 after they were swept in the first round by first seeded [[Detroit Pistons]] whose experience, veteran leadership and ability to consistently make the clutch basket proved far too much for the undermanned and overwhelmed Magic to overcome. It was announced on May 23, 2007, that [[Brian Hill (basketball coach)|Brian Hill]] had been fired as head coach of the Magic.\n\nOn June 1, 2007, the Magic signed [[Billy Donovan]] to be their head coach for five years. The next day, Donovan wished to be released from the contract and the Magic agreed several days later. On June 6, 2007, the Magic signed a 4-year contract with [[Stan Van Gundy]]. In the [[free agent]] market, the Magic signed [[Rashard Lewis]] of the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] to a six-year league-maximum contract believed to be worth over $110 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2932827|title=Sonics, Magic complete sign-and-trade for Rashard Lewis|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> At the NBA China Games, the Magic swept the three games in China, twice against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and once against the Chinese national team in games held in Shanghai and in [[Macau]].\n\nOn November 15, 2007, Bob Vander Weide, the son-in-law of Richard DeVos, officially took over as owner of the team, although ownership is still split evenly amongst Richard DeVos' other children as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/basketball/magic/orl-mnotes1507nov15,0,15219.story|title=Magic's Vander Weide officially takes over reins from owner Rich DeVos|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Magic started the [[2007\u201308 NBA season]] with an impressive 16\u20134 record in their first 20 games, which included wins over the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. Through the next few months, the Magic were not so successful, splitting their next 36 games with 18 wins and 18 losses. At the start of March, the Magic seemed to pick up speed again, finishing the month with 10 wins, the first time since November that they won 10 or more in a month. The Magic clinched the [[Southeast Division (NBA)|Southeast Division]] title when the [[Washington Wizards]] were routed at [[Utah Jazz|Utah]] 129\u201387 on March 31, 2008. It was the Magic's third division title, but only their first since 1995\u201396 season, as well as their first since the Southeast Division was formed. They also earned their 50th win of the season against the [[Chicago Bulls]] on April 13, which had not happened since the 1995\u201396 season. The Magic finished the regular season 52\u201330, their best season since 1995\u201396. With the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference, they were matched up in their first round playoff series against the [[Toronto Raptors]]. The Magic had home court advantage for the first time since the 1998\u201399 season.\n\nOn April 28, 2008, at [[Amway Arena]], the Magic eliminated the Raptors with a 4\u20131 series victory in the first round. It was the first playoff series victory for the Magic in 12 years after 6 straight first round exits. The run of success did not last long as they fell 4\u20131 to the experienced [[Detroit Pistons]] in the second round. With the Magic already down in the series, controversy erupted after the Pistons' Game 2 victory. At the conclusion of the 3rd quarter, [[Chauncey Billups]] of the Pistons made a three-point shot giving the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped just as the play began. NBA rules prohibit officials from using instant replay or any timing device to determine how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay allowed to be viewed from the time of the malfunction to when the play ends, when the game clock has not expired.

The Magic were able to win Game 3, with the Pistons' Chauncey Billups out for most of the game with an injury, but were unable to take advantage of his absence and defeat the Pistons in Games 4 and 5, which ended the Magic's playoff run in 2008.\n\nThe first half of the [[2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season|2008\u201309 season]] went very well for the Magic. After 41 games, the Magic were 33\u20138, leading the Southeast Division, as well as having one of the top four records in the league. At the start of February, [[Jameer Nelson]], their all-star starting point guard, went down with a shoulder injury. He was expected to miss the remainder of the season. After trading for [[Rafer Alston]], the Magic finished the regular season with a 59\u201323 record, it was the most games the team had won in a season since the 1995\u201396 season in which they had 60 wins. In the playoffs, the Magic beat the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the first round of the [[2009 NBA playoffs|playoffs]] and then the defending champions, the [[Boston Celtics]], in the Eastern Conference semifinals, behind assistant coach [[Patrick Ewing]]'s guarantee that they would win Game 7 of that series.<ref name=\"Magic Moment: Orlando beats Boston to advance\"/> In their first conference finals since 1996, the Magic beat the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], which were led by the season's MVP, [[LeBron James]]. After dropping the first two games in the [[2009 NBA Finals|Finals]] against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], the Magic finally won their first ever game in the Finals in Game 3. Despite Nelson's return to the team for the Finals, the Lakers won the series and the championship by beating the Magic in five games.\n\nIn the 2009 off-season, Orlando traded [[Rafer Alston]], [[Tony Battie]], and [[Courtney Lee]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in exchange for eight-time [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] [[Vince Carter]] and [[Ryan Anderson (basketball, born 1988)|Ryan Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4287197|title=New Jersey Nets ship Vince Carter to Orlando Magic for Rafer Alston, rookie Courtney Lee|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]], as part of a [[sign-and-trade]], was sent to the [[Toronto Raptors]].

Lewis tested positive for an elevated testosterone level that was caused by an over-the-counter supplement containing a substance banned by the league.<ref name=\"Lewis suspended 10 games by NBA\"/> To make matters worse, Vince Carter suffered a left ankle injury in just the second game of the season. Carter's injury turned out to be not too serious, but caused him to miss the next five games. Another setback came in mid-November, when [[Jameer Nelson]] injured his left knee, which required arthroscopic surgery to repair. Nelson would be out for five weeks. Despite all of this, the Magic had a 23\u20138 record at the end of December.\n\nOrlando lost seven of their first ten games in January, but recovered well enough to post a winning record for the month by winning six of their next seven. Following the All-Star break, the Magic went on a roll, winning 23 of their 28 remaining games, clinching their fourth consecutive playoff berth and winning their third consecutive division championship in the process. The Magic finished the regular season with a 59\u201323 record, matching their record from the 2008\u201309 season, and finishing with not only the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, but the second-best record in the entire league. The team became one of the only teams in NBA history to beat all of the other 29 teams at least once during the regular season. The Magic swept the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] and the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the first two rounds of the [[2010 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], respectively. They then faced the [[Boston Celtics]] in the conference finals. After losing the first three games of the series, Orlando managed to win the next two games, but lost on the road in Game 6, ending their season.\n\n====2010\u20132012: \"Dwightmare\" saga====\n[[File:Scott Skiles bench cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Scott Skiles coached the Magic in the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].]]\nIn anticipation of the team's move to [[Amway Center]], the Magic updated its logo. They retained the streaking ball logo, but changed the wordmark taken from their current uniforms. The Magic hosted the NBA All-Star Game in 2012. The Magic also unveiled black alternate uniforms.\n\nIn the summer of 2010 the Orlando Magic signed [[Chris Duhon]], formerly of the New York Knicks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehoops.com/blog/?p=6157 |title=Magic sign Chris Duhon |publisher=InsideHoops |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref> and [[Quentin Richardson]], formerly of the Miami Heat.\n\nOn December 18, 2010, having lost five of their last six games, the Magic made a blockbuster trade deal with the [[Phoenix Suns]] and the [[Washington Wizards]].

But they were ousted in six games by the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the first round of the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]], the first time head coach [[Stan Van Gundy]] was eliminated early in the playoffs.\n\nIn a shortened 2012 season, due to the NBA Lockout, the Magic started the offseason on a rocky note, with their All-Star center, [[Dwight Howard]], requesting a trade to either the [[New Jersey Nets]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]], or [[Dallas Mavericks]]. Overlooking the trade request the Magic did a sign and trade with the Boston Celtics for [[Glen Davis (basketball)|Glen Davis]] and [[Von Wafer]] in exchange for [[Brandon Bass]]. The Magic also amnestied [[Gilbert Arenas]] and signed [[Larry Hughes]], [[Justin Harper (basketball)|Justin Harper]], and [[DeAndre Liggins]]. The Magic started the season on Christmas Day in [[Oklahoma City]] against the [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]]. They lost the season opener 89\u201397. During the month of February, the Magic waived Hughes and signed [[Ish Smith]]. On February 26, Orlando hosted the 2012 All-Star Game. The Magic struggled to win games consistently, with concerns about the uncertainty of Dwight Howard's future with the franchise. However, after Dwight rescinded his trade demand and signed a one-year deal in March, the Magic seemed to find their footing again. But then in early April, shortly after it became public that Howard requested coach Van Gundy to be replaced, the center was diagnosed with a herniated disk and forced to have back surgery, thus ending his season. The Magic clinched the sixth seed in the east with a 37\u201329 record. The Magic were faced with the third seeded Pacers in the first round. Despite winning the first game of the series the Magic were defeated 4\u20131.\n\nOn May 21, 2012, it was reported that general manager [[Otis Smith (basketball)|Otis Smith]] and head coach [[Stan Van Gundy]] would part ways with the organization.

Another ingredient to the rivalry was the high-caliber players on both teams such as Orlando's [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]] to Miami's [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Tim Hardaway]]. The two had met each other in the NBA playoffs for the first time in [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]], with Miami beating Orlando 3\u20132, they have not met in the playoffs since.\n\nThe rivalry intensified with the rising stardom of Miami's and Orlando's [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Dwight Howard]], along with Miami's acquiring high-caliber stars such [[LeBron James]] from the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Chris Bosh]] from the [[Toronto Raptors]] and in 2010, resulting in fierce competition between the two.\n\nWhen Dwight Howard departed from the Magic to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in August 2012, the rivalry softened. The Orlando Magic are undergoing a process of rebuilding, however, competition still remains tense.\n\n===Atlanta Hawks===\nThe [[Atlanta Hawks]] and the Orlando Magic had an intense rivalry, mostly stemming from playoff competitions and the rising stardom of [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Josh Smith]], both from the [[2004 NBA draft]] and who were both raised in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\nThe two teams faced each other three times in the [[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]], and [[2011 NBA Playoffs|2011 NBA playoffs]]. The Magic defeated the Hawks in the second round of the 1996 playoffs 4\u20131, and swept the second round series 4\u20130 in the 2010 playoffs, while the Hawks eliminated the Magic 4\u20132 in the first round of the corresponding 2011 playoffs.\n\n==Media==\n{{main|List of Orlando Magic broadcasters}}\n\n===Television===\nThe current television announce team for the Orlando Magic is play-by-play announcer [[David Steele (sports announcer)|David Steele]] and color analyst [[Jeff Turner]]. Turner played for the Magic from its inaugural 1989 season to 1996. [[Paul Kennedy (broadcaster)|Paul Kennedy]] and Dante Marchetelli serve as courtside reporters, while Marchetelli, former coach Brian Hill, and former Magic player [[Nick Anderson]] host the pre-game, halftime and post-game shows. Television broadcasts were split in 2007\u201308 between [[Fox Sports Florida]] and Sun Sports (now [[Fox Sports Sun]]). In the 18 years before then, broadcasts were split between Sun Sports (formerly known as the Sunshine Network) and local television stations, originally [[WKCF]] and, later, [[WRBW]].\n\nThere was a controversy with moving broadcasts to Fox Sports Florida since Orlando's largest cable TV provider, [[Bright House Networks]], did not carry the network. Pressure increased for the cable provider to pick up FS Florida in time for the 2007\u201308 NBA season but this did not happen. The Magic persisted with airing games on FS Florida into the 2008\u201309 season despite Bright House's refusal to pick up the channel in all of its affiliates. Bright House and FS Florida came to an agreement on January 1, 2009 and began airing the channel as part of its standard cable package. However, Bright House airs the channel using a digital signal that only allows customers who own the Digital cable box to receive the channel. The customers do not have to pay any additional costs to get the channel with their Digital cable box.\n\nAs of the 2012\u201313 season, all Magic games are now on Fox Sports Florida.\n\n===Radio===\nThe current radio announce team for the Orlando Magic is play-by-play announcer [[Dennis Neumann]] and color analyst [[Richie Adubato]], another former Magic head coach. Games are produced by Magic Radio Network flagship AM 580 [[WDBO (AM)|WDBO]] in Orlando, and also broadcast on AM 1380 [[WELE]] in Daytona Beach, 99.5 FM [[WGMW]] \"The Star\" in Gainesville and Ocala, AM 1290 [[WPCF]] in Panama City, AM 1590 [[WPSL (AM)|WPSL]] in Port St. Lucie and AM 1450 [[WSTU]] in Stuart. The affiliate in Tallahassee is AM 1270 \"My 94.3\" [[WTLY]]. The immediate Tampa Bay area has no affiliate although AM 1340 in Clearwater [[WTAN]] is listed on the team's website.\n\nThe flagship broadcast was simulcast on [[WDBO-FM]] during the 2011\u201312 NBA season while that station moved from AM to FM. When WDBO-AM re-formatted from [[talk radio]] to [[sports radio]], it retained the flagship status. However, WDBO-FM still simulcasts Magic games in Central Florida.\n\nJoey Colon and Ram\u00f3n Rivas do Spanish-language commentary on AM 1030 [[WONQ]] \"La Grande\" in Orlando.\n\n===Podcasts===\nThe official Orlando Magic website features a collection of podcasts available on [[iTunes]], including \"Magic Overtime with Dante and Galante\".\n\n===Final Notes===\nThe Orlando Magic are one of the most supported teams and according to head coach of the San Antonio Spurs, Greg Popovich \"The [Orlando] Magic have an incredible batch of young stars, including Fultz, Isaac and Gordon, who, I believe, will be the future of the franchise and if given the right tools may one day become stars themselves\".\n\n==Leaders==\n===Franchise leaders===\n'''Bold''' denotes still active with
