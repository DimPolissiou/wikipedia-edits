He played 12 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] between 1921 and 1934, playing in 1921-24 for the [[St. Louis Browns]] and 1927-34 for the [[Cincinnati Reds]].\n\n== Career ==\nRay Kolp played baseball as a youth (with the nickname \"Jack\") on New Berlin town teams and on the Electric Suction Sweepers, a team sponsored by the sweeper manufacturer that became the [[The Hoover Company|Hoover Company]] in 1922.  Playing as \"Ray Culp\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Ray Kolp to Terre Haute|last=|first=|date=December 1, 1920|work=Akron Beacon Journal|access-date=}}</ref> for unclear contract-related reasons,<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Jack Kolp Likes Offer of Tigers;  Expects to Sign|last=|first=|date=December 28, 1919|work=Canton Repository|access-date=}}</ref> he was a pitcher and shortstop for the Akron Numatics in 1920 in the minor's International League with famous teammate [[Jim Thorpe]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Numatics Win Opening Game of Series with Syracuse Stars|last=|first=|date=August 7, 1920|work=Akron Beacon Journal|access-date=}}</ref>  In March 1921, Kolp was invited to a [[St. Louis Browns]]' tryout camp for pitchers and made the team to start his major league career.  Early on, he seemed to have a jinx over the [[Cleveland Indians]], beating them repeatedly,<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Some Pitchers Hold Jinx for Certain Clubs|last=|first=|date=August 17, 1922|work=Alton Evening Telegram|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> including his first trip to a big league mound on April 16,1921.\n\nOver his career, Ray Kolp was a good pitcher, but never a great pitcher.  He had an average fastball and mixed it with a sidearm pitch and various spinners.  The most games he won in a season was 14 with the Browns in 1922.  His overall major league won-loss record is 79-95.  He gave up two home runs to Babe Ruth in one game in New York on August 5, 1923.\n\nRay Kolp was a stylish dresser with an assertive personality.  On the field, Ray Kolp was cocky and vociferous, often taunting and scoffing at opposing players and advising umpires from both the pitching mound and dugout.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=On 'the Trail' of Sport|last=|first=|date=June 4, 1930|work=Hamilton Evening Journal|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>  He was an adept needler.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Adept Needler and Bench Jockey|last=|first=|date=July 31, 1967|work=Cincinnati Enquirer|access-date=}}</ref>  His baiting harassment made him a famous bench jockey,<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The Leading 'Jockey'|last=|first=|date=July 27, 1929|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=}}</ref> even in those days of unruly and emotional baseball.\n\nRay Kolp is most remembered for an incident in 1929 involving future Hall-of-Famer [[Hack Wilson]].  The episode occurred in the day's second game;  in an earlier game there had been a triple play, which may explain why feelings were running high.  [[Hack Wilson]] was on first with Ray Kolp in the Cincinnati dugout shouting taunts and insults as usual.  Having endured enough, [[Hack Wilson|Hack]] charged off the field into the opposing dugout where he clobbered Ray Kolp in the jaw.

He played all or part of 12 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] between 1921 and 1934, playing in 1921-24 for the [[St. Louis Browns]] and 1927-34 for the [[Cincinnati Reds]].\n\n== Career ==\nRay Kolp played baseball as a youth (with the nickname \"Jack\") on New Berlin town teams and on the Electric Suction Sweepers, a team sponsored by the sweeper manufacturer that became the [[The Hoover Company|Hoover Company]] in 1922.

Early on, he seemed to have a jinx over the [[Cleveland Indians]], beating them repeatedly,<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Some Pitchers Hold Jinx for Certain Clubs|last=|first=|date=August 17, 1922|work=Alton Evening Telegram|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> including his first trip to a big league mound on April 16,1921.\n\nOver his career, Ray Kolp was a good pitcher, but never a great pitcher.  He had an average fastball and mixed it with a sidearm pitch and various spinners.  The most games he won in a season was 14 with the Browns in 1922.  His overall major league won-loss record is 79-95.  He gave up two home runs to Babe Ruth in one game in New York on August 5, 1923.\n\nRay Kolp was a stylish dresser with an assertive personality.  On the field, Ray Kolp was cocky and vociferous, often taunting and scoffing at opposing players and advising umpires from both the pitching mound and dugout.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=On 'the Trail' of Sport|last=|first=|date=June 4, 1930|work=Hamilton Evening Journal|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>  He was an adept needler.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Adept Needler and Bench Jockey|last=|first=|date=July 31, 1967|work=Cincinnati Enquirer|access-date=}}</ref>  His baiting harassment made him a famous bench jockey,<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The Leading 'Jockey'|last=|first=|date=July 27, 1929|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=}}</ref> even in those days of unruly and emotional baseball.\n\nRay Kolp is most remembered for an incident in 1929 involving future Hall-of-Famer [[Hack Wilson]].  The episode occurred in the day's second game;  in an earlier game there had been a triple play, which may explain why feelings were running high.  [[Hack Wilson]] was on first with Ray Kolp in the Cincinnati dugout shouting taunts and insults as usual.

In 1870, he passed the exams in [[classical languages]] which were then required for admission to University.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\">{{cite journal\n|first=Anne J.|last=Kox|title=Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (in Dutch)|journal=Nederlands Tijdschirft voor Natuurkunde|volume=77|issue=12|page=441|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nLorentz studied [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[Leiden University]], where he was strongly influenced by the teaching of astronomy professor [[Frederik Kaiser]]; it was his influence that led him to become a physicist. After earning a [[bachelor's degree]], he returned to Arnhem in 1871 to teach night school classes in mathematics, but he continued his studies in [[Leiden]] in addition to his teaching position.  In 1875, Lorentz earned a [[doctoral degree]] under [[Pieter Rijke]] on a thesis entitled ''\"{{lang|nl|Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht}}\"'' (On the theory of reflection and refraction of light), in which he refined the electromagnetic theory of [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Hendrik Lorentz |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Lorentz_1875.pdf |title=Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht  |year=1875}}</ref>\n\n===Career===\n\n====Professor in Leiden====\nOn 17 November 1877, only 24 years of age, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz was appointed to the newly established chair in theoretical physics at the [[University of Leiden]]. The position had initially been offered to [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|Johan van der Waals]], but he accepted a position at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/> On 25 January 1878, Lorentz delivered his inaugural lecture on ''\"{{lang|nl|De moleculaire theori\u00ebn in de natuurkunde}}\"'' (The molecular theories in physics).

After that, he extended his research to a much wider area while still focusing on theoretical physics. Lorentz made significant contributions to fields ranging from [[hydrodynamics]] to [[general relativity]]. His most important contributions were in the area of electromagnetism, the electron theory, and relativity.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz theorized that [[atom]]s might consist of charged particles and suggested that the oscillations of these charged particles were the source of light. When a colleague and former student of Lorentz's, [[Pieter Zeeman]], discovered the [[Zeeman effect]] in 1896, Lorentz supplied its theoretical interpretation. The experimental and theoretical work was honored with the Nobel prize in physics in 1902. Lorentz' name is now associated with the [[Lorentz-Lorenz]] formula, the [[Lorentz force]], the [[Lorentzian distribution]], and the [[Lorentz transformation]].\n\n====Electrodynamics and relativity====\n{{Main|Lorentz ether theory|History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations#Lorentz1|History of Lorentz transformations#Lorentz2}}\n\nIn 1892 and 1895, Lorentz worked on describing electromagnetic phenomena (the propagation of light) in reference frames that move relative to the postulated [[luminiferous aether]].<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1892\n|title=La Th\u00e9orie electromagn\u00e9tique de Maxwell et son application aux corps mouvants\n|url = https://archive.org/details/lathorielectrom00loregoog\n|journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles\n|volume=25\n|pages=363\u2013552}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1895\n|title=Versuch einer Theorie der electrischen und optischen Erscheinungen in bewegten K\u00f6rpern\n|location=Leiden\n|publisher=E.J.

In 1900 and 1904, [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] called local time Lorentz's \"most ingenious idea\" and illustrated it by showing that clocks in moving frames are synchronized by exchanging light signals that are assumed to travel at the same speed against and with the motion of the frame<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri\n|year=1900\n|title=La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action\n|journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles\n|volume=5\n|pages=252\u2013278|title-link=s:fr:La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action\n}}.

It would be impossible to decide which of them moves or stands still with respect to the ether, and there would be no reason for preferring the times and lengths measured by the one to those determined by the other, nor for saying that either of them is in possession of the \"true\" times or the \"true\" lengths. This is a point which Einstein has laid particular stress on, in a theory in which he starts from what he calls the principle of relativity, [...] I cannot speak here of the many highly interesting applications which Einstein has made of this principle. His results concerning electromagnetic and optical phenomena ... agree in the main with those which we have obtained in the preceding pages, the chief difference being that Einstein simply postulates what we have deduced, with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily, from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field. By doing so, he may certainly take credit for making us see in the negative result of experiments like those of Michelson, Rayleigh and Brace, not a fortuitous compensation of opposing effects, but the manifestation of a general and fundamental principle. [...] It would be unjust not to add that, besides the fascinating boldness of its starting point, Einstein's theory has another marked advantage over mine. Whereas I have not been able to obtain for the equations referred to moving axes ''exactly'' the same form as for those which apply to a stationary system, Einstein has accomplished this by means of a system of new variables slightly different from those which I have introduced.}}\n\nThough Lorentz still maintained that there is an (undetectable) aether in which resting clocks indicate the \"true time\":\n\n{{Quote|1909: Yet, I think, something may also be claimed in favour of the form in which I have presented the theory. I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with a certain degree of substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter.<ref name=lor09 /><br /> 1910: Provided that there is an aether, then under all systems x, y, z, t, one is preferred by the fact, that the coordinate axes as well as the clocks are resting in the aether. If one connects with this the idea (which I would abandon only reluctantly) that space and time are completely different things, and that there is a \"true time\" (simultaneity thus would be independent of the location, in agreement with the circumstance that we can have the idea of infinitely great velocities), then it can be easily seen that this true time should be indicated by clocks at rest in the aether. However, if the relativity principle had general validity in nature, one wouldn't be in the position to determine, whether the reference system just used is the preferred one. Then one comes to the same results, as if one (following Einstein and Minkowski) deny the existence of the aether and of true time, and to see all reference systems as equally valid. Which of these two ways of thinking one is following, can surely be left to the individual.<ref name=lor10 />}}\n\nLorentz also gave credit to Poincar\u00e9's contributions to relativity.<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1921|orig-year=1914\n|title=Deux M\u00e9moires de Henri Poincar\u00e9 sur la Physique Math\u00e9matique\n|journal=Acta Mathematica\n|volume=38\n|issue=1\n|pages=293\u2013308\n|doi=10.1007/BF02392073|title-link=s:fr:Deux M\u00e9moires de Henri Poincar\u00e9 sur la Physique Math\u00e9matique}}\n*English Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:Two Papers of Henri Poincar\u00e9 on Mathematical Physics|Two Papers of Henri Poincar\u00e9 on Mathematical Physics]]</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Indeed, for some of the physical quantities which enter the formulas, I did not indicate the transformation which suits best.

Sci, 1984).</ref>\n\nLorentz was chairman of the first [[Solvay Conference]] held in Brussels in the autumn of 1911. Shortly after the conference, Poincar\u00e9 wrote an essay on quantum physics which gives an indication of Lorentz's status at the time:<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri\n|year=1913\n|title=Last Essays\n|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote| ... at every moment [the twenty physicists from different countries] could be heard talking of the [quantum mechanics] which they contrasted with the old mechanics. Now what was the old mechanics? Was it that of Newton, the one which still reigned uncontested at the close of the nineteenth century? No, it was the mechanics of Lorentz, the one dealing with the principle of relativity; the one which, hardly five years ago, seemed to be the height of boldness.}}\n\n====Change of priorities====\nIn 1910, Lorentz decided to reorganize his life.  His teaching and management duties at Leiden University were taking up too much of his time, leaving him little time for research. In 1912, he resigned from his chair of theoretical physics to become curator of the \"Physics Cabinet\" at [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]]. He remained connected to Leiden University  as an external professor, and his \"Monday morning lectures\" on new developments in theoretical physics soon became legendary.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz initially asked Einstein to succeed him as professor of theoretical physics at Leiden. However, Einstein could not accept because he had just accepted a position at [[ETH Zurich]]. Einstein had no regrets in this matter, since the prospect of having to fill Lorentz's shoes made him shiver. Instead Lorentz appointed [[Paul Ehrenfest]] as his successor in the chair of theoretical  physics at the Leiden University, who would found the Institute for Theoretical Physics which would become known as the [[Lorentz Institute]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\n====Civil work====\nAfter World War I, Lorentz was one of the driving forces behind the founding of the \"Wetenschappelijke Commissie van Advies en Onderzoek in het Belang van Volkswelvaart en Weerbaarheid\", a committee which was to harness the scientific potential united in the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW) for solving civil problems such as food shortage which had resulted from the war. Lorentz was appointed chair of the committee. However, despite the best efforts of many of the participants the committee would harvest little success. The only exception being that it ultimately resulted in the founding of TNO, the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz was also asked by the Dutch government to chair a committee to calculate some of the effects of the proposed [[Afsluitdijk]] (Enclosure Dam) flood control dam on water levels in the [[Waddenzee]]. [[Hydraulic engineering]] was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Originally Lorentz was only supposed to have a coordinating role in the committee, but it quickly became apparent that Lorentz was the only physicist to have any fundamental traction on the problem. In the period 1918 till 1926, Lorentz invested a large portion of his time in the problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/lorentz-the-grand-old-man-of-physics/|title=Lorentz: the Grand Old Man of Physics|date=March 13, 2000}}</ref> Lorentz proposed to start from the basic [[hydrodynamic]] equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a \"[[human computer]]\", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the [[Waddenzee]]. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1932, and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.<ref group=B>{{cite web|url=http://ilorentz.org/history/zuiderzee/zuiderzee.html |title=Carlo Beenakker |publisher=Ilorentz.org |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\nOne of the two sets of locks in the Afsluitdijk was named after him.\n\n===Family life===\nIn 1881, Lorentz married Aletta Catharina Kaiser. Her father was J.W. Kaiser, a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. He was the Director of the museum which later became the well-known [[Rijksmuseum]] (National Gallery). He also was the designer of the first postage stamps of The Netherlands.\n\nThere were two daughters, and one son from this marriage.\n\n[[Geertruida de Haas-Lorentz|Dr. Geertruida Luberta Lorentz]], the eldest daughter, was a physicist. She married Professor W.J. de Haas, who was the Director of the Cryogenic Laboratory at the University of Leiden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1902/lorentz/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1902|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nIn January 1928, Lorentz became seriously ill, and died shortly after on February 4.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/> The respect in which he was held in the Netherlands is apparent from [[Owen Willans Richardson]]'s description of his funeral:\n\n{{Quote|text=The funeral took place at Haarlem at noon on Friday, February 10.

Although steeped in his own investigation of the moment, he always seemed to have in his immediate grasp its ramifications into every corner of the universe. ... The singular clearness of his writings provides a striking reflection of his wonderful powers in this respect. .... He possessed and successfully employed the mental vivacity which is necessary to follow the interplay of discussion, the insight which is required to extract those statements which illuminate the real difficulties, and the wisdom to lead the discussion among fruitful channels, and he did this so skillfully that the process was hardly perceptible.<ref group=B name=richardson /></blockquote>\n\nM. J. Klein (1967) wrote of Lorentz's reputation in the 1920s:\n\n<blockquote>For many years physicists had always been eager \"to hear what Lorentz will say about it\" when a new theory was advanced, and, even at seventy-two, he did not disappoint them.<ref group=B name=Przibram/></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the [[Nobel prize]], Lorentz received a great many honours for his outstanding work.

After earning a [[bachelor's degree]], he returned to Arnhem in 1871 to teach night school classes in mathematics, but he continued his studies in [[Leiden]] in addition to his teaching position.  In 1875, Lorentz earned a [[doctoral degree]] under [[Pieter Rijke]] on a thesis entitled ''\"{{lang|nl|Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht}}\"'' (On the theory of reflection and refraction of light), in which he refined the electromagnetic theory of [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Hendrik Lorentz |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Lorentz_1875.pdf |title=Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht  |year=1875}}</ref>\n\n===Career===\n\n====Professor in Leiden====\nOn 17 November 1877, only 24 years of age, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz was appointed to the newly established chair in theoretical physics at the [[University of Leiden]].

After that, he extended his research to a much wider area while still focusing on theoretical physics. Lorentz made significant contributions to fields ranging from [[hydrodynamics]] to [[general relativity]]. His most important contributions were in the area of electromagnetism, the electron theory, and relativity.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz theorized that [[atom]]s might consist of charged particles and suggested that the oscillations of these charged particles were the source of light. When a colleague and former student of Lorentz's, [[Pieter Zeeman]], discovered the [[Zeeman effect]] in 1896, Lorentz supplied its theoretical interpretation. The experimental and theoretical work was honored with the Nobel prize in physics in 1902. Lorentz' name is now associated with the [[Lorentz-Lorenz]] formula, the [[Lorentz force]], the [[Lorentzian distribution]], and the [[Lorentz transformation]].\n\n====Electrodynamics and relativity====\n{{Main|Lorentz ether theory|History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations#Lorentz1|History of Lorentz transformations#Lorentz2}}\n\nIn 1892 and 1895, Lorentz worked on describing electromagnetic phenomena (the propagation of light) in reference frames that move relative to the postulated [[luminiferous aether]].<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1892\n|title=La Th\u00e9orie electromagn\u00e9tique de Maxwell et son application aux corps mouvants\n|url = https://archive.org/details/lathorielectrom00loregoog\n|journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles\n|volume=25\n|pages=363\u2013552}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1895\n|title=Versuch einer Theorie der electrischen und optischen Erscheinungen in bewegten K\u00f6rpern\n|location=Leiden\n|publisher=E.J.

In 1900 and 1904, [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] called local time Lorentz's \"most ingenious idea\" and illustrated it by showing that clocks in moving frames are synchronized by exchanging light signals that are assumed to travel at the same speed against and with the motion of the frame<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri\n|year=1900\n|title=La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action\n|journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles\n|volume=5\n|pages=252\u2013278|title-link=s:fr:La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action\n}}.

It would be impossible to decide which of them moves or stands still with respect to the ether, and there would be no reason for preferring the times and lengths measured by the one to those determined by the other, nor for saying that either of them is in possession of the \"true\" times or the \"true\" lengths. This is a point which Einstein has laid particular stress on, in a theory in which he starts from what he calls the principle of relativity, [...] I cannot speak here of the many highly interesting applications which Einstein has made of this principle. His results concerning electromagnetic and optical phenomena ... agree in the main with those which we have obtained in the preceding pages, the chief difference being that Einstein simply postulates what we have deduced, with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily, from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field. By doing so, he may certainly take credit for making us see in the negative result of experiments like those of Michelson, Rayleigh and Brace, not a fortuitous compensation of opposing effects, but the manifestation of a general and fundamental principle. [...] It would be unjust not to add that, besides the fascinating boldness of its starting point, Einstein's theory has another marked advantage over mine. Whereas I have not been able to obtain for the equations referred to moving axes ''exactly'' the same form as for those which apply to a stationary system, Einstein has accomplished this by means of a system of new variables slightly different from those which I have introduced.}}\n\nThough Lorentz still maintained that there is an (undetectable) aether in which resting clocks indicate the \"true time\":\n\n{{Quote|1909: Yet, I think, something may also be claimed in favour of the form in which I have presented the theory. I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with a certain degree of substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter.<ref name=lor09 /><br /> 1910: Provided that there is an aether, then under all systems x, y, z, t, one is preferred by the fact, that the coordinate axes as well as the clocks are resting in the aether. If one connects with this the idea (which I would abandon only reluctantly) that space and time are completely different things, and that there is a \"true time\" (simultaneity thus would be independent of the location, in agreement with the circumstance that we can have the idea of infinitely great velocities), then it can be easily seen that this true time should be indicated by clocks at rest in the aether. However, if the relativity principle had general validity in nature, one wouldn't be in the position to determine, whether the reference system just used is the preferred one. Then one comes to the same results, as if one (following Einstein and Minkowski) deny the existence of the aether and of true time, and to see all reference systems as equally valid. Which of these two ways of thinking one is following, can surely be left to the individual.<ref name=lor10 />}}\n\nLorentz also gave credit to Poincar\u00e9's contributions to relativity.<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1921|orig-year=1914\n|title=Deux M\u00e9moires de Henri Poincar\u00e9 sur la Physique Math\u00e9matique\n|journal=Acta Mathematica\n|volume=38\n|issue=1\n|pages=293\u2013308\n|doi=10.1007/BF02392073|title-link=s:fr:Deux M\u00e9moires de Henri Poincar\u00e9 sur la Physique Math\u00e9matique}}\n*English Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:Two Papers of Henri Poincar\u00e9 on Mathematical Physics|Two Papers of Henri Poincar\u00e9 on Mathematical Physics]]</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Indeed, for some of the physical quantities which enter the formulas, I did not indicate the transformation which suits best.

Sci, 1984).</ref>\n\nLorentz was chairman of the first [[Solvay Conference]] held in Brussels in the autumn of 1911. Shortly after the conference, Poincar\u00e9 wrote an essay on quantum physics which gives an indication of Lorentz's status at the time:<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri\n|year=1913\n|title=Last Essays\n|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote| ... at every moment [the twenty physicists from different countries] could be heard talking of the [quantum mechanics] which they contrasted with the old mechanics. Now what was the old mechanics? Was it that of Newton, the one which still reigned uncontested at the close of the nineteenth century? No, it was the mechanics of Lorentz, the one dealing with the principle of relativity; the one which, hardly five years ago, seemed to be the height of boldness.}}\n\n====Change of priorities====\nIn 1910, Lorentz decided to reorganize his life.  His teaching and management duties at Leiden University were taking up too much of his time, leaving him little time for research. In 1912, he resigned from his chair of theoretical physics to become curator of the \"Physics Cabinet\" at [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]]. He remained connected to Leiden University  as an external professor, and his \"Monday morning lectures\" on new developments in theoretical physics soon became legendary.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz initially asked Einstein to succeed him as professor of theoretical physics at Leiden. However, Einstein could not accept because he had just accepted a position at [[ETH Zurich]]. Einstein had no regrets in this matter, since the prospect of having to fill Lorentz's shoes made him shiver. Instead Lorentz appointed [[Paul Ehrenfest]] as his successor in the chair of theoretical  physics at the Leiden University, who would found the Institute for Theoretical Physics which would become known as the [[Lorentz Institute]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\n====Civil work====\nAfter World War I, Lorentz was one of the driving forces behind the founding of the \"Wetenschappelijke Commissie van Advies en Onderzoek in het Belang van Volkswelvaart en Weerbaarheid\", a committee which was to harness the scientific potential united in the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW) for solving civil problems such as food shortage which had resulted from the war. Lorentz was appointed chair of the committee. However, despite the best efforts of many of the participants the committee would harvest little success. The only exception being that it ultimately resulted in the founding of TNO, the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz was also asked by the Dutch government to chair a committee to calculate some of the effects of the proposed [[Afsluitdijk]] (Enclosure Dam) flood control dam on water levels in the [[Waddenzee]]. [[Hydraulic engineering]] was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Originally Lorentz was only supposed to have a coordinating role in the committee, but it quickly became apparent that Lorentz was the only physicist to have any fundamental traction on the problem. In the period 1918 till 1926, Lorentz invested a large portion of his time in the problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/lorentz-the-grand-old-man-of-physics/|title=Lorentz: the Grand Old Man of Physics|date=March 13, 2000}}</ref> Lorentz proposed to start from the basic [[hydrodynamic]] equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a \"[[human computer]]\", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the [[Waddenzee]]. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1932, and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.<ref group=B>{{cite web|url=http://ilorentz.org/history/zuiderzee/zuiderzee.html |title=Carlo Beenakker |publisher=Ilorentz.org |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\nOne of the two sets of locks in the Afsluitdijk was named after him.\n\n===Family life===\nIn 1881, Lorentz married Aletta Catharina Kaiser. Her father was J.W. Kaiser, a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. He was the Director of the museum which later became the well-known [[Rijksmuseum]] (National Gallery). He also was the designer of the first postage stamps of The Netherlands.\n\nThere were two daughters, and one son from this marriage.\n\n[[Geertruida de Haas-Lorentz|Dr. Geertruida Luberta Lorentz]], the eldest daughter, was a physicist. She married Professor W.J. de Haas, who was the Director of the Cryogenic Laboratory at the University of Leiden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1902/lorentz/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1902|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nIn January 1928, Lorentz became seriously ill, and died shortly after on February 4.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/> The respect in which he was held in the Netherlands is apparent from [[Owen Willans Richardson]]'s description of his funeral:\n\n{{Quote|text=The funeral took place at Haarlem at noon on Friday, February 10. At the stroke of twelve the State telegraph and telephone services of Holland were suspended for three minutes as a revered tribute to the greatest man the Netherlands has produced in our time. It was attended by many colleagues and distinguished physicists from foreign countries.

Although steeped in his own investigation of the moment, he always seemed to have in his immediate grasp its ramifications into every corner of the universe. ... The singular clearness of his writings provides a striking reflection of his wonderful powers in this respect. .... He possessed and successfully employed the mental vivacity which is necessary to follow the interplay of discussion, the insight which is required to extract those statements which illuminate the real difficulties, and the wisdom to lead the discussion among fruitful channels, and he did this so skillfully that the process was hardly perceptible.<ref group=B name=richardson /></blockquote>\n\nM. J. Klein (1967) wrote of Lorentz's reputation in the 1920s:\n\n<blockquote>For many years physicists had always been eager \"to hear what Lorentz will say about it\" when a new theory was advanced, and, even at seventy-two, he did not disappoint them.<ref group=B name=Przibram/></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the [[Nobel prize]], Lorentz received a great many honours for his outstanding work. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1905|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1905]].<ref name=frs>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316060617/https://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/fellows/|archivedate=2015-03-16|url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/fellows/|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|title=Fellows of the Royal Society}}</ref> The Society awarded him their [[Rumford Medal]] in 1908 and their [[Copley Medal]] in 1918.

Mulford]], who wrote a series of [[short stories]] and novels based on the character.\n\n==Origin==\nIn his early writings, Mulford portrayed the character as rude, dangerous, and rough-talking. He had a wooden leg which caused him to walk with a little \"hop\", hence the nickname. The character was played by movie actor [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] starting in 1935. The Cassidy character in films was adapted from Mulford's books and  transformed into a clean-cut, [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]]-drinking hero. Sixty-six popular films appeared, only a few of which were loosely based on Mulford's stories.\n\n==Film history==\n{{see also|List of Hopalong Cassidy films}}\n[[File:Poster - Eagle's Brood, The 01.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1935 Hopalong Cassidy film ''[[The Eagle's Brood]]'']]\nAs portrayed on the screen, white-haired Bill \"Hopalong\" Cassidy was usually clad strikingly in black (including his hat, an exception to the Western film stereotype that only villains wore black hats). He was reserved and well spoken, with a sense of fair play. He was often called upon to intercede when dishonest characters took advantage of honest citizens. \"Hoppy\" and his white horse, Topper, usually traveled through the West with two companions&mdash;one young and trouble-prone with a weakness for damsels in distress, the other older, comically awkward and outspoken.<ref>[http://www.b-westerns.com/hoppy1.htm \"William Boyd & Hopalong Cassidy\"], B-Westerns</ref>\n\nThe juvenile lead was successively played by [[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]], [[Russell Hayden]], [[George Reeves]], [[Rand Brooks]], and Jimmy Rogers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/movies|title=Movies|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> [[George \"Gabby\" Hayes|George Hayes]] (later to become known as \"Gabby\" Hayes) originally played Cassidy's grizzled sidekick, Windy Halliday. After Hayes left the series because of a salary dispute with producer Harry Sherman, he was replaced by the comedian Britt Wood as Speedy McGinnis and finally by the veteran movie comedian [[Andy Clyde]] as California Carlson. Clyde, the most durable of the sidekicks, remained with the series until it ended. A few actors of future prominence appeared in Cassidy films, notably [[Robert Mitchum]], who appeared in seven films at the beginning of his career.\n\nThe 66 Hopalong Cassidy pictures were filmed by independent producers who released the films through the studios. The first \"Hoppies\", as the films were known, were distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] to favorable returns, and United Artists was the distributor after Paramount. They were noted for fast action and outdoor photography (usually by [[Russell Harlan]]). [[Harry Sherman]] wanted to make more ambitious movies and tried to cancel the Cassidy series, but popular demand forced Sherman back into production, this time for [[United Artists]]. Sherman gave up the series in 1944, but William Boyd wanted to keep it going. To do this, he gambled his future on Hopalong Cassidy, mortgaging most of what he owned to buy the character rights from Mulford and the backlog of movies from Sherman.\n\nIn the first film, Hopalong Cassidy (then spelled \"Hop-along\") got his name after being shot in the leg. Hopalong's \"drink of choice\" was the nonalcoholic [[sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]].\n\n==Television and radio==\n[[File:Hopalong Cassidy (TV series).png|thumb|Title card for Hopalong Cassidy (TV series), 1949]]\nBoyd resumed production<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> in 1946, on lower budgets, and continued through 1948, when \"B\" westerns were being phased out. Boyd thought Hopalong Cassidy might have a future in television, spent $350,000 to obtain the rights to his old films,<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> and approached the fledgling [[NBC]] network. The initial broadcasts were so successful that NBC could not wait for a television series to be produced and edited the feature films to broadcast length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/broad_western.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629201827/http://www.tvacres.com/broad_western.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 June 2012|title=TV ACRES: Broadcast Firsts > Western Series|publisher=Tvacres.com|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> On June 24, 1949, ''Hopalong Cassidy'' became the first network [[westerns on television|Western television series]].\n\nThe success of the television series made Boyd a star.<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> The [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] began broadcasting [[Hopalong Cassidy (radio program)|a radio version]], with [[Andy Clyde]] (later George MacMichael on [[Walter Brennan]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Real McCoys]]'') as the sidekick (except for episodes 28 to 53 of the 105 episode series, when, for reasons unknown, he was replaced by several different radio actors), in January 1950. At the end of September, the show moved to [[CBS Radio]], where it ran until 1952.<ref>[http://www.audio-classics.com/lhopalongcassidy.html Radio Broadcast Log Of: Hopalong Cassidy] part of ''Audio Classics Archive''. Retrieved 2006-12-09.</ref>\n\nThe series and character were so popular that Hopalong Cassidy was featured on the cover of national magazines such as ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]], [[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> Boyd earned millions as Hopalong ($800,000 in 1950 alone),<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> mostly from merchandise licensing and endorsement deals. In 1950, Hopalong Cassidy was featured on the first [[lunchbox]] to bear an image, causing sales of Aladdin Industries lunch boxes to jump from 50,000 units to 600,000 units per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hopalong Cassidy|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/hopalong-cassidy|website=Archive of American Television|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> In 1950, more than 100 companies manufactured $70 million of Hopalong Cassidy products,<ref name=\"kiddies\">\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813849,00.html?internalid=ACA Kiddies in the Old Corral]\" ''Time'', 27 November 1950.</ref> including children's dinnerware, pillows, roller skates, soap, wristwatches (made by Timex), and jackknives.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/W/htmlW/westerns/westerns.htm Westerns] \u2013 Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>\n\nThere was a new demand for Hopalong Cassidy features in movie theaters, and Boyd licensed reissue distributor Film Classics to make new film prints and advertising accessories. Another 1950 enterprise saw the home-movie company [[Castle Films]] manufacturing condensed versions of the Paramount films for [[16&nbsp;mm]] and [[8&nbsp;mm film]] projectors; they were sold through 1966. Also, in January 1950 [[Dan Spiegel]] began to draw a syndicated [[comic strip]] with scripts by Royal King Cole; the strip lasted until 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toycollectormagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=182:hopalong-cassidy-returns&catid=34:features&Itemid=62 |title=Hopalong Cassidy Returns |author=Tom Hoepf |publisher=Toycollectormagazine.com |accessdate=6 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207215250/http://www.toycollectormagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=182%3Ahopalong-cassidy-returns&catid=34%3Afeatures&Itemid=62 |archivedate=7 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/s/spiegle_d.htm|title=Dan Spiegle|work=lambiek.net|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThanks to the earlier series which showed edited versions of his films, Boyd began work on a separate series of half-hour westerns made especially for television; [[Edgar Buchanan]] was his new sidekick, Red Connors (a character from the original stories and a few of the early films). The theme music for the television show was written by [[Nacio Herb Brown]] (music) and [[L. Wolfe Gilbert]] (lyrics). The show ranked number 7 in the 1949 [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] ratings, number 9 in the 1950-1951 season and number 28 in 1951-1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/index.htm|title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings|website=www.classictvhits.com}}</ref> The success of the show and tie-ins inspired juvenile television westerns such as ''[[The Range Rider]]'', ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'', ''[[Annie Oakley (TV series)|Annie Oakley]]'', ''[[The Gene Autry Show]]'', and ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]''.\n\nAfter Boyd's death, his company devoted to Hopalong Cassidy, U.S. Television Office, retained control of Cassidy films but, by the mid-1960s, had withdrawn them from television and sales in home movie markets.

Mulford]], who wrote a series of [[short stories]] and novels based on the character.\n\n==Origin==\nIn his early writings, Mulford portrayed the character as rude, dangerous, and rough-talking. He had a wooden leg which caused him to walk with a little \"hop\", hence the nickname. The character was played by movie actor [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] starting in 1935. The Cassidy character in films was adapted from Mulford's books and  transformed into a clean-cut, [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]]-drinking hero. Sixty-six popular films appeared, only a few of which were loosely based on Mulford's stories.\n\n==Film history==\n{{see also|List of Hopalong Cassidy films}}\n[[File:Poster - Eagle's Brood, The 01.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1935 Hopalong Cassidy film ''[[The Eagle's Brood]]'']]\nAs portrayed on the screen, white-haired Bill \"Hopalong\" Cassidy was usually clad strikingly in black (including his hat, an exception to the Western film stereotype that only villains wore black hats). He was reserved and well spoken, with a sense of fair play. He was often called upon to intercede when dishonest characters took advantage of honest citizens. \"Hoppy\" and his white horse, Topper, usually traveled through the West with two companions&mdash;one young and trouble-prone with a weakness for damsels in distress, the other older, comically awkward and outspoken.<ref>[http://www.b-westerns.com/hoppy1.htm \"William Boyd & Hopalong Cassidy\"], B-Westerns</ref>\n\nThe juvenile lead was successively played by [[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]], [[Russell Hayden]], [[George Reeves]], [[Rand Brooks]], and Jimmy Rogers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/movies|title=Movies|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> [[George \"Gabby\" Hayes|George Hayes]] (later to become known as \"Gabby\" Hayes) originally played Cassidy's grizzled sidekick, Windy Halliday. After Hayes left the series because of a salary dispute with producer Harry Sherman, he was replaced by the comedian Britt Wood as Speedy McGinnis and finally by the veteran movie comedian [[Andy Clyde]] as California Carlson. Clyde, the most durable of the sidekicks, remained with the series until it ended. A few actors of future prominence appeared in Cassidy films, notably [[Robert Mitchum]], who appeared in seven films at the beginning of his career.\n\nThe 66 Hopalong Cassidy pictures were filmed by independent producers who released the films through the studios. The first \"Hoppies\", as the films were known, were distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] to favorable returns, and United Artists was the distributor after Paramount. They were noted for fast action and outdoor photography (usually by [[Russell Harlan]]). [[Harry Sherman]] wanted to make more ambitious movies and tried to cancel the Cassidy series, but popular demand forced Sherman back into production, this time for [[United Artists]]. Sherman gave up the series in 1944, but William Boyd wanted to keep it going. To do this, he gambled his future on Hopalong Cassidy, mortgaging most of what he owned to buy the character rights from Mulford and the backlog of movies from Sherman.\n\nIn the first film, Hopalong Cassidy (then spelled \"Hop-along\") got his name after being shot in the leg. Hopalong's \"drink of choice\" was the nonalcoholic [[sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]].\n\n==Television and radio==\n[[File:Hopalong Cassidy (TV series).png|thumb|Title card for Hopalong Cassidy (TV series), 1949]]\nBoyd resumed production<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> in 1946, on lower budgets, and continued through 1948, when \"B\" westerns were being phased out. Boyd thought Hopalong Cassidy might have a future in television, spent $350,000 to obtain the rights to his old films,<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> and approached the fledgling [[NBC]] network. The initial broadcasts were so successful that NBC could not wait for a television series to be produced and edited the feature films to broadcast length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/broad_western.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629201827/http://www.tvacres.com/broad_western.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 June 2012|title=TV ACRES: Broadcast Firsts > Western Series|publisher=Tvacres.com|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> On June 24, 1949, ''Hopalong Cassidy'' became the first network [[westerns on television|Western television series]].\n\nThe success of the television series made Boyd a star.<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> The [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] began broadcasting [[Hopalong Cassidy (radio program)|a radio version]], with [[Andy Clyde]] (later George MacMichael on [[Walter Brennan]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Real McCoys]]'') as the sidekick (except for episodes 28 to 53 of the 105 episode series, when, for reasons unknown, he was replaced by several different radio actors), in January 1950. At the end of September, the show moved to [[CBS Radio]], where it ran until 1952.<ref>[http://www.audio-classics.com/lhopalongcassidy.html Radio Broadcast Log Of: Hopalong Cassidy] part of ''Audio Classics Archive''.

Another 1950 enterprise saw the home-movie company [[Castle Films]] manufacturing condensed versions of the Paramount films for [[16&nbsp;mm]] and [[8&nbsp;mm film]] projectors; they were sold through 1966. Also, in January 1950 [[Dan Spiegel]] began to draw a syndicated [[comic strip]] with scripts by Royal King Cole; the strip lasted until 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toycollectormagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=182:hopalong-cassidy-returns&catid=34:features&Itemid=62 |title=Hopalong Cassidy Returns |author=Tom Hoepf |publisher=Toycollectormagazine.com |accessdate=6 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207215250/http://www.toycollectormagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=182%3Ahopalong-cassidy-returns&catid=34%3Afeatures&Itemid=62 |archivedate=7 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/s/spiegle_d.htm|title=Dan Spiegle|work=lambiek.net|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThanks to the earlier series which showed edited versions of his films, Boyd began work on a separate series of half-hour westerns made especially for television; [[Edgar Buchanan]] was his new sidekick, Red Connors (a character from the original stories and a few of the early films). The theme music for the television show was written by [[Nacio Herb Brown]] (music) and [[L. Wolfe Gilbert]] (lyrics). The show ranked number 7 in the 1949 [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] ratings, number 9 in the 1950-1951 season and number 28 in 1951-1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/index.htm|title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings|website=www.classictvhits.com}}</ref> The success of the show and tie-ins inspired juvenile television westerns such as ''[[The Range Rider]]'', ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'', ''[[Annie Oakley (TV series)|Annie Oakley]]'', ''[[The Gene Autry Show]]'', and ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]''.\n\nAfter Boyd's death, his company devoted to Hopalong Cassidy, U.S. Television Office, retained control of Cassidy films but, by the mid-1960s, had withdrawn them from television and sales in home movie markets.
