{"title_page": "Molality", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Molarity}}\n'''Molality''', also called '''molal concentration''', is a measure of the [[concentration]] of a [[Wiktionary:solute|solute]] in a [[solution]] in terms of [[amount of substance]] in a specified amount of [[mass]] of the solvent. This contrasts with the definition of [[molarity]] which is based on a specified [[volume]] of solution.\n\nA commonly used unit for molality in [[chemistry]] is [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[kilogram|kg]].

The earliest known use of the [[intensive property]] molality and of its adjectival unit, the now-deprecated ''molal'', appears to have been published by [[G. N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall|M.

In contrast, solutions prepared volumetrically (e.g. [[molar concentration]] or [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]]) are likely to change as temperature and pressure change. In many applications, this is a significant advantage because the mass, or the amount, of a substance is often more important than its volume (e.g. in a [[limiting reagent]] problem).\n\nAnother advantage of molality is the fact that the molality of one solute in a solution is independent of the presence or absence of other solutes.\n\n;Problem areas:\nUnlike all the other compositional properties listed in \"Relation\" section (below), molality ''depends'' on the choice of the substance to be called \u201csolvent\u201d in an arbitrary mixture. If there is only one pure liquid substance in a mixture, the choice is clear, but not all solutions are this clear-cut: in an alcohol\u2013water solution, either one could be called the solvent; in an alloy, or [[solid solution]], there is no clear choice and all constituents may be treated alike. In such situations, mass or mole fraction is the preferred compositional specification.\n\n== Relation to other compositional properties ==\nIn what follows, the solvent may be given the same treatment as the other constituents of the solution, such that the molality of the solvent of an ''n''-solute solution, say ''b''<sub>0</sub>, is found to be nothing more than the reciprocal of its molar mass, ''M''<sub>0</sub> (expressed as kg/mol):\n:<math>b_0=\\frac{n_0}{n_0 M_0}=\\frac{1}{M_0}.</math>\n\n=== Mass fraction===\nThe conversions to and from the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]], ''w'', of the solute in a single-solute solution are\n:<math>w=\\frac{1}{1+\\dfrac{1}{b M}},\\quad b=\\frac{w}{(1-w)M} ,</math>\n\nwhere ''b'' is the molality and ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] of the solute.\n\nMore  generally, for an ''n''-solute/one-solvent solution, letting ''b<sub>i</sub>'' and ''w<sub>i</sub>'' be, respectively, the molality and mass fraction of the ''i''-th solute,\n:<math>w_i=w_0 b_i M_i,\\quad b_i=\\frac{w_i}{w_0 M_i},</math>\n\nwhere ''M<sub>i</sub>'' is the molar mass of the ''i''th solute, and ''w''<sub>0</sub> is the mass fraction of the solvent, which is expressible both as a function of the molalities as well as a function of the other mass fractions,\n:<math>w_0=\\frac{1}{1+\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{b_j M_j}}=1-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{w_j}.</math>\n\n=== Mole fraction ===\nThe conversions to and from the [[mole fraction]], ''x'', of the solute in a single-solute solution are\n:<math>x=\\frac{1}{1+\\dfrac{1}{M_0 b}},\\quad b=\\frac{x}{M_0(1-x)},</math>\nwhere ''M''<sub>0</sub> is the molar mass of the solvent.\n\nMore generally, for an ''n''-solute/one-solvent solution, letting ''x<sub>i</sub>'' be the mole fraction of the ''i''th solute,\n:<math>x_i=x_0 M_0 b_i,\\quad b_i=\\frac{b_0 x_i}{x_0},</math>\n\nwhere ''x''<sub>0</sub> is the mole fraction of the solvent, expressible both as a function of the molalities as well as a function of the other mole fractions:\n:<math>x_0=\\frac{1}{1+M_0\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{b_j}}=1-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j}.</math>\n\n=== Molar concentration (molarity)===\nThe conversions to and from the [[molar concentration]], ''c'', for one-solute solutions are\n:<math>c = \\frac{\\rho b}{1+ b M},\\quad b=\\frac{c}{\\rho-cM},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1'' is the [[mass density]] of the solution, ''b'' is the molality, and ''M'' is the molar mass (in kg/mol) of the solute.\n\nFor solutions with ''n'' solutes, the conversions are\n:<math>c_i =c_0 M_0 b_i,\\quad b_i=\\frac{b_0 c_i}{c_0},</math>\n\nwhere the molar concentration of the solvent ''c''<sub>0</sub> is expressible both as a function of the molalities as well as a function of the molarities:\n:<math>c_0=\\frac{\\rho b_0}{1+\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{b_j M_j}}=\\frac{\\rho-\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{c_i M_i}}{M_0}.</math>\n\n=== Mass concentration ===\nThe conversions to and from the [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]], ''\u03c1''<sub>solute</sub>, of a single-solute solution are\n:<math>\\rho_\\mathrm{solute} = \\frac{\\rho b M}{1+b M},\\quad b=\\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{solute}}{M \\left(\\rho-\\rho_\\mathrm{solute}\\right)},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1'' is the mass density of the solution, ''b'' is the molality, and ''M'' is the molar mass of the solute.\n\nFor the general ''n''-solute solution, the mass concentration of the ''i''th solute, ''\u03c1<sub>i</sub>'', is related to its molality, ''b<sub>i</sub>'', as follows:\n:<math>\\rho_i = \\rho_0 b_i M_i,\\quad b_i=\\frac{\\rho_i}{\\rho_0 M_i},</math>\n\nwhere the mass concentration of the solvent, ''\u03c1''<sub>0</sub>, is expressible both as a function of the molalities as well as a function of the mass concentrations:\n:<math>\\rho_0=\\frac{\\rho}{1+\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^n b_j M_j}=\\rho-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{\\rho_i}.</math>\n\n=== Equal ratios ===\nAlternatively, we may use just the last two equations given for the compositional property of the solvent in each of the preceding sections, together with the relationships given below, to derive the remainder of properties in that set:\n:<math>\\frac{b_i}{b_j}=\\frac{x_i}{x_j}=\\frac{c_i}{c_j}=\\frac{\\rho_i M_j}{\\rho_j M_i}=\\frac{w_i M_j}{w_j M_i},</math>\n\nwhere ''i'' and ''j'' are subscripts representing ''all'' the constituents, the ''n'' solutes plus the solvent.\n\n=== Example of conversion ===\nAn acid mixture consists of 0.76, 0.04, and 0.20 mass fractions of 70% HNO<sub>3</sub>, 49% HF, and H<sub>2</sub>O, where the percentages refer to mass fractions of the bottled acids carrying a balance of H<sub>2</sub>O. The first step is determining the mass fractions of the constituents:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  w_\\mathrm{HNO_3} &= 0.70 \\times 0.76 = 0.532\\\\\n     w_\\mathrm{HF} &= 0.49 \\times 0.04 = 0.0196\\\\\n   w_\\mathrm{H_2O} &= 1 - w_\\mathrm{HNO_3} - w_\\mathrm{HF} = 0.448\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe approximate molar masses in kg/mol are\n:<math>M_\\mathrm{HNO_3}=0.063\\ \\mathrm{kg/mol},\\quad M_\\mathrm{HF}=0.020\\ \\mathrm{kg/mol},\\ M_\\mathrm{H_2O}=0.018\\ \\mathrm{kg/mol}.</math>\n\nFirst derive the molality of the solvent, in mol/kg,\n:<math>b_\\mathrm{H_2O}=\\frac{1}{M_\\mathrm{H_2O}}=\\frac{1}{0.018}\\ \\mathrm{mol/kg},</math>\n\nand use that to derive all the others by use of the equal ratios:\n:<math>\\frac{b_\\mathrm{HNO_3}}{b_\\mathrm{H_2O}}=\\frac{w_\\mathrm{HNO_3}M_\\mathrm{H_2O}}{w_\\mathrm{H_2O}M_\\mathrm{HNO_3}}\\quad \\therefore b_\\mathrm{HNO_3}=18.83\\ \\mathrm{mol/kg}.</math>\n\nActually, ''b''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> cancels out, because it is not needed. In this case, there is a more direct equation: we use it to derive the molality of HF:\n:<math>b_\\mathrm{HF}=\\frac{w_\\mathrm{HF}}{w_\\mathrm{H_2O}M_\\mathrm{HF}}=2.19\\ \\mathrm{mol/kg}.</math>\n\nThe mole fractions may be derived from this result:\n:<math>x_\\mathrm{H_2O}=\\frac{1}{1+M_\\mathrm{H_2O}\\left(b_\\mathrm{HNO_3}+b_\\mathrm{HF}\\right)}=0.726,</math>\n:<math>\\frac{x_\\mathrm{HNO_3}}{x_\\mathrm{H_2O}}=\\frac{b_\\mathrm{HNO_3}}{b_\\mathrm{H_2O}}\\quad \\therefore x_\\mathrm{HNO_3}=0.246,</math>\n:<math>x_\\mathrm{HF}=1-x_\\mathrm{HNO_3}-x_\\mathrm{H_2O}=0.029.</math>\n\n=== Osmolality ===\nOsmolality is a variation of molality that takes into account only solutes that contribute to a solution's [[osmotic pressure]]. It is measured in [[osmole]]s of the solute per [[kilogram]] of water. This unit is frequently used in [[medical laboratory]] results in place of [[osmolarity]], because it can be measured simply by depression of the freezing point of a solution, or [[cryoscopy]] (see also: [[osmostat]] and [[colligative properties]]).\n\n==Relation to apparent (molar) properties==\nMolality appears in the expression of the [[apparent molar property|apparent (molar) volume]] of a solute as a function of the molality ''b'' of that solute (and density of the solution and solvent):\n\n:<math>{}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_1 = \\frac{1}{b}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0^0}\\right) + \\frac{M_1}{\\rho}</math>{{clarification|date=August 2018}}\n\nFor multicomponent systems the relation is slightly modified by the sum of molalities of solutes.\n\n:<math>{}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_i = \\frac{1}{\\sum b_j}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0^0}\\right) + \\frac{\\sum b_j M_j}{\\sum b_j \\rho}</math>\n\nFor multicomponent systems with more than one solute a total molality  an mean apparent molar volume can be defined for the solutes together and also a mean molar mass of the solutes as if they were a single solute. In this case the first equality from above is modified with the mean molar mass M of the pseudosolute instead of the molar mass of the single solute:\n\n:<math>{}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_{12..} = \\frac{1}{b_T}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0^0}\\right) + \\frac{M}{\\rho}</math>, <math>M = \\sum y_i M_i</math>\n\n:<math>y_i = \\frac {b_i}{b_T}</math>, y<sub>i,j</sub> being ratios involving molalities of solutes i,j and the total molality b<sub>T</sub>.\n\nThe sum of products molalities - apparent molar volumes of solutes in their binary solutions equals the product between the sum of molalities of solutes and apparent molar volume in ternary of multicomponent solution.<ref>Harned Owen, Physical Chemistry of Electrolytic Solutions, third edition 1958, p. 398-399</ref>.\n\n:<math>{}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_{123..} (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + \\ldots) = b_1 {}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_1 + b_2 {}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_{2} + b_3 {}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_{3} + \\ldots</math>,\n\n=== Relation to apparent molar properties and activity coefficients ===\n\nFor concentrated ionic solutions the activity coefficient of the electrolyte is split into electric and statistical components.\n\nThe statistical part includes molality b, [[solvation|hydration index number h]], the number of ions from the dissociation and the ratio r<sub>a</sub> between the [[apparent molar property|apparent molar volume]] of the electrolyte and the molar volume of water.\n\nConcentrated solution statistical part of the activity coefficient is:\n:<math>\\ln \\gamma_s = \\frac{h- \\nu}{\\nu} \\ln \\left(1 + \\frac{br_a}{55.5}\\right) - \\frac{h}{\\nu} \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{br_a}{55.5}\\right) + \\frac{br_a\\left(r_a + h -\\nu\\right)}{55.5 \\left(1 + \\frac{br_a}{55.5}\\right)}</math><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1039/TF9555101235|title = The influence of ionic hydration on activity coefficients in concentrated electrolyte solutions|journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society|volume = 51|pages = 1235|year = 1955|last1 = Glueckauf|first1 = E.}}</ref>,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1039/TF9575300305|title = The influence of ionic hydration on activity coefficients in concentrated electrolyte solutions|journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society|volume = 53|pages = 305|year = 1957|last1 = Glueckauf|first1 = E.}}</ref><ref name=\"Kort\u00fcm1960\">{{cite journal|last1=Kort\u00fcm|first1=G.|title=The Structure of Electrolytic Solutions, herausgeg. von W.

In this case, there is a more direct equation: we use it to derive the molality of HF:\n:<math>b_\\mathrm{HF}=\\frac{w_\\mathrm{HF}}{w_\\mathrm{H_2O}M_\\mathrm{HF}}=2.19\\ \\mathrm{mol/kg}.</math>\n\nThe mole fractions may be derived from this result:\n:<math>x_\\mathrm{H_2O}=\\frac{1}{1+M_\\mathrm{H_2O}\\left(b_\\mathrm{HNO_3}+b_\\mathrm{HF}\\right)}=0.726,</math>\n:<math>\\frac{x_\\mathrm{HNO_3}}{x_\\mathrm{H_2O}}=\\frac{b_\\mathrm{HNO_3}}{b_\\mathrm{H_2O}}\\quad \\therefore x_\\mathrm{HNO_3}=0.246,</math>\n:<math>x_\\mathrm{HF}=1-x_\\mathrm{HNO_3}-x_\\mathrm{H_2O}=0.029.</math>\n\n=== Osmolality ===\nOsmolality is a variation of molality that takes into account only solutes that contribute to a solution's [[osmotic pressure]]. It is measured in [[osmole]]s of the solute per [[kilogram]] of water. This unit is frequently used in [[medical laboratory]] results in place of [[osmolarity]], because it can be measured simply by depression of the freezing point of a solution, or [[cryoscopy]] (see also: [[osmostat]] and [[colligative properties]]).\n\n==Relation to apparent (molar) properties==\nMolality appears in the expression of the [[apparent molar property|apparent (molar) volume]] of a solute as a function of the molality ''b'' of that solute (and density of the solution and solvent):\n\n:<math>{}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_1 = \\frac{1}{b}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0^0}\\right) + \\frac{M_1}{\\rho}</math>{{clarification|date=August 2018}}\n\nFor multicomponent systems the relation is slightly modified by the sum of molalities of solutes.\n\n:<math>{}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_i = \\frac{1}{\\sum b_j}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0^0}\\right) + \\frac{\\sum b_j M_j}{\\sum b_j \\rho}</math>\n\nFor multicomponent systems with more than one solute a total molality  an mean apparent molar volume can be defined for the solutes together and also a mean molar mass of the solutes as if they were a single solute. In this case the first equality from above is modified with the mean molar mass M of the pseudosolute instead of the molar mass of the single solute:\n\n:<math>{}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_{12..} = \\frac{1}{b_T}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0^0}\\right) + \\frac{M}{\\rho}</math>, <math>M = \\sum y_i M_i</math>\n\n:<math>y_i = \\frac {b_i}{b_T}</math>, y<sub>i,j</sub> being ratios involving molalities of solutes i,j and the total molality b<sub>T</sub>.\n\nThe sum of products molalities - apparent molar volumes of solutes in their binary solutions equals the product between the sum of molalities of solutes and apparent molar volume in ternary of multicomponent solution.<ref>Harned Owen, Physical Chemistry of Electrolytic Solutions, third edition 1958, p. 398-399</ref>.\n\n:<math>{}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_{123..} (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + \\ldots) = b_1 {}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_1 + b_2 {}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_{2} + b_3 {}^\\phi\\tilde{V}_{3} + \\ldots</math>,\n\n=== Relation to apparent molar properties and activity coefficients ===\n\nFor concentrated ionic solutions the activity coefficient of the electrolyte is split into electric and statistical components.\n\nThe statistical part includes molality b, [[solvation|hydration index number h]], the number of ions from the dissociation and the ratio r<sub>a</sub> between the [[apparent molar property|apparent molar volume]] of the electrolyte and the molar volume of water.\n\nConcentrated solution statistical part of the activity coefficient is:\n:<math>\\ln \\gamma_s = \\frac{h- \\nu}{\\nu} \\ln \\left(1 + \\frac{br_a}{55.5}\\right) - \\frac{h}{\\nu} \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{br_a}{55.5}\\right) + \\frac{br_a\\left(r_a + h -\\nu\\right)}{55.5 \\left(1 + \\frac{br_a}{55.5}\\right)}</math><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1039/TF9555101235|title = The influence of ionic hydration on activity coefficients in concentrated electrolyte solutions|journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society|volume = 51|pages = 1235|year = 1955|last1 = Glueckauf|first1 = E.}}</ref>,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1039/TF9575300305|title = The influence of ionic hydration on activity coefficients in concentrated electrolyte solutions|journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society|volume = 53|pages = 305|year = 1957|last1 = Glueckauf|first1 = E.}}</ref><ref name=\"Kort\u00fcm1960\">{{cite journal|last1=Kort\u00fcm|first1=G.|title=The Structure of Electrolytic Solutions, herausgeg. von W.

His real name is Jayson Thompson, but decided to take on his mother's maiden name of 'Munly' instead. He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly & The Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots from 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood & upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\" with two parents and two siblings - one brother and one sister.\n\nIn his own words:  \n\n''{{quote|\"I used to sneak the banjo out of its case and play it.

His family also owned a lakeside summer retreat in Ellsworth, Ohio.\n\n===Interest in hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him.\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from a hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Themes and genres===\n\nMunly's own music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\n===Songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of the musical process. <ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\">{{cite news |last1=Baranauskas |first1=Sarah |title=DBUK |url=http://marqueemag.com/2019/07/dbuk/ |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Marquee Magazine |date=July 1, 2019 |ref=DBUK Marquee}}</ref>\n\nHe also admits that he can be \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation. \n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist, but has worked with several musicians that are featured performers on his albums. However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\n===Slim Cessna's Auto Club===\n\nMunly joined Slim Cessna's Auto Club between 1998 and 1999 after being friends with Slim Cessna for a few years. This was during the time that Munly was recording ''Galvanized Yankee'' in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. ''Always Say Please and Thank You'' (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"SCAC 101\" on ''Cipher'' (2008) is about how Munly came to join the band.\n\n===Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots===\n\nMunly and The Lee Lewis Harlots were active from 2000 to 2006. They were a six-piece [[alternative country]] band with mostly stringed instruments. The members were: Munly ([[vocals]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]]), Elin Palmer ([[violin]], [[nyckelharpa]], string arrangements), Frieda Stalheim (violin), Rebecca Vera ([[cello]]), Paul Bradley ([[upright bass]]), and Jeff Linsenmaier ([[drums]]). <ref name=\"MM Info\">{{cite web |title=Info |url=https://www.munlymunly.com/info.html |website=munly munly |accessdate=24 March 2020 |ref=MM Info}}</ref> Some members of the band have also contributed backing vocals, though it is not known exactly who.\n\nTheir only album, ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004), has received much critical acclaim. It was re-released on vinyl in 2013 with three additional tracks. Of the three, only one is a previously unreleased Harlots track: \"[[Rufus Wainwright]], I'm Coming After You\".\n\nIn July 2006, Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots was voted the best band in [[Colorado]] by over 100 music experts in the [[Denver Post]] Underground Music Poll. <ref name=\"Munly Denver Post\">{{cite news |last1=Baca |first1=Ricardo |title=Munly takes No 1. in Post music poll |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2006/07/20/munly-takes-no-1-in-post-music-poll/ |accessdate=24 March 2020 |work=Denver Post |publisher=MediaNewsGroup, Inc. |date=July 20, 2006 |ref=Munly Denver Post}}</ref>\n\n===Munly & The Lupercalians===\n\nMunly is currently working on a multi-album set tentatively titled \"The Kinnery Of Lupercalia\", which will be about the fictional town of Lupercalia and the people who live there. \n\nThe first of the four albums, [[Petr & the Wulf]], was released in 2010.

His real name is Jayson Thompson, but decided to take on his mother's maiden name of 'Munly' instead. He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly & The Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots from 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood & upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\" with two parents and two siblings - one brother and one sister.\n\nIn his own words:  \n\n''{{quote|\"I used to sneak the banjo out of its case and play it.

His family also owned a lakeside summer retreat in Ellsworth, Ohio.\n\n===Interest in hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him.\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from a hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Themes and genres===\n\nMunly's own music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\n===Songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of the musical process. <ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\">{{cite news |last1=Baranauskas |first1=Sarah |title=DBUK |url=http://marqueemag.com/2019/07/dbuk/ |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Marquee Magazine |date=July 1, 2019 |ref=DBUK Marquee}}</ref>\n\nHe also admits that he can be \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation. \n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist, but has worked with several musicians that are featured performers on his albums. However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\n===Slim Cessna's Auto Club===\n\nMunly joined Slim Cessna's Auto Club between 1998 and 1999 after being friends with Slim Cessna for a few years. This was during the time that Munly was recording ''Galvanized Yankee'' in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. ''Always Say Please and Thank You'' (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"SCAC 101\" on ''Cipher'' (2008) is about how Munly came to join the band.\n\n===Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots===\n\nMunly and The Lee Lewis Harlots were active from 2000 to 2006. They were a six-piece [[alternative country]] band with mostly stringed instruments. The members were: Munly ([[vocals]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]]), Elin Palmer ([[violin]], [[nyckelharpa]], string arrangements), Frieda Stalheim (violin), Rebecca Vera ([[cello]]), Paul Bradley ([[upright bass]]), and Jeff Linsenmaier ([[drums]]). <ref name=\"MM Info\">{{cite web |title=Info |url=https://www.munlymunly.com/info.html |website=munly munly |accessdate=24 March 2020 |ref=MM Info}}</ref> Some members of the band have also contributed backing vocals, though it is not known exactly who.\n\nTheir only album, ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004), has received much critical acclaim.
