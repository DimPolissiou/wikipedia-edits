It was founded in 1966 and named after the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. In June 1966, Brunel College of Advanced Technology was awarded a [[royal charter]] and became Brunel University. The university is often described as a British [[plate glass university]].\n\nBrunel is organised into three colleges and three major research institutes, a structure adopted in August 2014 which also changed the university's name to Brunel University London. Brunel has over 12,900 students and 2,500 staff, and had a total income of \u00a3200.7 million in 2014/15, of which 25% came from grants and research contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/campus/financial-statements|title=Financial Statements {{!}} Brunel University London|website=www.brunel.ac.uk|publisher=Brunel University London|accessdate=27 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505095446/http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/campus/financial-statements|archivedate=5 May 2016}}</ref> Brunel has three constituent Academic Colleges: College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences, College of Business, Arts and Social Sciences and College of Health and Life Sciences.\n\nThe university is ranked as one of the top 400 universities in the world by ''[[QS World University Rankings]]'' 2020 and the ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]'' 2020. The university won the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] in 2011. Brunel is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]], the [[European University Association]], and [[Universities UK]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Brunel Statue on Brunel University grounds.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] at the university]]\n\n===Origins===\nBrunel is one of a number of British universities which were established in the 1960s following the [[Robbins Report]] on higher education. It is sometimes described as a \"[[plate glass university]]\". The university's origins lie in '''Acton Technical College''', which was split into two in 1957: Acton Technical College continued to cater for technicians and craftsmen, and the new '''Brunel College of Technology''' (named after [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], the British engineer) was dedicated to the education of [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer]]s.\n\nThe campus buildings were designed in the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style of architecture by [[Sheppard Robson|Richard Sheppard, Robson & Partners, Architects]].\n\nIn 1960 Brunel College of Technology was awarded the status of [[College of Advanced Technology (United Kingdom)|College of Advanced Technology]], and it was decided that it should expand at another site in order to accommodate the extra buildings that would be needed. [[Uxbridge]] was chosen to house the new buildings, and construction work hadn't even begun before the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]] officially changed the College's status: it was officially named '''Brunel College of Advanced Technology''' in 1962 \u2013 the tenth Advanced Technology College in the country, and the last to be awarded this title.\n\nThe [[Uxbridge (Vine Street) Branch Line|Uxbridge (Vine Street) railway branch line]] was closed in 1964, and the college purchased the land adjacent to its site where the railway had run for \u00a365,000 from the local council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/26547/Annual_Report_2005.pdf |title=Annual Report 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=Brunel University |accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1966 to present===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\nThe [[royal charter]] granting university status was awarded on 9 June 1966.<ref name=\"Siran2010\">{{cite book|author=Mukerji, Siran|title=Cases on Transnational Learning and Technologically Enabled Environments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vB24k7LvYPUC&pg=PA360|date=31 March 2010|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-61520-750-3|page=360}}</ref> The university continued to use both campuses until 1971, when it left the Acton site.\n\nIn 1980, the university merged with Shoreditch College of Education, located at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[Runnymede (borough)|Runnymede]]. This became Brunel's second campus. In 1995, the university expanded again, integrating the [[West London Institute of Higher Education]], and adding campuses in [[Osterley]] and [[Twickenham]]. This increased the number of courses that Brunel University was able to offer. Traditionally the university's strengths were in engineering, science, technology and social sciences but with the addition of the West London Institute, new departments such as arts, humanities, geography and earth science, health and sports science were added, and the size of the student body increased to over 12,000.\n\nBrunel has been the subject of controversy as its approach to higher education has been both market-driven and politically conservative.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The decision to award an honorary degree to [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1996, following the [[University of Oxford]]'s refusal to do so, provoked an outcry by staff and students, and as a result the ceremony had to be held in the [[House of Lords]] instead of on campus. In the late 1990s, the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Materials Engineering were all closed, and, in 2004, the then Vice-Chancellor [[Steven Schwartz (vice-chancellor)|Steven Schwartz]], initiated the reorganisation of the university's faculties and departments into schools, and closed the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences. The succeeding Vice-Chancellor, the sociologist Christopher Jenks, took office in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/press/news-24811 |title=Brunel University Appoints Professor Chris Jenks Vice-Chancellor |date=15 February 2006 |publisher=Brunel University |accessdate=5 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716054756/http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/press/news-24811 |archivedate=16 July 2011}}</ref> He was followed by Julia Buckingham, previously at [[Imperial College London]], who took up the position of Vice Chancellor at Brunel in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/julia-buckingham-be-next-universities-uk-president|title=Julia Buckingham to be next Universities UK president|date=2019-03-15|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, Brunel University licensed [[Creative Barcode]], an automated idea sharing platform which protects ownership of early stage ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativebarcode.com/newsitem?item=35|title=Creative Barcode - Home|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> The name was changed to Brunel University London by a supplemental charter dated 16 July 2014.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:HSBC at Brunel University - geograph.org.uk - 1518865.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the main Brunel campus]]\nIn the late 1990s Brunel devised a 10-year, \u00a3250&nbsp;million masterplan for the campus. This involved selling off campus sites at [[Englefield Green#Brunel University Runnymede Campus|Runnymede]], Osterley and Twickenham and using the revenue from the sales to renovate and update the buildings and facilities on the Uxbridge campus. Works carried out included a library extension, a state-of-the-art sports complex, renovated students' union facilities, a new Health Sciences teaching centre, and the construction of more halls of residence.\n\nThe Brunel campus (especially those buildings in the 1960s '[[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]]' architectural style) has appeared in several films, most famously in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', large parts of which were filmed on campus.

is a [[Public university|public]] [[Research universities|research university]] located in [[Uxbridge]], [[West London|west]] [[London]], United Kingdom. It was founded in 1966 and named after the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. In June 1966, Brunel College of Advanced Technology was awarded a [[royal charter]] and became Brunel University. The university is often described as a British [[plate glass university]].\n\nBrunel is organised into three colleges and three major research institutes, a structure adopted in August 2014 which also changed the university's name to Brunel University London. Brunel has over 12,900 students and 2,500 staff, and had a total income of \u00a3200.7 million in 2014/15, of which 25% came from grants and research contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/campus/financial-statements|title=Financial Statements {{!}} Brunel University London|website=www.brunel.ac.uk|publisher=Brunel University London|accessdate=27 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505095446/http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/campus/financial-statements|archivedate=5 May 2016}}</ref> Brunel has three constituent Academic Colleges: College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences, College of Business, Arts and Social Sciences and College of Health and Life Sciences.\n\nThe university is ranked as one of the top 400 universities in the world by ''[[QS World University Rankings]]'' 2020 and the ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]'' 2020. The university won the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] in 2011. Brunel is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]], the [[European University Association]], and [[Universities UK]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Brunel Statue on Brunel University grounds.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] at the university]]\n\n===Origins===\nBrunel is one of a number of British universities which were established in the 1960s following the [[Robbins Report]] on higher education. It is sometimes described as a \"[[plate glass university]]\". The university's origins lie in '''Acton Technical College''', which was split into two in 1957: Acton Technical College continued to cater for technicians and craftsmen, and the new '''Brunel College of Technology''' (named after [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], the British engineer) was dedicated to the education of [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer]]s.\n\nThe campus buildings were designed in the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style of architecture by [[Sheppard Robson|Richard Sheppard, Robson & Partners, Architects]].\n\nIn 1960 Brunel College of Technology was awarded the status of [[College of Advanced Technology (United Kingdom)|College of Advanced Technology]], and it was decided that it should expand at another site in order to accommodate the extra buildings that would be needed. [[Uxbridge]] was chosen to house the new buildings, and construction work hadn't even begun before the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]] officially changed the College's status: it was officially named '''Brunel College of Advanced Technology''' in 1962 \u2013 the tenth Advanced Technology College in the country, and the last to be awarded this title.\n\nThe [[Uxbridge (Vine Street) Branch Line|Uxbridge (Vine Street) railway branch line]] was closed in 1964, and the college purchased the land adjacent to its site where the railway had run for \u00a365,000 from the local council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/26547/Annual_Report_2005.pdf |title=Annual Report 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=Brunel University |accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1966 to present===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\nThe [[royal charter]] granting university status was awarded on 9 June 1966.<ref name=\"Siran2010\">{{cite book|author=Mukerji, Siran|title=Cases on Transnational Learning and Technologically Enabled Environments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vB24k7LvYPUC&pg=PA360|date=31 March 2010|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-61520-750-3|page=360}}</ref> The university continued to use both campuses until 1971, when it left the Acton site.\n\nIn 1980, the university merged with Shoreditch College of Education, located at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[Runnymede (borough)|Runnymede]]. This became Brunel's second campus. In 1995, the university expanded again, integrating the [[West London Institute of Higher Education]], and adding campuses in [[Osterley]] and [[Twickenham]]. This increased the number of courses that Brunel University was able to offer. Traditionally the university's strengths were in engineering, science, technology and social sciences but with the addition of the West London Institute, new departments such as arts, humanities, geography and earth science, health and sports science were added, and the size of the student body increased to over 12,000.\n\nBrunel has been the subject of controversy as its approach to higher education has been both market-driven and politically conservative.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The decision to award an honorary degree to [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1996, following the [[University of Oxford]]'s refusal to do so, provoked an outcry by staff and students, and as a result the ceremony had to be held in the [[House of Lords]] instead of on campus. In the late 1990s, the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Materials Engineering were all closed, and, in 2004, the then Vice-Chancellor [[Steven Schwartz (vice-chancellor)|Steven Schwartz]], initiated the reorganisation of the university's faculties and departments into schools, and closed the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences. The succeeding Vice-Chancellor, the sociologist Christopher Jenks, took office in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/press/news-24811 |title=Brunel University Appoints Professor Chris Jenks Vice-Chancellor |date=15 February 2006 |publisher=Brunel University |accessdate=5 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716054756/http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/press/news-24811 |archivedate=16 July 2011}}</ref> He was followed by Julia Buckingham, previously at [[Imperial College London]], who took up the position of Vice Chancellor at Brunel in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/julia-buckingham-be-next-universities-uk-president|title=Julia Buckingham to be next Universities UK president|date=2019-03-15|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, Brunel University licensed [[Creative Barcode]], an automated idea sharing platform which protects ownership of early stage ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativebarcode.com/newsitem?item=35|title=Creative Barcode - Home|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> The name was changed to Brunel University London by a supplemental charter dated 16 July 2014.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:HSBC at Brunel University - geograph.org.uk - 1518865.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the main Brunel campus]]\nIn the late 1990s Brunel devised a 10-year, \u00a3250&nbsp;million masterplan for the campus. This involved selling off campus sites at [[Englefield Green#Brunel University Runnymede Campus|Runnymede]], Osterley and Twickenham and using the revenue from the sales to renovate and update the buildings and facilities on the Uxbridge campus. Works carried out included a library extension, a state-of-the-art sports complex, renovated students' union facilities, a new Health Sciences teaching centre, and the construction of more halls of residence.\n\nThe Brunel campus (especially those buildings in the 1960s '[[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]]' architectural style) has appeared in several films, most famously in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', large parts of which were filmed on campus. It has also featured in several UK television series including ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'', ''[[Silent Witness]]'', ''[[The Sweeney]]'' and ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://londonist.com/2012/05/londons-top-brutalist-buildings|title=London's Top Brutalist Buildings|date=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation and governance==\n\n===Colleges===\nBrunel has three constituent Academic Colleges:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/colleges|title=Colleges and Research Institutes {{!}} Brunel University|publisher=Brunel University|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n;College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences:\n*Computer Science\n*Design\n*Electronic and Computer Engineering\n*Mathematics\n*Mechanical and Aerospace \n*Civil Engineering\n\n;College of Business, Arts and Social Sciences:\n* Brunel Business School\n* Brunel Law School\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Economics and Finance\n* Education\n* Social and Political Sciences\n\n;College of Health and Life Sciences:\n* Clinical Sciences\n* Life Sciences\n\n===Research Institutes===\nResearch at Brunel has been organised into three institutes:\n*Institute of Energy Futures\n*Institute of Environment, Health and Societies\n*Institute of Materials and Manufacturing\n\n===Governance===\nBrunel exists by virtue of a [[royal charter]] first granted in 1966 and it has the status of an [[exempt charity]] as defined by the [[Charities Act 2006]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/information|title=Brunel University: A Registered Charity|accessdate=23 January 2012|publisher=Brunel University}}</ref>\n\nThe governing body of Brunel is the Council, which comprises university staff and students and independent members.

''The Guardian'' and ''The Times'' ceased using the TQA to compile their rankings (they use the National Student Survey results instead) and therefore Brunel had fallen in both rankings.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>). Historically, the covalent C-Co bond is one of the first examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert any form of B<sub>12</sub> to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> are all deeply red-colored crystals and water solutions, due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food additives and in many common multivitamins. \n\n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. These are converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

The MUT function is necessary for proper [[myelin]] synthesis and is not affected by folate supplementation.\n# [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]], also known as methionine synthase, is a methyltransferase enzyme, which uses the MeB<sub>12</sub> and reaction type 2 to transfer a methyl group from [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] to [[homocysteine]], thereby generating [[tetrahydrofolate]] (THF) and [[methionine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee RV, Matthews RG | title = Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 1450\u20139 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2407589 | doi = 10.1096/fasebj.4.5.2407589 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72f397b529d457977a9e949dbfb325eebe124590 }}</ref> This functionality is lost in [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], resulting in an increased [[homocysteine]] level and the trapping of [[folate]] as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, from which THF (the active form of folate) cannot be recovered. THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert any form of B<sub>12</sub> to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> are all deeply red-colored crystals and water solutions, due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food additives and in many common multivitamins. \n\n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. These are converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over the other two forms except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

For example, MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur.

Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]].

For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar. [[Pat Fraley]] provided the voice for the younger Scrooge in flashback episode \"Once Upon a Dime\".<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Scrooge's Scottish heritage, the Money Bin, and the Number One Dime remains the same, but he is well known as a seasoned \"adventure [[Capitalism|capitalist]]\" and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of McDuck Enterprises here. Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.<ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\"/>\n\n===Webby Vanderquack===\n'''Webbigail''' \"'''Webby'''\" '''Vanderquack''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Kate Micucci]] in the 2017 series) is the granddaughter of Mrs. Beakley and friend of [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]]. \n\nIn the 1987 series, she visually resembles [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]] from the Disney comics. She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll. Her love for animals is a recurring theme, be it penguins,<ref name=\"Cold Duck\" /> koalas,<ref name=\"Back Out in the Outback\" /> dinosaurs,<ref name=\"Dinosaur Ducks\" /> or even the [[Yeti]].<ref name=\"Lost Crown of Genghis Khan\" /> Webby is typically wearing a pink shirt and a large hairbow, she is usually rather timid, and often has difficulties being accepted by the boys,<ref name=\"Bustle\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/webby-vanderquack-has-a-bigger-role-in-the-ducktales-reboot-representing-adventurous-girls-everywhere-74642|title=Webby Vanderquack Has A Bigger Role In The 'DuckTales' Reboot, Representing Adventurous Girls Everywhere|first=Jack|last=O'Keeffe|publisher=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2018-07-15}}</ref> although she is also a capable Junior Woodchuck scout.<ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Webby is around the boys' age, being an intellectual [[nerd]] and somewhat of an athletic [[genius]], with her character wearing a pink and blue sweater vest, a purple skirt, and a smaller hairbow on her right-side. She is revealed to be an enthusiastic adventure fan and [[Clan McDuck]] historian who idolizes Scrooge McDuck as one of the greatest adventurers of all time.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.imes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-ducktales-d23-expo-20170715-story.html|title='DuckTales' clip shows a whole new Webby Vanderquack|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=2017-07-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Having spent most of her life sheltered from the outside world by her grandmother (among the activities withheld from her prior to her befriending Huey, Dewey and Louie are theme park visits<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> and sledding<ref name=\"The Impossible Summit of Mt.

While the boys find her slightly intimidating upon their first meeting, they soon accept her as a close friend and surrogate sister, as her optimism and energy often help encourage them.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /><ref name=\"Bustle\" />\n\n===Launchpad McQuack===\n'''Launchpad McQuack''' (voiced by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Beck Bennett]] in the 2017 series) is Scrooge's pilot, and an original ''DuckTales'' character. He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /><ref name=\"The Shadow War!\" /><ref name=\"Friendship Hates Magic!\" />\n\n===Bentina Beakley===\n'''Mrs. Bentina Beakley''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]] in the 1987 series and ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]''; [[Wendee Lee]] in ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Toks Olagundoye]] in the 2017 series) is the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] and [[nanny]] of the household, and the maternal grandmother of Webby. Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings. She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British. After years of being overprotective of Webby, the nephews' arrival causes her to agree to let her granddaughter be a part of Scrooge's adventures.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> Donald refers to her as \"Mrs. B\" and the two don't get along at first; though when the kids are kidnapped by the Beagle Boys, they join forces and eventually gain respect for each other.<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> Initially, Beakley also dislikes Webby's friend Lena, regarding her as a bad influence, but after Lena saves her life she becomes more accepting of her.<ref name=\"Terror of the Terra-firmians!\" /> Beakley's relationship with Scrooge's butler Duckworth is frosty, due to him criticizing her housework.<ref name=\"McMystery at McDuck McManor!\" />\n\n===Donald Duck===\n'''[[Donald Duck]]''' (voiced by [[Tony Anselmo]]) is a signature Disney character, originally debuting in the 1934 animated short \"[[The Wise Little Hen]]\".\n\nIn the 1987 series, his appearance was deliberately downplayed, in order to give more focus to Scrooge and the boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/iducktalesi-invented-a-new-animated-wonderlandthat-92324 |title=DuckTales invented a new animated wonderland\u2014that quickly disappeared|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews.

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar. [[Pat Fraley]] provided the voice for the younger Scrooge in flashback episode \"Once Upon a Dime\".<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Scrooge's Scottish heritage, the Money Bin, and the Number One Dime remains the same, but he is well known as a seasoned \"adventure [[Capitalism|capitalist]]\" and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of McDuck Enterprises here. Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.<ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\"/>\n\n===Webby Vanderquack===\n'''Webbigail''' \"'''Webby'''\" '''Vanderquack''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Kate Micucci]] in the 2017 series) is the granddaughter of Mrs. Beakley and friend of [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]]. \n\nIn the 1987 series, she visually resembles [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]] from the Disney comics. She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll.

While the boys find her slightly intimidating upon their first meeting, they soon accept her as a close friend and surrogate sister, as her optimism and energy often help encourage them.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /><ref name=\"Bustle\" />\n\n===Launchpad McQuack===\n'''Launchpad McQuack''' (voiced by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Beck Bennett]] in the 2017 series) is Scrooge's pilot, and an original ''DuckTales'' character. He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y.

Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings.
