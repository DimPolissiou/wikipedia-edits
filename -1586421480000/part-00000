On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]].\n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because images rather than words are traditionally used for the [[symbol]]ism of the shoulder patch worn to identify a soldier's unit. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert Tab is unique in that while it is awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army. In order of precedence, they are the [[Special Forces Tab]], the [[Ranger Tab]], the [[Sapper Tab]], and the [[President's Hundred Tab]].

Often these tabs were worn on the underside of pocket flaps so as not to violate uniform regulations. Such tabs also appear on stickers, shirts, hats, etc. that soldiers would wear with civilian attire. These include tabs containing the words \"SNIPER\", \"AIR ASSAULT\", \"[[Artillery observer|FISTER]]\", \"SCOUT\", and \"RECON\" or \"[[Recondo|RECONDO]].\" The \"SAPPER\" tab was one of these unofficial tabs until 2004 when it became an official special skill badge/tab of the U.S. Army.\n\n===Recondo===\n{{multiple image\n|align    = right\n|width1   = 145\n|image1   = US Army ROTC Recondo Badge.png\n|caption1 = ROTC Recondo Badge\n|width2   = 145\n|image2   = Recondo.jpg\n|caption2 = Recondo Tab\n}}\n[[Recondo]] was a [[Vietnam War]]-era title meant to designate Soldiers of the wider US Army trained in Ranger tactics but without having been sent to Ranger school. The title \"Recondo\" stood for \"Reconnaissance Commando\". The standard Recondo insignia was a downward-pointing arrowhead with \"RECONDO\" printed above. The Recondo patch was standardly worn on each graduate's right breast pocket. Recondo was also sometimes worn in the style of the more traditional shoulder tab.\n\nIn designing the unit patch for the [[Security Force Assistance Brigade]] stood up in 2018, the US Army took inspiration from the classic Recondo arrowhead design. The original unit patch design was eventually softened to less directly replicate the Recondo arrowhead patch after complaints from the US Army special forces community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beret for Soldiers of 1st SFAB \u2013 Concern in SF Community |url=https://sof.news/sfa/sfab-beret/}}</ref> The SFAB unit patches also introduced the new \"ADVISOR\" unit level tab to the Army uniform.\n\nThe US Army ROTC still issues a Recondo Badge to cadets who successfully complete Recondo training at the Leader Development and Assessment Course.\n\n===Pershing===\n[[File:US Army Pershing Tab of the Former 56th Field Artillery Command.png|right|thumb|160px|Pershing Tab]]\nThe Pershing Tab was worn as part of the shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI) for units supporting the [[Pershing missile]] system.

In 1971 the 56th FA received their own SSI that included the Pershing tab, which continued through redesignation as the 56th Field Artillery Command in 1986. The [[3rd Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment]] wore the Pershing tab with the SSI of [[III Corps (United States)|III Corps]] from 1971 to 1981, then with that of the [[214th Field Artillery Brigade]] when it had a SSI created in 1981.

On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]].\n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because images rather than words are traditionally used for the [[symbol]]ism of the shoulder patch worn to identify a soldier's unit. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert Tab is unique in that while it is awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army.

Successors to Sumerian civilization including the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians continued to use these groupings.\n\nThe Classical Mesopotamian system formed the basis for [[Elam]]ite, Hebrew, [[Urartu|Urartian]], Hurrian, Hittite, [[Ugarit]]ic, [[Phoenicia]]n, Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Arabic, and Islamic metrologies.<ref>Conder 1908, p. 87.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Classical Mesopotamian System also has a proportional relationship, by virtue of standardized commerce, to [[Bronze Age]] Harappan and Egyptian metrologies.\n\nIn 1916, during the last years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and in the middle of [[World War I]], the German [[Assyriology|assyriologist]] [[Eckhard Unger]] found a copper-alloy bar while excavating at Nippur. The bar dates from c. 2650 BC and Unger claimed it was used as a measurement standard.

Successors to Sumerian civilization including the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians continued to use these groupings.\n\nThe Classical Mesopotamian system formed the basis for [[Elam]]ite, Hebrew, [[Urartu|Urartian]], Hurrian, Hittite, [[Ugarit]]ic, [[Phoenicia]]n, Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Arabic, and Islamic metrologies.<ref>Conder 1908, p. 87.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Classical Mesopotamian System also has a proportional relationship, by virtue of standardized commerce, to [[Bronze Age]] Harappan and Egyptian metrologies.\n\nIn 1916, during the last years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and in the middle of [[World War I]], the German [[Assyriology|assyriologist]] [[Eckhard Unger]] found a copper-alloy bar while excavating at Nippur. The bar dates from c. 2650 BC and Unger claimed it was used as a measurement standard. This irregularly formed and irregularly marked graduated rule supposedly defined the Sumerian cubit as about {{convert|518.6|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=acta/>\n\n==Biblical cubit==\n{{Main|Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement}}\nThe standard of the cubit in different countries and in different ages has varied. This realization has led the rabbis of the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]] to clarify the length of their cubit, saying that the measure of the cubit of which they have spoken \"applies to the cubit of middle-size\".<ref name=\"MishnahMaimonides1967\">''Mishnah with Maimonides' Commentary'' (ed.

In the [[Tosefta]] (''Kelim Baba-Metsia'' 6:12\u201313), however, it brings down a second opinion, namely, that of [[Rabbi Meir]], who distinguishes between a medium-sized cubit of 5 handbreadths, used principally for rabbinic measurements in measuring the bare and untilled ground near a vineyard and where there is a prohibition to grow therein seed plants under the laws of [[Diverse kinds|Diverse Kinds]], and a larger cubit of 6 handbreadths used to measure therewith the altar.
