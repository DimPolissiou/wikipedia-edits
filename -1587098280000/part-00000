Antigonae is in Orff's words a \"musical setting\" for the [[Greek tragedy]] of [[Antigone (Sophocles)|the same name]] by [[Sophocles]]. However, it functions as an [[opera]].\n\nThe opera is a line-by-line setting of the German translation of Sophocles' play by [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. However, Orff did not treat H\u00f6lderlin's translation of the play as a traditional opera libretto, but rather as the basis for a \"musical transformation\" of the tragic language of the drama of Ancient Greece. [[Sophocles]]'s play was written in 442 BC, and H\u00f6lderlin's 1804 translation copies faithfully the mood and movement of Greek tragedy.<ref>Sch\u00e4fer, Walter Erich (1960).

King Kreon ([[Creon]]), who ascended the [[throne]] of Thebes after both brothers are killed in battle, decrees that Polynices is not to be buried. Antigonae, his sister, defies the order, but is caught. Kreon decrees that she be buried alive in spite of the fact that she is betrothed to his son, [[Haemon]]. The gods, through the blind prophet [[Tiresias]], express their disapproval of Kreon's decision, which convinces him to rescind his order, and he goes to bury Polynices.  However, Antigonae has already hanged herself rather than be buried alive. When Kreon arrives at the tomb where she was to be interred, his son, Haemon, attacks him and then kills himself. Finally, when Kreon's wife, [[Eurydice of Thebes|Eurydice]], is informed of Haemon's and Antigonae's death she, too, takes her own life. At the end of the play, and the opera, Kreon is the only principal left alive.\n\n== Music ==\nOrff's musical setting of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin's Sophocles translation from 1804 created a novel form of musical theatre in which the poetic text itself becomes musicalized through the declamation of the singing voices. An extraordinary reduction of the structures of the pitch domain, in connection with the predominance of rhythmic patterns, has been described as an essential feature of Orff's late style. <ref>Stefan Kunze: ''Orffs Trag\u00f6dien-Bearbeitungen und die Moderne.''

Peter Lang, Bern/Frankfurt/New York 2006.</ref>\n\nConcentrating on an ensemble of percussion instruments with and without definite pitches, originally certainly born out of the fascination that the orchestra's only still evolving group exercised on 20th-century composers, also appears to be a veritable patent solution for a composer who is interested in creating pitch organizations had never been a central concern. The idea of a differentiated cooperation based on the division of musical functions, which has distinguished the orchestra of Western art music that has grown organically over the centuries, appears in the orchestra of Orff\u2019s operas on [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin | H\u00f6lderlin]]\u2019s translations from Sophokles transposed on instrument constellations that were previously unknown to European art music. In the score of  ''Antigonae'', six grand pianos and a group of xylophones, which were mostly given only marginal tasks in the traditional orchestra, take on the role that the group of strings had in the orchestration of Viennese classical music. <ref>[[J\u00fcrgen Maehder]]: ''Die Dramaturgie der Instrumente in den Antikenopern von Carl Orff.''

In the course of the last two decades, Orff\u2019s H\u00f6lderlin operas have received more attention than in the years before 2000, not least because of pronounced similarities between Orff's musical language and more recent tendencies of Minimal Music. Of his three operas on drama from Greek Antiquity, especially ''Antigonae'' has been able to assert itself in the repertoire, since [[Arthur Honegger]] 's opera ''[[Antigone (Honegger)|Antigone]]'' (Brussels, [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie]], 1927), despite its libretto by [[Jean Cocteau]], has not been able to enter the standard operatic repertory. <ref>Theo Hirsbrunner: ''Carl Orffs \u201eAntigonae\u201c und \u201eOedipus der Tyrann\u201c im Vergleich mit Arthur Honeggers \u201eAntigone\u201c und Igor Strawinskys \u201eOedipus Rex\u201c.''

Schott, Mainz 2015, pp. 231\u2013245.</ref>\n\n==Instrumentation==\nAccording to the score, which is published by Schott Music, ''Antigonae'' is scored for an unusual orchestra with a strong percussion section. This orchestra is to be well screened from the audience when the opera is performed.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* 6 [[flute]]s all doubling [[piccolo]]s\n* 6 [[oboe]]s with which 3 double [[cor anglais]]\n* 6 [[trumpet]]s with [[Mute (music)|mutes]]\n{{col-break}}\n* 4 [[harp]]s\n* 6 grand [[piano]]s with 2 players each*\n* 9 [[contrabass]]es\n{{col-end}}\n(*) At several points, the strings are struck with various items, including wooden [[drum stick]]s on the higher strings, [[timpani]] sticks on the lower strings, and also a [[plectrum]].\n\nThe percussion section requires 10 to 15 players to perform on the following instruments:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* 7\u20138 [[timpani]] (including a drum on high A)\n* [[lithophone]] (soprano-range)\n* 2\u20133 [[xylophone]]s\n* 10 \"trough xylophones\" (2 soprano-xylophones, 6 tenor-xylophones, 2 bass-xylophones)*\n* 1 small wood drum\n* 1 large African slit-drum\n* 2 high [[bell]]s in D(5) and E(5)\n* 3 [[glockenspiel]] (2 high-range)\n* 4 pairs of [[zill|antique cymbals]]\n{{col-break}}\n* 3 [[suspended cymbal]]s (Turkish)\n* 3 pairs of [[crash cymbal]]s (Turkish)\n* Small [[Anvil#Musical instruments|anvil]]\n* 3 [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]]\n* 2 [[bass drum]]s\n* 6 [[tambourine]]s\n* 6 pairs of [[castanets]]\n* 10 large Javanese [[gong]]s pitched in G(1), C(2), D(2), E(2), G(2), A(3), C(3), D(3), E(3) and F(3)\n{{col-end}}\n(*) These are [[Orff Schulwerk]] instruments.\n\nFor the percussion, Carl Orff insisted on using the right kind of instruments. The two bells must be of typical shape; tubular bells and \"plate\" bells are not acceptable. The castanets must be of the type without handles, e.g. those only connected together via a string.\n\nCarl Orff also gave extensive performance directions that should be taken into account at performances. For instance, some of the 12 pianists switch to other pianos at several sections. In another place, the entire trumpet section is required to perform some passages backstage before returning to the orchestra.\n\n== Recordings ==\n===Audio===\n* Res Fischer, [[Hilde Zadek]], [[Benno Kusche]], [[Hermann Uhde]], Helmut Krebs, [[Lorenz Fehenberger]], [[Ernst Haefliger]], [[Josef Greindl]]; [[Wiener Philharmoniker]], conductor: [[Ferenc Fricsay]].

Created by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]] in January 2015 with original story by K\u014d Nakamura, the project began as a [[manga]] before expanding to other media. In addition to other manga, ''BanG Dream!'' includes an [[anime]] television series, live concerts, music CDs and videos, and the mobile [[rhythm game]] ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!'' by Craft Egg.\n\nThe franchise's premise is based around [[all-female band]]s whose members are also voice actresses in the anime and mobile game; {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, the project has seven groups, four of which are capable of playing their respective characters' instruments. The first band, Poppin'Party, was formed in February 2015, and further groups were introduced in 2017 with the launch of the mobile game: Afterglow, Pastel\uff0aPalettes, Roselia, and Hello, Happy World!. At the end of 2018, a [[backup band]] called The Third was renamed to Raise A Suilen and joined the series, followed by a seventh unit named Morfonica in 2020. For live performances, Poppin'Party, Roselia, Raise A Suilen, and Morfonica's voice actresses play their own music, while the others are limited to vocals.\n\nThe anime currently consists of three seasons. The first season, produced by Issen ([[OLM, Inc.|OLM]] with Bushiroad) and [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]], aired from January to April 2017. [[Sanzigen]] took over production duties for the second and third seasons, which were respectively broadcast in winter 2019 and 2020. A movie ''BanG Dream! Film Live'' premiered in 2019, while a sequel has been announced. Spin-off anime series include ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! \u2606 Pico'' and its sequel ''Pico ~Ohmori~'' by Sanzigen with DMM.futureworks and ''Pastel Life'' by [[Studio A-Cat]].\n\nThe series has enjoyed international popularity for its live performances and mobile game, while the anime has seen mixed but improving reviews with later seasons. In 2018, the franchise expanded to include a male-based counterpart ''[[Argonavis from BanG Dream!]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of BanG Dream! characters}}\n''BanG Dream!'' follows Kasumi Toyama, a happy-go-lucky girl and a new student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School. During her first weeks at the school, she tries out for numerous clubs in an effort to rediscover the \"Star Beat\", a \"sparkling, heart-pounding\" feeling she experienced while looking up at the stars in the night sky as a child.\n\nOne day, while returning from school, she spots a trail of star stickers that lead her to a pawnshop owned by her classmate Arisa Ichigaya. In the storage area, she finds a star-shaped guitar with glittery stickers on it and quickly becomes attached to it. The two later visit a local [[live house]], SPACE, where Kasumi decides to create a band upon watching a performance by a group named Glitter*Green. She then recruits Arisa and three of their classmates \u2013 S\u0101ya Yamabuki, Tae Hanazono, and Rimi Ushigome \u2013 to join her, though they are reluctant for personal reasons. Despite their initial misgivings, the five overcome many hurdles and ultimately agree to form the band \"Poppin'Party\". With her band mates, Kasumi finds the excitement that she had been looking for.\n\nDuring their first year of high school, Poppin'Party meet and befriend four all-girl bands at Hanasakigawa and nearby Haneoka Girls' High School, each of whom have their own stories: Afterglow consists of five childhood friends who maintain their friendship through music; Pastel\uff0aPalettes are an [[Japanese idol|idol group]] who are capable of playing their own instruments; Roselia strives to become the perfect band; and Hello, Happy World! is an eccentric band that seeks to spread happiness.\n\n==History==\nThe concept for ''BanG Dream!'' was created in March 2014 by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]], who wanted to lead a music project after seeing the success of ''[[Love Live! School Idol Festival]]'', a mobile game published by his company.<ref name=\"Kidani interview\">{{cite interview|last=Kidani|first=Takaaki|subject-link=Takaaki Kidani|interviewer=''Real Sound''|url=https://magnavalon.com/2019/05/19/bang-dream-interview-with-bushiroads-takaaki-kidani-the-path-and-future-of-bang-dream-project-part-1/|title=BanG Dream!

Created by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]] in January 2015 with original story by K\u014d Nakamura, the project began as a [[manga]] before expanding to other media. In addition to other manga, ''BanG Dream!'' includes an [[anime]] television series, live concerts, music CDs and videos, and the mobile [[rhythm game]] ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!'' by Craft Egg.\n\nThe franchise's premise is based around [[all-female band]]s whose members are also voice actresses in the anime and mobile game; {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, the project has seven groups, four of which are capable of playing their respective characters' instruments. The first band, Poppin'Party, was formed in February 2015, and further groups were introduced in 2017 with the launch of the mobile game: Afterglow, Pastel\uff0aPalettes, Roselia, and Hello, Happy World!. At the end of 2018, a [[backup band]] called The Third was renamed to Raise A Suilen and joined the series, followed by a seventh unit named Morfonica in 2020. For live performances, Poppin'Party, Roselia, Raise A Suilen, and Morfonica's voice actresses play their own music, while the others are limited to vocals.\n\nThe anime currently consists of three seasons. The first season, produced by Issen ([[OLM, Inc.|OLM]] with Bushiroad) and [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]], aired from January to April 2017. [[Sanzigen]] took over production duties for the second and third seasons, which were respectively broadcast in winter 2019 and 2020. A movie ''BanG Dream! Film Live'' premiered in 2019, while a sequel has been announced. Spin-off anime series include ''BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! \u2606 Pico'' and its sequel ''Pico ~Ohmori~'' by Sanzigen with DMM.futureworks and ''Pastel Life'' by [[Studio A-Cat]].\n\nThe series has enjoyed international popularity for its live performances and mobile game, while the anime has seen mixed but improving reviews with later seasons. In 2018, the franchise expanded to include a male-based counterpart ''[[Argonavis from BanG Dream!]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of BanG Dream! characters}}\n''BanG Dream!'' follows Kasumi Toyama, a happy-go-lucky girl and a new student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School. During her first weeks at the school, she tries out for numerous clubs in an effort to rediscover the \"Star Beat\", a \"sparkling, heart-pounding\" feeling she experienced while looking up at the stars in the night sky as a child.\n\nOne day, while returning from school, she spots a trail of star stickers that lead her to a pawnshop owned by her classmate Arisa Ichigaya. In the storage area, she finds a star-shaped guitar with glittery stickers on it and quickly becomes attached to it. The two later visit a local [[live house]], SPACE, where Kasumi decides to create a band upon watching a performance by a group named Glitter*Green. She then recruits Arisa and three of their classmates \u2013 S\u0101ya Yamabuki, Tae Hanazono, and Rimi Ushigome \u2013 to join her, though they are reluctant for personal reasons. Despite their initial misgivings, the five overcome many hurdles and ultimately agree to form the band \"Poppin'Party\". With her band mates, Kasumi finds the excitement that she had been looking for.\n\nDuring their first year of high school, Poppin'Party meet and befriend four all-girl bands at Hanasakigawa and nearby Haneoka Girls' High School, each of whom have their own stories: Afterglow consists of five childhood friends who maintain their friendship through music; Pastel\uff0aPalettes are an [[Japanese idol|idol group]] who are capable of playing their own instruments; Roselia strives to become the perfect band; and Hello, Happy World! is an eccentric band that seeks to spread happiness.\n\n==History==\nThe concept for ''BanG Dream!'' was created in March 2014 by Bushiroad president [[Takaaki Kidani]], who wanted to lead a music project after seeing the success of ''[[Love Live! School Idol Festival]]'', a mobile game published by his company.<ref name=\"Kidani interview\">{{cite interview|last=Kidani|first=Takaaki|subject-link=Takaaki Kidani|interviewer=''Real Sound''|url=https://magnavalon.com/2019/05/19/bang-dream-interview-with-bushiroads-takaaki-kidani-the-path-and-future-of-bang-dream-project-part-1/|title=BanG Dream!

The first known commercially available phantom-powered microphone was the [[Schoeps]] model CMT 20, which came out in 1964, built to the specifications of French radio with 9\u201312 volt DC phantom power; the positive pole of this powering was grounded.

A microphone or other device can obtain DC power from either signal line to ground terminal, and two capacitors block this DC from appearing at the output. R1 and R2 should be 6.81k ohms for \"P48\" 48 volt phantom. R3-6 and [[Zener diode]]s 1-4 protect the output to a maximum of 10v.]]\n\n[[File:Audio-Technica AT8801 Phantom Power Supply.jpg|thumb|right| An external phantom power supply.]]\n\nPhantom powering consists of a [[phantom circuit]] where direct current is applied equally through the two [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] lines of a [[balanced audio connector]] (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an [[XLR connector]]). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for [[dynamic microphone]]s could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.<ref group=\"note\">There are phantom-powered vacuum tube microphones, such as the [http://www.microtechgefell.com/index.php/en/microphones/studio-a-recording/large-membrane-tube-mics/340-um900-roehrenmikrofon Microtech Gefell UM900] and [http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/187139bf88c8539d/index.html/ Audio-Technica AT3060]</ref>\n\nWith phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as \"parallel powering\" or \"T-powering\" (from the German term ''Tonaderspeisung''), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.\n\nThe IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 [[kilohm|k\u03a9]] for 48 V, 1.2 k\u03a9 for 24 V, and 680 \u03a9 for 12 V), and the shield is [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The 6.81&nbsp;k\u03a9 value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1%<ref>http://sound.whsites.net/project96.htm</ref> or better to maintain good [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.\n\nNearly all modern [[mixing console|mixing consoles]] have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, while on smaller mixers a single master switch may control power delivery to all channels. Phantom power can be blocked in any  channel with a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.\n\n[[Instrument amplifier]]s rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.\n\n==Caveats==\n[[File:AKG C1000S microphone, open.jpg|right|thumb|[[AKG C1000|AKG C1000S]] showing battery]]\n\nSome microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails, which may be useful.\n\nPhantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1&nbsp;[[Milliampere|mA]] per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2&nbsp;mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power supply circuits, especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2&nbsp;mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.\n\nMid-1970s and later condenser microphones designed for 48-volt phantom powering often require much more current (e.g., 2\u20134&nbsp;mA for Neumann transformerless microphones, 4\u20135&nbsp;mA for the Schoeps CMC (\"Colette\") series and Josephson microphones, 5\u20136&nbsp;mA for most [[Shure]] KSM-series microphones, 8&nbsp;mA for CAD Equiteks and 10&nbsp;mA for Earthworks). The IEC standard gives 10&nbsp;mA as the maximum allowed current per microphone. If its required current is not available, a microphone may still put out a signal, but it cannot deliver its intended level of performance. The specific symptoms vary somewhat, but the most common result will be reduction of the maximum sound-pressure level that the microphone can handle without overload (distortion). Some microphones will also show lower sensitivity (output level for a given sound-pressure level).\n\nMost [[ground lift]] switches have the unwanted effect of disconnecting phantom power. There must always be a DC current path between pin 1 of the microphone and the negative side of the 48 volt supply, if power is to reach the microphone's electronics. Lifting the ground, which is normally pin 1, breaks this path and disables the phantom power supply.\n\nThere is a common belief that connecting a dynamic or ribbon microphone to a phantom-powered input will damage it. There are three possibilities for this damage to occur. If there is a fault in the cable, phantom power may damage some mics by applying a voltage across the output of the microphone.<ref>{{cite web |quote=Sending Phantom Power to an old (prior to 1970 design) ribbon microphone without an isolating transformer, while using a bad cable, which has the ground (pin 1) shorted to pin 2 or pin 3 of the XLR.

A keyed variation of the usual [[XLR connector]], the [[XLD connector]], may be used to prevent accidental interchange of analog and digital devices.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Francis Rumsey |author2=John Watkinson |title=Digital interface handbook third edition |publisher=Elsevier |year=2004 |ISBN=0-240-51909-4 |page=204}}</ref>\n\n==Other microphone powering techniques==\nT-power, also known as A-B powering<ref>\n\nMichael Talbot-Smith ''Sound assistance'', Focal Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-240-51572-2}}, pages 94,95\n\n</ref> or T12, described in DIN 45595, is an alternative to phantom powering that is still widely used in the world of production film sound. Many mixers and recorders intended for that market have a T-power option. Many older Sennheiser and Schoeps microphones use this powering method, although newer recorders and mixers are phasing out this option. Adapter barrels, and dedicated power supplies, are made to accommodate T powered microphones. There is often no audible difference between microphones featuring this method and microphones with P48 powering. In this scheme, 12{{nbsp}}volts is applied through 180{{nbsp}}ohm resistors between the microphone's \"hot\" terminal (XLR pin 2) and the microphone's \"cold\" terminal (XLR pin 3). This results in a 12-volt potential difference with significant current capability across pins 2 and 3, which would likely cause permanent damage if applied to a dynamic or ribbon microphone.\n\nPlug-in-power (PiP), is the low-current 3\u20135&nbsp;V supply provided at the microphone jack of some consumer equipment, such as portable recorders and computer [[sound card]]s. It is also defined in IEC 61938.<ref>https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142</ref> It is unlike phantom power since it is an unbalanced interface with a low voltage (around +5{{nbsp}}volts) connected to the signal conductor with return through the sleeve; the DC power is in common with the audio signal from the microphone. A capacitor is used to block the DC from subsequent audio frequency circuits.  It is often used for powering [[electret microphone]]s, which will not function without power. It is suitable only for powering microphones specifically designed for use with this type of power supply. Damage may result if these microphones are connected to true (48&nbsp;V) phantom power through a 3.5&nbsp;mm to XLR adapter that connects the XLR shield to the 3.5&nbsp;mm sleeve.<ref>http://www.microphone-data.com/media/filestore/articles/Powering%20mics-10.pdf Chris Woolf ''Powering Microphones'', retrieved 2013 April 28</ref> Plug-in-power is covered by Japanese standard CP-1203A:2007<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeita.or.jp/cgi-bin/standard_e/list.cgi?cateid=1&subcateid=6|title=JEITA / JEITA Standards / AV&IT Technology Standardization / Interface|website=www.jeita.or.jp|access-date=2016-04-19}}</ref>\n\nA similar line-powering scheme is found in computer sound cards.

A microphone or other device can obtain DC power from either signal line to ground terminal, and two capacitors block this DC from appearing at the output. R1 and R2 should be 6.81k ohms for \"P48\" 48 volt phantom. R3-6 and [[Zener diode]]s 1-4 protect the output to a maximum of 10v.]]\n\n[[File:Audio-Technica AT8801 Phantom Power Supply.jpg|thumb|right| An external phantom power supply.]]\n\nPhantom powering consists of a [[phantom circuit]] where direct current is applied equally through the two [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] lines of a [[balanced audio connector]] (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an [[XLR connector]]). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for [[dynamic microphone]]s could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.<ref group=\"note\">There are phantom-powered vacuum tube microphones, such as the [http://www.microtechgefell.com/index.php/en/microphones/studio-a-recording/large-membrane-tube-mics/340-um900-roehrenmikrofon Microtech Gefell UM900] and [http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/187139bf88c8539d/index.html/ Audio-Technica AT3060]</ref>\n\nWith phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as \"parallel powering\" or \"T-powering\" (from the German term ''Tonaderspeisung''), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.\n\nThe IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 [[kilohm|k\u03a9]] for 48 V, 1.2 k\u03a9 for 24 V, and 680 \u03a9 for 12 V), and the shield is [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The 6.81&nbsp;k\u03a9 value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1%<ref>http://sound.whsites.net/project96.htm</ref> or better to maintain good [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.\n\nNearly all modern [[mixing console|mixing consoles]] have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, while on smaller mixers a single master switch may control power delivery to all channels. Phantom power can be blocked in any  channel with a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.\n\n[[Instrument amplifier]]s rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.\n\n==Caveats==\n[[File:AKG C1000S microphone, open.jpg|right|thumb|[[AKG C1000|AKG C1000S]] showing battery]]\n\nSome microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails, which may be useful.\n\nPhantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1&nbsp;[[Milliampere|mA]] per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2&nbsp;mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power supply circuits, especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2&nbsp;mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.\n\nMid-1970s and later condenser microphones designed for 48-volt phantom powering often require much more current (e.g., 2\u20134&nbsp;mA for Neumann transformerless microphones, 4\u20135&nbsp;mA for the Schoeps CMC (\"Colette\") series and Josephson microphones, 5\u20136&nbsp;mA for most [[Shure]] KSM-series microphones, 8&nbsp;mA for CAD Equiteks and 10&nbsp;mA for Earthworks). The IEC standard gives 10&nbsp;mA as the maximum allowed current per microphone. If its required current is not available, a microphone may still put out a signal, but it cannot deliver its intended level of performance. The specific symptoms vary somewhat, but the most common result will be reduction of the maximum sound-pressure level that the microphone can handle without overload (distortion). Some microphones will also show lower sensitivity (output level for a given sound-pressure level).\n\nMost [[ground lift]] switches have the unwanted effect of disconnecting phantom power. There must always be a DC current path between pin 1 of the microphone and the negative side of the 48 volt supply, if power is to reach the microphone's electronics. Lifting the ground, which is normally pin 1, breaks this path and disables the phantom power supply.\n\nThere is a common belief that connecting a dynamic or ribbon microphone to a phantom-powered input will damage it. There are three possibilities for this damage to occur. If there is a fault in the cable, phantom power may damage some mics by applying a voltage across the output of the microphone.<ref>{{cite web |quote=Sending Phantom Power to an old (prior to 1970 design) ribbon microphone without an isolating transformer, while using a bad cable, which has the ground (pin 1) shorted to pin 2 or pin 3 of the XLR.

Many mixers and recorders intended for that market have a T-power option. Many older Sennheiser and Schoeps microphones use this powering method, although newer recorders and mixers are phasing out this option. Adapter barrels, and dedicated power supplies, are made to accommodate T powered microphones. There is often no audible difference between microphones featuring this method and microphones with P48 powering. In this scheme, 12{{nbsp}}volts is applied through 180{{nbsp}}ohm resistors between the microphone's \"hot\" terminal (XLR pin 2) and the microphone's \"cold\" terminal (XLR pin 3). This results in a 12{{nbsp}}volt potential difference with significant current capability across pins 2 and 3, which would likely cause permanent damage if applied to a dynamic or ribbon microphone.\n\nPlug-in-power (PiP), is the low-current 3\u20135&nbsp;V supply provided at the microphone jack of some consumer equipment, such as portable recorders and computer [[sound card]]s. It is also defined in IEC 61938.<ref>https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142</ref> It is unlike phantom power since it is an unbalanced interface with a low voltage (around +5{{nbsp}}volts) connected to the signal conductor with return through the sleeve; the DC power is in common with the audio signal from the microphone. A capacitor is used to block the DC from subsequent audio frequency circuits.  It is often used for powering [[electret microphone]]s, which will not function without power. It is suitable only for powering microphones specifically designed for use with this type of power supply. Damage may result if these microphones are connected to true (48&nbsp;V) phantom power through a 3.5&nbsp;mm to XLR adapter that connects the XLR shield to the 3.5&nbsp;mm sleeve.<ref>http://www.microphone-data.com/media/filestore/articles/Powering%20mics-10.pdf Chris Woolf ''Powering Microphones'', retrieved 2013 April 28</ref> Plug-in-power is covered by Japanese standard CP-1203A:2007<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeita.or.jp/cgi-bin/standard_e/list.cgi?cateid=1&subcateid=6|title=JEITA / JEITA Standards / AV&IT Technology Standardization / Interface|website=www.jeita.or.jp|access-date=2016-04-19}}</ref>\n\nA similar line-powering scheme is found in computer sound cards.

He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]], and [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]] (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete [[Crosley Field]]) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|a multipurpose stadium]] which could host both baseball and football games.\n\nDue to the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|impending merger]] of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the {{nfly|1970}} season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities ([[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Lexington, Kentucky]]; [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], and [[Springfield, Ohio]]) that are all no more than {{convert|110|mi}} away from downtown Cincinnati, along with [[Indianapolis]], until the [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|Baltimore Colts relocated]] there prior to the [[1984 NFL season]].\n\nThe Bengals won the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC championship]] in {{nfly|1981}} and {{nfly|1988}}, but lost [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]] and [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] to the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, [[Mike Brown (American football executive)|Mike Brown]]. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder [[Austin Knowlton]] and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.<ref>{{cite news|last=Katzowitz|first=Josh|title=Mike Brown Now Owns Most of Bengals Franchise|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22475988/34008660|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|website=CBSSports.com|date=December 23, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s and the 2000s were a period of great struggle.

The city's world-renowned [[Cincinnati Zoo|zoo]] was also home to a rare white [[Bengal tiger]]. However, possibly as an insult to [[Art Modell]], or possibly as a homage to his own start as a head coach to the [[Massillon Washington High School|Massillon Tigers]], Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 and which is still in use; however, that design featured yellow stripes on a turquoise helmet{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which were more uniform in width. The Bengals would begin play in the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]].\n\nIn 1966, the American Football League agreed to [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|a merger]] with its older and more established rival, the [[National Football League]]. Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise. One of the reasons the NFL agreed to this was that they wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added that brought the combined total number clubs in the merged league to twenty-six teams. The NFL was content for that team to be in the American Football League because it meant that the existing nine AFL clubs were the ones that had to provide players in the ensuing [[expansion draft]] and the NFL owners preferred for the ensuing dilution of talent to occur in what they had always considered to be an inferior league.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million\u2013400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.\n\nPrior to the merger being announced, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League, and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/PaulBrown.htm|title=Paul Brown|publisher=Conigliofamily.com|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref> However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term. He ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL when after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970.\n\nThere was also a complication: [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]] were in need of a facility to replace the antiquated, obsolete [[Crosley Field]], which they had used since 1912. Parking nightmares had plagued the city as far back as the 1950s, the little park lacked modern amenities, and New York City, which in 1957 had lost both its [[National League]] teams (the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]) to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, was actively courting Reds owner [[Powel Crosley]]. However, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated worsening problems with the Crosley Field location, which were exacerbated by the [[Mill Creek Expressway]] ([[I-75]]) project that ran alongside the park.\n[[File:Cincinnati-paul-brown-stadium2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Paul Brown Stadium]], home of the Bengals.]]\nWith assistance from Ohio governor James A. Rhodes, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city. The new facility had to be ready by the opening of the [[1970 NFL season]] and was officially named [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|Riverfront Stadium]]. With the completion of the merger in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that voluntarily moved to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and placed in the [[AFC Central]], the same division as the Bengals. An instant [[Battle of Ohio (NFL)|rivalry was born]], fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.\n\nFor their first two seasons, the Bengals played at [[Nippert Stadium]] which is the current home of the [[University of Cincinnati]] [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Bearcats]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6JQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u1wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4236,1676508&dq=nippert+stadium+cincinnati+bengals&hl=en|title=Hot Football Time in Old Cincy Tonight|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|agency=Associated Press|date=August 3, 1968|page=2C|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> The team held training camp at [[Wilmington College (Ohio)|Wilmington College]] in [[Wilmington, Ohio|Wilmington]], through the 1968 preseason.

The team appeared in the playoffs in [[1990 NFL season|1990]], making it to the second round  before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders. Before the [[1991 NFL Season|following season]] got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82. He had already transferred control to his son, [[Mike Brown (football team owner)|Mike Brown]], but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.  The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. They began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in history, 2\u201314, which led to the hiring of [[Marvin Lewis]] as head coach in 2003. [[Carson Palmer]], the future star quarterback, was drafted in [[2003 NFL Draft|2003]], but did not play a snap that whole season, as [[Jon Kitna]] had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year). Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the [[2004 NFL season|following season]]. Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 in the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.\n\nThe Bengals returned to the playoffs again in [[2009 NFL season|2009]] in a season that included the franchise's first ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals (the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens) had both made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/sports/football/17lewis.html|title=Bengals\u2019 Lewis Is N.F.L.

When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.  He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the [[Oakland Raiders]].  In the [[2011 NFL draft]], the Bengals selected wide receiver [[A. J. Green|AJ Green]] in the first round, and quarterback [[Andy Dalton]] in the second round.  The Bengals improved to 9\u20137 in the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]], and clinched a playoff spot. Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards.  However, they lost to the [[Houston Texans]] 31\u201310 in the Wild Card Round. In the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]], the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982. However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19\u201313.\n\nIn the [[2013 NFL season|2013 season]], for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11\u20135 record. But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the [[San Diego Chargers]], 27\u201310. Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw 2 interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0\u20135 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]] started well with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their week 5 matchup at the New England Patriots, 43\u201317. An overtime tie to the [[Carolina Panthers]] and shutout loss to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10\u20135\u20131 as the 5th seed, they lost to the Colts, 26\u201310, in the first round of the playoffs. This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons.\n\nIn 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8\u20130 start with a 31\u201310 win over the [[Cleveland Browns]], but they then lost multiple consequtive games yet clinched a playoff berth.  However, they lost to the division rival [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], 18\u201316, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening round playoff games. This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals. The Bengals finished the 2016 campaign with a 6\u20139\u20131 record, losing several key players to injury including AJ Green, [[Giovani Bernard]], and [[Jeremy Hill]]. They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27\u201327 tie against the [[Washington Redskins]] which was played in [[London]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://pro32.ap.org/article/redskins-bengals-battle-27-27-tie-london|title=Redskins, Bengals battle to 27-27 tie in London|date=October 30, 2016|work=Pro32: Head to Head|access-date=March 15, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017.

On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25653722/bengals-fire-coach-marvin-lewis-6-10-season |title=Marvin Lewis out as coach of Bengals after long run |last=Terrell |first=Katherine |publisher=ESPN |date=December 31, 2018 |access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith Zac Taylor assuming the head coaching mantle, the 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, barely losing to Seattle 21-20 in CenturyLink Field, but what started with promise, ended in disaster. The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0-11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win against the Jets 22-6 in Cincinnati. They eventually lost to the Patriots and lost to the Dolphins 38-35 in OT after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the #1 Overall Pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. They'd cap off the season with a win against the underperforming Cleveland Browns, finishing 2-14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\nWhen the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the [[Cleveland Browns]]. When Paul Brown was fired by [[Art Modell]], Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland so, after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest.\n\nThe Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called ''TV numbers'') until the 1980 season, when they appeared on the sleeves; they were the only NFL team that did not have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet facemask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced. Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today.\n\nIn 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the ''TV numbers'' moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.<ref>{{cite web|title=2004-Present: The New Stripes|url=http://www.bengals.com/team/history/uniforms-2004.html|publisher=Cincinnati Bengals|accessdate=September 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813104026/http://www.bengals.com/team/history/uniforms-2004.html|archive-date=August 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bengals Logos - Then & Now|url=http://www.bengals.com/team/history/bengals-logos.html|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Bengals.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127142856/http://www.bengals.com/team/history/bengals-logos.html|archive-date=November 27, 2009|access-date=September 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions such as the 1970 season when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season, and most of the 1971 season. Since 2005, the Bengals wear white for September home games where the heat could become a factor.\n\n==Mascots==\nThe team's official mascot is a [[Bengal tiger]] named Who Dey.<ref name=\"WhoDey\" /> Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the [[Cincinnati Ben\u2013Gals]], the team's [[NFL Cheerleading|cheerleading squad]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bengals.com/cheerleaders/index.html|title=Ben-Gals Cheerleaders Home|publisher=Bengals.com|accessdate=August 15, 2012}}</ref> which included [[Laura Vikmanis]], the oldest cheerleader in league history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1349473/Laura-Vikmanis-42-NFLs-oldest-cheerleader-Can-younger-girls.html|title=Laura Vikmanis, 42, is NFL's oldest cheerleader: Can she keep up with younger girls?|publisher=Dailymail.co.uk|date=January 22, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Contributions to NFL culture==\n\n===No-huddle offense===\nA [[no-huddle offense]] was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, [[Sam Wyche]], the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator [[Bruce Coslet]], made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play\u2014often within 5\u201310 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds\u2014the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactical purpose, and resting. In response the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made.\nThe hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the [[Buffalo Bills]], coached by [[Marv Levy]], who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season.  The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game.  The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.  Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized.  Levy did not have his players fake injuries in the game, but installed his version the next year, 1989.  The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.  Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules.  Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time.  This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect.\n\n===West Coast offense===\nThe [[West Coast offense]] is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback [[Virgil Carter]] was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971. [[Ken Anderson (quarterback)|Ken Anderson]] replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player [[O.J. Simpson]]. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack. The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the [[Steel Curtain]], defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end [[Bob Trumpy]], would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses, making him, to date, the Bengals' only winning quarterback.\n\n===Zone blitz===\nThe defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals [[defensive coordinator]] [[Dick LeBeau]] (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000\u20132002) created the [[zone blitz]] in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.\n\n==Season-by-season records==\n{{main|List of Cincinnati Bengals seasons}}\n\n==Players of note==\n{{Category see also|Cincinnati Bengals players}}\n\n===Current roster===\n{{Cincinnati Bengals roster}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"| '''Cincinnati Bengals retired numbers'''\n|-\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|No.\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Player\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Position\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Seasons\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Retired\n|-\n| '''54''' || [[Bob Johnson (American football)|Bob Johnson]] || [[Center (American football)|C]] || 1968\u201379 || December 17, 1978\n|}\n\n===Pro Football Hall of Fame members===\nThree members of the Hall of Fame have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only [[Anthony Mu\u00f1oz]] spent his entire career with the Bengals.

The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\" The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's [[mascot]], a [[Bengal tiger]].<ref name=\"WhoDey\" />\n\nThe Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the [[1980 Cincinnati Bengals season|1980 Cincinnati Bengals]]. While the origins of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/who-dey-vs-who-dat/ | title=Who Dey vs. Who Dat | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 14, 2006 | accessdate=June 15, 2011 | author=Monkovic, Toni}}</ref>\n\nThe Who Dey chant is also steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of [[Hudepohl Brewing Company]] through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Berger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.<ref>This is an eye witness account from a Cincinnati Bengals season ticket holder.  This family held season tickets for the Bengals from their inaugural season in 1968 through the 2000 season when the Bengals moved to Paul Brown Stadium.</ref>\n\nThe chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"[[Who Dat?]]\", which was officially adopted by the [[New Orleans Saints]] in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in [[minstrel shows]] and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by [[Dixieland|New Orleans Jazz]] and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local [[Louisiana]] High Schools, [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] and [[Patterson High School (Louisiana)|Patterson High School]] reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of [[Alcorn State University]] and [[Louisiana State University]] picked up the cheer in the 1970s. [[Southern University]] in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/features/80308957.html |title=Where dat from? |website=2theadvocate.com |date=December 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127191420/http://www.2theadvocate.com/features/80308957.html |archive-date=January 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 23, 2015 |last=Morris |first=George}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.nfl.com/teams/cincinnatibengals/profile?team=CIN Cincinnati Bengals] at the [[National Football League]] official website\n\n{{Cincinnati Bengals}}\n{{Navboxes\n|titlestyle = {{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals|border=2}}\n|list =\n{{NFL}}\n{{American Football League navbox}}\n{{Ohio Sports}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|American football|Ohio}}\n\n[[Category:Cincinnati Bengals| ]]\n[[Category:National Football League teams]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:American football teams established in 1968]]\n[[Category:American Football League teams]]\n[[Category:Sports teams in Ohio]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the current Cincinnati Bengals team|the team that existed between 1937\u20131941|Cincinnati Bengals (1937\u201341)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\n{{short description|National Football League franchise in Cincinnati, Ohio}}\n{{Infobox NFL team\n| name = Cincinnati Bengals\n| current = 2019 Cincinnati Bengals season\n| logo = Cincinnati Bengals logo.svg\n| wordmark = Cincinnati Bengals wordmark.svg\n| founded = {{Start date and years ago|May 23, 1967}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Cincinnati Bengals Team Facts|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/teams/cincinnati-bengals/team-facts/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ProFootballHOF.com|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref>\n| first_season = [[1968 Cincinnati Bengals season|1968]]\n| city = and '''headquartered''' in [[Paul Brown Stadium]]<br />[[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]\n| uniform = File:AFCN-Uniform-CIN.PNG\n| colors = Black, orange, white<ref>{{cite news|last=LaPlaca|first=Michael|title=Bengals 2019 Uniform Schedule; Color Rush Dates Revealed|url=https://www.bengals.com/news/bengals-2019-uniform-schedule-color-rush-dates-revealed|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Bengals.com|date=September 2, 2019|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cincinnati Bengals Team Capsule|url=http://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2018/08/09/0ap3000000946101.pdf#page=52|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=2018 Official National Football League Record and Fact Book|date=August 9, 2018|access-date=September 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><br />{{color box|#000000}} {{color box|#FB4F14}} {{color box|#FFFFFF}}\n| song = Bengals Growl\n| mascot = Bengal tiger (Who Dey)<ref name=\"WhoDey\">{{cite web|title=Who Dey Appearance Request|url=https://www.bengals.com/fans/whodeyappearance|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Bengals.com|access-date=July 5, 2019}}</ref>\n| owner = [[Mike Brown (American football executive)|Mike Brown]]\n| president = Mike Brown\n| general manager = Mike Brown\n| coach = [[Zac Taylor]]\n| hist_yr = 1968\n| affiliate_old =\n[[American Football League]] (1968\u20131969)\n* [[AFL West]] (1968\u20131969)\n| NFL_start_yr = 1970\n| division_hist =\n* '''[[American Football Conference]] (1970\u2013present)'''\n** [[AFC Central]] (1970\u20132001)\n** '''[[AFC North]] (2002\u2013present)'''\n| no_conf_champs = 2\n| no_div_champs = 9\n| conf_champs =\n* '''AFC:''' [[1981 NFL season|1981]], [[1988 NFL season|1988]]\n| div_champs =\n* '''AFC Central:''' [[1970 NFL season|1970]], [[1973 NFL season|1973]], [[1981 NFL season|1981]], [[1988 NFL season|1988]], [[1990 NFL season|1990]]\n* '''AFC North:''' [[2005 NFL season|2005]], [[2009 NFL season|2009]], [[2013 NFL season|2013]], [[2015 NFL season|2015]]\n| playoff_appearances =\n* '''NFL:''' [[1970\u201371 NFL playoffs|1970]], [[1973\u201374 NFL playoffs|1973]], [[1975\u201376 NFL playoffs|1975]], [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs|1981]], [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982]], [[1988\u201389 NFL playoffs|1988]], [[1990\u201391 NFL playoffs|1990]], [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs|2005]], [[2009\u201310 NFL playoffs|2009]], [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011]], [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs|2012]], [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs|2013]], [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|2014]], [[2015\u201316 NFL playoffs|2015]]\n| no_playoff_appearances = 14\n| stadium_years =\n* [[Nippert Stadium]] (1968\u20131969)\n* [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|Riverfront Stadium]] (1970\u20131999)\n* '''[[Paul Brown Stadium]] (2000\u2013present)'''\n}}\n\nThe '''Cincinnati Bengals''' are a professional [[American football]] franchise based in [[Cincinnati]]. The Bengals compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC North|North]] division. Their home stadium is [[Paul Brown Stadium]], located in [[downtown Cincinnati]]. Their divisional opponents are the [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].\n\nThe Bengals were founded in {{nfly|1966}} as a member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) by former Cleveland Browns head coach [[Paul Brown]], and began play in the 1968 season. Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to {{nfly|1975}}. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by [[Art Modell]] (who had purchased majority interest in the team in {{nfly|1961}}) in January {{nfly|1963}}, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]], and [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]] (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete [[Crosley Field]]) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|a multipurpose stadium]] which could host both baseball and football games.\n\nDue to the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|impending merger]] of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the {{nfly|1970}} season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities ([[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Lexington, Kentucky]]; [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], and [[Springfield, Ohio]]) that are all no more than {{convert|110|mi}} away from downtown Cincinnati, along with [[Indianapolis]], until the [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|Baltimore Colts relocated]] there prior to the [[1984 NFL season]].\n\nThe Bengals won the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC championship]] in {{nfly|1981}} and {{nfly|1988}}, but lost [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]] and [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] to the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, [[Mike Brown (American football executive)|Mike Brown]]. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder [[Austin Knowlton]] and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.<ref>{{cite news|last=Katzowitz|first=Josh|title=Mike Brown Now Owns Most of Bengals Franchise|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22475988/34008660|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|website=CBSSports.com|date=December 23, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s and the 2000s were a period of great struggle. Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without posting a winning record, nor qualifying to play in the [[NFL playoffs]]. The Bengals had several head coaches and several of their top [[NFL Draft|draft]] picks did not pan out. Mike Brown, the team's ''de facto'' general manager,<ref>{{cite news|title=HBO Shows Bengals Behind the Scenes|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp09/news/story?id=4412908|publisher=[[ESPN]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=August 20, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 16 Worst Owners in Sports: Mike Brown \u2013 Cincinnati Bengals|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/worst-owners-in-sports-2011-5#mike-brown--cincinnati-bengals-13|website=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-2000s, the team's fortunes have improved. Two years after becoming head coach, [[Marvin Lewis]] guided the Bengals to their first winning season and first division title in over a decade. After the acquisition of [[Andy Dalton]] as quarterback in 2011, the Bengals had made the playoffs each season until 2016, ranking highly among NFL teams in win totals.<ref>{{cite news|last=Owczarski|first=Jim|title=Polian: Questioning Bengals success 'absurd'|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2015/05/17/bengals-bill-polian/27479191/|newspaper=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=May 17, 2015|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}</ref> The Bengals drafts are also highly touted, leading to a consistency that had long escaped the franchise.

Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Team Chronology|url=http://prod.static.bengals.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/2017/17-history.pdf#page=2|publisher=Cincinnati Bengals|date=June 26, 2017|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}</ref> Another [[Cincinnati Bengals (1937\u201341)|Cincinnati Bengals]] team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues<ref>[[American Football League (1936)|AFL II]] 1937, [[American Football League (1938)|AFL/APFA]] 1939, [[American Football League (1940)|AFL III]] 1940\u20131941</ref> from [[1937 American Football League season|1937]] to 1942. The city's world-renowned [[Cincinnati Zoo|zoo]] was also home to a rare white [[Bengal tiger]]. However, possibly as an insult to [[Art Modell]], or possibly as a homage to his own start as a head coach to the [[Massillon Washington High School|Massillon Tigers]], Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 and which is still in use; however, that design featured yellow stripes on a turquoise helmet{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which were more uniform in width. The Bengals would begin play in the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]].\n\nIn 1966, the American Football League agreed to [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|a merger]] with its older and more established rival, the [[National Football League]]. Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise. One of the reasons the NFL agreed to this was that they wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added that brought the combined total number clubs in the merged league to twenty-six teams. The NFL was content for that team to be in the American Football League because it meant that the existing nine AFL clubs were the ones that had to provide players in the ensuing [[expansion draft]] and the NFL owners preferred for the ensuing dilution of talent to occur in what they had always considered to be an inferior league.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million\u2013400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.\n\nPrior to the merger being announced, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League, and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/PaulBrown.htm|title=Paul Brown|publisher=Conigliofamily.com|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref> However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term. He ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL when after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970.\n\nThere was also a complication: [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]] were in need of a facility to replace the antiquated, obsolete [[Crosley Field]], which they had used since 1912. Parking nightmares had plagued the city as far back as the 1950s, the little park lacked modern amenities, and New York City, which in 1957 had lost both its [[National League]] teams (the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]) to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, was actively courting Reds owner [[Powel Crosley]]. However, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated worsening problems with the Crosley Field location, which were exacerbated by the [[Mill Creek Expressway]] ([[I-75]]) project that ran alongside the park.\n[[File:Cincinnati-paul-brown-stadium2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Paul Brown Stadium]], home of the Bengals.]]\nWith assistance from Ohio governor James A. Rhodes, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city. The new facility had to be ready by the opening of the [[1970 NFL season]] and was officially named [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|Riverfront Stadium]]. With the completion of the merger in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that voluntarily moved to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and placed in the [[AFC Central]], the same division as the Bengals.

One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players with above-average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver [[Pat McInally]] attended [[Harvard University]] and linebacker Reggie Williams attended [[Dartmouth College]] and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly articulate and went on to have successful careers in [[Play-by-play|commentary]] and [[broadcasting]] as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Verderame|first1=Matt|title=Paul Brown and his Lasting Influence on the NFL|url=http://fansided.com/2016/09/06/paul-brown-nfl-browns-bengals-innovations/|website=Fansided|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] until the team moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]].

In [[1975 NFL season|1975]], the [[1975 Cincinnati Bengals season|team]] posted an 11\u20133 record, giving them what is to this day the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history.

The team appeared in the playoffs in [[1990 NFL season|1990]], making it to the second round  before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders. Before the [[1991 NFL Season|following season]] got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82. He had already transferred control to his son, [[Mike Brown (football team owner)|Mike Brown]], but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.  The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. They began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in history, 2\u201314, which led to the hiring of [[Marvin Lewis]] as head coach in 2003. [[Carson Palmer]], the future star quarterback, was drafted in [[2003 NFL Draft|2003]], but did not play a snap that whole season, as [[Jon Kitna]] had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year). Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the [[2004 NFL season|following season]]. Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 in the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.\n\nThe Bengals returned to the playoffs again in [[2009 NFL season|2009]] in a season that included the franchise's first ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals (the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens) had both made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/sports/football/17lewis.html|title=Bengals\u2019 Lewis Is N.F.L.

When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.  He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the [[Oakland Raiders]].  In the [[2011 NFL draft]], the Bengals selected wide receiver [[A. J. Green|AJ Green]] in the first round, and quarterback [[Andy Dalton]] in the second round.  The Bengals improved to 9\u20137 in the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]], and clinched a playoff spot. Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards.  However, they lost to the [[Houston Texans]] 31\u201310 in the Wild Card Round. In the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]], the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982. However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19\u201313.\n\nIn the [[2013 NFL season|2013 season]], for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11\u20135 record. But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the [[San Diego Chargers]], 27\u201310. Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw 2 interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0\u20135 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]] started well with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their week 5 matchup at the New England Patriots, 43\u201317. An overtime tie to the [[Carolina Panthers]] and shutout loss to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10\u20135\u20131 as the 5th seed, they lost to the Colts, 26\u201310, in the first round of the playoffs. This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons.\n\nIn 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8\u20130 start with a 31\u201310 win over the [[Cleveland Browns]], but they then lost multiple consequtive games yet clinched a playoff berth.  However, they lost to the division rival [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], 18\u201316, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening round playoff games. This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals. The Bengals finished the 2016 campaign with a 6\u20139\u20131 record, losing several key players to injury including AJ Green, [[Giovani Bernard]], and [[Jeremy Hill]]. They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27\u201327 tie against the [[Washington Redskins]] which was played in [[London]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://pro32.ap.org/article/redskins-bengals-battle-27-27-tie-london|title=Redskins, Bengals battle to 27-27 tie in London|date=October 30, 2016|work=Pro32: Head to Head|access-date=March 15, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0\u20133, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5\u20139. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens, that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7\u20139.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/2017.htm |title=2017 Cincinnati Bengals Statistics & Players |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref> The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/bengals-sign-marvin-lewis-year-deal-2019/story?id=52103182 |title=Bengals sign Marvin Lewis to two-year deal through 2019 |date=January 2, 2018 |work=ABC News |access-date=July 17, 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4-1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and the Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start.

The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6-10 and last place in the AFC North. On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25653722/bengals-fire-coach-marvin-lewis-6-10-season |title=Marvin Lewis out as coach of Bengals after long run |last=Terrell |first=Katherine |publisher=ESPN |date=December 31, 2018 |access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith Zac Taylor assuming the head coaching mantle, the 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, barely losing to Seattle 21-20 in CenturyLink Field, but what started with promise, ended in disaster. The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0-11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win against the Jets 22-6 in Cincinnati. They eventually lost to the Patriots and lost to the Dolphins 38-35 in OT after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the #1 Overall Pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. They'd cap off the season with a win against the underperforming Cleveland Browns, finishing 2-14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\nWhen the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the [[Cleveland Browns]]. When Paul Brown was fired by [[Art Modell]], Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland so, after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest.\n\nThe Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called ''TV numbers'') until the 1980 season, when they appeared on the sleeves; they were the only NFL team that did not have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet facemask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced. Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today.\n\nIn 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the ''TV numbers'' moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.<ref>{{cite web|title=2004-Present: The New Stripes|url=http://www.bengals.com/team/history/uniforms-2004.html|publisher=Cincinnati Bengals|accessdate=September 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813104026/http://www.bengals.com/team/history/uniforms-2004.html|archive-date=August 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bengals Logos - Then & Now|url=http://www.bengals.com/team/history/bengals-logos.html|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Bengals.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127142856/http://www.bengals.com/team/history/bengals-logos.html|archive-date=November 27, 2009|access-date=September 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions such as the 1970 season when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season, and most of the 1971 season. Since 2005, the Bengals wear white for September home games where the heat could become a factor.\n\n==Mascots==\nThe team's official mascot is a [[Bengal tiger]] named Who Dey.<ref name=\"WhoDey\" /> Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the [[Cincinnati Ben\u2013Gals]], the team's [[NFL Cheerleading|cheerleading squad]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bengals.com/cheerleaders/index.html|title=Ben-Gals Cheerleaders Home|publisher=Bengals.com|accessdate=August 15, 2012}}</ref> which included [[Laura Vikmanis]], the oldest cheerleader in league history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1349473/Laura-Vikmanis-42-NFLs-oldest-cheerleader-Can-younger-girls.html|title=Laura Vikmanis, 42, is NFL's oldest cheerleader: Can she keep up with younger girls?|publisher=Dailymail.co.uk|date=January 22, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Contributions to NFL culture==\n\n===No-huddle offense===\nA [[no-huddle offense]] was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, [[Sam Wyche]], the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator [[Bruce Coslet]], made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play\u2014often within 5\u201310 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds\u2014the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactical purpose, and resting. In response the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made.\nThe hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the [[Buffalo Bills]], coached by [[Marv Levy]], who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season.  The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game.  The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.  Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized.  Levy did not have his players fake injuries in the game, but installed his version the next year, 1989.  The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.  Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules.  Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time.  This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect.\n\n===West Coast offense===\nThe [[West Coast offense]] is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback [[Virgil Carter]] was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971. [[Ken Anderson (quarterback)|Ken Anderson]] replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player [[O.J. Simpson]]. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack. The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the [[Steel Curtain]], defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end [[Bob Trumpy]], would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses, making him, to date, the Bengals' only winning quarterback.\n\n===Zone blitz===\nThe defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals [[defensive coordinator]] [[Dick LeBeau]] (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000\u20132002) created the [[zone blitz]] in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.\n\n==Season-by-season records==\n{{main|List of Cincinnati Bengals seasons}}\n\n==Players of note==\n{{Category see also|Cincinnati Bengals players}}\n\n===Current roster===\n{{Cincinnati Bengals roster}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"| '''Cincinnati Bengals retired numbers'''\n|-\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|No.\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Player\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Position\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Seasons\n!  style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals}};\"|Retired\n|-\n| '''54''' || [[Bob Johnson (American football)|Bob Johnson]] || [[Center (American football)|C]] || 1968\u201379 || December 17, 1978\n|}\n\n===Pro Football Hall of Fame members===\nThree members of the Hall of Fame have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only [[Anthony Mu\u00f1oz]] spent his entire career with the Bengals.

The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\" The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's [[mascot]], a [[Bengal tiger]].<ref name=\"WhoDey\" />\n\nThe Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the [[1980 Cincinnati Bengals season|1980 Cincinnati Bengals]]. While the origins of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/who-dey-vs-who-dat/ | title=Who Dey vs. Who Dat | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 14, 2006 | accessdate=June 15, 2011 | author=Monkovic, Toni}}</ref>\n\nThe Who Dey chant is also steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of [[Hudepohl Brewing Company]] through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Berger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.<ref>This is an eye witness account from a Cincinnati Bengals season ticket holder.  This family held season tickets for the Bengals from their inaugural season in 1968 through the 2000 season when the Bengals moved to Paul Brown Stadium.</ref>\n\nThe chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"[[Who Dat?]]\", which was officially adopted by the [[New Orleans Saints]] in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in [[minstrel shows]] and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by [[Dixieland|New Orleans Jazz]] and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local [[Louisiana]] High Schools, [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] and [[Patterson High School (Louisiana)|Patterson High School]] reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of [[Alcorn State University]] and [[Louisiana State University]] picked up the cheer in the 1970s. [[Southern University]] in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/features/80308957.html |title=Where dat from? |website=2theadvocate.com |date=December 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127191420/http://www.2theadvocate.com/features/80308957.html |archive-date=January 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 23, 2015 |last=Morris |first=George}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.nfl.com/teams/cincinnatibengals/profile?team=CIN Cincinnati Bengals] at the [[National Football League]] official website\n\n{{Cincinnati Bengals}}\n{{Navboxes\n|titlestyle = {{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cincinnati Bengals|border=2}}\n|list =\n{{NFL}}\n{{American Football League navbox}}\n{{Ohio Sports}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|American football|Ohio}}\n\n[[Category:Cincinnati Bengals| ]]\n[[Category:National Football League teams]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:American football teams established in 1968]]\n[[Category:American Football League teams]]\n[[Category:Sports teams in Ohio]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1006:b019:1f7b:cc62:9842:c3e:3bb8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals"}

(Scrubs)}}\n[[Zach Braff]] portrays Dr. [[John Michael \"J.D.\" Dorian]], the show's original [[protagonist]] and narrator. J.D. begins the series as a staff [[Internship (medicine)#United States|intern]], progressing to [[Medical residency#United States|resident]] and then [[attending physician]]. His [[voice-over]] to the series comes from his internal thoughts and often features [[Surreal humor|surreal]] [[fantasy|fantasies]]. J.D. was a [[recurring character]] in Season 9, though he was still considered to be the protagonist of the episodes in which he appeared. Braff received top billing as a main cast member in each of his appearances for that season. He did not appear in the last episode of the series, titled \"Our Thanks\", and no mention was made of him.\n\nJ.D.'s name is based on that of Dr. Jonathan Doris, a college friend of series creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]]. Doris served as medical adviser to the show. \n\n===Christopher Duncan Turk===\n{{Main|Christopher Turk}}\n[[Donald Faison]] portrays [[Christopher Duncan Turk]], J.D.'s best friend, a surgical attending physician and later chief of surgery. Turk roomed with J.D. in college and medical school, and the two have an extremely close relationship, described in the Season 6 episode \"My Musical\" as \"guy love\". He is married to [[Carla Espinosa]]. J.D. claims that Turk got his middle name from his father's [[Dunkin' Donuts|love of donuts]].\n\nTurk and J.D. both attended [[The College of William and Mary]], ''Scrubs'' creator Bill Lawrence's alma mater.<ref name=\"My Perspective\">{{cite episode | title = My Perspective | episodelink = My Perspective | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = 2007-02-15 | season  = 6  | number = 09 }}</ref> They share a goofy sense of humor.

J.D. was Turk's best man<ref name=\"My Best Friend's Wedding\">{{cite episode | title = My Best Friend's Wedding | episodelink = My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs) | series = Scrubs | network = NBC  | airdate = 2004-05-04| season  = 3  | number = 22 }}</ref> and is the godfather of Carla's and his child, Izzy.\n\nDonald Faison was the only original cast member, besides [[John C. McGinley]], to return for Season 9 as a regular cast member.\n\nTurk's name is based on that of real-life physician Jon Turk, a medical consultant for ''Scrubs''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonturkmd.com/html/nb-article.html |title=Jon Turk, M.D |publisher=Jon Turk, M.D. |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\n===Perry Ulysses Cox===\n{{Main|Perry Cox}}\n[[John C. McGinley]] portrays Percival \"Perry\" Ulysses Cox, a senior attending physician at Sacred Heart, the hospital's residency director, and eventually chief of medicine in Season 8 (\"[[Scrubs (season 8)#Episodes|My Cookie Pants]]\"). J.D. considers Cox his mentor despite the fact that Cox routinely criticizes and belittles him. Cox frequently suggests that this harsh treatment is intended as conditioning for the rigors of hospital life.\n\nDr. Cox is sarcastic and bitter, with a quick, cruel wit, normally expressed through frequent and sometimes incredibly long rants in which he viciously attacks almost every character on the show. He is athletic, often found playing [[basketball]] in the hospital's parking lot with younger employees. In \"[[My Friend the Doctor]]\", he shows off by [[slam dunk|slam-dunking]] a basketball, but injures his back when he lands, a reminder that he is middle-aged. Out of vanity, he tries to disguise his injury. His parents were an absent or abusive mother and an alcoholic, abusive father, which may have sculpted his personality and poor social skills.\n\nMcGinley says in the Season 1 [[DVD]] bonus features that Dr. Cox's habit of touching his nose is a homage to [[Paul Newman]]'s character in ''[[The Sting]]'', although Cox also uses it as a sign of irritation on occasion, rather than just a sign that \"it's going to be OK\", as it was used in the film. Dr. Cox has also been compared to [[Gregory House]] (although Cox's character was created several years before House's) by Dr. Kelso, who says, \"Oh Perry, you are so edgy and cantankerous, like House without the limp.\" This is further explored in \"My House\", during which Cox acquires a temporary limp. At the end of the episode, through a series of circumstances, Dr. Cox walks into a room where the other characters are sitting and, in a very House-esque way, gives them the answers to everything they have been trying to figure out in the episode.\n\n===Elliot Reid===\n{{Main|Elliot Reid}}\n[[Sarah Chalke]] portrays [[Elliot Reid]], another intern and later private-practice physician. Her relationship with J.D. becomes romantic on several occasions, and at the start of Season 9, she is married to J.D. and seven months pregnant. Elliot is driven by a neurotic desire to prove her abilities to her family (in which all of the men are doctors), her peers, and herself. Being the byproduct of a wealthy family, Elliot was largely unprepared for the \"real world\" hostilities and socioeconomic differences among the hospital staff. Elliot has an estranged relationship with both of her parents, particularly her mother who often belittles and demeans her. Elliot has a habit of speaking in a high pitched voice when she becomes irritated or feels ignored. \n\nAt Sacred Heart, Elliot begins as an intern and later becomes a resident after a grueling yearlong internship. She serves as co-chief resident with J.D. during Season 4. At the end of that season, she briefly leaves to take an [[endocrinology]] fellowship, which ends five days later after her research partner finds the cure to [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], the disease they are researching.<ref name=\"My Rite of Passage\">{{cite episode | title = My Rite of Passage | episodelink = My Rite of Passage | series = Scrubs |network = NBC | airdate = 2006-01-03 | season = 5 | number = 2 }}</ref> After a brief spell at a [[free clinic]], she returns to Sacred Heart and becomes a senior attending physician. At the end of the episode \"[[My Coffee]]\", she accepts an offer to go into private practice, allowing her to receive double the pay, still work at Sacred Heart, and never have to deal with superiors Dr. Cox (McGinley) or Dr. Kelso (Ken Jenkins) again. In \"[[My Full Moon]]\", she ponders her future career after struggling to deliver the bad news to a patient diagnosed with [[H.I.V.]] She tells Turk that if she were lucky enough to get married and have enough money to stop working, she would \"walk out of this place and never look back\".\n\n===Carla Espinosa===\n{{Main|Carla Espinosa}}\n[[Judy Reyes]] portrays Carla Espinosa, the hospital's head nurse, who acts as a mother figure to the interns, often hiding their mistakes from their attending doctor. During the course of the series, Turk forms a relationship with Carla; eventually, they marry and start a family together. Carla does not appear in Season 9 but is mentioned a few times by Turk.\n\nCarla starts dating Turk (Faison) in the show's second episode, \"[[My Mentor]]\".  They remain together for almost the entire run of the show. Carla marries Turk in the finale of Season 3, \"[[My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs)|My Best Friend's Wedding]]\". She and Turk go through a trial separation in Season 4 after Carla discovers that Turk is still talking to his ex-girlfriend without telling her he is married, a separation that is prolonged after Carla and J.D. kiss. After couples' therapy and some frank discussions with each other and J.D., Turk and Carla reunite and immediately begin trying to conceive. Initially, they are unsuccessful, but Carla finally gets [[pregnant]] toward the end of the season after several episodes in which she and Turk worry about their respective fertility. Carla gives birth to a baby girl, whom they name Isabella, in the episode \"[[My Best Friend's Baby's Baby and My Baby's Baby]]\". J.D. becomes the godfather of the child. In \"[[My House (Scrubs)|My House]]\", she is revealed to suffer from [[postpartum depression]]. She spends most of the [[My Friend with Money|following episode]] in [[denial]] about the condition, but finally gets help after a frank discussion with Jordan Sullivan, who also suffered from the condition.\n\n===Robert Kelso===\n{{Main|Bob Kelso}}\n[[Ken Jenkins]] portrays Robert \"Bob\" Kelso, Sacred Heart's chief of medicine for most of the series. Kelso is portrayed as cold, heartless, and cruel, driven primarily by the hospital's bottom line rather than the well-being of patients. However, he is occasionally suggested to have a softer side, with his cruelty being a means of coping with years of hard decisions. Other characters have noted that he is burdened by the job. He retires in Season 7, after which his relationship with staff at the hospital improves. Toward the end of Season 8, he realizes he misses being a doctor. In Season 9, he returns to Sacred Heart as a professor.\n\nThroughout the series, he is at odds with Dr. Cox, Sacred Heart's chief attending physician, who eventually replaces him as chief of medicine. Cox calls him \"Bobbo\" or similar variations, often refers to him as a \"pod person\" or \"[[Satan|the Devil]] himself\", and even punches him in the episode \"[[My Dream Job]]\". The two occasionally share moments of understanding and compassion, however, such as when Kelso tells a [[clinical depression|depressed]] Cox that the hospital and Kelso himself need him, as they balance each other out to do what is best for the hospital. After his retirement, Kelso becomes more openly friendly with Dr Cox.\n\n===Janitor===\n{{Main|Janitor (Scrubs)}}\n[[Neil Flynn]] portrays the hospital's custodian known as \"Janitor\" through most of the series. In the last episode of Season 8, he reveals his name to J.D. as \"Glenn Matthews\", though he is referred to immediately afterward by a passerby as something else,<!-- since nobody can agree what was actually said, please do not restore a specific name --> leaving his true name ambiguous. As part of the bonus features of the complete series DVD release, Bill Lawrence confirmed that Glenn Matthews is the character's name. An incident in the pilot episode establishes an adversarial relationship between J.D. and him, which persists throughout the series. This tends to take the form of the Janitor pulling mean-spirited pranks on J.D., although he gives J.D. a pass after his father dies. The Janitor was the main antagonist of the series.\n\nIn the Season 9 premiere, Turk tells J.D. that the day after he left Sacred Heart, the Janitor asked when J.D. was returning, either oblivious to, or in denial of, J.D.'s departure, and upon coming to the realization that J.D. no longer worked at Sacred Heart, promptly walked off the job and quit. He was not seen for the remainder of the season due to Neil Flynn leaving the show to go work on his own show ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''.\n\nFlynn is an [[improvisational comedy|improv]] comedian and, as such, [[Ad libitum|ad-libs]] many of his lines. Flynn originally auditioned for the role of Dr. Cox. However, Lawrence asked Flynn if he would consider another part\u2014the mysterious custodian who makes tormenting J.D. his life's work.\n\nWhile the Janitor was intended as a running gag for only the pilot episode, series creator Lawrence stated, \"When we watched the pilot, we knew instantly we had to keep this guy around.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/about/scouts-neil-flynn.shtml |title=Last Comic Standing \u2013 About the Show \u2013 Neil Flynn: Scrubs Talent Scout, Houston |publisher=NBCUniversal Media LLC |accessdate=2013-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103053950/http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/about/scouts-neil-flynn.shtml |archivedate=2012-11-03 }}</ref>\n\n===Denise Mahoney===\n[[Eliza Coupe]] portrayed Denise \"Jo\" Mahoney, one of several new interns in [[Scrubs (season 8)|Season 8]]. Denise was extremely blunt and opinionated. She had never been able to connect strongly to her emotions, even when she was with her family. She became J.D.'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and took steps to empathize with patients.\n\nJ.D. nicknamed her Jo in \"[[My Jerks]]\", because she reminded him of \"that streetwise mannish girl\" on ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''.<ref name=\"My Jerks\">{{cite episode|title=[[My Jerks]]|series=Scrubs|credits= |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|station=ABC |airdate=January 6, 2009 |season=8 |seriesno= |number=1 |minutes= }}</ref> She was tough, insensitive, and contemptuous of any show of vulnerability or emotion.\n\nDenise said she got into medicine because she was fascinated by the \"nuts and bolts of it all\".<ref name=\"My Cookie Pants\">{{cite episode|title=[[My Cookie Pants]]|series=Scrubs|credits= |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|station=ABC |airdate=January 27, 2009 |season=8 |seriesno= |number=6 |minutes= }}</ref> She was extremely dedicated as a doctor, so much so that she spent too much time in the hospital.

In \"[[Our Role Models]]\", she said she had never known her mother.\n\n===Lucy Bennett===\n[[Kerry Bish\u00e9]] portrays Lucy Bennett, a medical student at Winston University. She serves as the new narrator for Season 9, showing a penchant for fantastical fantasies, much like J.D., while having self-esteem issues and several personality \"quirks\", similar to Elliot. She loves horses and believes \"if they could talk, they would be wise\".\n\nLucy is at first overwhelmed by life in a hospital, especially when both her chief professor, Dr. Cox, and her student advisor, [[Denise Mahoney]] ([[Eliza Coupe]]), take an immediate dislike to her. Seeking a respite, she sleeps with her classmate Cole Aaronson ([[Dave Franco]]), an arrogant rich kid who takes a naked picture of her without her knowledge and then humiliates her by letting it fall out of his backpack and into the wrong hands. At the end of the episode, she befriends J.D., who is temporarily teaching at the university; he takes her under his wing and encourages her to stand up to Dr. Cox.\n\nShe continues an affair with Cole, who she says \"[kills] her soul as he climbs into bed\" with her. Later on, she starts to accept Cole and admits to her class that she loves him. Throughout the series, she often goes out of her way to seek acceptance, baking cupcakes, sharing class notes, and trying to bond with fellow students.   When Cole wants to become a surgeon, he tears up 17 of Lucy's cuddly horses and tries to re-assemble them. Lucy holds 17 individual funerals for them that Drew has to suffer through.\n\nAs the season progresses, Lucy faces more and greater challenges in medicine and life. In \"[[Our Drunk Friend]]\", she personally raises money to send an [[alcoholic]] patient to rehab, only to have it blow up in her face when he falls off the wagon. J.D., who had initially seemed to support her, tells her that he knew the patient was a lost cause, but felt that she needed to learn how to cope with defeat.\n\n===Drew Suffin===\n[[Michael Mosley (actor)|Michael Mosley]] portrays Drew Suffin, who is a medical student at Winston University giving it a second go. He had previously been in jail and was apparently shot by a 12-year-old. He describes jail as \"cold\". He is in a relationship with Denise. He is apparently Dr. Cox's favorite student; at one point, Cox forces him to tape a \"#1\" sign to his chest, which is shortly replaced by a pink T-shirt saying \"#1\". He later stops wearing either, though Cox still shows him signs of favoritism (he even pats Drew's back, to the dismay of J.D.). Drew disappoints Dr. Cox after Cox shows him off to Turk in the series finale, \"Our Thanks\", saying that his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is the opposite of J.D. Drew then turns to Dr. Cox and asks for relationship advice. Dr. Cox replies, \"Oh dear God, Drew, not you. It's happening again.\"\n\n===Cole Aaronson===\n[[Dave Franco]] portrays Cole Aaronson, a medical student at Winston University. His family donated a large sum of money to get the new Sacred Heart Hospital built, and as such, Cole believes he is \"untouchable\" and can do whatever he wants. While spoiled, arrogant, and immature, he occasionally reveals himself to have a good heart. He is in a relationship with Lucy for a time, but after he is diagnosed with [[melanoma]], he takes his frustrations out on her, causing her to leave him. He then confides in Dr. Kelso, who gives him some much-needed advice that brings Lucy back to him. His melanoma goes into remission in the series finale, and Cole decides to become a surgeon and follow Dr. Turk. By the end of the finale, Turk gives up trying to scare Cole away and accepts him as a kind of prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n===Todd Quinlan===\nDr. Todd Quinlan (often called \"The Todd\"), played by [[Robert Maschio]], was a surgeon at Sacred Heart known for his rampant sexual [[innuendo]] and [[sexual harassment]] of females. Despite his [[Fraternities and sororities|frat-boy]] personality and his depiction as absent-minded and unintelligent, Todd is a skilled surgeon: the hospital's best surgical [[Internship (medicine)#United States|intern]] and second-best surgical [[Medical residency#United States|resident]].<ref>\"[[My Extra Mile]]\", ''Scrubs'', Season 5, Episode 15, NBC.

In the Season 1 DVD commentaries, Bill Lawrence said this was deliberate.\n\nAlthough Todd is often shown speaking to women in a way that constitutes sexual harassment, in \"[[My Lucky Charm (Scrubs)|My Lucky Charm]]\", he states, \"The Todd appreciates hot regardless of gender.\" He pretends to be [[gay]] in \"[[My Lunch]]\", believing that \"chicks dig gay dudes.\"<ref name=\"My Lunch\">{{cite episode| title = My Lunch | episodelink = My Lunch | series = Scrubs| network = NBC | airdate = 2006-04-25| season = 5 | number = 20 }}</ref> In \"[[My Office (Scrubs episode)|My Office]]\", after talking with Dr. Molly Clock, he explains that his view of women originates from an unhealthy relationship with his mother with whom he once had a brief incestuous experience. However, it is revealed in \"[[My Tormented Mentor]]\" that Todd's father also influenced him to look at women as sexual objects. It was implied that Todd made such comments only to maintain an image.{{episode|date=August 2012}}  He shows sensitivity and compassion for friends and people around him, going out of his way to protect Turk and even notices that Turk is upset in \"Their Story\".{{fact|date=January 2018}} He has a tattoo on his bicep that reads \"DOC\".\n\nThroughout the series, Todd often refers to himself in the [[grammatical person|third person]] and gives a variety of [[high five]]s, hard enough that they hurt. He often devises names for these variations of high fives by taking a word or subject that references a previous comment or gesture, and adding \"five\" to it for example, \"moving-on five\" or \"something-might-be-wrong five\", normally accompanied by a sound effect. He is a member of [[the Janitor]]'s second Brain Trust, along with Ted and Doug. In \"[[My Soul on Fire|My Soul On Fire, Part 1]]\", it is revealed that Todd went to medical school [[List of medical schools in the Caribbean|in the Bahamas]] and learned the high five from his professor. In \"[[My Chief Concern]]\", he appears to be involved in a [[three-way]] sexual relationship with the Hendersons, a married couple. Although Todd maintains a steady role through much of the series, he appears only twice in \"[[My Finale]]\": When J.D. runs out of the hospital and when J.D. leaves for the final time, at which point Todd gives him a \"goodbye five from the big dog\". Todd is a recurring character in Season 9.\n\n===Ted Buckland===\nTheodore \"Ted\" Buckland, Jr., played by [[Sam Lloyd]], is Sacred Heart's [[lawyer]], credited as an unnamed \"Lawyer\" for the first season. As the hospital's \"sad sack\", he has pathetically low self-esteem and frequent [[suicide|suicidal]] tendencies. He is constantly degraded by Dr. Kelso, who slowly but surely breaks him down. It is implied that Ted has never won a case. It took him five tries to pass the bar exam because of stress-induced [[dyslexia]]; he has also stated that he took the exam in [[Alaska]], where it was much easier to pass. Ted attended [[Ithaca College]] and was the best attorney to have graduated from [[South Texas College of Law]].<ref>''Scrubs'' Season 5, Episode 17 \"My Chopped Liver\"</ref> A conversation with the Janitor in Season 3 indicates that Ted can speak Korean.<ref>''Scrubs'' Season 3, Episode 15 \"My Tormented Mentor\"</ref>\n\nSo intense is Ted's hatred for Kelso that he regularly has homicidal thoughts about him, and Kelso is well aware of these thoughts, which adds to their tensions. On many occasions, Ted has considered suicide, even going so far as to stand on the edge of the hospital roof and try to coax himself into jumping. Ted claims that he had a wife and children, but they left him because of the stress of his job. \n\nHe has an [[Oedipus complex]] regarding his mother, with whom he lives. He sleeps in the same bed as her and has remarked that she has installed a camera in the bathroom to check up on him when he  bathes. In one episode it is suggested that Ted\u2019s mother believes he is a doctor, as he is shown coming home in stolen scrubs, claiming to have saved a patient\u2019s life. Ted leads an [[a cappella]] group with three other non-medical hospital employees he calls his \"Worthless Peons\" (played by [[The Blanks (band)|The Blanks]], the real-life band of Sam Lloyd), and is shown to be uncharacteristically confident when surrounded by his bandmates. He also participates in [[biking]] and [[triathlon]]s, often training with Doug Murphy. For one episode, he joins the Brain Trust with the Janitor, Todd, and Doug. He eventually becomes best friends with Keith Dudemeister. With the help of the Janitor and J.D., he finds the courage to ask Stephanie Gooch ([[Kate Micucci]]), a [[ukulele]]-playing musician who performs for the hospital's patients, on a date, and the two form a relationship and move in together. \n\nTed has made three appearances outside of the ''Scrubs'' universe in ''[[Cougar Town]]''. In the [[Cougar Town (season 2)#ep45/46|Season 2 finale]], written and directed by [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]], he visits the main cast in [[Hawaii]] and says that Gooch has run off with an unseen \"Dr. Hooch\". Ted and his band reappear in Season 3 of [[Cougar Town]], where they audition to play at [[Disney World]]. In the episode \"A One Story Town\", Ted panics when he notices that everyone he meets resembles people he used to work with, including Jules' father, played by [[Ken Jenkins]]\u2014as well as [[Zach Braff]], [[Sarah Chalke]], [[Christa Miller]], and [[Robert Maschio]]\u2014all as characters who resemble Kelso, J.D., Elliot, Jordan, and Todd, respectively.\n\n===Laverne Roberts===\nLaverne Roberts, played by [[Aloma Wright]], was a nurse at Sacred Heart. In her free time, Laverne enjoyed [[soap opera]]s and office [[gossip]]. She was a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and had strong opinions on premarital sex, abortion, and other actions. It was later revealed that she maintained much of her religious devotion as a way to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with seeing suffering and death in the hospital every day. Laverne was one of the few staff members who could intimidate imposing employees such as Dr. Cox, the Janitor, Dr. Kelso, and Carla, with whom she was especially close. Laverne had a husband named Lester, a son, and a nephew (Lance) who fought in the [[Iraq War]]. She and Lester were shown to have marital problems, and her attempts to fix them were unsuccessful.\n\nWhile driving to the hospital one morning, Laverne was involved in a car accident, fell into a [[coma]], and was put on life support. Her family decided to take her off after learning that she was [[Brain death|brain dead]]. Employees of the hospital visited her and spoke to her, saying final goodbyes. Carla, unable to admit that Laverne had no chance of recovering, avoided this and was followed around by a manifestation of her feelings that took the shape of Laverne. The manifestation disappeared once Carla finally said goodbye to Laverne, and Laverne died almost immediately afterward. Her character made a brief appearance in a flashback in \"My Comedy Show\" and in the Season 8 finale, in J.D.'s last fantasy.\n\nAfter ''Scrubs'' was renewed for a seventh season, creator Bill Lawrence promised Aloma Wright another role, because he had killed off Laverne under the impression that the show was in its final season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2007/biz/markets-festivals/scrubs-resuscitates-wright-s-role-1117966985/|title=\u2018Scrubs\u2019 resuscitates Wright\u2019s role|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=2007-06-15|work=Variety|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303044246/https://variety.com/2007/biz/markets-festivals/scrubs-resuscitates-wright-s-role-1117966985/|archivedate=2017-03-03}}</ref> Wright played a new character similar to Laverne, but only J.D. could see the similarities.

She first appeared in \"My Bad\" (Season 1) as J.D.'s patient, and he wound up having sex with her before finding out she was Dr. Cox's ex-wife.\n\nJordan's father, Quinn Sullivan, was on the Board of Directors, and she inherited the position after his death. She was the sister of the deceased Ben Sullivan (who was a close friend of Dr. Cox) and Danni Sullivan (an ex-girlfriend of J.D., leading Ben to tease J.D. in \"[[My Screw Up]]\", \"You know something? You have slept with both of my sisters\"). After her divorce from Dr. Cox, they maintained a strictly sexual relationship, and they both continued to have feelings for each other and got back together shortly before the birth (in Season 2's \"My Karma\") of their son, Jack. However, Jordan did not tell Dr. Cox that he was the child's father for several episodes, because she wanted to make sure he truly wanted to be with her. Though Dr. Cox and Jordan had been shown to bicker, Dr. Cox remarked that Jordan now refused to argue with him because she did not want Jack to be emotionally scarred.<ref name=\"MySelfExam\">{{cite episode| title = My Self-Examination | episodelink = My Self-Examination | series = Scrubs| network = NBC | airdate = 2004-04-27| season = 3 | number = 21 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Jordan and Dr. Cox found out that their divorce papers had not been signed correctly and that they were still legally married, their relationship became strained. Deciding that marriage was ruining their relationship, they got a legal divorce. Later, they had a daughter, Jennifer Dylan (named by J.D., after his initials). In Season 8, both Jordan and Dr. Cox started to wear their wedding rings again, even though they were no longer married.\n\nJordan was portrayed as [[sarcastic]], vindictive, and cold; she blamed this on her parents, but later admitted to Elliot that her parents had been supportive and were not the cause of her behavior.<ref name=\"TheirStory\">{{cite episode| title = Their Story | episodelink = Their Story | series = Scrubs| | network = NBC | airdate = 2007-04-19| season = 6 | number = 17 }}</ref> Though never seen on screen, her mother was referenced in three episodes, including one that revealed Dr. Cox's nickname for her, \"Evil Dogface\". Jordan is occasionally portrayed to struggle with being middle aged. E. g. she primarily targets men in their twenties for her one night stands, partly as a self-test to find out whether she is still sexually attractive to a younger age group and she has admitted freely that she did and further plans to undergo cosmetic surgery (e. g. referring to her breasts as \"fity percent real\"). The Janitor strongly implied in \"[[My Life in Four Cameras]]\" that Jordan had [[bipolar disorder]].\n\nDespite her cruelty, Jordan showed loyalty toward friends and sometimes tried to fix her wrongdoings. She eventually developed a tolerance and almost fondness for Elliot, which seemed to stem from the fact that they were both able to manipulate their boyfriends and that they were both \"nervous pooers\". When Elliot was dating Keith, they double-dated with Jordan and Cox a couple of times. In later episodes, Jordan was easily annoyed by Elliot, and in \"[[Their Story]]\", she purposely tried to cause tension between Elliot and Keith. However, she managed to fix the damage at the end of the episode. In later seasons, Jordan formed a friendship with Carla. In \"[[My Finale]]\", she kissed J.D. on the cheek (noting, \"We did it once\") and told him to \"take care\". Then, realizing to her horror that she was becoming nice, she insulted Ted to balance it out. During J.D.'s vision of the future, she, Dr. Cox, and their family spent Christmas with J.D., Elliot, Turk, and Carla.\n\n===Doug Murphy===\nDr. Doug Murphy, played by [[Johnny Kastl]], was a [[pathologist]] at Sacred Heart, formerly a doctor of internal medicine. Doug was an incompetent nervous wreck who often accidentally killed patients assigned to him, and even had causes of deaths named after him. He even said in the season 4 episode \"My First Kill\" his first kill was 40 minutes into his first day. Because of his anxiety, he was nicknamed \"nervous guy\" and \"pee pants\" by Dr. Cox, who, along with Dr. Kelso, degraded him constantly. Despite his lack of medical skills and having to repeat his third year of residency, Doug eventually became a licensed physician. However, he began to doubt himself and came to the conclusion that he should not be a doctor. While on a trip to the [[morgue]], he realized that because of the number of deaths he had been responsible for, he was able to identify the cause of death of several people. He became an expert [[coroner]] but still made several mistakes, such as forgetting a [[gurney]], misplacing a dead body, or failing to retrieve a patient before ''[[rigor mortis]]'' set in. He also mentioned in \"[[List of Scrubs episodes|My Way Home]]\" that he hated dead people: J.D. tried to sneak out of the hospital in a [[body bag]], and when he sat up, Doug believed he was a zombie, panicked, and hit him repeatedly with a [[fire extinguisher]], saying, \"Dead people should be dead!\"\n\nDoug was often seen sucking on [[lollipop]]s (an homage to the original [[Kojak]]), as were other coroners at Sacred Heart. At the baby shower for Carla and Turk's child, Doug and some other coroners were shown eating and trading lollipops. Doug and Ted often hung out with each other, and were revealed to bike and compete in triathlons together, as well. Doug, Ted, and Todd were all members of the Janitor's second Brain Trust, but Doug was temporarily replaced with Lloyd. Doug revealed that, after putting toe tags on [[cadaver]]s for so long, he had developed a [[Foot fetishism|foot fetish]], and he was later found hiding under a reception desk because he \"got tired of looking at dead ones' feet\".\n\n===Keith Dudemeister===\nKeith Dudemeister, played by [[Travis Schuldt]], was a medical resident at Sacred Heart. The episode \"[[My Intern's Eyes]]\" was shown through (but not narrated from) Keith's point of view. Keith was introduced as a timid intern who became very popular amongst his fellow interns and some senior staff. J.D. took Keith under his wing and taught him the ropes. Despite all this, J.D. grew to irrationally dislike Keith, who quickly began to excel in his hospital duties, and furthermore because Keith was a \"booty call\" that progressed into a relationship with Elliot. However, J.D. soon decided that he would like Keith because Elliot did, and admitted that Keith had genuine skills as a doctor, with the two becoming good friends soon after. J.D. also admitted in [[My Road to Nowhere|one episode]] that, had Elliot never worked at the hospital, he and Keith would probably have immediately become best friends. Despite J.D.'s dislike of Keith, the two have a great deal in common\u2014which may explain Elliot's interest in him. Elliot, who spoke fluent [[German (language)|German]], informed J.D. that Keith's last name meant \"master of dudes\" in German. Keith and Ted would eventually become best friends. In \"[[His Story IV]]\", Keith revealed himself to be a Republican, which strengthened his relationship with Elliot, as she was also one. Eventually, Keith moved in with Elliot and she confessed that she loved him. Keith later proposed to her, and they quickly began to plan a wedding.<ref name=\"MyColdShower\">{{cite episode| title = My Cold Shower | episodelink = My Cold Shower | series = Scrubs| network = NBC | airdate = 2007-05-10| season = 6 | number = 19 }}</ref> Elliot, doubting her love for Keith, had second thoughts and cold feet, responding by nearly cheating on Keith with J.D. Elliot decided to break off the engagement. Their relationship became very strained, with Keith insulting Elliot whenever he saw her. While he eventually acted professionally at work with her, he alternated between anger and depression outside of the workplace. Elliot made jokes about her leaving him, but Ted informed her that Keith was still hurt and pretended to be over it only when she was around. Elliot finally realized his feelings in \"[[My Jerks]]\" and sincerely apologized for hurting him. Keith responded by saying he had really needed to hear that. He appeared again in \"[[My Finale]]\" in J.D.'s final daydream of all the people he had met at Sacred Heart.\n\n==Minor characters==\n=== Dr. Phillip Wen===\nDr. Wen, played by [[Charles Chun]], was an attending surgeon who mentored Turk and the Todd for their first three years at the hospital. He tended to be very serious and business-like, and was one of very few characters not treated comically (although a couple of attempts were made, such as when he and Turk argued over what song to play during a surgery and when he pushed Turk to help him beat Dr. Cox and J.D. at wheelchair racing). Dr. Wen was more dispassionate and modest than most surgeons, but he did have an egotistic, competitive side; he competed against Dr. Cox in a wheelchair race between the medical and surgical branches.<ref name=\"MyWayHighway\">{{cite episode| title = My Way or the Highway | episodelink = My Way or the Highway (Scrubs) | series = Scrubs| network = NBC | airdate = 2002-04-16| season = 1 | number = 20 }}</ref> He was one of the few characters to refer to Turk by his first name, Christopher. Little is known about Wen's personal life other than that he was married, and that his wife once broke her legs in a car accident. Although his full position at the hospital is unknown, he was chief of surgery until he passed the title to Turk. He was inordinately fond of the song \"[[A Little Respect]]\" by [[Erasure]].<ref name=\"BestFriendMistake\">{{cite episode| title = My Best Friend's Mistake | episodelink = My Best Friend's Mistake | series = Scrubs|network = NBC | airdate = 2001-10-09| season = 1 | number = 3 }}</ref>\n\nDr. Wen was not featured on the show after Season 6, but in Season 8, his name was seen on Dr. Cox's \"Sometimes Allowed\" list,<ref name=\"NewRole\">{{cite episode| title = My New Role | episodelink = My New Role | series = Scrubs| network = ABC | airdate = 2009-02-03| season = 7 | number = 157 }}</ref> and he was parodied in the annual interns' sketch show. J.D. commented that the Dr. Wen sketch was not working, referring to Dr. Wen's lack of comedic flair. When Carla became a surgical nurse, revealing things about Turk in surgery, Dr. Wen was seen laughing with the Todd under his mask. He made an appearance in the series finale.<ref name=\"ComedyShow\">{{cite episode| title = My Comedy Show | episodelink = My Comedy Show | series = Scrubs| network = ABC | airdate = 2009-02-10| season = 8 | number = 160 }}</ref> The character has the same name as a former writing partner of series writer Bill Callahan; the two previously wrote for ''[[Spin City]]'', which was co-created by ''Scrubs'' creator Bill Lawrence. Callahan and Wen parted ways in 2003 while working on ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'', a year before Callahan joined the show's writing staff. In \"[[My Catalyst]]\", his nametag said '''Phillip Wen'''.\n\n===Ben Sullivan===\nBenjamin \"Ben\" Sullivan, played by [[Brendan Fraser]], was a carpenter and photographer who was Jordan's and Danni's older brother and Cox's brother-in-law and best friend. Unlike his sisters, Ben was easygoing and friendly with a good sense of humor. He was an expert at identifying actresses who had appeared naked in movies (a trait that allowed him to become quick friends with J.D., who had a similar skill), and was described by Jordan as \"clumsy\", which caused many accidents during his carpentry jobs. Ben was diagnosed with [[leukemia]], which initially caused a strain on his friendship with Cox (because Cox was unable to handle the fact that Ben had only a 30% chance of survival), but J.D. convinced Cox to be there for Ben. Ben eventually went into remission. He then traveled on the \"World Leukemia Tour\" for two years and returned only in time for his nephew Jack's birthday in \"[[My Screw Up]]\". Cox, despite being displeased with Ben for not seeing a single \"doctor, medicine man, or 'scary shaman with saucers in his ears{{'\"}} during his extended trip, was nonetheless delighted to see him again, and left Ben in J.D.'s care while Cox made arrangements for Jack's birthday party. Ben went into cardiac arrest and died 20 minutes after Cox left the hospital. Cox took his death very hard, initially blaming J.D. and sending him home, but Ben's ghost (a figment of Cox's imagination) reminded him that it was not J.D.'s fault, and Cox later apologized. Everyone at the hospital was saddened by Ben's death, and many senior staff members attended his funeral two days later. Finally, Cox acknowledged Ben's death and his ghost dissipated. Cox sat with Jordan and J.D. in the front row at the funeral and cried.\n\n=== Lonnie ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Scrubs (TV series)]] -->\nLonnie, (played by [[Michael Hobert]]), first seen in \"[[His Story II]]\", began working at Sacred Heart as one of J.D.'s interns in Season 3. While trying to impress a date, J.D. stole Lonnie's scrubs and told his date that Lonnie was his \"slave\". In Season 4, Lonnie became a second-year resident and was taught by co-chief residents Elliot and J.D. He continued his residency in Season 5, supervised by Dr. Cox. He was part of the Triple Giant Doctor in \"[[My Ocardial Infarction]]\". He had three children \"that he knew of\", all daughters; he could grow a [[moustache]] in one day; and he played [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] basketball for [[Villanova University]], where he was All-Conference. During Season 4, J.D. strongly disliked him because of his outgoing nature, but perhaps more so because, unlike most of the other interns, Lonnie did not appear to fear J.D. He briefly appeared in Season 6. Michael Hobert, who played him, also appeared as an extra in [[My First Day|the pilot episode]], as a patient getting an [[MRI]] scan near the end of the episode. In the Season 8 finale, \"[[My Finale]]\", Lonnie was shown one last time. His last words were, \"I hate you so much, J.D.\"\n\n===Lloyd===\nLloyd, the Delivery Guy (played by writer [[Mike Schwartz]])\u2014whose last name may be Slawski, his father's surname<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Identity Crisis |episodelink=My Identity Crisis |series=Scrubs|airdate=2007-11-15 |season=7 |number=4}}</ref>\u2014was a member of the air band Cool Cats with Turk, Ted, and the Janitor, where he played air drums. He had been in rehab for drug use but relapsed (though he did not use needles, and carried a straw). He admitted to J.D. that he once received a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] for [[crack cocaine]]. In an early episode, he was a patient at the hospital after getting his penis stuck in a flashlight. He was also seen in a musical number after getting feces thrown in his eye by a homeless person. It was revealed that he was the son of \"Colonel Doctor\" when J.D. was taped to the ceiling in the episode \"[[My Perspective]]\".\n\nLloyd was also an avid fan of [[speed metal]], which he aggressively blasted while driving his truck. This was introduced in Season 6's \"[[My Therapeutic Month]]\", when J.D. asked Lloyd for a ride and Lloyd introduced him to the metal band [[Devildriver]], specifically their songs \"The Devil's Son\" and \"Driving Down the Darkness\". In \"[[My No Good Reason]]\", Dr. Cox used Lloyd as part of a plan to get Nurse [[Laverne Roberts]] to admit that bad things sometimes happen for no reason, but she saw through the plan (\"That's not her father; that's a delivery guy in a sweater\"). In \"[[My Long Goodbye]]\", J.D. sent a text message to Lloyd to go pick up Dr. Cox's son, Jack, from daycare because J.D. had not listened to Dr. Cox when he asked him to do it. Lloyd proceeded to blast speed metal from his radio with Jack in the car, lip-syncing to \"Driving Down the Darkness\" while Jack air drummed.\n\nLloyd was once referred to as the loneliest person in the hospital. In the Season 1 episode \"My Old Lady\", Lloyd was in one of J.D.'s fantasies, dumping a ton of bricks on J.D.'s head. He delivered syringes and installed Elliot's stripper pole in the episode \"[[Their Story]]\", and it was revealed in \"[[My Turf War]]\" that he was a [[hypochondriac]]. In the Season 6 finale, Lloyd was part of the Janitor's Brain Trust, replacing an upset Doug. However, he was fired from the group after his tryout. \n\nIn one of his early appearances, when making fun of Carla, his nametag said Frank. Lloyd's uniform consisted of blue shorts and a blue shirt. It was revealed in \"[[My Identity Crisis]]\" that his father's name was Coleman Slawski (Colonel Doctor), and so he was probably Lloyd Slawski. According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20180224010731/http://www.rateyourdoc.org/ RateYourDoc.org], Lloyd became an ambulance driver for Sacred Heart after cleaning up. In Season 8's \"[[My Soul on Fire]] Part 1\", the Janitor announced to the Brain Trust that Lloyd had died while snorkeling in his father's pool. This turned out to be false when Lloyd entered the room and said that he had faked his own death.\n\n===Kim Briggs===\nKimberly \"Kim\" Briggs, played by [[Elizabeth Banks]], was a former [[urology|urologist]] at Sacred Heart and the mother of J.D.'s child, Sam Perry Gilligan Dorian. Kim had been working in the hospital on J.D.'s first day (the pilot episode) and attended Ben's funeral in \"[[My Screw Up]]\". However, J.D. did not notice her because of her [[wedding ring]] (married women were \"invisible\" to J.D.). Elliot later remarked that Kim was actually divorced and wore the ring only to avoid unwanted advances from other doctors. J.D. and Kim started dating, and she revealed in \"[[My Transition]]\" that she was pregnant. Ironically, the two had not actually had sex because they did not want to risk pregnancy; instead, their child was accidentally conceived via [[premature ejaculation]] during [[non-penetrative sex]]. The two vacillated on whether to have an abortion, but decided to have the baby after Turk and Carla's daughter was born. In \"[[My House (Scrubs)|My House]]\", Kim accepted a position at a hospital in [[Tacoma, Washington]], but said she would return in about four months. J.D. decided to make a surprise visit in \"[[My Road to Nowhere]]\" in order to see her first [[ultrasound]], but when he got there, she told him she had [[Miscarriage|miscarried]]. In light of this news, the two had a long conversation about their relationship and ultimately decided to end it. At the end of the episode, however, Kim was seen during her ultrasound, having lied to J.D. so he would not feel he had to stay with her.\n\nIn \"[[My Conventional Wisdom]]\", Turk and J.D. went to a medical convention in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Coincidentally, Kim was speaking at the convention, and was visibly still pregnant. After J.D. confronted her, she pleaded with him to discuss their problems, but he was too angry and left, overwhelmed. She followed him back to Sacred Heart and confronted him. J.D. decided to listen to his [[conscience]] in \"[[My Rabbit]]\" and support Kim, solely for the sake of their son. However, their relationship soon reignited, and they became a couple again. J.D. avoided telling Kim he loved her, still contemplating whether they were right for each other. When Kim went into [[childbirth|labor]] in \"[[My Hard Labor]]\", she demanded to know what he really thought of their relationship. J.D. ultimately told her the truth\u2014that he did not really love her anymore\u2014and she was furious and ended the relationship. After the birth, however, they agreed to remain friends for the sake of their child. She moved away afterward with Sam, but J.D. still saw him often. In \"[[My Cuz]]\", Kim was revealed to be dating [[#Sean Kelly|Sean Kelly]], Elliot's ex-boyfriend; Elliot had introduced them after Kim and J.D.'s breakup. In \"[[My Chief Concern]]\", Kim was present when J.D. got a job at her hospital.\n\n===Seymour Beardfac\u00e9===\nDr. Seymour \"Beard Face\" Beardfac\u00e9, played by Geoff Stevenson, was a doctor with a thick and bushy beard, which inspired everyone to refer to him as \"Beard Face\" rather than the correct pronunciation, {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|b|\u026a\u0259r|d|_|f|\u00e6|\u02c8|s|e\u026a}}. This angered him and prompted the repeated line, \"It's Beardfac\u00e9, damn it.\" He was first seen in the Season 2 episode \"[[My Case Study]]\". Beardfac\u00e9 was the fastest appendectomist at Sacred Heart until Turk took the title, a moment Turk considered one of his greatest. In ''Scrubs: Interns'', it was revealed that Beardfac\u00e9 was going through a \"gender identity crisis\", inviting Howie to dinner and stealing sports bras. He was seen talking to an intern in Season 9's \"Our First Day of School\", but was only in the background and had no lines.\n\n===Kevin Casey===\nDr. Kevin Casey, played by [[Michael J. Fox]], was a doctor at a different hospital who was a close associate of Dr. Cox. He was a brilliant doctor who specialized in both internal medicine and surgery. Dr. Casey suffered from [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] to an extreme degree: He washed his hands hours after his last surgery, avoided lengthy physical contact, and drove home to use his own restroom. Although his condition harmed his personal life, he saw it as the key to his career success. Stating that medicine is all about obsession, he read and studied medical texts repeatedly and hypothesized every possible scenario that could befall a patient; he was essentially unflappable and enjoyed overall confidence. His medical and surgical skills were superior to Dr. Cox's and Turk's. He also appeared to have a photographic memory and was able to cite information from thousands of pages of medical textbooks.\n\n===Coleman Slawski===\nDr. Coleman \"Colonel Doctor\" Slawski, played by Bob Bencomo, was a doctor whose name nobody seemed to know. He was seen as early as Season 1's \"[[My Super Ego]]\", but his nickname (stemming from his striking resemblance to [[Colonel Sanders]]) was not introduced until Season 5's \"[[My Jiggly Ball]]\", when he laughed at a joke Dr. Kelso had made and Kelso said, \"Thank you, Colonel Doctor!\" To Slawski's \"Excuse me?\" Kelso replied: \"I'm sorry. I don't know your name, and you look like that Kentucky Fried Chicken guy.\" The Janitor watched surveillance footage of Slawski using the bathroom so he could \"freak him out\" by guessing how many times he had gone during a given day. Like Dr. Mickhead, he was around since the show began but was originally supposed to be an extra. He was shown to be the father of Lloyd the Delivery Guy when J.D. was taped to the ceiling in the Season 6 episode \"[[My Perspective]]\". His real name was revealed in Season 7's \"[[My Identity Crisis]]\". His name (Coleman Slawski) was a play on the word coleslaw. He was seen in the background of many Season 9 episodes.\n\n===Hooch===\nDr. Hooch, played by [[Phill Lewis]], was an [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]] whom Turk and J.D. enjoyed antagonizing. When he was introduced, he was an easygoing guy, but because of a combination of people accidentally calling his name and J.D. and Turk pulling pranks, he gradually became angrier and eventually snapped. Hooch became very aggressive; he once knocked a man out with his shoe for trying to exit an elevator he was guarding for J.D. Earlier in the same episode, when J.D. and Turk put [[bouillon cube]]s in his shower head, he rushed out of the shower room and threatened everyone in the area: \"If it happens again, I will wait in my [[SUV]]\u2014blast me some [[speed metal]], 5.1 [[surround sound]], heavy on the bass\u2014and someone will be getting mowed down.\") Upon learning that Turk was the culprit, he threatened to take one of Turk's fingers as his own \"funny prank\". In response to Hooch's extreme behavior, J.D. and Turk habitually said \"Hooch is crazy\" in a nonchalant tone. They paired him with another doctor, Dr. Paul Turner (played by [[Jim Hanks]], brother of [[Tom Hanks]], who played the titular Turner in the movie ''[[Turner & Hooch]]''), in one episode to create what J.D. described as \"a super medical crime-fighting team\", Turner and Hooch. Despite resenting J.D. and Turk for the manipulation, Turner and Hooch formed a good team and were near tears when they were forced to split. Hooch briefly replaced Turk as J.D.'s best friend and was given the nickname Chocolate Bear Two.\n\nIn \"[[My Growing Pains]]\", Hooch was fired for being involved in a hostage situation. This was presumably because Rex and three other interns had followed him around all day, again as a prank by J.D. and Turk. In \"[[My New Role]]\" in Season 8, he appeared on the \"Never Ever, Ever, Ever, Ever, Ever Allowed in Dr. Cox's Office\" list along with J.D. and Jordan, despite the fact that he had been fired. (Jordan was no longer working at Sacred Heart at that point, either.) He was seen in the [[My Finale|Season 8 finale]] in a straitjacket, saying, \"Hooch ''is'' crazy.\"\n\nIn the Season 2 finale of ''[[Cougar Town]]'', [[Ted Buckland]] revealed that, since the end of ''Scrubs'', Hooch had run away with Ted's former girlfriend, [[Stephanie Gooch]].\n\n===Leonard===\nLeonard, played by producer Randall Winston, was the hospital's security guard, easily recognizable thanks to his height, giant afro and the hook he had in place of his right hand. He was first seen in J.D.'s fantasy of denial in Season 1's \"[[My Occurrence]]\", still having his right hand. One of the show's many running jokes (first made in Season 3's \"[[My Screw Up]]\") was that whenever he was mentioned, he was called the \"big black security guard with the hook for the hand\", but everyone knew him by his giant afro. When his relationship with second-year resident Gloria was revealed in Season 5's \"[[My Lunch]]\", she stated that she was \"never going back\", and Leonard told everyone that he loved \"white meat\". He did not allow bouncing basketballs in the hallways and confiscated (and popped) Turk's, because of J.D., on more than one occasion. Leonard lost his hand after it got caught in an ice machine (sometime between episodes 1.22 and 3.14), and he received a $5,000,000 settlement from the hospital. He might have been bisexual, for in Season 5's \"[[My Chopped Liver]]\", when Dr. Cox was pretending to mentor the interns, Gloria said that her boyfriend was bi-curious and wanted her to pick his lovers. This would only prove to be true, though, if Gloria and Leonard were already dating at that point. He appeared in the finale alongside Gloria, where he said, \"Got me some white meat.\" Gloria was later seen pregnant with Leonard's twin children.\n\n===Walter Mickhead===\nDr. Walter Mickhead, played by Frank Encarnacao, made his first appearance in Season 2's \"[[My Overkill]]\". He was originally known as \"black-haired doctor\". He was one of a handful of characters who started out as extras for the show (Dr. Kelso addressed him as a pediatrician, Dr. Carlson, in \"[[My Case Study]]\" in Season 2). His real name was first mentioned in Season 3's \"[[My White Whale]]\u201d, when J.D. told Turk, \"The girl one just called you Dr. Jerk!\" and Turk replied: \"No sweat. You should hear what [the interns] call Dr. Mickhead.\" In \"[[My Porcelain God]]\u201d, J.D. mentioned that Dr. Kevin Casey had helped Mickhead overcome his addiction to huffing paint. In \"[[My Quarantine]]\" in Season 4, he turned out to be one of many hospital staff members who had slept with Jordan during her separation from Dr. Cox. When Dr. Cox thanks whoever taught her the \"[[Reverse amazon|reverse cowgirl]]\" position, both J.D. and Dr. Mickhead reply, \"You're welcome\".\n\nIn Season 5's \"[[Her Story II]]\u201d, it was revealed that his wife was recently murdered and that Mickhead was a \"person of interest\" in the investigation. He did not do much to rebut the suspicion that he was involved in his wife's death, first practically making out with a nurse in the hospital a few days after the event, then asking J.D.'s girlfriend Julie to hide a hammer (supposedly the murder weapon) for him in her basement, a maneuver J.D. stopped at the last second. Later in the episode, Mickhead was seized by two policemen, protesting his innocence and fighting the arrest. In Season 5's \"[[My Cabbage]]\u201d, he gave out \"cool\" orange prison jumpsuits to people at the hospital after his release. Dr. Cox remarked in Season 6, in \"[[My Conventional Wisdom]]\u201d, that Mickhead had just barely beaten the rap.\n\nIn Season 6's \"[[His Story IV]]\u201d, he identified himself as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Also in Season 6, it was revealed that he was a surgeon. In \"[[My Saving Grace]]\" (Season 8), short-time chief of medicine Dr. Maddox admitted that she had had a sexual relationship with Mickhead, complaining that he had to choke her to keep an erection, to which Mickhead replied, \"I have needs.\" He was seen in \"[[My Finale]]\u201d, when J.D. imagined everyone he had met at the hospital, and simply said, \"I didn't kill her.\"\n\n===Molly Clock===\nDr. Molly Clock, played by [[Heather Graham]], was an attending psychiatrist at Sacred Heart who first appeared in the Season 4 episode \"[[My Old Friend's New Friend]]\". Turk said that Dr. Clock was the second hottest employee at Sacred Heart (after Nurse Tisdale) and that he would kill to have sex with her; however, he also disapproved of her profession and sometimes referred to her as a \"devil woman\". Dr. Clock was perky and extremely optimistic, expressing great joy over the fact that the hospital cafeteria was serving [[kielbasa]] and arguing that all people were innately good-natured. She was excellent at her job, very intelligent and self-confident, and as a result, she became the mentor and role model that Elliot had always wanted (along with Carla). She had an uncanny ability to single out a person's deepest insecurity, once reducing Elliot to tears with the word \"eyebrows\". She also showed a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for men who had mental health problems (like J.D.). Dr. Clock was one of the few people in the hospital who were completely impervious to Dr. Cox's sarcastic barbs. She used the time in which he was ranting to compose flippant replies, which annoyed him to no end.\n\nIn Season 4's \"[[My Last Chance (Scrubs)|My Last Chance]]\u201d, Dr. Clock announced her plan to accept a position at a Milwaukee hospital and made out with J.D. at her farewell party. She agreed to sleep with J.D., but only if Elliot gave him permission. She ended up leaving without anything happening between the two of them after Elliot gave J.D. a note that he believed gave him permission to sleep with Dr. Clock, but actually said, \"Now we're even.\" She was last seen in Season 4's \"[[My Best Laid Plans]]\u201d, when she returned to Sacred Heart and ended up at a bar with J.D., willing to go all the way\u2014but J.D. decided not to. The name Molly Clock was an homage to one of the medical consultants on the show, Dr. Dolly Klock.\n\n===Randall Winston===\nRandall Winston, played by [[Martin Klebba]], was a [[Dwarfism|little person]] who worked in the janitorial branch of Sacred Heart. He had a very likable demeanor and addressed people as \"Bro\" or \"Brah\". The character was named for one of the show's producers, Randall Winston (who played Leonard, the security guard with a hook for a hand). Randall's first two appearances took place in J.D.'s daydreams, in which J.D. imagined Randall dressed in a [[karate]] [[Keikogi|gi]] and punching him repeatedly in the crotch in surprise attacks: first after jumping out of J.D.'s locker, and then when J.D. walked in on one of [[Perry Cox|Dr. Cox]] and Jordan's sadomasochistic sex routines in which Randall seemed to participate. It was later revealed that these fantasies related to Randall's being treated at Sacred Heart for a kidney injury after sparring in his karate class and to his frequent use of the expression \"punch in the crotch\" (\"[[My Rule of Thumb]]\u201d, Season 3).\n\nIn Season 3's \"[[My Catalyst]]\u201d, the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] introduced Randall to [[Bob Kelso|Dr. Kelso]] as \"my new associate\". Kelso offered the two of them $23 a month to get rid of the hospital's trash (which they did by simply dumping it on a roof behind the hospital). When J.D. learned in \"[[My Butterfly]]\" that Randall had been hired to work at Sacred Heart, he realized \"why he's been back in my dreams\"\u2014that is, emerging from the chest cavity of a surgery patient and punching Turk in the crotch. In \"[[My Self-Examination]]\u201d, he was elected president of the hospital's janitor union, beating the Janitor, who assured him that he had some hard feelings for him. This was one of several cases in which the Janitor drew the short straw in competing with Randall. For instance, Randall was incredibly strong for his size and not only was able to bring the Janitor to his knees by squeezing his hand and apparently breaking it (\"It's like a mechanical [[vise]]!\" a tormented Janitor observed), but also beat him once in a wrestling match. When the Janitor challenged him to a rematch on the roof of the hospital, Randall responded, \"You never learn, do you?\" (\"My Catalyst\u201d, Season 3).\n\nAlthough generally on good terms with J.D., Randall at least once participated in a prank the Janitor played on him. When J.D. was about to check on Randall for a fake injury he supposedly suffered when an air conditioning vent collapsed on him, Randall coughed out, \"Co-chief! Co-chief!\" as part of the Janitor's elaborate attempts to demote J.D. from his new chief resident position (\"[[My New Game]]\u201d, Season 4). Randall was also a member of the first Brain Trust and was the third member of Hibbleton, the Janitor's [[a cappella]] band. He appeared in \"[[My Finale]]\" as one of the many supporting characters whom J.D. saw as part of a final fantasy down the hallway leading toward the hospital's exit, where he said, \"Way to leave a cherry gig, brah\u201d, and pretended to punch J.D. in the crotch.\n\nBill Lawrence included a character named Randall Winston, the mayor of New York, in his previously co-created sitcom, ''[[Spin City]]''. Both characters were named after the actor who played Leonard on ''Scrubs''. The real-life Winston was the basis for the character Carter on ''Spin City'', and his friendship with Lawrence was the basis for the one shared by Turk and J.D. on ''Scrubs''.\n\n===Ted's Band (The Worthless Peons)===\n{{Further|The Blanks}}\n\n===Snoop Dogg Attending===\nRonald, aka Snoop Dogg Attending (formerly Snoop Dogg Resident and Snoop Dogg Intern), played by Manley Henry, got his nickname because of his physical resemblance to [[Snoop Dogg]]. He was seen as an intern as early as Season 1's \"[[My Super Ego]]\" but was not credited. He was first mentioned in the Season 3 episode \"[[My Porcelain God]]\" (he asked \"Where my hos at?\" to which J.D. replied, \"I haven't seen them\"). He was given the name Snoop Dogg Resident in the Season 6 episode \"[[My Fishbowl]]\". He was also seen to be an attending in the Season 5 episode \"[[My Jiggly Ball]]\u201d, as he balanced on a wheelchair with the other attending physicians to determine which of them would introduce Dr. Kelso at a conference. He later got a snake when a patient who owned a pet store gave it to him, and said, \"My hos are gonna love this.\" He was mentioned again in Season 6's \"[[My Long Goodbye]]\". It was revealed in Season 7's \"[[My Own Worst Enemy (Scrubs)|My Own Worst Enemy]]\" that he had become an attending, after J.D. incorrectly called him an intern and then a resident. In Season 6's \"[[Their Story]]\u201d, his annoyance that nobody called him by his real name, Ronald, was revealed. Like Dr. Mickhead, Colonel Doctor, and Dr. Beardfac\u00e9, Ronald was a longtime extra before being mentioned. Also revealed in \"[[My Own Worst Enemy (Scrubs)|My Own Worst Enemy]]\" was that he had feelings for a squeaky-voiced intern named Josephine. He was seen with his arm around Josephine in \"[[My Finale]]\u201d, during J.D.'s fantasy about everyone he had met at the hospital, and had a brief cameo in Season 9's \"[[Our Drunk Friend]]\".\n\n===Troy===\nTroy, played by [[Joe Rose (actor)|Joe Rose]], worked in the Sacred Heart cafeteria and was the Janitor's lackey/sidekick. He was first seen in Season 2 in \"[[Scrubs (season 2)#Episodes|My Big Mouth]]\u201d, when J.D. inadvertently insulted him while trying to make the Janitor feel better about his role in the hospital. Just like the Janitor, Troy came to hate J.D., and he and the Janitor often teamed up to intimidate and harass him. However, Troy's tendency to get overenthusiastic while messing with J.D. annoyed the Janitor, and he frequently had to remind Troy to play it cool, especially when it came to Troy's occasional homicidal urges. When J.D. embarrassed them by showing that, even on second try, they were unable to solve the riddle of what two coins could be used to make 30 cents if one of them is not a nickel (a challenge he first presented to them in \"[[My Lucky Night]]\" in Season 3), the Janitor had to interfere so that Troy would not attack J.D. with a crowbar (\"[[My D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, My D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]\u201d, Season 5). Troy also twice proposed to simply kill J.D. instead of solving the riddle (triggering the Janitor's query \"How's therapy going?\" on the second occasion). During a brief truce in \"[[My Brother, My Keeper]]\" (Season 2), the Janitor assured J.D. that a reluctant Troy would \"stop spitting in your food\". Troy was not very intelligent (to solve J.D.'s riddle, he twice proposed taking a penny and a button that he had written \"29 cents\" on), and the Janitor advised him repeatedly not to procreate. In \"[[My Moment of Un-Truth]]\" (Season 3), the Janitor used Troy as the sole guest at a fake twin birthday party in the cafeteria, a video of which was supposed to serve as \"indisputable evidence\" to Turk and J.D. that the Janitor had a twin brother called Roscoe. (The clumsiness of the whole performance was partly attributable to Troy's extremely bad acting and his following the Janitor with his eyes as the Janitor switched sides and into the role of Roscoe behind the camera.) Troy was also a member of the first brain trust and of Hibbleton, the Janitor's [[a cappella]] group.\n\n===Paul Zeltzer===\nDr. Paul Zeltzer, played by Bob Clendenin, was a skilled [[oncologist]] who made his first appearance in Season 1 in \"[[My Hero (Scrubs)|My Hero]]\". In Season 2's [[My New Old Friend]]\u201d, Dr. Cox described him as \"the finest oncologist we have on staff\". Dr. Zeltzer seemed to have unusual sexual tastes and to enjoy prostitutes: In \"[[His Story (Scrubs)|His Story]]\u201d, Dr. Cox invited him and some other doctors to his apartment for food and drinks, and Zeltzer immediately asked whether there would be prostitutes there. When Cox told him no, Zeltzer unconvincingly responded, \"Oh, uh, good.\" According to the Season 1 DVD commentary, this trait was given as part of a common practice with one-off staff members who were deemed funny enough to warrant returns: When they returned, a particular character trait was assigned to them, in this case sexual deviancy. This feature was underlined in Season 4's \"[[My Office]]\u201d, when a patient came in with a light bulb stuck in his rectum and Dr. Zeltzer commented, \"That's why my wife and I use candles.\" When Turk responded by calling him \"the most disturbing man I've ever met in my life\u201d, Zeltzer took it as a compliment and wondered whether Turk and Carla were \"open-minded\". A flashback revealed that once, when Zeltzer and his wife had Dr. Cox and Jordan over for drinks, they slipped their guests \"roofies\" ([[Rohypnol]]), a [[date rape drug]]. After Cox and then Jordan passed out, Mrs. Zeltzer announced, \"Party time!\" While Jordan was ready to \"give them another chance\" a year later, Cox angrily turned down an invite to a camping trip with Zeltzer, his wife and \"a pretty interesting guy named Ron\" (\"[[My Chopped Liver]]\u201d, Season 5). Zeltzer had a strong rivalry with Dr. Leventhal, another oncologist at the hospital, and admitted to having an affair with Leventhal's wife, apparently out of spite (\"My New Old Friend\u201d, Season 2). He appeared in \"[[My Finale]]\u201d, telling J.D.: \"Key party later. There will be prostitutes.\"\n\n===Jason Cabbagio===\nJason \"Cabbage\" Cabbagio, played by Shaughn Buchholz, first appeared in \"[[My Intern's Eyes]]\" (Season 5). He was J.D.'s favorite intern because he amused J.D. and had a \"dynamite ape impression\". After Dr. Cox forced J.D. to realize that he was letting his personal feelings for Cabbage (and his dislike of Cabbage's colleague and Elliot's booty call, Keith Dudemeister) get in the way of admitting that Cabbage was never going to be a good doctor, J.D. had to let him go. Before leaving the hospital for the final time as a doctor, Cabbage stopped to pick up a used medical glove and dropped it into a waste bin. This caused him to accidentally spread an infection to Mrs. Wilk when he stopped to thank her for being so kind to him (\"[[My Cabbage]]\"). The infection led to her death in the next episode, \"[[My Five Stages]]\". Cabbage returned in the Season 6 episode \"[[My Coffee]]\" as an employee at Coffee Bucks, the new hospital [[caf\u00e9]].\n\n===Patricia Wilk===\n[[Michael Learned]] played Patricia Wilk, a kind and genial patient who suffered from a very serious disease that caused a lengthy stay in the hospital. While there, she befriended many of the staff, especially her physicians (J.D. and Dr. Cox). Eventually, despite seemingly insurmountable odds, she recovered to the point of being released from the hospital. However, because of the last act of medical ineptitude of Jason \"Cabbage\" Cabbagio (who forgot to wash his hands after handling an infected medical glove and then shook her hand just before she left for home), she contracted an infection that forced her to return to the hospital one week after leaving. Because of her already seriously weakened immune system, the infection quickly became deadly. Despite the efforts of J.D. and Cox, she was declared terminal. She became depressed and scared of death, and J.D. and Cox went through the five stages of grief on her behalf, but they were all comforted by Doctor Hedrick (a counselor for the terminally ill). Succumbing to the infection, she lapsed into unconsciousness and died peacefully. Mrs. Wilk had a lasting effect on J.D. and could be seen in his \"parade\" out during the Season 8 finale, saying, \"Hi, Tiger.\"\n\n===Sean Kelly===\nSean Kelly, played by [[Scott Foley]], was a handsome and charismatic animal trainer who worked at [[SeaWorld]]. He quickly won over all of Elliot's close friends, with the notable exception of J.D., who was jealous of Sean throughout the course of his relationship with Elliot. Elliot and Sean's relationship had its ups and downs, with Elliot ultimately breaking up with him\u2014just as they were preparing to move in together\u2014after realizing that she still had feelings for J.D. Almost immediately, J.D. regretted breaking them up when he realized that he did not really love Elliot and had simply wanted what he could not have. J.D. told Elliot that he did not love her at Turk and Carla's wedding rehearsal in \"[[My Self-Examination]]\u201d, and in the following episode, \"[[My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs)|My Best Friend's Wedding]]\u201d, he set out to find Sean in an attempt to fix his friendship with Elliot. When J.D. found Sean sitting on the street outside his apartment, Sean was shown to have grown a massive beard in the mere four days since Elliot dumped him, much to J.D.'s amazement. He convinced Sean to come to Turk and Carla's wedding and win Elliot back. Sean did come but was unable to convince Elliot to take him back. He found some satisfaction in the fact that Elliot had had her heart broken too, and ended up leaving the wedding with J.D.'s ex-girlfriend Danni. He made an appearance in Season 8's \"[[My Cuz]]\u201d, in a relationship with [[Kim Briggs (Scrubs)|Kim Briggs]].\n\n===Sam Dorian===\nSam Dorian, played by [[John Ritter]], was J.D. and Dan's father, an unsuccessful office supplies salesman. He was the main source of income for his family, and, although he failed to get ideal wages, he still made enough for the family to get by. Sam and his wife, Barbara, got divorced when J.D. was seven years old, but he remained a part of J.D.'s adult life. He was good friends with Turk, as they both acted and sounded like \"real men\". Sam was reported to have died after having a \"massive heart attack\" in the episode \"[[My Cake]]\u201d, and Dan delivered the bad news and a double-layer fudge cake (used in the Dorian family when conveying bad news) to J.D. The episode paid homage to Ritter's real-life death. J.D. named his son, Sam, after his father. [[Zach Braff]] mentioned during the commentary on the Season One DVD that Ritter had ad-libbed his final line (a slightly embarrassed \"I pooed a little\" after soliciting J.D. to pull his finger, a running gag throughout the episode), which caused the entire cast and crew to break up laughing.\n\n===Dan Dorian===\nDaniel \"Dan\" Dorian, played by [[Tom Cavanagh]], was J.D.'s older brother, a hyper, quick-witted slacker who lived with his mother in his hometown and worked at a bar; J.D. called him \"a self-involved user\". J.D. was very uncomfortable when his brother was around, while Dr. Cox was generally disgusted by his lack of maturity and his self-serving attitude and referred to him at one point as \"the worst older brother in the world\". Dan was seemingly oblivious to Cox's disdain and often reacted to his rants in a nonchalant manner. However, Turk and Elliot genuinely liked him, the latter being somewhat attracted to him in earlier seasons. While at first, J.D. showed signs of jealousy, it was later revealed that J.D. was embarrassed by Dan, and that Dan was aware of it. He was also aware that J.D. looked up to Dr. Cox, and eventually asked Cox to promise that he would never have a reason to let J.D. down.\n\nHe had a fling with Elliot in Season 4, which J.D. discovered, to his own surprise, that he did not mind. The siblings were briefly estranged after J.D. tried being honest about Dan's wasting his potential. When J.D. made another attempt to be honest with his brother, however, Dan followed his advice and applied for a new job, made evident by the suit that J.D. gave him for his interview. As of Season 7, Dan was gainfully employed in real estate. He finally purchased his own home and gave J.D. a [[Prius]]. J.D. was angry and jealous at first at how quickly and (comparatively) easily Dan had become successful, but he eventually got over those feelings and was proud of how his brother has turned his life around. Upon meeting J.D.'s son for the first time, Dan noted that his nephew \"looks like Dad\". Dan makes a brief last appearance in \"[[My Finale]]\" as the first person J.D. imagined as he left the hospital for the last time. His final line was his apparent catchphrase to J.D.: \"Heyyy, little brother.\"\n\n===Danni Sullivan===\nDanielle \"Danni\" Sullivan, played by [[Tara Reid]], was an on-again, off-again fling of J.D.'s, similar to many of the women he dated. She was the younger sister of Dr. Cox's ex-wife, Jordan Sullivan. Like J.D., Danni maintained an internal monologue in her head. According to J.D., she had hearing \"like a bat\". She was also seen dating [[Larry Thomas (actor)|Larry Thomas]] of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' \"[[Soup Nazi]]\" fame. At Turk and Carla's wedding, she made out with both Doug and Ted in quick succession, something she apparently had a habit of doing at people's weddings. This led to a fight between the two when they were quarantined together. According to Turk, she also threw up on his grandmother before leaving the wedding in the company of Sean. She appeared for the last time in Season 4. She was mentioned in Season 9 when Jordan told Dr. Cox that a man she married had died.\n\n===Ladinia Williams===\nLadinia \"Lady\" Williams, played by [[Kit Pongetti]], was the girlfriend of the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] and became his wife in Season 8. She was so named because her parents were watching the Disney film ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' not long after she was conceived. In \"My Soul on Fire, Part 2\u201d, at Lady's and Janitor's wedding ceremony, the Brain Trust's justice of the peace (a cameo by Bill Lawrence) called her Ladinia. Pongetti had a cameo in \"My Philosophy\" as Dr. Mitchell, a research fellow with an office next to Dr. Kelso's.\n\n===Stephanie Gooch===\nStephanie Gooch, sometimes called simply \"The Gooch\u201d, was played by [[Kate Micucci]]. A local musician who played her [[ukulele]] for the hospital's patients, Stephanie became the object of Ted's affection. J.D. and the Janitor called a temporary truce to help Ted with his lack of confidence around women. Although Ted could initially be around her only in the presence of his band, he later overcame his awkwardness. The two began dating, a fact Ted enjoyed flaunting to the hospital's staff. By the end of Season 8, Ted and Stephanie had moved in together. Micucci performed several of her original songs on the show, including \"Screw You\" (a modified version of her [[Garfunkel and Oates]] duet \"Fuck You\"), which was featured in both ''Scrubs'' and the ''Scrubs: Interns'' web series. In a guest appearance in \"Something Good is Coming\u201d, a Season 2 episode of ''[[Cougar Town]]'', another series by ''Scrubs'' creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]], Ted said that Gooch had run away with [[List of Scrubs characters#Hooch|Hooch]].\n\n===Franklyn, MT===\nFranklyn, played by [[Masi Oka]], was a quiet medical technologist seen throughout the series. Because he was so calm and quiet, he was often used by the other characters. For example, when Dr. Cox destroyed Franklyn's lab in a fit of rage, Franklyn still retained his calm demeanor, despite his apparent annoyance. He may also have had a crush on Elliot, as evidenced by the fact that in one episode, Elliot was easily able to persuade him to run a lab on a patient by flirting, though he had other work. She once got him to re-check a test sample by asking him while crying.\n\n===Harvey Corman===\nHarvey Corman, played by [[Richard Kind]], was an \"admittedly frugal [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]]\" who appeared in the episodes \"[[My Female Trouble]]\u201d, \"[[My Malpractical Decision]]\u201d, \"[[My Fault (Scrubs episode)|My Fault]]\u201d, and \"[[My New Old Friend]]\". Dr. Cox tried to scare him off by offering a very painful bone marrow test, but was surprised and guilty when he found out that Mr. Corman had [[Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia]]. He apologized for not believing Mr. Corman, but Mr. Corman lectured him on not caring enough about his patients. In \"My Fault\u201d, he came to Sacred Heart for a [[Full-body CT scan|full-body scan]] in order to find every little thing wrong with him. At the end of the episode, he said of [[Harvey Korman|his name]] that it did not \"get him as much action as you may think\" after admitting to Dr. Cox, whom he severely annoyed, that he did not get the scan. In earlier episodes, he sued Turk for giving him a restraining order and won the case. He was known to serve a tennis ball with enough force to incapacitate a person.\n\n===Ed Dhandapani===\nEd \"Big Ed\" Dhandapani, played by [[Aziz Ansari]], was a lackadaisical intern who appeared in four episodes of Season 8. Extremely talented at creating fast-spreading catchphrases, Ed was well liked by many at the hospital but hated by J.D. and, later, by Dr. Cox. He stated that he used to be a DJ. Though he was exceptionally intelligent and skilled compared with the other interns, he remained content with being an average doctor and spent more time doing ridiculous activities with his friends than learning medicine. When Dr. Cox realized his laziness, he ordered Ed to spend two days studying cardiac diseases. When he failed to study, Cox fired him.\n\n===Jimmy===\nJimmy, played by [[Taran Killam]], was introduced in Season 8. He was known at Sacred Heart as \"the Overly Touchy Orderly\" because he appeared to have an extreme tactile addiction\u2014touching everyone and offering rubs, massages, or just general physical contact, regardless of whether people consented. However, J.D. stated that Jimmy successfully controlled part of his habit by touching people only above the waist. Jimmy's love for contact extended beyond people; for example, when he was forced to keep his hands to himself, he fondled a table. He was temporarily part of the Janitor's \"Brain Trust\". He was fired by Doctor Maddox, only to be reinstated when she was removed as chief of medicine. He had a talent for impersonation. He was seen in J.D's last fantasy at Sacred Heart, massaging Dr. Beardfac\u00e9.\n\n===Jill Tracy===\nJill Tracy, played by [[Nicole Sullivan]], was a recurring patient at Sacred Heart Hospital and one of the longest recurring ancillary characters on Scrubs, appearing in six episodes over five seasons (in chronological order, \"[[Scrubs (season 1)|My Nickname]]\u201d, \"[[Scrubs (season 1)|My Occurrence]]\u201d, \"[[Scrubs (season 3)|My Fifteen Seconds]]\u201d, \"[[Scrubs (season 5)|My Lunch]]\u201d, \"[[Scrubs (season 6)|My Long Goodbye]]\u201d, and \"[[Scrubs (season 8)|My Finale (Part 2)]]\"), starting early in Season 1 and finishing in the Season 8 finale as one of the people J.D. imagines seeing while exiting the hospital for the last time.\n\nJ.D. and Dr. Cox found Jill obnoxious, but she bonded with Elliot in Season 1's \"[[Scrubs (season 1)|My Occurrence]]\". She exhibited telling signs of clinical depression, but because of her cheery-obnoxious personality, doctors misdiagnosed her every time she was admitted to Sacred Heart. During her fourth appearance, in Season 5's \"[[My Lunch]]\u201d, she frequently ran into J.D. at the supermarket. Despite his best efforts to avoid her, she eventually had lunch with him and tried to tell him about her problems, but J.D. was anxious to end the encounter and failed to realize that Jill desperately needed help.\n\nLater in the episode, Jill was admitted to Sacred Heart unconscious and eventually died without regaining consciousness. Because her [[drug test|tox screen]] was positive for [[cocaine]], and because of what she said at lunch, J.D. concluded that she had died of suicide by overdose. Her organs were given to transplant patients, most of whom were almost out of time. However, the [[autopsy]] revealed that she had died of [[rabies]], and all the transplant patients consequently succumbed to the disease. Jill returned as a ghost to haunt Dr. Cox in \"[[My Long Goodbye]]\".\n\nIn her last appearance in \"[[Scrubs (season 8)|My Finale (Part 2)]]\", Jill was the fifth person J.D. saw in his farewell fantasy.\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Scrubs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters On Scrubs}}\n[[Category:Scrubs (TV series) characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of American comedy-drama television series characters|Scrubs]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Scrubs'' characters}}\nThe following is a list of characters from the [[NBC]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/nbc-sitcom-scrubs-moving-abc-wbna23398822 |title=NBC sitcom \u2018Scrubs\u2019 moving to ABC - Entertainment - Television - TODAY.com |publisher=Today.com |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2012-03-22 }}</ref> [[United States|American]] [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Character appearance summary ==\n: <small>{{Color box|#bfd|border=darkgray}} = [[Ensemble cast|Main cast]] (credited) </small>\n: <small>{{Color box|#ffdddd|border=darkgray}} = [[Recurring character|Recurring cast]] (4+)</small>\n: <small>{{Color box|#ADD8E6|border=darkgray}} = [[Guest appearance|Guest cast]] (1-3)</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"9\" class=\"unsortable\"| Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px\"| [[Scrubs (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px\"| [[Scrubs (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px\"| [[Scrubs (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px\"| [[Scrubs (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px\"| [[Scrubs (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px\"| [[Scrubs (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px%\"| [[Scrubs (season 7)|7]]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px\"| [[Scrubs (season 8)|8]]\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"75px\"| [[Scrubs (season 9)|9]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[J.D.

(Scrubs)}}\n[[Zach Braff]] portrays Dr. [[John Michael \"J.D.\" Dorian]], the show's original [[protagonist]] and narrator. J.D. begins the series as a staff [[Internship (medicine)#United States|intern]], progressing to [[Medical residency#United States|resident]] and then [[attending physician]]. His [[voice-over]] to the series comes from his internal thoughts and often features [[Surreal humor|surreal]] [[fantasy|fantasies]]. J.D. was a [[recurring character]] in Season 9, though he was still considered to be the protagonist of the episodes in which he appeared. Braff received top billing as a main cast member in each of his appearances for that season. He did not appear in the last episode of the series, titled \"Our Thanks\", and no mention was made of him.\n\nJ.D.'s name is based on that of Dr. Jonathan Doris, a college friend of series creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]]. Doris served as medical adviser to the show. \n\n===Christopher Duncan Turk===\n{{Main|Christopher Turk}}\n[[Donald Faison]] portrays [[Christopher Duncan Turk]], J.D.'s best friend, a surgical attending physician and later chief of surgery. Turk roomed with J.D. in college and medical school, and the two have an extremely close relationship, described in the Season 6 episode \"My Musical\" as \"guy love\". He is married to [[Carla Espinosa]]. J.D. claims that Turk got his middle name from his father's [[Dunkin' Donuts|love of donuts]].\n\nTurk and J.D. both attended [[The College of William and Mary]], ''Scrubs'' creator Bill Lawrence's alma mater.<ref name=\"My Perspective\">{{cite episode | title = My Perspective | episodelink = My Perspective | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = 2007-02-15 | season  = 6  | number = 09 }}</ref> They share a goofy sense of humor. For example, they both enjoy dancing \"[[Robot (dance)|the robot]]\";<ref name=\"My Hypocritical Oath\">{{cite episode | title = My Hypocritical Oath | episodelink = My Hypocritical Oath | series = Scrubs| network = NBC  | airdate = 2005-02-01\n|season  = 4  | number = 15 }}</ref> \"dramatic slow running\"; pretending to be a \"multiethnic [[Siamese twins|Siamese]] doctor\"; and pretending to be the \"world's most [[Gigantism|giant]] doctor\".\nThey own a stuffed yellow [[Labrador retriever]] named Rowdy, which they treat like a live dog. J.D. was Turk's best man<ref name=\"My Best Friend's Wedding\">{{cite episode | title = My Best Friend's Wedding | episodelink = My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs) | series = Scrubs | network = NBC  | airdate = 2004-05-04| season  = 3  | number = 22 }}</ref> and is the godfather of Carla's and his child, Izzy.\n\nDonald Faison was the only original cast member, besides [[John C. McGinley]], to return for Season 9 as a regular cast member.\n\nTurk's name is based on that of real-life physician Jon Turk, a medical consultant for ''Scrubs''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonturkmd.com/html/nb-article.html |title=Jon Turk, M.D |publisher=Jon Turk, M.D. |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\n===Perry Ulysses Cox===\n{{Main|Perry Cox}}\n[[John C. McGinley]] portrays Percival \"Perry\" Ulysses Cox, a senior attending physician at Sacred Heart, the hospital's residency director, and eventually chief of medicine in Season 8 (\"[[Scrubs (season 8)#Episodes|My Cookie Pants]]\"). J.D. considers Cox his mentor despite the fact that Cox routinely criticizes and belittles him. Cox frequently suggests that this harsh treatment is intended as conditioning for the rigors of hospital life.\n\nDr. Cox is sarcastic and bitter, with a quick, cruel wit, normally expressed through frequent and sometimes incredibly long rants in which he viciously attacks almost every character on the show. He is athletic, often found playing [[basketball]] in the hospital's parking lot with younger employees. In \"[[My Friend the Doctor]]\", he shows off by [[slam dunk|slam-dunking]] a basketball, but injures his back when he lands, a reminder that he is middle-aged. Out of vanity, he tries to disguise his injury. His parents were an absent or abusive mother and an alcoholic, abusive father, which may have sculpted his personality and poor social skills.\n\nMcGinley says in the Season 1 [[DVD]] bonus features that Dr. Cox's habit of touching his nose is a homage to [[Paul Newman]]'s character in ''[[The Sting]]'', although Cox also uses it as a sign of irritation on occasion, rather than just a sign that \"it's going to be OK\", as it was used in the film. Dr. Cox has also been compared to [[Gregory House]] (although Cox's character was created several years before House's) by Dr. Kelso, who says, \"Oh Perry, you are so edgy and cantankerous, like House without the limp.\" This is further explored in \"My House\", during which Cox acquires a temporary limp. At the end of the episode, through a series of circumstances, Dr. Cox walks into a room where the other characters are sitting and, in a very House-esque way, gives them the answers to everything they have been trying to figure out in the episode.\n\n===Elliot Reid===\n{{Main|Elliot Reid}}\n[[Sarah Chalke]] portrays [[Elliot Reid]], another intern and later private-practice physician. Her relationship with J.D. becomes romantic on several occasions, and at the start of Season 9, she is married to J.D. and seven months pregnant. Elliot is driven by a neurotic desire to prove her abilities to her family (in which all of the men are doctors), her peers, and herself. Being the byproduct of a wealthy family, Elliot was largely unprepared for the \"real world\" hostilities and socioeconomic differences among the hospital staff. Elliot has an estranged relationship with both of her parents, particularly her mother who often belittles and demeans her. Elliot has a habit of speaking in a high pitched voice when she becomes irritated or feels ignored. \n\nAt Sacred Heart, Elliot begins as an intern and later becomes a resident after a grueling yearlong internship. She serves as co-chief resident with J.D. during Season 4. At the end of that season, she briefly leaves to take an [[endocrinology]] fellowship, which ends five days later after her research partner finds the cure to [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], the disease they are researching.<ref name=\"My Rite of Passage\">{{cite episode | title = My Rite of Passage | episodelink = My Rite of Passage | series = Scrubs |network = NBC | airdate = 2006-01-03 | season = 5 | number = 2 }}</ref> After a brief spell at a [[free clinic]], she returns to Sacred Heart and becomes a senior attending physician. At the end of the episode \"[[My Coffee]]\", she accepts an offer to go into private practice, allowing her to receive double the pay, still work at Sacred Heart, and never have to deal with superiors Dr. Cox (McGinley) or Dr. Kelso (Ken Jenkins) again. In \"[[My Full Moon]]\", she ponders her future career after struggling to deliver the bad news to a patient diagnosed with [[H.I.V.]] She tells Turk that if she were lucky enough to get married and have enough money to stop working, she would \"walk out of this place and never look back\".\n\n===Carla Espinosa===\n{{Main|Carla Espinosa}}\n[[Judy Reyes]] portrays Carla Espinosa, the hospital's head nurse, who acts as a mother figure to the interns, often hiding their mistakes from their attending doctor. During the course of the series, Turk forms a relationship with Carla; eventually, they marry and start a family together. Carla does not appear in Season 9 but is mentioned a few times by Turk.\n\nCarla starts dating Turk (Faison) in the show's second episode, \"[[My Mentor]]\".  They remain together for almost the entire run of the show. Carla marries Turk in the finale of Season 3, \"[[My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs)|My Best Friend's Wedding]]\". She and Turk go through a trial separation in Season 4 after Carla discovers that Turk is still talking to his ex-girlfriend without telling her he is married, a separation that is prolonged after Carla and J.D. kiss. After couples' therapy and some frank discussions with each other and J.D., Turk and Carla reunite and immediately begin trying to conceive. Initially, they are unsuccessful, but Carla finally gets [[pregnant]] toward the end of the season after several episodes in which she and Turk worry about their respective fertility. Carla gives birth to a baby girl, whom they name Isabella, in the episode \"[[My Best Friend's Baby's Baby and My Baby's Baby]]\". J.D. becomes the godfather of the child. In \"[[My House (Scrubs)|My House]]\", she is revealed to suffer from [[postpartum depression]]. She spends most of the [[My Friend with Money|following episode]] in [[denial]] about the condition, but finally gets help after a frank discussion with Jordan Sullivan, who also suffered from the condition.\n\n===Robert Kelso===\n{{Main|Bob Kelso}}\n[[Ken Jenkins]] portrays Robert \"Bob\" Kelso, Sacred Heart's chief of medicine for most of the series. Kelso is portrayed as cold, heartless, and cruel, driven primarily by the hospital's bottom line rather than the well-being of patients. However, he is occasionally suggested to have a softer side, with his cruelty being a means of coping with years of hard decisions. Other characters have noted that he is burdened by the job. He retires in Season 7, after which his relationship with staff at the hospital improves. Toward the end of Season 8, he realizes he misses being a doctor. In Season 9, he returns to Sacred Heart as a professor.\n\nThroughout the series, he is at odds with Dr. Cox, Sacred Heart's chief attending physician, who eventually replaces him as chief of medicine. Cox calls him \"Bobbo\" or similar variations, often refers to him as a \"pod person\" or \"[[Satan|the Devil]] himself\", and even punches him in the episode \"[[My Dream Job]]\". The two occasionally share moments of understanding and compassion, however, such as when Kelso tells a [[clinical depression|depressed]] Cox that the hospital and Kelso himself need him, as they balance each other out to do what is best for the hospital. After his retirement, Kelso becomes more openly friendly with Dr Cox.\n\n===Janitor===\n{{Main|Janitor (Scrubs)}}\n[[Neil Flynn]] portrays the hospital's custodian known as \"Janitor\" through most of the series. In the last episode of Season 8, he reveals his name to J.D. as \"Glenn Matthews\", though he is referred to immediately afterward by a passerby as something else,<!-- since nobody can agree what was actually said, please do not restore a specific name --> leaving his true name ambiguous. As part of the bonus features of the complete series DVD release, Bill Lawrence confirmed that Glenn Matthews is the character's name. An incident in the pilot episode establishes an adversarial relationship between J.D. and him, which persists throughout the series. This tends to take the form of the Janitor pulling mean-spirited pranks on J.D., although he gives J.D. a pass after his father dies. The Janitor was the main antagonist of the series.\n\nIn the Season 9 premiere, Turk tells J.D. that the day after he left Sacred Heart, the Janitor asked when J.D. was returning, either oblivious to, or in denial of, J.D.'s departure, and upon coming to the realization that J.D. no longer worked at Sacred Heart, promptly walked off the job and quit. He was not seen for the remainder of the season due to Neil Flynn leaving the show to go work on his own show ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''.\n\nFlynn is an [[improvisational comedy|improv]] comedian and, as such, [[Ad libitum|ad-libs]] many of his lines. Flynn originally auditioned for the role of Dr. Cox. However, Lawrence asked Flynn if he would consider another part\u2014the mysterious custodian who makes tormenting J.D. his life's work.\n\nWhile the Janitor was intended as a running gag for only the pilot episode, series creator Lawrence stated, \"When we watched the pilot, we knew instantly we had to keep this guy around.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/about/scouts-neil-flynn.shtml |title=Last Comic Standing \u2013 About the Show \u2013 Neil Flynn: Scrubs Talent Scout, Houston |publisher=NBCUniversal Media LLC |accessdate=2013-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103053950/http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/about/scouts-neil-flynn.shtml |archivedate=2012-11-03 }}</ref>\n\n===Denise Mahoney===\n[[Eliza Coupe]] portrayed Denise \"Jo\" Mahoney, one of several new interns in [[Scrubs (season 8)|Season 8]]. Denise was extremely blunt and opinionated. She had never been able to connect strongly to her emotions, even when she was with her family. She became J.D.'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and took steps to empathize with patients.\n\nJ.D. nicknamed her Jo in \"[[My Jerks]]\", because she reminded him of \"that streetwise mannish girl\" on ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''.<ref name=\"My Jerks\">{{cite episode|title=[[My Jerks]]|series=Scrubs|credits= |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|station=ABC |airdate=January 6, 2009 |season=8 |seriesno= |number=1 |minutes= }}</ref> She was tough, insensitive, and contemptuous of any show of vulnerability or emotion.\n\nDenise said she got into medicine because she was fascinated by the \"nuts and bolts of it all\".<ref name=\"My Cookie Pants\">{{cite episode|title=[[My Cookie Pants]]|series=Scrubs|credits= |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|station=ABC |airdate=January 27, 2009 |season=8 |seriesno= |number=6 |minutes= }}</ref> She was extremely dedicated as a doctor, so much so that she spent too much time in the hospital.

In \"[[Our Role Models]]\", she said she had never known her mother.\n\n===Lucy Bennett===\n[[Kerry Bish\u00e9]] portrays Lucy Bennett, a medical student at Winston University. She serves as the new narrator for Season 9, showing a penchant for fantastical fantasies, much like J.D., while having self-esteem issues and several personality \"quirks\", similar to Elliot. She loves horses and believes \"if they could talk, they would be wise\".\n\nLucy is at first overwhelmed by life in a hospital, especially when both her chief professor, Dr. Cox, and her student advisor, [[Denise Mahoney]] ([[Eliza Coupe]]), take an immediate dislike to her. Seeking a respite, she sleeps with her classmate Cole Aaronson ([[Dave Franco]]), an arrogant rich kid who takes a naked picture of her without her knowledge and then humiliates her by letting it fall out of his backpack and into the wrong hands. At the end of the episode, she befriends J.D., who is temporarily teaching at the university; he takes her under his wing and encourages her to stand up to Dr. Cox.\n\nShe continues an affair with Cole, who she says \"[kills] her soul as he climbs into bed\" with her. Later on, she starts to accept Cole and admits to her class that she loves him. Throughout the series, she often goes out of her way to seek acceptance, baking cupcakes, sharing class notes, and trying to bond with fellow students.   When Cole wants to become a surgeon, he tears up 17 of Lucy's cuddly horses and tries to re-assemble them. Lucy holds 17 individual funerals for them that Drew has to suffer through.\n\nAs the season progresses, Lucy faces more and greater challenges in medicine and life. In \"[[Our Drunk Friend]]\", she personally raises money to send an [[alcoholic]] patient to rehab, only to have it blow up in her face when he falls off the wagon. J.D., who had initially seemed to support her, tells her that he knew the patient was a lost cause, but felt that she needed to learn how to cope with defeat.\n\n===Drew Suffin===\n[[Michael Mosley (actor)|Michael Mosley]] portrays Drew Suffin, who is a medical student at Winston University giving it a second go. He had previously been in jail and was apparently shot by a 12-year-old. He describes jail as \"cold\". He is in a relationship with Denise. He is apparently Dr. Cox's favorite student; at one point, Cox forces him to tape a \"#1\" sign to his chest, which is shortly replaced by a pink T-shirt saying \"#1\". He later stops wearing either, though Cox still shows him signs of favoritism (he even pats Drew's back, to the dismay of J.D.). Drew disappoints Dr. Cox after Cox shows him off to Turk in the series finale, \"Our Thanks\", saying that his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is the opposite of J.D. Drew then turns to Dr. Cox and asks for relationship advice. Dr. Cox replies, \"Oh dear God, Drew, not you. It's happening again.\"\n\n===Cole Aaronson===\n[[Dave Franco]] portrays Cole Aaronson, a medical student at Winston University. His family donated a large sum of money to get the new Sacred Heart Hospital built, and as such, Cole believes he is \"untouchable\" and can do whatever he wants. While spoiled, arrogant, and immature, he occasionally reveals himself to have a good heart. He is in a relationship with Lucy for a time, but after he is diagnosed with [[melanoma]], he takes his frustrations out on her, causing her to leave him. He then confides in Dr. Kelso, who gives him some much-needed advice that brings Lucy back to him. His melanoma goes into remission in the series finale, and Cole decides to become a surgeon and follow Dr. Turk. By the end of the finale, Turk gives up trying to scare Cole away and accepts him as a kind of prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n===Todd Quinlan===\nDr. Todd Quinlan (often called \"The Todd\"), played by [[Robert Maschio]], was a surgeon at Sacred Heart known for his rampant sexual [[innuendo]] and [[sexual harassment]] of females. Despite his [[Fraternities and sororities|frat-boy]] personality and his depiction as absent-minded and unintelligent, Todd is a skilled surgeon: the hospital's best surgical [[Internship (medicine)#United States|intern]] and second-best surgical [[Medical residency#United States|resident]].<ref>\"[[My Extra Mile]]\", ''Scrubs'', Season 5, Episode 15, NBC. March 21, 2006,</ref> He is Turk's friend, and even believes that he, rather than J.D., is Turk's best friend, and that Turk would choose him over Carla if confronted with that choice.{{episode|date=January 2018}} Todd's surname was not revealed until Season 5. In the Season 1 DVD commentaries, Bill Lawrence said this was deliberate.\n\nAlthough Todd is often shown speaking to women in a way that constitutes sexual harassment, in \"[[My Lucky Charm (Scrubs)|My Lucky Charm]]\", he states, \"The Todd appreciates hot regardless of gender.\" He pretends to be [[gay]] in \"[[My Lunch]]\", believing that \"chicks dig gay dudes.\"<ref name=\"My Lunch\">{{cite episode| title = My Lunch | episodelink = My Lunch | series = Scrubs| network = NBC | airdate = 2006-04-25| season = 5 | number = 20 }}</ref> In \"[[My Office (Scrubs episode)|My Office]]\", after talking with Dr. Molly Clock, he explains that his view of women originates from an unhealthy relationship with his mother with whom he once had a brief incestuous experience. However, it is revealed in \"[[My Tormented Mentor]]\" that Todd's father also influenced him to look at women as sexual objects. It was implied that Todd made such comments only to maintain an image.{{episode|date=August 2012}}  He shows sensitivity and compassion for friends and people around him, going out of his way to protect Turk and even notices that Turk is upset in \"Their Story\".{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nThroughout the series, Todd often refers to himself in the [[grammatical person|third person]] and gives a variety of [[high five]]s, hard enough that they hurt. He often devises names for these variations of high fives by taking a word or subject that references a previous comment or gesture, and adding \"five\" to it for example, \"moving-on five\" or \"something-might-be-wrong five\", normally accompanied by a sound effect. He is a member of [[the Janitor]]'s second Brain Trust, along with Ted and Doug. In \"[[My Soul on Fire|My Soul On Fire, Part 1]]\", it is revealed that Todd went to medical school [[List of medical schools in the Caribbean|in the Bahamas]] and learned the high five from his professor. In \"[[My Chief Concern]]\", he appears to be involved in a [[three-way]] sexual relationship with the Hendersons, a married couple. Although Todd maintains a steady role through much of the series, he appears only twice in \"[[My Finale]]\": When J.D. runs out of the hospital and when J.D. leaves for the final time, at which point Todd gives him a \"goodbye five from the big dog\". Todd is a recurring character in Season 9.\n\n===Ted Buckland===\nTheodore \"Ted\" Buckland, Jr., played by [[Sam Lloyd]], is Sacred Heart's [[lawyer]], credited as an unnamed \"Lawyer\" for the first season. As the hospital's \"sad sack\", he has pathetically low self-esteem and frequent [[suicide|suicidal]] tendencies. He is constantly degraded by Dr. Kelso, who slowly but surely breaks him down. It is implied that Ted has never won a case. It took him five tries to pass the bar exam because of stress-induced [[dyslexia]]; he has also stated that he took the exam in [[Alaska]], where it was much easier to pass. Ted attended [[Ithaca College]] and was the best attorney to have graduated from [[South Texas College of Law]].<ref>''Scrubs'' Season 5, Episode 17 \"My Chopped Liver\"</ref> A conversation with the Janitor in Season 3 indicates that Ted can speak Korean.<ref>''Scrubs'' Season 3, Episode 15 \"My Tormented Mentor\"</ref>\n\nSo intense is Ted's hatred for Kelso that he regularly has homicidal thoughts about him, and Kelso is well aware of these thoughts, which adds to their tensions. On many occasions, Ted has considered suicide, even going so far as to stand on the edge of the hospital roof and try to coax himself into jumping. Ted claims that he had a wife and children, but they left him because of the stress of his job. \n\nHe has an [[Oedipus complex]] regarding his mother, with whom he lives. He sleeps in the same bed as her and has remarked that she has installed a camera in the bathroom to check up on him when he  bathes. In one episode it is suggested that Ted\u2019s mother believes he is a doctor, as he is shown coming home in stolen scrubs, claiming to have saved a patient\u2019s life. Ted leads an [[a cappella]] group with three other non-medical hospital employees he calls his \"Worthless Peons\" (played by [[The Blanks (band)|The Blanks]], the real-life band of Sam Lloyd), and is shown to be uncharacteristically confident when surrounded by his bandmates. He also participates in [[biking]] and [[triathlon]]s, often training with Doug Murphy. For one episode, he joins the Brain Trust with the Janitor, Todd, and Doug. He eventually becomes best friends with Keith Dudemeister. With the help of the Janitor and J.D., he finds the courage to ask Stephanie Gooch ([[Kate Micucci]]), a [[ukulele]]-playing musician who performs for the hospital's patients, on a date, and the two form a relationship and move in together. \n\nTed has made three appearances outside of the ''Scrubs'' universe in ''[[Cougar Town]]''. In the [[Cougar Town (season 2)#ep45/46|Season 2 finale]], written and directed by [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]], he visits the main cast in [[Hawaii]] and says that Gooch has run off with an unseen \"Dr. Hooch\". Ted and his band reappear in Season 3 of [[Cougar Town]], where they audition to play at [[Disney World]]. In the episode \"A One Story Town\", Ted panics when he notices that everyone he meets resembles people he used to work with, including Jules' father, played by [[Ken Jenkins]]\u2014as well as [[Zach Braff]], [[Sarah Chalke]], [[Christa Miller]], and [[Robert Maschio]]\u2014all as characters who resemble Kelso, J.D., Elliot, Jordan, and Todd, respectively.\n\n===Laverne Roberts===\nLaverne Roberts, played by [[Aloma Wright]], was a nurse at Sacred Heart. In her free time, Laverne enjoyed [[soap opera]]s and office [[gossip]]. She was a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and had strong opinions on premarital sex, abortion, and other actions. It was later revealed that she maintained much of her religious devotion as a way to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with seeing suffering and death in the hospital every day. Laverne was one of the few staff members who could intimidate imposing employees such as Dr. Cox, the Janitor, Dr. Kelso, and Carla, with whom she was especially close. Laverne had a husband named Lester, a son, and a nephew (Lance) who fought in the [[Iraq War]]. She and Lester were shown to have marital problems, and her attempts to fix them were unsuccessful.\n\nWhile driving to the hospital one morning, Laverne was involved in a car accident, fell into a [[coma]], and was put on life support. Her family decided to take her off after learning that she was [[Brain death|brain dead]]. Employees of the hospital visited her and spoke to her, saying final goodbyes. Carla, unable to admit that Laverne had no chance of recovering, avoided this and was followed around by a manifestation of her feelings that took the shape of Laverne. The manifestation disappeared once Carla finally said goodbye to Laverne, and Laverne died almost immediately afterward. Her character made a brief appearance in a flashback in \"My Comedy Show\" and in the Season 8 finale, in J.D.'s last fantasy.\n\nAfter ''Scrubs'' was renewed for a seventh season, creator Bill Lawrence promised Aloma Wright another role, because he had killed off Laverne under the impression that the show was in its final season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2007/biz/markets-festivals/scrubs-resuscitates-wright-s-role-1117966985/|title=\u2018Scrubs\u2019 resuscitates Wright\u2019s role|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=2007-06-15|work=Variety|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303044246/https://variety.com/2007/biz/markets-festivals/scrubs-resuscitates-wright-s-role-1117966985/|archivedate=2017-03-03}}</ref> Wright played a new character similar to Laverne, but only J.D. could see the similarities.

J.D. was able to see the physical similarities between Laverne and Nurse Shirley, and gave her the nickname \"Laverneagain\", which she hated.<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Identity Crisis |episodelink=My Identity Crisis |series=Scrubs|credits= |network=NBC |station= |airdate=2007-11-15 |season=7 |number=4 |minutes= }}</ref> After joining the staff of Sacred Heart at the beginning of [[List of Scrubs episodes#Season 7: 2007-2008|Season 7]], she apparently developed a close friendship with the Janitor.\n\n===Jordan Sullivan===\nJordan Sullivan, played by [[Christa Miller]] (the real-life spouse of series creator Bill Lawrence<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/dirt/real-estalker/bill-lawrence-christa-miller-manhattan-condo-1202748494/|title=Bill Lawrence and Christa Miller Pick Up Brand New Condo in Manhattan Office Building Conversion|last=David|first=Mark|last2=David|first2=Mark|date=2018-04-09|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>), was the ex-wife of Perry Cox and a member (later retired) of the Sacred Heart Board of Directors. She first appeared in \"My Bad\" (Season 1) as J.D.'s patient, and he wound up having sex with her before finding out she was Dr. Cox's ex-wife.\n\nJordan's father, Quinn Sullivan, was on the Board of Directors, and she inherited the position after his death. She was the sister of the deceased Ben Sullivan (who was a close friend of Dr. Cox) and Danni Sullivan (an ex-girlfriend of J.D., leading Ben to tease J.D. in \"[[My Screw Up]]\", \"You know something? You have slept with both of my sisters\"). After her divorce from Dr. Cox, they maintained a strictly sexual relationship, and they both continued to have feelings for each other and got back together shortly before the birth (in Season 2's \"My Karma\") of their son, Jack. However, Jordan did not tell Dr. Cox that he was the child's father for several episodes, because she wanted to make sure he truly wanted to be with her. Though Dr. Cox and Jordan had been shown to bicker, Dr. Cox remarked that Jordan now refused to argue with him because she did not want Jack to be emotionally scarred.<ref name=\"MySelfExam\">{{cite episode| title = My Self-Examination | episodelink = My Self-Examination | series = Scrubs| network = NBC | airdate = 2004-04-27| season = 3 | number = 21 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Jordan and Dr. Cox found out that their divorce papers had not been signed correctly and that they were still legally married, their relationship became strained. Deciding that marriage was ruining their relationship, they got a legal divorce. Later, they had a daughter, Jennifer Dylan (named by J.D., after his initials). In Season 8, both Jordan and Dr. Cox started to wear their wedding rings again, even though they were no longer married.\n\nJordan was portrayed as [[sarcastic]], vindictive, and cold; she blamed this on her parents, but later admitted to Elliot that her parents had been supportive and were not the cause of her behavior.<ref name=\"TheirStory\">{{cite episode| title = Their Story | episodelink = Their Story | series = Scrubs| | network = NBC | airdate = 2007-04-19| season = 6 | number = 17 }}</ref> Though never seen on screen, her mother was referenced in three episodes, including one that revealed Dr. Cox's nickname for her, \"Evil Dogface\". Jordan is occasionally portrayed to struggle with being middle aged. E. g. she primarily targets men in their twenties for her one night stands, partly as a self-test to find out whether she is still sexually attractive to a younger age group and she has admitted freely that she did and further plans to undergo cosmetic surgery (e. g. referring to her breasts as \"fity percent real\"). The Janitor strongly implied in \"[[My Life in Four Cameras]]\" that Jordan had [[bipolar disorder]].\n\nDespite her cruelty, Jordan showed loyalty toward friends and sometimes tried to fix her wrongdoings. She eventually developed a tolerance and almost fondness for Elliot, which seemed to stem from the fact that they were both able to manipulate their boyfriends and that they were both \"nervous pooers\". When Elliot was dating Keith, they double-dated with Jordan and Cox a couple of times. In later episodes, Jordan was easily annoyed by Elliot, and in \"[[Their Story]]\", she purposely tried to cause tension between Elliot and Keith. However, she managed to fix the damage at the end of the episode. In later seasons, Jordan formed a friendship with Carla. In \"[[My Finale]]\", she kissed J.D. on the cheek (noting, \"We did it once\") and told him to \"take care\". Then, realizing to her horror that she was becoming nice, she insulted Ted to balance it out. During J.D.'s vision of the future, she, Dr. Cox, and their family spent Christmas with J.D., Elliot, Turk, and Carla.\n\n===Doug Murphy===\nDr. Doug Murphy, played by [[Johnny Kastl]], was a [[pathologist]] at Sacred Heart, formerly a doctor of internal medicine. Doug was an incompetent nervous wreck who often accidentally killed patients assigned to him, and even had causes of deaths named after him. He even said in the season 4 episode \"My First Kill\" his first kill was 40 minutes into his first day. Because of his anxiety, he was nicknamed \"nervous guy\" and \"pee pants\" by Dr. Cox, who, along with Dr. Kelso, degraded him constantly. Despite his lack of medical skills and having to repeat his third year of residency, Doug eventually became a licensed physician. However, he began to doubt himself and came to the conclusion that he should not be a doctor. While on a trip to the [[morgue]], he realized that because of the number of deaths he had been responsible for, he was able to identify the cause of death of several people. He became an expert [[coroner]] but still made several mistakes, such as forgetting a [[gurney]], misplacing a dead body, or failing to retrieve a patient before ''[[rigor mortis]]'' set in. He also mentioned in \"[[List of Scrubs episodes|My Way Home]]\" that he hated dead people: J.D. tried to sneak out of the hospital in a [[body bag]], and when he sat up, Doug believed he was a zombie, panicked, and hit him repeatedly with a [[fire extinguisher]], saying, \"Dead people should be dead!\"\n\nDoug was often seen sucking on [[lollipop]]s (an homage to the original [[Kojak]]), as were other coroners at Sacred Heart. At the baby shower for Carla and Turk's child, Doug and some other coroners were shown eating and trading lollipops. Doug and Ted often hung out with each other, and were revealed to bike and compete in triathlons together, as well. Doug, Ted, and Todd were all members of the Janitor's second Brain Trust, but Doug was temporarily replaced with Lloyd. Doug revealed that, after putting toe tags on [[cadaver]]s for so long, he had developed a [[Foot fetishism|foot fetish]], and he was later found hiding under a reception desk because he \"got tired of looking at dead ones' feet\".\n\n===Keith Dudemeister===\nKeith Dudemeister, played by [[Travis Schuldt]], was a medical resident at Sacred Heart. The episode \"[[My Intern's Eyes]]\" was shown through (but not narrated from) Keith's point of view. Keith was introduced as a timid intern who became very popular amongst his fellow interns and some senior staff. J.D. took Keith under his wing and taught him the ropes. Despite all this, J.D. grew to irrationally dislike Keith, who quickly began to excel in his hospital duties, and furthermore because Keith was a \"booty call\" that progressed into a relationship with Elliot. However, J.D. soon decided that he would like Keith because Elliot did, and admitted that Keith had genuine skills as a doctor, with the two becoming good friends soon after. J.D. also admitted in [[My Road to Nowhere|one episode]] that, had Elliot never worked at the hospital, he and Keith would probably have immediately become best friends. Despite J.D.'s dislike of Keith, the two have a great deal in common\u2014which may explain Elliot's interest in him. Elliot, who spoke fluent [[German (language)|German]], informed J.D. that Keith's last name meant \"master of dudes\" in German. Keith and Ted would eventually become best friends. In \"[[His Story IV]]\", Keith revealed himself to be a Republican, which strengthened his relationship with Elliot, as she was also one. Eventually, Keith moved in with Elliot and she confessed that she loved him. Keith later proposed to her, and they quickly began to plan a wedding.<ref name=\"MyColdShower\">{{cite episode| title = My Cold Shower | episodelink = My Cold Shower | series = Scrubs| network = NBC | airdate = 2007-05-10| season = 6 | number = 19 }}</ref> Elliot, doubting her love for Keith, had second thoughts and cold feet, responding by nearly cheating on Keith with J.D. Elliot decided to break off the engagement. Their relationship became very strained, with Keith insulting Elliot whenever he saw her. While he eventually acted professionally at work with her, he alternated between anger and depression outside of the workplace. Elliot made jokes about her leaving him, but Ted informed her that Keith was still hurt and pretended to be over it only when she was around. Elliot finally realized his feelings in \"[[My Jerks]]\" and sincerely apologized for hurting him. Keith responded by saying he had really needed to hear that. He appeared again in \"[[My Finale]]\" in J.D.'s final daydream of all the people he had met at Sacred Heart.\n\n==Minor characters==\n=== Dr. Phillip Wen===\nDr. Wen, played by [[Charles Chun]], was an attending surgeon who mentored Turk and the Todd for their first three years at the hospital. He tended to be very serious and business-like, and was one of very few characters not treated comically (although a couple of attempts were made, such as when he and Turk argued over what song to play during a surgery and when he pushed Turk to help him beat Dr. Cox and J.D. at wheelchair racing). Dr. Wen was more dispassionate and modest than most surgeons, but he did have an egotistic, competitive side; he competed against Dr. Cox in a wheelchair race between the medical and surgical branches.<ref name=\"MyWayHighway\">{{cite episode| title = My Way or the Highway | episodelink = My Way or the Highway (Scrubs) | series = Scrubs| network = NBC | airdate = 2002-04-16| season = 1 | number = 20 }}</ref> He was one of the few characters to refer to Turk by his first name, Christopher. Little is known about Wen's personal life other than that he was married, and that his wife once broke her legs in a car accident. Although his full position at the hospital is unknown, he was chief of surgery until he passed the title to Turk. He was inordinately fond of the song \"[[A Little Respect]]\" by [[Erasure]].<ref name=\"BestFriendMistake\">{{cite episode| title = My Best Friend's Mistake | episodelink = My Best Friend's Mistake | series = Scrubs|network = NBC | airdate = 2001-10-09| season = 1 | number = 3 }}</ref>\n\nDr. Wen was not featured on the show after Season 6, but in Season 8, his name was seen on Dr. Cox's \"Sometimes Allowed\" list,<ref name=\"NewRole\">{{cite episode| title = My New Role | episodelink = My New Role | series = Scrubs| network = ABC | airdate = 2009-02-03| season = 7 | number = 157 }}</ref> and he was parodied in the annual interns' sketch show. J.D. commented that the Dr. Wen sketch was not working, referring to Dr. Wen's lack of comedic flair. When Carla became a surgical nurse, revealing things about Turk in surgery, Dr. Wen was seen laughing with the Todd under his mask. He made an appearance in the series finale.<ref name=\"ComedyShow\">{{cite episode| title = My Comedy Show | episodelink = My Comedy Show | series = Scrubs| network = ABC | airdate = 2009-02-10| season = 8 | number = 160 }}</ref> The character has the same name as a former writing partner of series writer Bill Callahan; the two previously wrote for ''[[Spin City]]'', which was co-created by ''Scrubs'' creator Bill Lawrence. Callahan and Wen parted ways in 2003 while working on ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'', a year before Callahan joined the show's writing staff. In \"[[My Catalyst]]\", his nametag said '''Phillip Wen'''.\n\n===Ben Sullivan===\nBenjamin \"Ben\" Sullivan, played by [[Brendan Fraser]], was a carpenter and photographer who was Jordan's and Danni's older brother and Cox's brother-in-law and best friend. Unlike his sisters, Ben was easygoing and friendly with a good sense of humor. He was an expert at identifying actresses who had appeared naked in movies (a trait that allowed him to become quick friends with J.D., who had a similar skill), and was described by Jordan as \"clumsy\", which caused many accidents during his carpentry jobs. Ben was diagnosed with [[leukemia]], which initially caused a strain on his friendship with Cox (because Cox was unable to handle the fact that Ben had only a 30% chance of survival), but J.D. convinced Cox to be there for Ben. Ben eventually went into remission. He then traveled on the \"World Leukemia Tour\" for two years and returned only in time for his nephew Jack's birthday in \"[[My Screw Up]]\". Cox, despite being displeased with Ben for not seeing a single \"doctor, medicine man, or 'scary shaman with saucers in his ears{{'\"}} during his extended trip, was nonetheless delighted to see him again, and left Ben in J.D.'s care while Cox made arrangements for Jack's birthday party. Ben went into cardiac arrest and died 20 minutes after Cox left the hospital. Cox took his death very hard, initially blaming J.D. and sending him home, but Ben's ghost (a figment of Cox's imagination) reminded him that it was not J.D.'s fault, and Cox later apologized. Everyone at the hospital was saddened by Ben's death, and many senior staff members attended his funeral two days later. Finally, Cox acknowledged Ben's death and his ghost dissipated. Cox sat with Jordan and J.D. in the front row at the funeral and cried.\n\n=== Lonnie ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Scrubs (TV series)]] -->\nLonnie, (played by [[Michael Hobert]]), first seen in \"[[His Story II]]\", began working at Sacred Heart as one of J.D.'s interns in Season 3. While trying to impress a date, J.D. stole Lonnie's scrubs and told his date that Lonnie was his \"slave\". In Season 4, Lonnie became a second-year resident and was taught by co-chief residents Elliot and J.D. He continued his residency in Season 5, supervised by Dr. Cox. He was part of the Triple Giant Doctor in \"[[My Ocardial Infarction]]\". He had three children \"that he knew of\", all daughters; he could grow a [[moustache]] in one day; and he played [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] basketball for [[Villanova University]], where he was All-Conference. During Season 4, J.D. strongly disliked him because of his outgoing nature, but perhaps more so because, unlike most of the other interns, Lonnie did not appear to fear J.D. He briefly appeared in Season 6. Michael Hobert, who played him, also appeared as an extra in [[My First Day|the pilot episode]], as a patient getting an [[MRI]] scan near the end of the episode. In the Season 8 finale, \"[[My Finale]]\", Lonnie was shown one last time. His last words were, \"I hate you so much, J.D.\"\n\n===Lloyd===\nLloyd, the Delivery Guy (played by writer [[Mike Schwartz]])\u2014whose last name may be Slawski, his father's surname<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Identity Crisis |episodelink=My Identity Crisis |series=Scrubs|airdate=2007-11-15 |season=7 |number=4}}</ref>\u2014was a member of the air band Cool Cats with Turk, Ted, and the Janitor, where he played air drums. He had been in rehab for drug use but relapsed (though he did not use needles, and carried a straw). He admitted to J.D. that he once received a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] for [[crack cocaine]]. In an early episode, he was a patient at the hospital after getting his penis stuck in a flashlight. He was also seen in a musical number after getting feces thrown in his eye by a homeless person. It was revealed that he was the son of \"Colonel Doctor\" when J.D. was taped to the ceiling in the episode \"[[My Perspective]]\".\n\nLloyd was also an avid fan of [[speed metal]], which he aggressively blasted while driving his truck. This was introduced in Season 6's \"[[My Therapeutic Month]]\", when J.D. asked Lloyd for a ride and Lloyd introduced him to the metal band [[Devildriver]], specifically their songs \"The Devil's Son\" and \"Driving Down the Darkness\". In \"[[My No Good Reason]]\", Dr. Cox used Lloyd as part of a plan to get Nurse [[Laverne Roberts]] to admit that bad things sometimes happen for no reason, but she saw through the plan (\"That's not her father; that's a delivery guy in a sweater\"). In \"[[My Long Goodbye]]\", J.D. sent a text message to Lloyd to go pick up Dr. Cox's son, Jack, from daycare because J.D. had not listened to Dr. Cox when he asked him to do it. Lloyd proceeded to blast speed metal from his radio with Jack in the car, lip-syncing to \"Driving Down the Darkness\" while Jack air drummed.\n\nLloyd was once referred to as the loneliest person in the hospital. In the Season 1 episode \"My Old Lady\", Lloyd was in one of J.D.'s fantasies, dumping a ton of bricks on J.D.'s head. He delivered syringes and installed Elliot's stripper pole in the episode \"[[Their Story]]\", and it was revealed in \"[[My Turf War]]\" that he was a [[hypochondriac]]. In the Season 6 finale, Lloyd was part of the Janitor's Brain Trust, replacing an upset Doug. However, he was fired from the group after his tryout. \n\nIn one of his early appearances, when making fun of Carla, his nametag said Frank. Lloyd's uniform consisted of blue shorts and a blue shirt. It was revealed in \"[[My Identity Crisis]]\" that his father's name was Coleman Slawski (Colonel Doctor), and so he was probably Lloyd Slawski. According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20180224010731/http://www.rateyourdoc.org/ RateYourDoc.org], Lloyd became an ambulance driver for Sacred Heart after cleaning up. In Season 8's \"[[My Soul on Fire]] Part 1\", the Janitor announced to the Brain Trust that Lloyd had died while snorkeling in his father's pool. This turned out to be false when Lloyd entered the room and said that he had faked his own death.\n\n===Kim Briggs===\nKimberly \"Kim\" Briggs, played by [[Elizabeth Banks]], was a former [[urology|urologist]] at Sacred Heart and the mother of J.D.'s child, Sam Perry Gilligan Dorian. Kim had been working in the hospital on J.D.'s first day (the pilot episode) and attended Ben's funeral in \"[[My Screw Up]]\". However, J.D. did not notice her because of her [[wedding ring]] (married women were \"invisible\" to J.D.). Elliot later remarked that Kim was actually divorced and wore the ring only to avoid unwanted advances from other doctors. J.D. and Kim started dating, and she revealed in \"[[My Transition]]\" that she was pregnant. Ironically, the two had not actually had sex because they did not want to risk pregnancy; instead, their child was accidentally conceived via [[premature ejaculation]] during [[non-penetrative sex]]. The two vacillated on whether to have an abortion, but decided to have the baby after Turk and Carla's daughter was born. In \"[[My House (Scrubs)|My House]]\", Kim accepted a position at a hospital in [[Tacoma, Washington]], but said she would return in about four months. J.D. decided to make a surprise visit in \"[[My Road to Nowhere]]\" in order to see her first [[ultrasound]], but when he got there, she told him she had [[Miscarriage|miscarried]]. In light of this news, the two had a long conversation about their relationship and ultimately decided to end it. At the end of the episode, however, Kim was seen during her ultrasound, having lied to J.D. so he would not feel he had to stay with her.\n\nIn \"[[My Conventional Wisdom]]\", Turk and J.D. went to a medical convention in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Coincidentally, Kim was speaking at the convention, and was visibly still pregnant. After J.D. confronted her, she pleaded with him to discuss their problems, but he was too angry and left, overwhelmed. She followed him back to Sacred Heart and confronted him. J.D. decided to listen to his [[conscience]] in \"[[My Rabbit]]\" and support Kim, solely for the sake of their son. However, their relationship soon reignited, and they became a couple again. J.D. avoided telling Kim he loved her, still contemplating whether they were right for each other. When Kim went into [[childbirth|labor]] in \"[[My Hard Labor]]\", she demanded to know what he really thought of their relationship. J.D. ultimately told her the truth\u2014that he did not really love her anymore\u2014and she was furious and ended the relationship. After the birth, however, they agreed to remain friends for the sake of their child. She moved away afterward with Sam, but J.D. still saw him often. In \"[[My Cuz]]\", Kim was revealed to be dating [[#Sean Kelly|Sean Kelly]], Elliot's ex-boyfriend; Elliot had introduced them after Kim and J.D.'s breakup. In \"[[My Chief Concern]]\", Kim was present when J.D. got a job at her hospital.\n\n===Seymour Beardfac\u00e9===\nDr. Seymour \"Beard Face\" Beardfac\u00e9, played by Geoff Stevenson, was a doctor with a thick and bushy beard, which inspired everyone to refer to him as \"Beard Face\" rather than the correct pronunciation, {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|b|\u026a\u0259r|d|_|f|\u00e6|\u02c8|s|e\u026a}}. This angered him and prompted the repeated line, \"It's Beardfac\u00e9, damn it.\" He was first seen in the Season 2 episode \"[[My Case Study]]\". Beardfac\u00e9 was the fastest appendectomist at Sacred Heart until Turk took the title, a moment Turk considered one of his greatest. In ''Scrubs: Interns'', it was revealed that Beardfac\u00e9 was going through a \"gender identity crisis\", inviting Howie to dinner and stealing sports bras. He was seen talking to an intern in Season 9's \"Our First Day of School\", but was only in the background and had no lines.\n\n===Kevin Casey===\nDr. Kevin Casey, played by [[Michael J. Fox]], was a doctor at a different hospital who was a close associate of Dr. Cox. He was a brilliant doctor who specialized in both internal medicine and surgery. Dr. Casey suffered from [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] to an extreme degree: He washed his hands hours after his last surgery, avoided lengthy physical contact, and drove home to use his own restroom. Although his condition harmed his personal life, he saw it as the key to his career success. Stating that medicine is all about obsession, he read and studied medical texts repeatedly and hypothesized every possible scenario that could befall a patient; he was essentially unflappable and enjoyed overall confidence. His medical and surgical skills were superior to Dr. Cox's and Turk's. He also appeared to have a photographic memory and was able to cite information from thousands of pages of medical textbooks.\n\n===Coleman Slawski===\nDr. Coleman \"Colonel Doctor\" Slawski, played by Bob Bencomo, was a doctor whose name nobody seemed to know. He was seen as early as Season 1's \"[[My Super Ego]]\", but his nickname (stemming from his striking resemblance to [[Colonel Sanders]]) was not introduced until Season 5's \"[[My Jiggly Ball]]\", when he laughed at a joke Dr. Kelso had made and Kelso said, \"Thank you, Colonel Doctor!\" To Slawski's \"Excuse me?\" Kelso replied: \"I'm sorry. I don't know your name, and you look like that Kentucky Fried Chicken guy.\" The Janitor watched surveillance footage of Slawski using the bathroom so he could \"freak him out\" by guessing how many times he had gone during a given day. Like Dr. Mickhead, he was around since the show began but was originally supposed to be an extra. He was shown to be the father of Lloyd the Delivery Guy when J.D. was taped to the ceiling in the Season 6 episode \"[[My Perspective]]\". His real name was revealed in Season 7's \"[[My Identity Crisis]]\". His name (Coleman Slawski) was a play on the word coleslaw. He was seen in the background of many Season 9 episodes.\n\n===Hooch===\nDr. Hooch, played by [[Phill Lewis]], was an [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]] whom Turk and J.D. enjoyed antagonizing. When he was introduced, he was an easygoing guy, but because of a combination of people accidentally calling his name and J.D. and Turk pulling pranks, he gradually became angrier and eventually snapped. Hooch became very aggressive; he once knocked a man out with his shoe for trying to exit an elevator he was guarding for J.D. Earlier in the same episode, when J.D. and Turk put [[bouillon cube]]s in his shower head, he rushed out of the shower room and threatened everyone in the area: \"If it happens again, I will wait in my [[SUV]]\u2014blast me some [[speed metal]], 5.1 [[surround sound]], heavy on the bass\u2014and someone will be getting mowed down.\") Upon learning that Turk was the culprit, he threatened to take one of Turk's fingers as his own \"funny prank\". In response to Hooch's extreme behavior, J.D. and Turk habitually said \"Hooch is crazy\" in a nonchalant tone. They paired him with another doctor, Dr. Paul Turner (played by [[Jim Hanks]], brother of [[Tom Hanks]], who played the titular Turner in the movie ''[[Turner & Hooch]]''), in one episode to create what J.D. described as \"a super medical crime-fighting team\", Turner and Hooch. Despite resenting J.D. and Turk for the manipulation, Turner and Hooch formed a good team and were near tears when they were forced to split. Hooch briefly replaced Turk as J.D.'s best friend and was given the nickname Chocolate Bear Two.\n\nIn \"[[My Growing Pains]]\", Hooch was fired for being involved in a hostage situation. This was presumably because Rex and three other interns had followed him around all day, again as a prank by J.D. and Turk. In \"[[My New Role]]\" in Season 8, he appeared on the \"Never Ever, Ever, Ever, Ever, Ever Allowed in Dr. Cox's Office\" list along with J.D. and Jordan, despite the fact that he had been fired. (Jordan was no longer working at Sacred Heart at that point, either.) He was seen in the [[My Finale|Season 8 finale]] in a straitjacket, saying, \"Hooch ''is'' crazy.\"\n\nIn the Season 2 finale of ''[[Cougar Town]]'', [[Ted Buckland]] revealed that, since the end of ''Scrubs'', Hooch had run away with Ted's former girlfriend, [[Stephanie Gooch]].\n\n===Leonard===\nLeonard, played by producer Randall Winston, was the hospital's security guard, easily recognizable thanks to his height, giant afro and the hook he had in place of his right hand. He was first seen in J.D.'s fantasy of denial in Season 1's \"[[My Occurrence]]\", still having his right hand. One of the show's many running jokes (first made in Season 3's \"[[My Screw Up]]\") was that whenever he was mentioned, he was called the \"big black security guard with the hook for the hand\", but everyone knew him by his giant afro. When his relationship with second-year resident Gloria was revealed in Season 5's \"[[My Lunch]]\", she stated that she was \"never going back\", and Leonard told everyone that he loved \"white meat\". He did not allow bouncing basketballs in the hallways and confiscated (and popped) Turk's, because of J.D., on more than one occasion. Leonard lost his hand after it got caught in an ice machine (sometime between episodes 1.22 and 3.14), and he received a $5,000,000 settlement from the hospital. He might have been bisexual, for in Season 5's \"[[My Chopped Liver]]\", when Dr. Cox was pretending to mentor the interns, Gloria said that her boyfriend was bi-curious and wanted her to pick his lovers. This would only prove to be true, though, if Gloria and Leonard were already dating at that point. He appeared in the finale alongside Gloria, where he said, \"Got me some white meat.\" Gloria was later seen pregnant with Leonard's twin children.\n\n===Walter Mickhead===\nDr. Walter Mickhead, played by Frank Encarnacao, made his first appearance in Season 2's \"[[My Overkill]]\". He was originally known as \"black-haired doctor\". He was one of a handful of characters who started out as extras for the show (Dr. Kelso addressed him as a pediatrician, Dr. Carlson, in \"[[My Case Study]]\" in Season 2). His real name was first mentioned in Season 3's \"[[My White Whale]]\u201d, when J.D. told Turk, \"The girl one just called you Dr. Jerk!\" and Turk replied: \"No sweat. You should hear what [the interns] call Dr. Mickhead.\" In \"[[My Porcelain God]]\u201d, J.D. mentioned that Dr. Kevin Casey had helped Mickhead overcome his addiction to huffing paint. In \"[[My Quarantine]]\" in Season 4, he turned out to be one of many hospital staff members who had slept with Jordan during her separation from Dr. Cox. When Dr. Cox thanks whoever taught her the \"[[Reverse amazon|reverse cowgirl]]\" position, both J.D. and Dr. Mickhead reply, \"You're welcome\".\n\nIn Season 5's \"[[Her Story II]]\u201d, it was revealed that his wife was recently murdered and that Mickhead was a \"person of interest\" in the investigation. He did not do much to rebut the suspicion that he was involved in his wife's death, first practically making out with a nurse in the hospital a few days after the event, then asking J.D.'s girlfriend Julie to hide a hammer (supposedly the murder weapon) for him in her basement, a maneuver J.D. stopped at the last second. Later in the episode, Mickhead was seized by two policemen, protesting his innocence and fighting the arrest. In Season 5's \"[[My Cabbage]]\u201d, he gave out \"cool\" orange prison jumpsuits to people at the hospital after his release. Dr. Cox remarked in Season 6, in \"[[My Conventional Wisdom]]\u201d, that Mickhead had just barely beaten the rap.\n\nIn Season 6's \"[[His Story IV]]\u201d, he identified himself as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Also in Season 6, it was revealed that he was a surgeon. In \"[[My Saving Grace]]\" (Season 8), short-time chief of medicine Dr. Maddox admitted that she had had a sexual relationship with Mickhead, complaining that he had to choke her to keep an erection, to which Mickhead replied, \"I have needs.\" He was seen in \"[[My Finale]]\u201d, when J.D. imagined everyone he had met at the hospital, and simply said, \"I didn't kill her.\"\n\n===Molly Clock===\nDr. Molly Clock, played by [[Heather Graham]], was an attending psychiatrist at Sacred Heart who first appeared in the Season 4 episode \"[[My Old Friend's New Friend]]\". Turk said that Dr. Clock was the second hottest employee at Sacred Heart (after Nurse Tisdale) and that he would kill to have sex with her; however, he also disapproved of her profession and sometimes referred to her as a \"devil woman\". Dr. Clock was perky and extremely optimistic, expressing great joy over the fact that the hospital cafeteria was serving [[kielbasa]] and arguing that all people were innately good-natured. She was excellent at her job, very intelligent and self-confident, and as a result, she became the mentor and role model that Elliot had always wanted (along with Carla). She had an uncanny ability to single out a person's deepest insecurity, once reducing Elliot to tears with the word \"eyebrows\". She also showed a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for men who had mental health problems (like J.D.). Dr. Clock was one of the few people in the hospital who were completely impervious to Dr. Cox's sarcastic barbs. She used the time in which he was ranting to compose flippant replies, which annoyed him to no end.\n\nIn Season 4's \"[[My Last Chance (Scrubs)|My Last Chance]]\u201d, Dr. Clock announced her plan to accept a position at a Milwaukee hospital and made out with J.D. at her farewell party. She agreed to sleep with J.D., but only if Elliot gave him permission. She ended up leaving without anything happening between the two of them after Elliot gave J.D. a note that he believed gave him permission to sleep with Dr. Clock, but actually said, \"Now we're even.\" She was last seen in Season 4's \"[[My Best Laid Plans]]\u201d, when she returned to Sacred Heart and ended up at a bar with J.D., willing to go all the way\u2014but J.D. decided not to. The name Molly Clock was an homage to one of the medical consultants on the show, Dr. Dolly Klock.\n\n===Randall Winston===\nRandall Winston, played by [[Martin Klebba]], was a [[Dwarfism|little person]] who worked in the janitorial branch of Sacred Heart. He had a very likable demeanor and addressed people as \"Bro\" or \"Brah\". The character was named for one of the show's producers, Randall Winston (who played Leonard, the security guard with a hook for a hand). Randall's first two appearances took place in J.D.'s daydreams, in which J.D. imagined Randall dressed in a [[karate]] [[Keikogi|gi]] and punching him repeatedly in the crotch in surprise attacks: first after jumping out of J.D.'s locker, and then when J.D. walked in on one of [[Perry Cox|Dr. Cox]] and Jordan's sadomasochistic sex routines in which Randall seemed to participate. It was later revealed that these fantasies related to Randall's being treated at Sacred Heart for a kidney injury after sparring in his karate class and to his frequent use of the expression \"punch in the crotch\" (\"[[My Rule of Thumb]]\u201d, Season 3).\n\nIn Season 3's \"[[My Catalyst]]\u201d, the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] introduced Randall to [[Bob Kelso|Dr. Kelso]] as \"my new associate\". Kelso offered the two of them $23 a month to get rid of the hospital's trash (which they did by simply dumping it on a roof behind the hospital). When J.D. learned in \"[[My Butterfly]]\" that Randall had been hired to work at Sacred Heart, he realized \"why he's been back in my dreams\"\u2014that is, emerging from the chest cavity of a surgery patient and punching Turk in the crotch. In \"[[My Self-Examination]]\u201d, he was elected president of the hospital's janitor union, beating the Janitor, who assured him that he had some hard feelings for him. This was one of several cases in which the Janitor drew the short straw in competing with Randall. For instance, Randall was incredibly strong for his size and not only was able to bring the Janitor to his knees by squeezing his hand and apparently breaking it (\"It's like a mechanical [[vise]]!\" a tormented Janitor observed), but also beat him once in a wrestling match. When the Janitor challenged him to a rematch on the roof of the hospital, Randall responded, \"You never learn, do you?\" (\"My Catalyst\u201d, Season 3).\n\nAlthough generally on good terms with J.D., Randall at least once participated in a prank the Janitor played on him. When J.D. was about to check on Randall for a fake injury he supposedly suffered when an air conditioning vent collapsed on him, Randall coughed out, \"Co-chief! Co-chief!\" as part of the Janitor's elaborate attempts to demote J.D. from his new chief resident position (\"[[My New Game]]\u201d, Season 4). Randall was also a member of the first Brain Trust and was the third member of Hibbleton, the Janitor's [[a cappella]] band. He appeared in \"[[My Finale]]\" as one of the many supporting characters whom J.D. saw as part of a final fantasy down the hallway leading toward the hospital's exit, where he said, \"Way to leave a cherry gig, brah\u201d, and pretended to punch J.D. in the crotch.\n\nBill Lawrence included a character named Randall Winston, the mayor of New York, in his previously co-created sitcom, ''[[Spin City]]''. Both characters were named after the actor who played Leonard on ''Scrubs''. The real-life Winston was the basis for the character Carter on ''Spin City'', and his friendship with Lawrence was the basis for the one shared by Turk and J.D. on ''Scrubs''.\n\n===Ted's Band (The Worthless Peons)===\n{{Further|The Blanks}}\n\n===Snoop Dogg Attending===\nRonald, aka Snoop Dogg Attending (formerly Snoop Dogg Resident and Snoop Dogg Intern), played by Manley Henry, got his nickname because of his physical resemblance to [[Snoop Dogg]]. He was seen as an intern as early as Season 1's \"[[My Super Ego]]\" but was not credited. He was first mentioned in the Season 3 episode \"[[My Porcelain God]]\" (he asked \"Where my hos at?\" to which J.D. replied, \"I haven't seen them\"). He was given the name Snoop Dogg Resident in the Season 6 episode \"[[My Fishbowl]]\". He was also seen to be an attending in the Season 5 episode \"[[My Jiggly Ball]]\u201d, as he balanced on a wheelchair with the other attending physicians to determine which of them would introduce Dr. Kelso at a conference. He later got a snake when a patient who owned a pet store gave it to him, and said, \"My hos are gonna love this.\" He was mentioned again in Season 6's \"[[My Long Goodbye]]\". It was revealed in Season 7's \"[[My Own Worst Enemy (Scrubs)|My Own Worst Enemy]]\" that he had become an attending, after J.D. incorrectly called him an intern and then a resident. In Season 6's \"[[Their Story]]\u201d, his annoyance that nobody called him by his real name, Ronald, was revealed. Like Dr. Mickhead, Colonel Doctor, and Dr. Beardfac\u00e9, Ronald was a longtime extra before being mentioned. Also revealed in \"[[My Own Worst Enemy (Scrubs)|My Own Worst Enemy]]\" was that he had feelings for a squeaky-voiced intern named Josephine. He was seen with his arm around Josephine in \"[[My Finale]]\u201d, during J.D.'s fantasy about everyone he had met at the hospital, and had a brief cameo in Season 9's \"[[Our Drunk Friend]]\".\n\n===Troy===\nTroy, played by [[Joe Rose (actor)|Joe Rose]], worked in the Sacred Heart cafeteria and was the Janitor's lackey/sidekick. He was first seen in Season 2 in \"[[Scrubs (season 2)#Episodes|My Big Mouth]]\u201d, when J.D. inadvertently insulted him while trying to make the Janitor feel better about his role in the hospital. Just like the Janitor, Troy came to hate J.D., and he and the Janitor often teamed up to intimidate and harass him. However, Troy's tendency to get overenthusiastic while messing with J.D. annoyed the Janitor, and he frequently had to remind Troy to play it cool, especially when it came to Troy's occasional homicidal urges. When J.D. embarrassed them by showing that, even on second try, they were unable to solve the riddle of what two coins could be used to make 30 cents if one of them is not a nickel (a challenge he first presented to them in \"[[My Lucky Night]]\" in Season 3), the Janitor had to interfere so that Troy would not attack J.D. with a crowbar (\"[[My D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, My D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]\u201d, Season 5). Troy also twice proposed to simply kill J.D. instead of solving the riddle (triggering the Janitor's query \"How's therapy going?\" on the second occasion). During a brief truce in \"[[My Brother, My Keeper]]\" (Season 2), the Janitor assured J.D. that a reluctant Troy would \"stop spitting in your food\". Troy was not very intelligent (to solve J.D.'s riddle, he twice proposed taking a penny and a button that he had written \"29 cents\" on), and the Janitor advised him repeatedly not to procreate. In \"[[My Moment of Un-Truth]]\" (Season 3), the Janitor used Troy as the sole guest at a fake twin birthday party in the cafeteria, a video of which was supposed to serve as \"indisputable evidence\" to Turk and J.D. that the Janitor had a twin brother called Roscoe. (The clumsiness of the whole performance was partly attributable to Troy's extremely bad acting and his following the Janitor with his eyes as the Janitor switched sides and into the role of Roscoe behind the camera.) Troy was also a member of the first brain trust and of Hibbleton, the Janitor's [[a cappella]] group.\n\n===Paul Zeltzer===\nDr. Paul Zeltzer, played by Bob Clendenin, was a skilled [[oncologist]] who made his first appearance in Season 1 in \"[[My Hero (Scrubs)|My Hero]]\". In Season 2's [[My New Old Friend]]\u201d, Dr. Cox described him as \"the finest oncologist we have on staff\". Dr. Zeltzer seemed to have unusual sexual tastes and to enjoy prostitutes: In \"[[His Story (Scrubs)|His Story]]\u201d, Dr. Cox invited him and some other doctors to his apartment for food and drinks, and Zeltzer immediately asked whether there would be prostitutes there. When Cox told him no, Zeltzer unconvincingly responded, \"Oh, uh, good.\" According to the Season 1 DVD commentary, this trait was given as part of a common practice with one-off staff members who were deemed funny enough to warrant returns: When they returned, a particular character trait was assigned to them, in this case sexual deviancy. This feature was underlined in Season 4's \"[[My Office]]\u201d, when a patient came in with a light bulb stuck in his rectum and Dr. Zeltzer commented, \"That's why my wife and I use candles.\" When Turk responded by calling him \"the most disturbing man I've ever met in my life\u201d, Zeltzer took it as a compliment and wondered whether Turk and Carla were \"open-minded\". A flashback revealed that once, when Zeltzer and his wife had Dr. Cox and Jordan over for drinks, they slipped their guests \"roofies\" ([[Rohypnol]]), a [[date rape drug]]. After Cox and then Jordan passed out, Mrs. Zeltzer announced, \"Party time!\" While Jordan was ready to \"give them another chance\" a year later, Cox angrily turned down an invite to a camping trip with Zeltzer, his wife and \"a pretty interesting guy named Ron\" (\"[[My Chopped Liver]]\u201d, Season 5). Zeltzer had a strong rivalry with Dr. Leventhal, another oncologist at the hospital, and admitted to having an affair with Leventhal's wife, apparently out of spite (\"My New Old Friend\u201d, Season 2). He appeared in \"[[My Finale]]\u201d, telling J.D.: \"Key party later. There will be prostitutes.\"\n\n===Jason Cabbagio===\nJason \"Cabbage\" Cabbagio, played by Shaughn Buchholz, first appeared in \"[[My Intern's Eyes]]\" (Season 5). He was J.D.'s favorite intern because he amused J.D. and had a \"dynamite ape impression\". After Dr. Cox forced J.D. to realize that he was letting his personal feelings for Cabbage (and his dislike of Cabbage's colleague and Elliot's booty call, Keith Dudemeister) get in the way of admitting that Cabbage was never going to be a good doctor, J.D. had to let him go. Before leaving the hospital for the final time as a doctor, Cabbage stopped to pick up a used medical glove and dropped it into a waste bin. This caused him to accidentally spread an infection to Mrs. Wilk when he stopped to thank her for being so kind to him (\"[[My Cabbage]]\"). The infection led to her death in the next episode, \"[[My Five Stages]]\". Cabbage returned in the Season 6 episode \"[[My Coffee]]\" as an employee at Coffee Bucks, the new hospital [[caf\u00e9]].\n\n===Patricia Wilk===\n[[Michael Learned]] played Patricia Wilk, a kind and genial patient who suffered from a very serious disease that caused a lengthy stay in the hospital. While there, she befriended many of the staff, especially her physicians (J.D. and Dr. Cox). Eventually, despite seemingly insurmountable odds, she recovered to the point of being released from the hospital. However, because of the last act of medical ineptitude of Jason \"Cabbage\" Cabbagio (who forgot to wash his hands after handling an infected medical glove and then shook her hand just before she left for home), she contracted an infection that forced her to return to the hospital one week after leaving. Because of her already seriously weakened immune system, the infection quickly became deadly. Despite the efforts of J.D. and Cox, she was declared terminal. She became depressed and scared of death, and J.D. and Cox went through the five stages of grief on her behalf, but they were all comforted by Doctor Hedrick (a counselor for the terminally ill). Succumbing to the infection, she lapsed into unconsciousness and died peacefully. Mrs. Wilk had a lasting effect on J.D. and could be seen in his \"parade\" out during the Season 8 finale, saying, \"Hi, Tiger.\"\n\n===Sean Kelly===\nSean Kelly, played by [[Scott Foley]], was a handsome and charismatic animal trainer who worked at [[SeaWorld]]. He quickly won over all of Elliot's close friends, with the notable exception of J.D., who was jealous of Sean throughout the course of his relationship with Elliot. Elliot and Sean's relationship had its ups and downs, with Elliot ultimately breaking up with him\u2014just as they were preparing to move in together\u2014after realizing that she still had feelings for J.D. Almost immediately, J.D. regretted breaking them up when he realized that he did not really love Elliot and had simply wanted what he could not have. J.D. told Elliot that he did not love her at Turk and Carla's wedding rehearsal in \"[[My Self-Examination]]\u201d, and in the following episode, \"[[My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs)|My Best Friend's Wedding]]\u201d, he set out to find Sean in an attempt to fix his friendship with Elliot. When J.D. found Sean sitting on the street outside his apartment, Sean was shown to have grown a massive beard in the mere four days since Elliot dumped him, much to J.D.'s amazement. He convinced Sean to come to Turk and Carla's wedding and win Elliot back. Sean did come but was unable to convince Elliot to take him back. He found some satisfaction in the fact that Elliot had had her heart broken too, and ended up leaving the wedding with J.D.'s ex-girlfriend Danni. He made an appearance in Season 8's \"[[My Cuz]]\u201d, in a relationship with [[Kim Briggs (Scrubs)|Kim Briggs]].\n\n===Sam Dorian===\nSam Dorian, played by [[John Ritter]], was J.D. and Dan's father, an unsuccessful office supplies salesman. He was the main source of income for his family, and, although he failed to get ideal wages, he still made enough for the family to get by. Sam and his wife, Barbara, got divorced when J.D. was seven years old, but he remained a part of J.D.'s adult life. He was good friends with Turk, as they both acted and sounded like \"real men\". Sam was reported to have died after having a \"massive heart attack\" in the episode \"[[My Cake]]\u201d, and Dan delivered the bad news and a double-layer fudge cake (used in the Dorian family when conveying bad news) to J.D. The episode paid homage to Ritter's real-life death. J.D. named his son, Sam, after his father. [[Zach Braff]] mentioned during the commentary on the Season One DVD that Ritter had ad-libbed his final line (a slightly embarrassed \"I pooed a little\" after soliciting J.D. to pull his finger, a running gag throughout the episode), which caused the entire cast and crew to break up laughing.\n\n===Dan Dorian===\nDaniel \"Dan\" Dorian, played by [[Tom Cavanagh]], was J.D.'s older brother, a hyper, quick-witted slacker who lived with his mother in his hometown and worked at a bar; J.D. called him \"a self-involved user\". J.D. was very uncomfortable when his brother was around, while Dr. Cox was generally disgusted by his lack of maturity and his self-serving attitude and referred to him at one point as \"the worst older brother in the world\". Dan was seemingly oblivious to Cox's disdain and often reacted to his rants in a nonchalant manner. However, Turk and Elliot genuinely liked him, the latter being somewhat attracted to him in earlier seasons. While at first, J.D. showed signs of jealousy, it was later revealed that J.D. was embarrassed by Dan, and that Dan was aware of it. He was also aware that J.D. looked up to Dr. Cox, and eventually asked Cox to promise that he would never have a reason to let J.D. down.\n\nHe had a fling with Elliot in Season 4, which J.D. discovered, to his own surprise, that he did not mind. The siblings were briefly estranged after J.D. tried being honest about Dan's wasting his potential. When J.D. made another attempt to be honest with his brother, however, Dan followed his advice and applied for a new job, made evident by the suit that J.D. gave him for his interview. As of Season 7, Dan was gainfully employed in real estate. He finally purchased his own home and gave J.D. a [[Prius]]. J.D. was angry and jealous at first at how quickly and (comparatively) easily Dan had become successful, but he eventually got over those feelings and was proud of how his brother has turned his life around. Upon meeting J.D.'s son for the first time, Dan noted that his nephew \"looks like Dad\". Dan makes a brief last appearance in \"[[My Finale]]\" as the first person J.D. imagined as he left the hospital for the last time. His final line was his apparent catchphrase to J.D.: \"Heyyy, little brother.\"\n\n===Danni Sullivan===\nDanielle \"Danni\" Sullivan, played by [[Tara Reid]], was an on-again, off-again fling of J.D.'s, similar to many of the women he dated. She was the younger sister of Dr. Cox's ex-wife, Jordan Sullivan. Like J.D., Danni maintained an internal monologue in her head. According to J.D., she had hearing \"like a bat\". She was also seen dating [[Larry Thomas (actor)|Larry Thomas]] of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' \"[[Soup Nazi]]\" fame. At Turk and Carla's wedding, she made out with both Doug and Ted in quick succession, something she apparently had a habit of doing at people's weddings. This led to a fight between the two when they were quarantined together. According to Turk, she also threw up on his grandmother before leaving the wedding in the company of Sean. She appeared for the last time in Season 4. She was mentioned in Season 9 when Jordan told Dr. Cox that a man she married had died.\n\n===Ladinia Williams===\nLadinia \"Lady\" Williams, played by [[Kit Pongetti]], was the girlfriend of the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] and became his wife in Season 8. She was so named because her parents were watching the Disney film ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' not long after she was conceived. In \"My Soul on Fire, Part 2\u201d, at Lady's and Janitor's wedding ceremony, the Brain Trust's justice of the peace (a cameo by Bill Lawrence) called her Ladinia. Pongetti had a cameo in \"My Philosophy\" as Dr. Mitchell, a research fellow with an office next to Dr. Kelso's.\n\n===Stephanie Gooch===\nStephanie Gooch, sometimes called simply \"The Gooch\u201d, was played by [[Kate Micucci]]. A local musician who played her [[ukulele]] for the hospital's patients, Stephanie became the object of Ted's affection. J.D. and the Janitor called a temporary truce to help Ted with his lack of confidence around women. Although Ted could initially be around her only in the presence of his band, he later overcame his awkwardness. The two began dating, a fact Ted enjoyed flaunting to the hospital's staff. By the end of Season 8, Ted and Stephanie had moved in together. Micucci performed several of her original songs on the show, including \"Screw You\" (a modified version of her [[Garfunkel and Oates]] duet \"Fuck You\"), which was featured in both ''Scrubs'' and the ''Scrubs: Interns'' web series. In a guest appearance in \"Something Good is Coming\u201d, a Season 2 episode of ''[[Cougar Town]]'', another series by ''Scrubs'' creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]], Ted said that Gooch had run away with [[List of Scrubs characters#Hooch|Hooch]].\n\n===Franklyn, MT===\nFranklyn, played by [[Masi Oka]], was a quiet medical technologist seen throughout the series. Because he was so calm and quiet, he was often used by the other characters. For example, when Dr. Cox destroyed Franklyn's lab in a fit of rage, Franklyn still retained his calm demeanor, despite his apparent annoyance. He may also have had a crush on Elliot, as evidenced by the fact that in one episode, Elliot was easily able to persuade him to run a lab on a patient by flirting, though he had other work. She once got him to re-check a test sample by asking him while crying.\n\n===Harvey Corman===\nHarvey Corman, played by [[Richard Kind]], was an \"admittedly frugal [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]]\" who appeared in the episodes \"[[My Female Trouble]]\u201d, \"[[My Malpractical Decision]]\u201d, \"[[My Fault (Scrubs episode)|My Fault]]\u201d, and \"[[My New Old Friend]]\". Dr. Cox tried to scare him off by offering a very painful bone marrow test, but was surprised and guilty when he found out that Mr. Corman had [[Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia]]. He apologized for not believing Mr. Corman, but Mr. Corman lectured him on not caring enough about his patients. In \"My Fault\u201d, he came to Sacred Heart for a [[Full-body CT scan|full-body scan]] in order to find every little thing wrong with him. At the end of the episode, he said of [[Harvey Korman|his name]] that it did not \"get him as much action as you may think\" after admitting to Dr. Cox, whom he severely annoyed, that he did not get the scan. In earlier episodes, he sued Turk for giving him a restraining order and won the case. He was known to serve a tennis ball with enough force to incapacitate a person.\n\n===Ed Dhandapani===\nEd \"Big Ed\" Dhandapani, played by [[Aziz Ansari]], was a lackadaisical intern who appeared in four episodes of Season 8. Extremely talented at creating fast-spreading catchphrases, Ed was well liked by many at the hospital but hated by J.D. and, later, by Dr. Cox. He stated that he used to be a DJ. Though he was exceptionally intelligent and skilled compared with the other interns, he remained content with being an average doctor and spent more time doing ridiculous activities with his friends than learning medicine. When Dr. Cox realized his laziness, he ordered Ed to spend two days studying cardiac diseases. When he failed to study, Cox fired him.\n\n===Jimmy===\nJimmy, played by [[Taran Killam]], was introduced in Season 8. He was known at Sacred Heart as \"the Overly Touchy Orderly\" because he appeared to have an extreme tactile addiction\u2014touching everyone and offering rubs, massages, or just general physical contact, regardless of whether people consented. However, J.D. stated that Jimmy successfully controlled part of his habit by touching people only above the waist. Jimmy's love for contact extended beyond people; for example, when he was forced to keep his hands to himself, he fondled a table. He was temporarily part of the Janitor's \"Brain Trust\". He was fired by Doctor Maddox, only to be reinstated when she was removed as chief of medicine. He had a talent for impersonation. He was seen in J.D's last fantasy at Sacred Heart, massaging Dr. Beardfac\u00e9.\n\n===Jill Tracy===\nJill Tracy, played by [[Nicole Sullivan]], was a recurring patient at Sacred Heart Hospital and one of the longest recurring ancillary characters on Scrubs, appearing in six episodes over five seasons (in chronological order, \"[[Scrubs (season 1)|My Nickname]]\u201d, \"[[Scrubs (season 1)|My Occurrence]]\u201d, \"[[Scrubs (season 3)|My Fifteen Seconds]]\u201d, \"[[Scrubs (season 5)|My Lunch]]\u201d, \"[[Scrubs (season 6)|My Long Goodbye]]\u201d, and \"[[Scrubs (season 8)|My Finale (Part 2)]]\"), starting early in Season 1 and finishing in the Season 8 finale as one of the people J.D. imagines seeing while exiting the hospital for the last time.\n\nJ.D. and Dr. Cox found Jill obnoxious, but she bonded with Elliot in Season 1's \"[[Scrubs (season 1)|My Occurrence]]\". She exhibited telling signs of clinical depression, but because of her cheery-obnoxious personality, doctors misdiagnosed her every time she was admitted to Sacred Heart. During her fourth appearance, in Season 5's \"[[My Lunch]]\u201d, she frequently ran into J.D. at the supermarket. Despite his best efforts to avoid her, she eventually had lunch with him and tried to tell him about her problems, but J.D. was anxious to end the encounter and failed to realize that Jill desperately needed help.\n\nLater in the episode, Jill was admitted to Sacred Heart unconscious and eventually died without regaining consciousness. Because her [[drug test|tox screen]] was positive for [[cocaine]], and because of what she said at lunch, J.D. concluded that she had died of suicide by overdose. Her organs were given to transplant patients, most of whom were almost out of time. However, the [[autopsy]] revealed that she had died of [[rabies]], and all the transplant patients consequently succumbed to the disease. Jill returned as a ghost to haunt Dr. Cox in \"[[My Long Goodbye]]\".\n\nIn her last appearance in \"[[Scrubs (season 8)|My Finale (Part 2)]]\", Jill was the fifth person J.D. saw in his farewell fantasy.\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Scrubs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters On Scrubs}}\n[[Category:Scrubs (TV series) characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of American comedy-drama television series characters|Scrubs]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1700:ab10:3e40:a972:d0fd:3df4:2b97", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTodd Quinlan)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scrubs_characters"}
