These strata are now classified as the [[Maastricht Formation]] - both [[formation (geology)|formation]] and stage derive their names from the city. The Maastricht Formation is known for its fossils from this age, most notably those of the giant [[sea reptile]] ''[[Mosasaurus]]'', which in turn also derives its name from the Dutch city (''mosa'' being Latin for the river [[Meuse|Maas]]).\n\nThe base of the Maastrichtian stage is at the first appearance of [[ammonite]] species ''[[Pachydiscus|Pachydiscus neubergicus]]''. At the original type locality near Maastricht, the stratigraphic record was later found to be incomplete. A reference profile for the base was then appointed in a section along the [[Ardour (river)|Ardour river]] called ''Grande Carri\u00e8re'', close to the village of [[Tercis-les-Bains]] in southwestern [[France]].<ref>The GSSP is described by Odin (2001); Odin & Lamaurelle (2001)</ref> The top of the Maastrichtian stage is defined to be at the [[iridium]] anomaly at the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] (K\u2013Pg boundary), which is also characterised by the [[extinction]] of many groups of life, such as certain [[foraminifer]]s and calcareous [[nanoplankton]], all ammonites and [[belemnite]]s, etc.\n\n===Subdivision===\nThe Maastrichtian is commonly subdivided into two substages (Upper and Lower) and three ammonite [[biozone]]s. The biozones are (from young to old):\n*zone of ''[[Anapachydiscus|Anapachydiscus terminus]]''\n*zone of ''Anapachydiscus fresvillensis''\n*zone of ''[[Pachydiscus|Pachydiscus neubergicus]]'' till ''Pachydiscus epiplectus''\n\nThe Maastrichtian is roughly coeval with the [[Lancian]] [[North American Land Mammal Age]].\n\n==Lithostratigraphy and palaeogeography==\nThe following are summaries of the characteristics of specific Maastrichtian aged formations.\n\n===North America===\nThe [[Bearpaw Formation]], also called the Bearpaw Shale, is a [[sedimentary rock]] formation found in northwestern North America. It is exposed in the U.S. state of [[Montana]], as well as the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It overlies the older [[Two Medicine Formation|Two Medicine]], [[Judith River Formation|Judith River]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]s, and is in turn overlain by the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] in Canada and the [[Fox Hills Formation|Fox Hills Sandstone]] in Montana. To the east and south it blends into the [[Pierre Shale]].\n\nA [[marine (ocean)|marine]] formation composed mostly of [[shale]], it represents the last major expansion of the [[Western Interior Seaway]] before it completely receded from northwestern North America by the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]]. It includes well-preserved [[ammonite]] [[fossil]]s. Other fossils found in this formation include many types of [[shellfish]], [[bony fish]], [[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]], [[bird]]s, and marine reptiles like [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s and [[sea turtle]]s. The occasional [[dinosaur]] remains have also been discovered, presumably from carcasses washed out to sea.\n\n[[File:Hell Creek.jpg|thumb|right|Hell Creek Formation is well exposed in the badlands in the vicinity of Ft. Peck Reservoir.]]\nThe [[Hell Creek Formation]] is an intensely studied division of [[Upper Cretaceous]] to lower [[Paleocene]] rocks in North America, named for exposures studied along '''Hell Creek''', near [[Jordan, Montana]]. The Hell Creek Formation occurs in badlands of eastern [[Montana]] and portions of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Wyoming]]. In Montana, the Hell Creek Formation overlies the [[Fox Hills Formation]] and is the uppermost formation of the Cretaceous period.\n\nIt is a series of fresh and brackish-water [[clays]], [[mudstone]]s, and [[sandstones]] deposited during the Maastrichtian, the last part of the [[Cretaceous period]], by [[fluvial]] activity in fluctuating river channels and deltas and very occasional peaty swamp deposits along the low-lying eastern [[continental margin]] fronting the late Cretaceous [[Western Interior Seaway]]. The climate was mild.<ref>The presence of [[crocodylians]] suggests a sub-tropical climate, with no prolonged annual cold.</ref> The  [[iridium]]-enriched [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]], which separates the Cretaceous from the [[Cenozoic]], occurs as a discontinuous but distinct thin marker bedding within the Formation, near its uppermost strata.\n\nThe [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] is part of the [[Edmonton Group]] and is up to 230 m in depth. It is Late Campanian to Early Maastrichtian in age (Edmontonian Land Mammal Age) and is composed of [[mudstone]], [[sandstone]], and [[carbon]]aceous [[shale]]s. There are a variety of environments, which have yielded a diversity of fossil material. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation outcrops extensively in the area of Drumheller, Alberta, as well as further north along the Red Deer River near Trochu, and also in the city of Edmonton.\n\n===Africa===\nThe [[Sarir field]] was discovered in southern [[Cyrenaica]] during 1961 and is considered to be the largest [[oil field]] in [[Libya]], with estimated oil reserves of {{convert|12|Goilbbl|km3|abbr=on}}.<ref>OGJ 2004</ref> Sarir is operated by the [[Arabian Gulf Oil Company]] (AGOCO), a subsidiary of the state-owned [[National Oil Corporation]] (NOC).\n\nThe Sarir stratigraphic column generally resembles succession patterns throughout the Sirte Basin, with some variations. In the early regressive phase, basal sandstones were deposited on a [[Precambrian]] basement of [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks. Sandstones are dated on [[angiosperm]] [[pollen]] as younger than [[Albian]], probably from the Late Cretaceous. After a lengthy hiatus, represented by unconformity and sandstone erosion, a transgressive sequence of red, green, and purple [[Anhydrite]] shales was laid. Variegated bed remnants occur in crestal sections of many northern structures, such as in wells B-1-65 and C-1-80.\n\nAbove the transgressive sequence are Late Cretaceous shales with tight, micritic carbonate, marking the top of the [[Mesozoic]]. These shales thicken into troughs, providing the field's sole [[source rock]]. The youngest [[fauna]] are Maastrichtian, with an apparent disconformity between the Late Cretaceous and [[Paleocene]], marked by high levels of [[gamma radiation]] on logs.\n\nThe [[Berivotra Formation]] is an Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) sedimentary rock marine formation found in Madagascar, that is contemporary to the terrestrial [[Maevarano Formation]].\n\nThe Maevarano Formation is an [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[sedimentary]] [[formation (geology)|rock formation]] found in the [[Mahajanga Province]] of northwestern [[Madagascar]]. It is most likely Maastrichtian in age, and records a seasonal, [[semiarid]] environment with [[river]]s that had greatly varying [[discharge (hydrology)|discharges]]. Notable animal [[fossil]]s recovered include the [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] ''[[Majungasaurus]]'' and the early [[bird]]s ''[[Rahonavis]]'' and ''[[Vorona]]'', and the [[titanosaur]]ian [[sauropod]] ''[[Rapetosaurus]]''.\n\n===Asia===\nThe [[Lameta Formation]] is a [[sedimentary]] [[geological formation|rock formation]] found in [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Gujarat]], and [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It is of Maastrichtian age ([[Upper Cretaceous]]), and is notable for its [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s.  Many [[nomen dubium|dubious]] names have been created for isolated bones, but several [[genus|genera]] of dinosaurs from these rocks are well-supported, including the [[titanosaur]] [[sauropod]] ''[[Isisaurus]]'', the [[abelisaur]]s ''[[Indosaurus]]'', ''[[Indosuchus]]'', ''[[Laevisuchus]]'', and ''[[Rajasaurus]]'' and possible [[stegosaur]]s.<ref name=DBWetal04>Weishampel ''et al.'' (2004)</ref><ref>Galton and Upchurch (2004); \"Introduction\", page 343.</ref>\n\nThe [[Barun Goyot Formation]], dating from the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], is located within and is widely represented in the [[Gobi Desert]] basin, in the [[\u00d6mn\u00f6govi Province]] of [[Mongolia]].\n\nIt was previously known as the \"Lower Nemegt Beds\", occurring beneath the [[Nemegt Formation]] and above the [[Djadokhta Formation]]. It is approximately {{convert|4|in|mm}} in thickness and was laid down roughly 80-71 [[mya (unit)|mya]], making it uncertain whether it should be classed as [[Campanian]] or Maastrichtian, although the latter is less likely. The Barun Goyot Formation preserves an environment of [[Dune|sand dunes]], created from wind-eroded rocks ([[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] dunes).\n\nThe Nemegt Formation is a Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[Deposition (sediment)|formation]] in the [[Gobi Desert]] of [[Mongolia]]. It overlies, and in some places interdigitates with, the [[Barun Goyot Formation]]. It consists of river channel sediments and contains [[fossil]]s of [[fish]], [[turtle]]s, [[crocodilian]]s, [[bird]]s and a diverse [[fauna]] of [[dinosaur]]s. The [[climate]] was wetter than when the preceding formations were deposited; there seems to have existed at least some degree of forest cover.\n\nThe absolute age of the Nemegt Formation is unknown but it is thought to be Maastrichtian or maybe late [[Campanian]] in age, very roughly some 76-65&nbsp;million years old. The presence of ''[[Saurolophus]]'', a taxon also known from the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] of [[Alberta]], may indicate an Early Maastrichtian age, about 70 million years old.\n\n==Paleontology==\n[[File:Hemipneustes leymeriei MHNT.jpg|thumb|Fossil of ''Hemipneustes leymeriei'' [[Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse]]]]\n{{main|Flora and fauna of the Maastrichtian stage}}\n\n=== Birds ===\n\nSeveral lineages of modern birds existed, though many were of lineages that differed profoundly from their relatives of today and thus are not their ancestors, but became extinct in the [[Cenozoic]]. For example, ''[[Vegavis iaai]]'' indicates that at least four lineages of [[Anseriformes]] were distinct: [[Anhimidae]], [[Anatidae]], [[Anseranatidae]] and [[Presbyornithidae]] (and possibly [[Dromornithidae]]), and that there was at least one [[Galliformes]] lineage too, and apparently the [[Gastornithiformes]] were also distinct. It is also highly likely that there was at least one, and probably several, lineages of [[Charadriiformes]], that [[penguin]]s were about to split from their closest relatives or had already done so, and that if the [[Metaves]] are a valid group they would presumably have been distinct too. Also, [[paleognath]]s were of course long distinct from [[neognath]]s.\n\n=== Pterosaurs ===\n\nTraditionally, pterosaur faunas of the Maastrichtian were assumed to be dominated by [[Azhdarchidae|azhdarchids]], with other pterosaur groups having become extinct earlier on. However, more recent findings suggest a fairly composite pterosaur diversity: at least six (\"Nyctosaurus\" ''lamegoi'', a Mexican humerus, a Jordan humerus and several taxa from Morocco) [[Nyctosauridae|nyctosaur]]s date to this period, as do a few [[Pteranodontidae|pteranodontids]], and ''[[Navajodactylus]]'', tentatively assigned to Azhdarchidae, lacks any synapomorphies of the group.<ref>Wilton, Mark P.

The Maastricht Formation is known for its fossils from this age, most notably those of the giant [[sea reptile]] ''[[Mosasaurus]]'', which in turn also derives its name from the Dutch city (''mosa'' being Latin for the river [[Meuse|Maas]]).\n\nThe base of the Maastrichtian stage is at the first appearance of [[ammonite]] species ''[[Pachydiscus|Pachydiscus neubergicus]]''. At the original type locality near Maastricht, the stratigraphic record was later found to be incomplete. A reference profile for the base was then appointed in a section along the [[Ardour (river)|Ardour river]] called ''Grande Carri\u00e8re'', close to the village of [[Tercis-les-Bains]] in southwestern [[France]].<ref>The GSSP is described by Odin (2001); Odin & Lamaurelle (2001)</ref> The top of the Maastrichtian stage is defined to be at the [[iridium]] anomaly at the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] (K\u2013Pg boundary), which is also characterised by the [[extinction]] of many groups of life, such as certain [[foraminifer]]s and calcareous [[nanoplankton]], all ammonites and [[belemnite]]s, etc.\n\n===Subdivision===\nThe Maastrichtian is commonly subdivided into two substages (Upper and Lower) and three ammonite [[biozone]]s.

It is exposed in the U.S. state of [[Montana]], as well as the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It overlies the older [[Two Medicine Formation|Two Medicine]], [[Judith River Formation|Judith River]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]s, and is in turn overlain by the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] in Canada and the [[Fox Hills Formation|Fox Hills Sandstone]] in Montana. To the east and south it blends into the [[Pierre Shale]].\n\nA [[marine (ocean)|marine]] formation composed mostly of [[shale]], it represents the last major expansion of the [[Western Interior Seaway]] before it completely receded from northwestern North America by the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]].

The Hell Creek Formation occurs in badlands of eastern [[Montana]] and portions of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Wyoming]]. In Montana, the Hell Creek Formation overlies the [[Fox Hills Formation]] and is the uppermost formation of the Cretaceous period.\n\nIt is a series of fresh and brackish-water [[clays]], [[mudstone]]s, and [[sandstones]] deposited during the Maastrichtian, the last part of the [[Cretaceous period]], by [[fluvial]] activity in fluctuating river channels and deltas and very occasional peaty swamp deposits along the low-lying eastern [[continental margin]] fronting the late Cretaceous [[Western Interior Seaway]].

These shales thicken into troughs, providing the field's sole [[source rock]]. The youngest [[fauna]] are Maastrichtian, with an apparent disconformity between the Late Cretaceous and [[Paleocene]], marked by high levels of [[gamma radiation]] on logs.\n\nThe [[Berivotra Formation]] is an Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) sedimentary rock marine formation found in Madagascar, that is contemporary to the terrestrial [[Maevarano Formation]].\n\nThe Maevarano Formation is an [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[sedimentary]] [[formation (geology)|rock formation]] found in the [[Mahajanga Province]] of northwestern [[Madagascar]].

The Barun Goyot Formation preserves an environment of [[Dune|sand dunes]], created from wind-eroded rocks ([[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] dunes).\n\nThe Nemegt Formation is a Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[Deposition (sediment)|formation]] in the [[Gobi Desert]] of [[Mongolia]]. It overlies, and in some places interdigitates with, the [[Barun Goyot Formation]]. It consists of river channel sediments and contains [[fossil]]s of [[fish]], [[turtle]]s, [[crocodilian]]s, [[bird]]s and a diverse [[fauna]] of [[dinosaur]]s. The [[climate]] was wetter than when the preceding formations were deposited; there seems to have existed at least some degree of forest cover.\n\nThe absolute age of the Nemegt Formation is unknown but it is thought to be Maastrichtian or maybe late [[Campanian]] in age, very roughly some 76-65&nbsp;million years old. The presence of ''[[Saurolophus]]'', a taxon also known from the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] of [[Alberta]], may indicate an Early Maastrichtian age, about 70 million years old.\n\n==Paleontology==\n[[File:Hemipneustes leymeriei MHNT.jpg|thumb|Fossil of ''Hemipneustes leymeriei'' [[Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse]]]]\n{{main|Flora and fauna of the Maastrichtian stage}}\n\n=== Birds ===\n\nSeveral lineages of modern birds existed, though many were of lineages that differed profoundly from their relatives of today and thus are not their ancestors, but became extinct in the [[Cenozoic]]. For example, ''[[Vegavis iaai]]'' indicates that at least four lineages of [[Anseriformes]] were distinct: [[Anhimidae]], [[Anatidae]], [[Anseranatidae]] and [[Presbyornithidae]] (and possibly [[Dromornithidae]]), and that there was at least one [[Galliformes]] lineage too, and apparently the [[Gastornithiformes]] were also distinct. It is also highly likely that there was at least one, and probably several, lineages of [[Charadriiformes]], that [[penguin]]s were about to split from their closest relatives or had already done so, and that if the [[Metaves]] are a valid group they would presumably have been distinct too. Also, [[paleognath]]s were of course long distinct from [[neognath]]s.\n\n=== Pterosaurs ===\n\nTraditionally, pterosaur faunas of the Maastrichtian were assumed to be dominated by [[Azhdarchidae|azhdarchids]], with other pterosaur groups having become extinct earlier on. However, more recent findings suggest a fairly composite pterosaur diversity: at least six (\"Nyctosaurus\" ''lamegoi'', a Mexican humerus, a Jordan humerus and several taxa from Morocco) [[Nyctosauridae|nyctosaur]]s date to this period, as do a few [[Pteranodontidae|pteranodontids]], and ''[[Navajodactylus]]'', tentatively assigned to Azhdarchidae, lacks any synapomorphies of the group.<ref>Wilton, Mark P.

The Dangote Group has moved from being a [[trading company]] to be the largest industrial group in Nigeria including Dangote Sugar Refinery, [[Dangote Cement]], and Dangote Flour.\n\nIn July 2012, Dangote approached the [[Nigerian Ports Authority]] to lease an abandoned piece of land at the [[Apapa]] Port, which was approved.<ref>[http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Data/Africa_file/Company/nigeria04.html \"Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (DSR)\"], ''Institute of Developing Economies-Japan External Trade Organization''.
