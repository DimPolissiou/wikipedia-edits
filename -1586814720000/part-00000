To the immediate north-east is the [[University of Nottingham]]'s main campus, [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park]]. The [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and retail chemist group [[Boots UK|Boots]] has its headquarters {{convert|1|km|mi|1|order=flip}} east of the centre of Beeston, on the border with [[Borough of Broxtowe|Broxtowe]] and the City of Nottingham. To the south lies the [[River Trent]] and the village of [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], with extensive wetlands.<ref>[http://www.attenboroughnaturecentre.co.uk/docs/anr-map.pdf Attenborough Nature Centre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704165209/http://www.attenboroughnaturecentre.co.uk/docs/anr-map.pdf |date=4 July 2010}} Map of Attenborough wetlands</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSuburban development in the mid-20th century has extended the built-up area of Beeston to the former villages of [[Chilwell]] to the west, and [[Wollaton]] and [[Lenton Abbey]] to the north. It is separated from [[Bramcote]] to the north-west by the Beeston Fields Golf Course. The Broxtowe-City of Nottingham border essentially forms the town's eastern edge. The main area and shopping district lies to the north of the [[Midland Main Line|railway line]], and the mixed residential and industrial area of Beeston Rylands to the south.\n\n===Beeston Rylands===\n[[File:Beeston Canal - geograph.org.uk - 53033.jpg|thumb|right|The Beeston Canal passing through Rylands]]\nRylands was originally a small settlement around Beeston Lock, comprising some tens of houses and two pubs, although the name now refers to all of the area south of the railway line. The ''Jolly Angler'' was originally on the river side of the canal, but has since moved.<ref>[http://www.beeston-notts.co.uk/landmark_pubs3.shtml Beeston history website] ''Jolly Angler''</ref> Beeston began to spread south of the railway line in the late 19th century, when a few Victorian villas were built near the level crossing by the station.\n\nOver the first few decades of the 20th century, several estates were built to house workers at [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|Ericssons]] and Boots, both of which had large factories south of the railway line. These estates joined Beeston and Rylands. Further development after the Second World War filled gaps, initially with an estate of council houses and flats, and latterly with private houses and bungalows. The last significant development, in 1970, was Meadow Farm, now the four roads of timber-framed semi-detached houses between Beech Avenue and the canal.  Since then Beeston Rylands has had a small amount of infill development.\n\nBeeston Rylands was historically at risk of flooding from the [[River Trent]] to the south. This reduced property values and the size of houses built there, predominantly for the rental market. The last serious flood, in 1947, reached beyond the railway line: most of Queens Road was flooded, as was Nether Street. Strengthened flood defences have reduced the risk of flooding to a probability of once every fifty years. A series of flood-defence improvements, costing \u00a351 million and designed to decrease the expected flood incidence to once in a hundred years, began in 2009 along a {{convert|27|km|mi|order=flip}} stretch of the Trent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8602573.stm BBC News] Attenborough flood defence plans submitted</ref>\n\n===University of Nottingham===\nThe eastern edge of Beeston abuts the [[University of Nottingham]]'s University Park campus, through which runs Beeston Lane.\n\nAlthough most of the University is within the City of Nottingham, around half the self-catering flats in the [[Broadgate Park]] hall of residence fall within Beeston. Nearer still is Albion House, which is associated with the main Broadgate Park site.\n\nBeeston has a large population of postgraduate students, who supposedly prefer the quieter atmosphere compared to [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]] and [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]], where many undergraduates live.\n\n===Wards===\n{{see also|Borough of Broxtowe#Wards}}\nBeeston divides into four [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] for local electoral purposes within the borough of Broxtowe: Beeston North, Beeston Central, Beeston Rylands and Beeston West.<ref name=\"Wards\">[http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe Boundary Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509213923/http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe |date=9 May 2011}} \u2013 Broxtowe</ref>\n\nBeeston's town centre is largely within the West and Central wards. The North ward includes some residential estates north of the A52 (Derby Road), including a small part of the Wollaton urban area that falls within Broxtowe. To the west lie [[Bramcote Hills]] and the Bramcote ward. The original Beeston/Bramcote boundary is still marked on the A52.\n\nThe Beeston Rylands ward has a larger area than the other three wards as it includes unpopulated [[floodplain]]s of the River Trent and industrial areas, including the part of the Boots campus. The Rylands ward also extends north of the railway line to Queens Road and includes the former site of Nottingham Rugby Club.\n\nTo the west of Beeston Rylands lies the [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]] ward; while the Chilwell East ward lies to the west of Beeston West.  \n[[File:Beeston wards map.png|thumb|right|The historic area of the town (the 1933 civil parish area) in blue, and the present-day ward boundaries within the borough of Broxtowe]]\nA review of ward boundaries in 2000 brought changes to Beeston's western boundary. In the north-west, Beeston Cemetery and the residential streets surrounding it (to the south of Derby Road) such as Coniston Road and Windermere Road, as well as the ''Nuseryman'' pub and the eastern part of Beeston Fields Golf Course, were transferred to Bramcote ward. Beeston gained some territory from Chilwell in residential streets such as Park Road, Grove Avenue and Cumberland Avenue, and in Nottingham College and the industrial patch between Holly Lane and Wilmot Lane.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original boundary between the old Beeston and Chilwell parishes can still be identified by a road-name change on the site of the ''Hop Pole'' pub, from [[Chilwell Road, Beeston|Chilwell Road]] on the Beeston side to High Road on the Chilwell side.\n\n====Elections====\n{{see also|Broxtowe local elections}}\nBeeston's four wards each return two councillors to Broxtowe Borough Council. For Nottinghamshire County Council the town is covered by two [[electoral division]]s, each with a county councillor: Beeston North (North and West wards) and Beeston South & Attenborough (Central, Rylands and Attenborough wards).<ref>[http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/home/your_council/councilelections/electionresultsbydivision09.htm?division=19#84 Nottinghamshire County Council]</ref>\n\nFor elections to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] the town is part of the [[Broxtowe (UK Parliament constituency)|Broxtowe constituency]]. From 1974 to 1983 a [[Beeston (UK Parliament constituency)|Beeston constituency]] existed. The present Member of Parliament is [[Darren Henry]], of the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative party]].\n\n===History of local government===\nBeeston is an [[unparished area]] and has no town council, but it was a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] until 1935.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120917204026/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10256665 Vision of Britain] Beeston (ancient/civil parish)</ref> The parish area was reduced in 1933, with some lands in the east transferred to the City of Nottingham; boundary posts were erected on the new Beeston-Nottingham boundary and many are still in place today, with \"1933\" marked on them. The present four wards cover the same post-1933 area of the old parish, with the two recent alterations made to the western boundary, as described in the \"Wards\" section above.\n\nFrom 1935 until 1974 (when the borough of Broxtowe was formed) Beeston was paired with the town of [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] (2&nbsp;km to the west) in the [[Beeston and Stapleford]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. Previously a [[Beeston Urban District]] existed, covering Beeston parish. The town was the administrative centre of Beeston and Stapleford Urban District Council and is the administrative centre for Broxtowe Borough Council, which has its head offices in Foster Avenue at Beeston Town Hall and the other council buildings there.\n\n===Geographic locale===\n{{Geographic Location\n|title = '''Destinations from Beeston'''\n|Northwest = [[Ilkeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]], [[Bramcote]]\n|North     = [[Wollaton]], [[Bilborough]]\n|Northeast = ''[[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park]]'', [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]], [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]]<br/>'''[[Nottingham]]'''\n|West      = [[Ockbrook]], [[Sandiacre]]<br/>'''[[Derby]]'''\n|Centre    = Beeston\n|East      = ''[[The Boots Estate|Boots Estate]]'', [[West Bridgford]]\n|Southwest = [[Sawley, Derbyshire|Sawley]], [[Long Eaton]], [[Toton]]<br/>''[[East Midlands Airport]]''\n|South     = [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], [[Barton in Fabis]], [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire|Gotham]]  \n|Southeast = [[Clifton, Nottinghamshire|Clifton]], [[Ruddington]]\n}}\n\n==Origins of the name==\nThe earliest name of the settlement was ''Bestune'', recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=The Place-Names of Nottinghamshire |last=Gover |first=J.

There is a sculpture in the High Road of a man sitting next to a beehive, popularly known as the \"Bee-man\", \"the man of Beeston\", etc., though officially called \"The Beeston Seat\". The sculptor was Sioban Coppinger in 1987, modelling a friend, Stephen Hodges, for his \"timeless ability to exude calm when all else are succumbing to stress.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.siobancoppinger.co.uk/work/64d87/ |title=BEESTON SEAT \u2013 Sioban Coppinger |first=Designed by Brown & |last=Brown |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Domesday===\nIn Bestune at the Conquest, the Saxons Alfag, Alwine and UIchel had three manors consisting of three [[carucate]]s of land assessed. These were taken from them and given to William Peverel, lord of Nottingham Castle, who had in his [[demesne]] two plough teams, 17 bond tenants called [[villeins]], unable to leave the estate without the lord's consent, each farming some {{convert|15|acre|ha}} of arable, and one ordinary tenant or sochman. Together they had nine plough teams. There were {{convert|24|acre|ha}} of meadow. The annual yield of the estate was 30 shillings.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Walskipper-Beeston Boiler-001.jpg|thumb|A Beeston Boiler still in use in South Africa, 2008]]\nBeeston outgrew its village status as a silk weaving centre in the early 19th century. The first silk mill was burnt down (along with [[Nottingham Castle]]) in the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] riots of 1831. With the decline of the silk industry, many former mills gained light industrial uses in the early 20th century. Equipment made by the [[Beeston Boiler Company]] is still found all over the former [[British Empire]].\n\nBetween 1880 and the turn of the century, [[Thomas Humber]] and partners made bicycles and eventually motor-cycles and cars at a factory at the junction of what are now Queens Road and Humber Road. At its height it employed 2000, although this ended abruptly in 1907 when the firm moved to Coventry.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Population of Beeston, Nottinghamshire.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Population of Beeston, now just over 21,000 inhabitants]]<!-- Calculated from four Beeston wards. This is NOT the population of the Beeston-Stapleford urban district-->\nIn 1901 the [[National Telephone Company]] built a factory in Beeston for telephone materials. This was taken over by the British [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|L.M. Ericsson Manufacturing Co. Ltd.]] in 1903. Shortly before the transfer, most of the old factory was destroyed by fire, and in the rebuilding it was extended. A new power station was built. In 1906 and 1907 a large building was erected, chiefly devoted to cabinet work. The old factory building covered an area of {{convert|63000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, the cabinet factory {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, and the power station {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, making a total of {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Although most of the factory buildings were low rise, a [[paternoster lift]] survived in E-block at the site until it was demolished in 2016.\n\nUnder the [[Plessey]] name these large premises continued as a major source of employment through the 1980s. Plessey became [[GEC-Plessey Telecommunications|GPT]] with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]'s involvement. With the various restructurings of the [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] group and its rebranding as [[Marconi Electronic Systems|Marconi]], much of the site was sold to [[Siemens]] along with the private telephone-network side of the business. Siemens sublet much of the site as a \"technology park\" when it moved most manufacturing overseas.\n\nSMS Electronics was formed from a [[management buyout]] of the manufacturing facility of Siemens in 2003. It won the [[Queens Award for Export]] in 2012 and employs over 200. The whole site was acquired by [[HSBC]] in 2006 for a mixed-use \"employment-led\" redevelopment. In 2007 a building was constructed for [[Atos|Atos Origin]] which at the time was the largest pre-let buildings in the Midlands.\n\nThe Boots campus includes three [[listed building|listed]] modernist buildings designed by engineer [[Owen Williams (engineer)|Owen Williams]] (two Grade I, one Grade II), though they are difficult to see from outside.

The church was first lit with gas in 1857. A Public Lighting Act was adopted at a vestry meeting on 13 November 1862. Opposition to the street lamps was strong, and the effigy of an active promoter of it was carried on an ass round the village and hung on a lamp-post, and but for police interference would have been burned. In 1861 gas was supplied from Nottingham by the [[Nottingham Corporation Gas Department#Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company|Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company]] and for street lamps in 1872. Beeston was connected to the mains water supply in 1876.\n\n[[File:AngloScotianMills.JPG|thumb|left|[[Anglo Scotian Mills]] on Wollaton Road by [[James Huckerby]] 1892]]\n\nThe [[crenellation|crenellated]] [[listed building]] of the [[Anglo Scotian Mills]]<ref name=\"listed\"/> remains on Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre. It is a solitary reminder of the former dominance of silk and lace mills on the skyline. The buildings have been converted into apartments by a developer. A cottage on the north side of Anglo Scotian Mills was reputed to have the tallest domestic chimney in England.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its length was necessary to reach over the roof of the Mill. Although the cottage has been demolished for several years, the chimney can still be seen attached to the Mill wall.\n\nA rare survival is the G H Hurt & Son Shawl Factory, which is occasionally open to the public. Shawls are produced on knitting machines and hand finished in much the same way as they have been for centuries. The factory contains examples of knitting frames from the 17th century.\n\nLost industrial buildings include the rebuilt silk mill and the looming bulk of the Neville Works mill on the boundary with Chilwell (later occupied by the Myford lathe factory).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===The Land Societies===\n====St John's Grove Estate====\nAfter the enclosure of the land surrounding Beeston in 1809, the area of [[St John's Grove, Beeston|St John's Grove]] was allotted to the vicar of the parish church. In 1878 the land was acquired from the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] by the Beeston Land Society, a group of citizens, who divided it into 28 plots of between three-quarters and {{convert|1|acre|ha|adj=on}} and laid out wide, straight streets. Most of the houses date from Edwardian and late Victorian times. The Land Society set conditions for developers. There were to be no public houses, and strict building lines would ensure that properties were set back a consistent distance from the road. The St John's Grove Estate is now a conservation area.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 St John's Conservation Area description \u2013 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002310/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 |date=18 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\n====Imperial Park Estate====\nShortly after 1878, the Imperial Park Land Society and its sister the Beeston Building Society were founded. They aimed to assist the development and financing of superior housing around what is now Imperial Road, north of Newton Street, adjacent to the St John's Grove development and bounded on the north by North Street. The early model was to have savings made by a group of subscribers and funds allocated by the drawing of lots, in turn for each of them to build a house.\n\n====Bellevue Park Estate====\nThis initial success was repeated when, in 1881, a syndicate acquired land from George Fellows, of the banking family that had its home at Belle Vue, now Beeston Fields Golf Club. The Belle Vue Land Society was formed to develop this land using similar methods to Imperial Park. The development lay to the north as a continuation to Imperial Park. Denison Street formed its northern extreme and Montague Street defined its eastern limit.\n\n====Cottage Grove====\nCottage Grove, historically was just outside Beeston parish and part of [[Chilwell]], was promoted by the [[Labourer's Friend Society]] in the 1840s as plots for cottages with allotments for the labouring poor. The scheme failed and the area now consists mostly of Victorian and Edwardian houses laid out along the parallel Park Road and Grove Avenue and the two short cross streets Cedar Road and North Drive. The area retains a leafy character and the roads remain unkerbed. It has been a conservation area since 2008.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236  Cottage Grove Conservation Area description \u2013 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918015056/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236 |date=18 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====The Estates today====\nSome areas originally developed by the Land Societies have been spoiled where original plots have been subdivided and more modern properties built in styles not in keeping with the original buildings. Many properties in the Imperial Park and Bellvue Estates have lost their original elegance with the lowering of chimney stacks, inappropriate replacement of windows and doors with modern PVC, the loss of hedged fronts to brick walls or fencing, and paving over front gardens for parking.\n\n===Other development===\n[[File:ChilwellRoadMethodistChurch.JPG|thumb|Methodist Church on Chilwell Road]]\n[[File:BeestonBaptistChurch.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church on Dovecote Lane, formerly known as John Clifford Baptist Church]]\nA [[Chilwell Road Methodist Church|particularly fine Methodist Church]] was built by the architect W.

Further east Broadgate saw improvements, with a new space at the top entrance to Broadgate Recreation Ground. The works were completed in late 2006.\n\nThe shopping centre is traversed by Wollaton Road. An area south-east of the shopping centre has made room for a [[Tesco]] superstore, which opened 1 November 2010, rivalling the [[Sainsbury's]] store in the town centre and the recent [[Lidl]] store in Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre.

It is separated from [[Bramcote]] to the north-west by the Beeston Fields Golf Course. The Broxtowe-City of Nottingham border essentially forms the town's eastern edge. The main area and shopping district lies to the north of the [[Midland Main Line|railway line]], and the mixed residential and industrial area of Beeston Rylands to the south.\n\n===Beeston Rylands===\n[[File:Beeston Canal - geograph.org.uk - 53033.jpg|thumb|right|The Beeston Canal passing through Rylands]]\nRylands was originally a small settlement around Beeston Lock, comprising some tens of houses and two pubs, although the name now refers to all of the area south of the railway line. The ''Jolly Angler'' was originally on the river side of the canal, but has since moved.<ref>[http://www.beeston-notts.co.uk/landmark_pubs3.shtml Beeston history website] ''Jolly Angler''</ref> Beeston began to spread south of the railway line in the late 19th century, when a few Victorian villas were built near the level crossing by the station.\n\nOver the first few decades of the 20th century, several estates were built to house workers at [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|Ericssons]] and Boots, both of which had large factories south of the railway line. These estates joined Beeston and Rylands. Further development after the Second World War filled gaps, initially with an estate of council houses and flats, and latterly with private houses and bungalows. The last significant development, in 1970, was Meadow Farm, now the four roads of timber-framed semi-detached houses between Beech Avenue and the canal.  Since then Beeston Rylands has had a small amount of infill development.\n\nBeeston Rylands was historically at risk of flooding from the [[River Trent]] to the south. This reduced property values and the size of houses built there, predominantly for the rental market. The last serious flood, in 1947, reached beyond the railway line: most of Queens Road was flooded, as was Nether Street. Strengthened flood defences have reduced the risk of flooding to a probability of once every fifty years. A series of flood-defence improvements, costing \u00a351 million and designed to decrease the expected flood incidence to once in a hundred years, began in 2009 along a {{convert|27|km|mi|order=flip}} stretch of the Trent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8602573.stm BBC News] Attenborough flood defence plans submitted</ref>\n\n===University of Nottingham===\nThe eastern edge of Beeston abuts the [[University of Nottingham]]'s University Park campus, through which runs Beeston Lane.\n\nAlthough most of the University is within the City of Nottingham, around half the self-catering flats in the [[Broadgate Park]] hall of residence fall within Beeston. Nearer still is Albion House, which is associated with the main Broadgate Park site.\n\nBeeston has a large population of postgraduate students, who supposedly prefer the quieter atmosphere compared to [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]] and [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]], where many undergraduates live.\n\n===Wards===\n{{see also|Borough of Broxtowe#Wards}}\nBeeston divides into four [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] for local electoral purposes within the borough of Broxtowe: Beeston North, Beeston Central, Beeston Rylands and Beeston West.<ref name=\"Wards\">[http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe Boundary Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509213923/http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe |date=9 May 2011}} \u2013 Broxtowe</ref>\n\nBeeston's town centre is largely within the West and Central wards. The North ward includes some residential estates north of the A52 (Derby Road), including a small part of the Wollaton urban area that falls within Broxtowe. To the west lie [[Bramcote Hills]] and the Bramcote ward. The original Beeston/Bramcote boundary is still marked on the A52.\n\nThe Beeston Rylands ward has a larger area than the other three wards as it includes unpopulated [[floodplain]]s of the River Trent and industrial areas, including the part of the Boots campus. The Rylands ward also extends north of the railway line to Queens Road and includes the former site of Nottingham Rugby Club.\n\nTo the west of Beeston Rylands lies the [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]] ward; while the Chilwell East ward lies to the west of Beeston West.  \n[[File:Beeston wards map.png|thumb|right|The historic area of the town (the 1933 civil parish area) in blue, and the present-day ward boundaries within the borough of Broxtowe]]\nA review of ward boundaries in 2000 brought changes to Beeston's western boundary. In the north-west, Beeston Cemetery and the residential streets surrounding it (to the south of Derby Road) such as Coniston Road and Windermere Road, as well as the ''Nuseryman'' pub and the eastern part of Beeston Fields Golf Course, were transferred to Bramcote ward. Beeston gained some territory from Chilwell in residential streets such as Park Road, Grove Avenue and Cumberland Avenue, and in Nottingham College and the industrial patch between Holly Lane and Wilmot Lane.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original boundary between the old Beeston and Chilwell parishes can still be identified by a road-name change on the site of the ''Hop Pole'' pub, from [[Chilwell Road, Beeston|Chilwell Road]] on the Beeston side to High Road on the Chilwell side.\n\n====Elections====\n{{see also|Broxtowe local elections}}\nBeeston's four wards each return two councillors to Broxtowe Borough Council.

Previously a [[Beeston Urban District]] existed, covering Beeston parish. The town was the administrative centre of Beeston and Stapleford Urban District Council and is the administrative centre for Broxtowe Borough Council, which has its head offices in Foster Avenue at Beeston Town Hall and the other council buildings there.\n\n===Geographic locale===\n{{Geographic Location\n|title = '''Destinations from Beeston'''\n|Northwest = [[Ilkeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]], [[Bramcote]]\n|North     = [[Wollaton]], [[Bilborough]]\n|Northeast = ''[[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park]]'', [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]], [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]]<br/>'''[[Nottingham]]'''\n|West      = [[Ockbrook]], [[Sandiacre]]<br/>'''[[Derby]]'''\n|Centre    = Beeston\n|East      = ''[[The Boots Estate|Boots Estate]]'', [[West Bridgford]]\n|Southwest = [[Sawley, Derbyshire|Sawley]], [[Long Eaton]], [[Toton]]<br/>''[[East Midlands Airport]]''\n|South     = [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], [[Barton in Fabis]], [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire|Gotham]]  \n|Southeast = [[Clifton, Nottinghamshire|Clifton]], [[Ruddington]]\n}}\n\n==Origins of the name==\nThe earliest name of the settlement was ''Bestune'', recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=The Place-Names of Nottinghamshire |last=Gover |first=J.

These were taken from them and given to William Peverel, lord of Nottingham Castle, who had in his [[demesne]] two plough teams, 17 bond tenants called [[villeins]], unable to leave the estate without the lord's consent, each farming some {{convert|15|acre|ha}} of arable, and one ordinary tenant or sochman. Together they had nine plough teams. There were {{convert|24|acre|ha}} of meadow. The annual yield of the estate was 30 shillings.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Walskipper-Beeston Boiler-001.jpg|thumb|A Beeston Boiler still in use in South Africa, 2008]]\nBeeston outgrew its village status as a silk weaving centre in the early 19th century. The first silk mill was burnt down (along with [[Nottingham Castle]]) in the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] riots of 1831. With the decline of the silk industry, many former mills gained light industrial uses in the early 20th century. Equipment made by the [[Beeston Boiler Company]] is still found all over the former [[British Empire]].\n\nBetween 1880 and the turn of the century, [[Thomas Humber]] and partners made bicycles and eventually motor-cycles and cars at a factory at the junction of what are now Queens Road and Humber Road. At its height it employed 2000, although this ended abruptly in 1907 when the firm moved to Coventry.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Population of Beeston, Nottinghamshire.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Population of Beeston, now just over 21,000 inhabitants]]<!-- Calculated from four Beeston wards. This is NOT the population of the Beeston-Stapleford urban district-->\nIn 1901 the [[National Telephone Company]] built a factory in Beeston for telephone materials. This was taken over by the British [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|L.M. Ericsson Manufacturing Co. Ltd.]] in 1903. Shortly before the transfer, most of the old factory was destroyed by fire, and in the rebuilding it was extended. A new power station was built. In 1906 and 1907 a large building was erected, chiefly devoted to cabinet work. The old factory building covered an area of {{convert|63000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, the cabinet factory {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, and the power station {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, making a total of {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Although most of the factory buildings were low rise, a [[paternoster lift]] survived in E-block at the site until it was demolished in 2016.\n\nUnder the [[Plessey]] name these large premises continued as a major source of employment through the 1980s. Plessey became [[GEC-Plessey Telecommunications|GPT]] with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]'s involvement. With the various restructurings of the [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] group and its rebranding as [[Marconi Electronic Systems|Marconi]], much of the site was sold to [[Siemens]] along with the private telephone-network side of the business. Siemens sublet much of the site as a \"technology park\" when it moved most manufacturing overseas.\n\nSMS Electronics was formed from a [[management buyout]] of the manufacturing facility of Siemens in 2003. It won the [[Queens Award for Export]] in 2012 and employs over 200. The whole site was acquired by [[HSBC]] in 2006 for a mixed-use \"employment-led\" redevelopment. In 2007 a building was constructed for [[Atos|Atos Origin]] which at the time was the largest pre-let buildings in the Midlands.\n\nThe Boots campus includes three [[listed building|listed]] modernist buildings designed by engineer [[Owen Williams (engineer)|Owen Williams]] (two Grade I, one Grade II), though they are difficult to see from outside.

It allowed goods traffic from the Erewash valley to bypass the [[River Erewash]] and [[River Trent]]. In response, a Beeston Canal was promoted by the [[Trent Navigation Company]] in 1794. This stretched from Beeston Cut to Lenton, over a weir at Beeston Rylands.

Both are included in the West End [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]], which covers several buildings, many historical or of character, along Dovecote Lane, Grange Avenue, West End, and Church Street. Included in the area is the historic Village Cross.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4232 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609154002/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4232 |date=9 June 2011 }} \u2013 Beeston West End conservation area</ref>\n\nAn [[Inclosure acts|enclosure act]] was passed for the parish of Beeston, and in 1809 the Commissioners stated that the lands amounted to {{convert|822|acre|km2}}, to be made tithe free, and the ancient enclosed lands and homesteads liable to tithe was \u00a3687 2s 29d. They then proceeded to fix the width of the roads. The Nottingham and Derby turnpike road was fixed at {{convert|50|foot|m}}. Wollaton Road, then called Cowgate, was {{convert|30|foot|m}}. The enclosures altered the appearance of part of the parish from a moor growing poor grass to cultivated fields with hedges, and so increased the food supply. It relieved farmers of their duty to pay a tenth of their product in kind.\n\nSome lands on or near [[Bramcote Moor]], but in Beeston parish, were enclosed in 1847, by provisional order of the Inclosure Commissioners.\n\nBefore the general introduction of gas in the parish, there was a limited supply from the Mill to separate houses. The church was first lit with gas in 1857. A Public Lighting Act was adopted at a vestry meeting on 13 November 1862. Opposition to the street lamps was strong, and the effigy of an active promoter of it was carried on an ass round the village and hung on a lamp-post, and but for police interference would have been burned. In 1861 gas was supplied from Nottingham by the [[Nottingham Corporation Gas Department#Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company|Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company]] and for street lamps in 1872. Beeston was connected to the mains water supply in 1876.\n\n[[File:AngloScotianMills.JPG|thumb|left|[[Anglo Scotian Mills]] on Wollaton Road by [[James Huckerby]] 1892]]\n\nThe [[crenellation|crenellated]] [[listed building]] of the [[Anglo Scotian Mills]]<ref name=\"listed\"/> remains on Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre. It is a solitary reminder of the former dominance of silk and lace mills on the skyline. The buildings have been converted into apartments by a developer. A cottage on the north side of Anglo Scotian Mills was reputed to have the tallest domestic chimney in England.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its length was necessary to reach over the roof of the Mill. Although the cottage has been demolished for several years, the chimney can still be seen attached to the Mill wall.\n\nA rare survival is the G H Hurt & Son Shawl Factory, which is occasionally open to the public. Shawls are produced on knitting machines and hand finished in much the same way as they have been for centuries. The factory contains examples of knitting frames from the 17th century.\n\nLost industrial buildings include the rebuilt silk mill and the looming bulk of the Neville Works mill on the boundary with Chilwell (later occupied by the Myford lathe factory).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===The Land Societies===\n====St John's Grove Estate====\nAfter the enclosure of the land surrounding Beeston in 1809, the area of [[St John's Grove, Beeston|St John's Grove]] was allotted to the vicar of the parish church. In 1878 the land was acquired from the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] by the Beeston Land Society, a group of citizens, who divided it into 28 plots of between three-quarters and {{convert|1|acre|ha|adj=on}} and laid out wide, straight streets. Most of the houses date from Edwardian and late Victorian times. The Land Society set conditions for developers. There were to be no public houses, and strict building lines would ensure that properties were set back a consistent distance from the road. The St John's Grove Estate is now a conservation area.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 St John's Conservation Area description \u2013 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002310/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 |date=18 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\n====Imperial Park Estate====\nShortly after 1878, the Imperial Park Land Society and its sister the Beeston Building Society were founded. They aimed to assist the development and financing of superior housing around what is now Imperial Road, north of Newton Street, adjacent to the St John's Grove development and bounded on the north by North Street. The early model was to have savings made by a group of subscribers and funds allocated by the drawing of lots, in turn for each of them to build a house.\n\n====Bellevue Park Estate====\nThis initial success was repeated when, in 1881, a syndicate acquired land from George Fellows, of the banking family that had its home at Belle Vue, now Beeston Fields Golf Club. The Belle Vue Land Society was formed to develop this land using similar methods to Imperial Park. The development lay to the north as a continuation to Imperial Park. Denison Street formed its northern extreme and Montague Street defined its eastern limit.\n\n====Cottage Grove====\nCottage Grove, historically was just outside Beeston parish and part of [[Chilwell]], was promoted by the [[Labourer's Friend Society]] in the 1840s as plots for cottages with allotments for the labouring poor. The scheme failed and the area now consists mostly of Victorian and Edwardian houses laid out along the parallel Park Road and Grove Avenue and the two short cross streets Cedar Road and North Drive. The area retains a leafy character and the roads remain unkerbed. It has been a conservation area since 2008.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236  Cottage Grove Conservation Area description \u2013 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918015056/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236 |date=18 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====The Estates today====\nSome areas originally developed by the Land Societies have been spoiled where original plots have been subdivided and more modern properties built in styles not in keeping with the original buildings. Many properties in the Imperial Park and Bellvue Estates have lost their original elegance with the lowering of chimney stacks, inappropriate replacement of windows and doors with modern PVC, the loss of hedged fronts to brick walls or fencing, and paving over front gardens for parking.\n\n===Other development===\n[[File:ChilwellRoadMethodistChurch.JPG|thumb|Methodist Church on Chilwell Road]]\n[[File:BeestonBaptistChurch.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church on Dovecote Lane, formerly known as John Clifford Baptist Church]]\nA [[Chilwell Road Methodist Church|particularly fine Methodist Church]] was built by the architect W.

The lines running to the right are the tapes of genetic instructions, which are copied along with the body of the machines. The machine shown runs in a 32-state version of von Neumann's cellular automata environment, not his original 29-state specification.]]\n\n[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.<ref name=TSRA>{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}</ref>\n\nVon Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.\n\nTo define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells.\n\nThe universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.\n\n== Purpose ==\n\nVon Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.<ref name=McMullin2000>{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347\u2013361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}</ref> However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.<ref name=\"walenz.org\">[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThis universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].\n\nNote that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou\u2013Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.\n\nThe concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.\n\nVon Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.\n\nThe combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.<ref name=McMullin2000/> The image below illustrates this possibility.\n\nThis insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.<ref name=Rocha_lec_notes>{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}</ref> The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutation]]s) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].\n\n[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]\n\n== Implementations ==\n\n[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.\n\n[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.<ref name=Pesavento1995/><ref name=NobiliPesavento1996>{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc.

As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.\n\nIn 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.\n\nC. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y.

The lines running to the right are the tapes of genetic instructions, which are copied along with the body of the machines. The machine shown runs in a 32-state version of von Neumann's cellular automata environment, not his original 29-state specification.]]\n\n[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.<ref name=TSRA>{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}</ref>\n\nVon Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.\n\nTo define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells.\n\nThe universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.\n\n== Purpose ==\n\nVon Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.<ref name=McMullin2000>{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347\u2013361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}</ref> However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.<ref name=\"walenz.org\">[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThis universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].\n\nNote that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou\u2013Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.\n\nThe concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.\n\nVon Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.\n\nThe combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.<ref name=McMullin2000/> The image below illustrates this possibility.\n\nThis insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.<ref name=Rocha_lec_notes>{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}</ref> The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutation]]s) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].\n\n[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]\n\n== Implementations ==\n\n[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.\n\n[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.<ref name=Pesavento1995/><ref name=NobiliPesavento1996>{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc.

As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.\n\nIn 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.\n\nC. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y.

On 3 October, Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] officially opened the NFSA's headquarters in Canberra.\n\n==History of the organisation==\n\nThe work of the Archive can be officially dated to the establishment of the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (part of the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) by a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] decision on 11 December 1935.\n\nAfter being part of the National Library of Australia, and its predecessors, for nearly 50 years, the National Film and Sound Archive was created as a separate [[Commonwealth]] collecting institution through an announcement in Parliament on 5 April 1984 that took immediate effect.<ref name=\"NAA CA 4123\">{{citation|title=CA 4123: National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+4123|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> At that time, an Advisory Committee was established to guide the institution.\n\nOn 21 June 1999, the name was changed to ScreenSound Australia, the National Collection of Screen and Sound, and changed again in early 2000 to ScreenSound Australia, National Screen and Sound Archive.

Following elections in November 2007, however, the new Labor Government implemented an election promise to allow the NFSA to become a [[statutory authority]], similar to other major cultural institutions including the [[National Library of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[National Museum of Australia]].

Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[Australian Institute of Anatomy]]! -->\n{{main|Australian Institute of Anatomy}}\n[[File:National Film and Sound Archive viewed near McCoy Circuit.jpg|right|thumb|The National Film and Sound Archive fronts onto McCoy Circuit.]]\nThe building to which the Archive moved in 1984 was the home of the Australian Institute of Anatomy from 1931-84. Originally it held the anatomy collection of [[William Colin Mackenzie|Sir Colin MacKenzie]]. This collection included the heart of the celebrated Australian racehorse [[Phar Lap]].\n\nThe building is often classified as [[art deco]], though its overall architectural style is technically \"Late 20th Century Stripped Classical\", the style of ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised.  It features a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, a horizontal skyline, classical columns and a central entrance. The decorative foyer features images of native flora, fauna and Aboriginal art and motifs. Face masks of well-known scientists from the late 19th century and early 20th century are featured on the foyer\u2019s walls as a reminder of its previous incarnation as the Institute of Anatomy.\n\nThe building also features a landscaped courtyard, theatre and research centre. In 1999, the building was extended to accommodate the Archive's growth. The new wing\u2019s design is in keeping with the Art Deco style of the main structure with details and finishes to match the original.\n\n==Awards==\n\n===Ken G Hall Film Preservation Award===\nThe Ken G Hall Film Preservation Award was established in 1995 as a tribute to producer/director Ken G Hall. It is presented in recognition of an individual, group, or organisation, for their outstanding contribution to the art of moving image and its preservation. It is presented to candidates where there is a significant link between their work and its impact or relationship to the Australian film industry. Examples of this contribution include technical innovation, scholarship in the field, involvement with the survival of film as an art form and as a cultural experience, advocacy, sponsorship and fundraising.\n\n*2012 Susanne Chauvel Carlsson\n*2011 David Hannay\n*2010 [[Patricia Lovell]]\n*2009 Ian Dunlop\n*2006 [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]]\n*2005 [[Phillip Noyce]]\n*2004 Graham Shirley\n*2003 Tom Nurse\n*2002 Judy Adamson\n*2001 Murray Forrest\n*2000 [[Anthony Buckley]]\n*1999 Joan Long\n*1998 Not awarded\n*1997 [[Kodak]] Australasia\n*1996 [[Peter Weir]]\n*1995 Alan Rydge and [[Rupert Murdoch]]\n\n===National Folk Recording Award===\nThe NFSA National Folk Recording Award was established in 2001 to encourage and reward excellence in Australian folk music recording.

The NFSA was found to generally provide more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=Alan|title=YouTube versus the National Film and Sound Archive: Which Is the More Useful Resource for Historians of Australian Television?|journal=[[Television & New Media]]|year=2011|volume=12|issue=2|page=154}}</ref>\n\nThe NFSA announced plans to collect Australian-developed video games as part of its collection starting in 2019 with new titles to be added on an annual basis.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/national-film-and-sound-archive-of-australia-to-collect-preserve-aussie-video-games | title = National Film and Sound Archive of Australia to Collect, Preserve Aussie Video Games | first=  Luke | last = Reilly | date =September 26, 2019 | accessdate = September 26, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Special Collections ===\n* Film Australia Collection: contains a diverse range of more than 3,000 titles of Australian documentary and educational programs, spanning a century of Commonwealth documentary and docu-drama titles (1913\u20132008).\n* The [[Sounds of Australia]] is the NFSA's selection of sound recordings with cultural, historical and aesthetic significance and relevance, which inform or reflect life in Australia. It was established in 2007. Each year, the Australian public nominates new sounds to be added with final selections determined by a panel of industry experts.\n* NFSA Restores is the NFSA's program to digitise, restore and preserve, at the highest archival standards, classic and cult Australian films so they can be seen on the big screen in today's digital cinemas.\n* Oral History Collection\n* Non-Theatrical Lending Collection: Non-theatrical screenings take place on a non-commercial basis (no direct admission charge is levied) and are held by: educational, cultural, social and religious institutions; community groups; churches; film societies; government bodies; hospitals; libraries; museums and galleries.\n* Australian Jazz Archive\n\n== History of the building ==\n<!-- This is a SUMMARY. Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[Australian Institute of Anatomy]]! -->\n{{main|Australian Institute of Anatomy}}\n[[File:National Film and Sound Archive viewed near McCoy Circuit.jpg|right|thumb|The National Film and Sound Archive fronts onto McCoy Circuit.]]\nThe building to which the Archive moved in 1984 was the home of the Australian Institute of Anatomy from 1931-84. Originally it held the anatomy collection of [[William Colin Mackenzie|Sir Colin MacKenzie]]. This collection included the heart of the celebrated Australian racehorse [[Phar Lap]].\n\nThe building is often classified as [[art deco]], though its overall architectural style is technically \"Late 20th Century Stripped Classical\", the style of ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised.  It features a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, a horizontal skyline, classical columns and a central entrance. The decorative foyer features images of native flora, fauna and Aboriginal art and motifs. Face masks of well-known scientists from the late 19th century and early 20th century are featured on the foyer\u2019s walls as a reminder of its previous incarnation as the Institute of Anatomy.\n\nThe building also features a landscaped courtyard, theatre and research centre. In 1999, the building was extended to accommodate the Archive's growth. The new wing\u2019s design is in keeping with the Art Deco style of the main structure with details and finishes to match the original.\n\n==Awards==\n\n===Ken G Hall Film Preservation Award===\nThe Ken G Hall Film Preservation Award was established in 1995 as a tribute to producer/director Ken G Hall. It is presented in recognition of an individual, group, or organisation, for their outstanding contribution to the art of moving image and its preservation. It is presented to candidates where there is a significant link between their work and its impact or relationship to the Australian film industry. Examples of this contribution include technical innovation, scholarship in the field, involvement with the survival of film as an art form and as a cultural experience, advocacy, sponsorship and fundraising.\n\n*2012 Susanne Chauvel Carlsson\n*2011 David Hannay\n*2010 [[Patricia Lovell]]\n*2009 Ian Dunlop\n*2006 [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]]\n*2005 [[Phillip Noyce]]\n*2004 Graham Shirley\n*2003 Tom Nurse\n*2002 Judy Adamson\n*2001 Murray Forrest\n*2000 [[Anthony Buckley]]\n*1999 Joan Long\n*1998 Not awarded\n*1997 [[Kodak]] Australasia\n*1996 [[Peter Weir]]\n*1995 Alan Rydge and [[Rupert Murdoch]]\n\n===National Folk Recording Award===\nThe NFSA National Folk Recording Award was established in 2001 to encourage and reward excellence in Australian folk music recording.
