Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''''' is the eighth [[studio album]] by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]]. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom{{refn|group=nb|According to author Allen J. Wiener, the album's intended release date of 1 June has been \"traditionally observed\" over the ensuing decades, yet the true release date was 26 May.{{sfn|Wiener|1992|p=31}}}} and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and 15 weeks at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between [[popular music]] and [[high art]], and for reflecting the interests of [[Baby boomers|contemporary youth]] and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture]]. It won four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1968, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], the first rock [[LP record|LP]] to receive this honour.\n\nIn August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to [[London]] in November, [[Paul McCartney]] had an idea for a song involving an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] military band that formed the impetus of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept. Sessions began on 24 November at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] with two compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Penny Lane]]\", but after pressure from [[EMI]], the songs were released as a [[double A-side]] single and left off the album.\n\nIn February 1967, after recording [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|the title track]], McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This [[alter ego]] group further inspired the band to experiment artistically. During the recording sessions, there was no thought of reproducing the songs in concert, and the band were free to continue the technological experimentation marked by their previous album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer [[George Martin]] and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], the group approached the [[Recording studio as an instrument|studio as an instrument]], colouring much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" and \"[[A Day in the Life]]\". Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|tableau of celebrities and historical figures]], was designed by the [[pop art]]ists [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Jann Haworth]].\n\n''Sgt. Pepper'' is regarded by musicologists as an early [[concept album]] that advanced the use of [[Cyclic form|extended form]] in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. An important work of British [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including [[vaudeville]], [[Circus music|circus]], [[music hall]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and [[Classical music|Western]] and [[Indian classical music]]. It is described as one of the first [[art rock]] LPs, a progenitor to [[progressive rock]], and the starting point of the [[album era]]. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] placed ''Sgt. Pepper'' in the [[National Recording Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"LoC2003\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it as the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|greatest album of all time]]. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, and remains the UK's best-selling studio album. Professor Kevin Dettmar, writing in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', described it as \"the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\".{{sfn|Dettmar|2006|p=139}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{quote box|quote= We were fed up with being the Beatles.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. Gould adds that McCartney's succumbing to peer pressure allowed Lennon \"to play the role of psychedelic guide\" to his songwriting partner, thereby facilitating a closer collaboration between the two than had been evident since early in the Beatles' career.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=388\u201389}} For his part, Lennon had turned deeply introspective during the filming of ''How I Won the War'' in southern Spain in September 1966. His anxiety over his and the Beatles' future was reflected in \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\",{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=332\u201333}} a song that provided the initial theme, regarding a Liverpool childhood, of the new album.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}} On his return to London, Lennon embraced the city's arts culture, of which McCartney was a part,{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=88}} and shared his bandmate's interest in [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] and [[Electronic music|electronic-music]] composers such as [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[John Cage]] and [[Luciano Berio]].{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=165}}{{sfn|Prendergast|2003|p=193}}\n\nIn November, during his and Evans' return flight from Kenya, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the ''Sgt.

Pepper'' reflect the Beatles' general immersion in the [[blues]], [[Motown]] and other American popular musical traditions.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=62}} The author [[Ian MacDonald]] writes that when reviewing their rivals' recent work in late 1966, the Beatles identified the most significant LP as [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', which [[Brian Wilson]], the band's leader, had created in response to the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]''.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215}} McCartney was highly impressed with the \"harmonic structures\" and choice of instruments used on ''Pet Sounds'', and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could \"get further out\" than the Beach Boys had.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=197}} He identified ''Pet Sounds'' as his main musical inspiration for ''Sgt. Pepper'', adding that \"[we] nicked a few ideas\",{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=204}} although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=253}} ''[[Freak Out!]]'' by [[the Mothers of Invention]] has also been cited as having influenced ''Sgt. Pepper''.{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=160}} According to the biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], during the recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: \"This is our ''Freak Out!''\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=158}} The music journalist [[Chet Flippo]] stated that McCartney was inspired to record a [[concept album]] after hearing ''Freak Out!''{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=160}}\n\n[[Indian music]] was another touchstone on ''Sgt. Pepper'', principally for Lennon and Harrison.{{sfn|Reck|2008|pp=69, 72\u201373}} In a 1967 interview, Harrison said that the Beatles' ongoing success had encouraged them to continue developing musically and that, given their standing, \"We can do things that please us without conforming to the standard pop idea. We are not only involved in pop music, but all music.\"{{sfn|Philo|2015|p=119}} McCartney envisioned the Beatles' alter egos being able to \"do a bit of [[B.B. King]], a bit of Stockhausen, a bit of [[Albert Ayler]], a bit of Ravi Shankar, a bit of ''Pet Sounds'', a bit of [[the Doors]]\".{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=19}} He saw the group as \"pushing frontiers\" similar to other composers of the time, even though the Beatles did not \"necessarily like what, say, Berio was doing\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005}}\n\n== Recording and production ==\n===Recording history===\n[[File:Abbeyroadtomswain.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A colour image of a large room with a piano in the middle|[[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road Studio Two]], where nearly every track on ''Sgt.

Pepper'' marks the beginning of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote more than half of the album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}}{{refn|group=nb|In Emerick's opinion, the recording of ''Sgt.

When the decision was made to re-record the basic track, Starr was summoned to the studio, but called off soon afterwards as the focus switched from rhythm to vocal tracking.{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=270}} Much of the bass guitar on the album was mixed upfront.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=52}} Preferring to overdub his bass part last, McCartney tended to play other instruments when recording a song's backing track. This approach afforded him the time to devise bass lines that were melodically adventurous \u2013 one of the qualities he especially admired in Wilson's work on ''Pet Sounds'' \u2013 and complemented the song's final arrangement.<ref>{{harvnb|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=169\u201370}}; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=281}}: \"one of the qualities he especially admired on ''Pet Sounds''\".</ref> McCartney played a [[grand piano]] on \"[[A Day in the Life]]\" and a [[Lowrey organ]] on \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", while Martin played a [[Hohner Pianet]] on \"Getting Better\", a [[harpsichord]] on \"[[Fixing a Hole]]\" and a [[pump organ|harmonium]] on \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\"<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=104}}: Lowrey organ on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=106}}: Hohner Pianet on \"Getting Better\", {{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=107}}: harpsichord on \"Fixing a Hole\"; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=110}}: harmonium on \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\"; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=120}}: grand piano on \"A Day in the Life\".</ref>\n\nAlthough Harrison's role as lead guitarist was limited during the sessions, Everett considers that \"his contribution to the album is strong in several ways.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=100}} In addition to providing sitar and [[Tanpura|tambura]] on his composition \"[[Within You Without You]]\", and [[swarmandal]] on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", Harrison played tambura on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"Getting Better\".{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=104, 106, 111}}{{refn|group=nb|In a 2017 interview, Starr said with regard to Harrison's guitar contributions: \"Actually, Paul and I were talking about him when we were both listening to ''Sgt Pepper's'' for the [50th] anniversary and saying how important George's work on guitar was on that record.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/ringo-starr-the-voice-behind-the-yellow-submarine-and-tank-engine-returns-on-give-more-love/news-story/c5eb865f1b73a574e82930ff04f4bb92|first=Kathy|last=McCabe|title=Ringo Starr: The voice behind the yellow submarine and tank engine returns on Give More Love|work=[[news.com.au]]|date=17 September 2017|accessdate=2 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202095605/https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/ringo-starr-the-voice-behind-the-yellow-submarine-and-tank-engine-returns-on-give-more-love/news-story/c5eb865f1b73a574e82930ff04f4bb92|archive-date=2 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} As on ''Revolver'',{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=112}} the Beatles also increasingly used session musicians, particularly for classical-inspired arrangements.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=197}} Norman comments that Lennon's prominent vocal on some of McCartney's songs \"hugely enhanced their atmosphere\", particularly \"[[Lovely Rita]]\".{{sfn|Norman|2016|p=263}}\n\nWithin an hour of completing the last overdubs on the album's songs, on 20 April 1967, the group returned to Harrison's \"[[Only a Northern Song]]\", the basic track of which they had taped in February.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=109}} The Beatles overdubbed random sounds and instrumentation before submitting it as the first of four new songs they were contracted to supply to [[United Artists]] for inclusion in the animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=102}} In author [[Mark Lewisohn]]'s description, it was a \"curious\" session, but one that demonstrated the Beatles' \"tremendous appetite for recording\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=109}} During the ''Sgt.

ADT was invented by Townsend during the ''Revolver'' sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative to having to record doubled lead vocals.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2010|p=216}} Another important effect was [[Pitch shift|varispeeding]], a technique that the Beatles used extensively on ''Revolver''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190}} Martin cites \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" as having the most variations of tape speed on ''Sgt.

During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=105}} For the album's title track, the recording of Starr's drum kit was enhanced by the use of [[Damping (music)|damping]] and [[Microphone practice#Basic techniques|close-miking]].

He also said that in the context of 1967, ''Sgt.

But it couldn't be done, because only the Beatles can put out an album by the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=188}}{{refn|group=nb|Everett similarly characterises ''Their Satanic Majesties Request'' and the [[Small Faces]]' ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]'' as ''Sgt.

He added that [[the Velvet Underground]]'s ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'', an album that contrasted sharply with the Beatles' message by \"offer[ing] no escape\", became more relevant in a cultural climate typified by \"the [[Sex Pistols]], the new political aggression, the rioting in the streets\" during the 1970s.<ref name=\"Frith/HoR\" /> In a 1987 review for ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, [[Charles Shaar Murray]] asserted that ''Sgt.

Ned Rorem and Leonard Bernstein.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|pp=155}} According to Rodriguez, an element of exaggeration accompanied some of the acclaim for ''Sgt.

Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Lydon|title=Paul Williams ''Outlaw Blues: A Book of Rock Music''|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 April 1969|p=}}</ref>\n\n=== Studio as instrument ===\n{{Main|Recording studio as an instrument}}\n{{quote box|quote= Equal credit [for ''Sgt.

The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance.\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=167}}\n\nIn his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', David Howard says that many acts, \"from the Rolling Stones to [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]] to the [[Ultimate Spinach]]\", soon imitated the album's innovative production techniques, and that as a result of ''Sgt. Pepper'', the producer's role \"ballooned almost overnight\".{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=31}} In this regard, Lennon and McCartney complained that Martin had received too much attention for his role in the album's creation,{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|pp=172\u201373}} so beginning a feeling of resentment by the Beatles towards their longtime producer.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=489}}{{refn|group=nb|The group were particularly annoyed that ''Time'' had referred to ''Sgt.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''''' is the eighth [[studio album]] by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]]. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom{{refn|group=nb|According to author Allen J. Wiener, the album's intended release date of 1 June has been \"traditionally observed\" over the ensuing decades, yet the true release date was 26 May.{{sfn|Wiener|1992|p=31}}}} and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and 15 weeks at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between [[popular music]] and [[high art]], and for reflecting the interests of [[Baby boomers|contemporary youth]] and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture]]. It won four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1968, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], the first rock [[LP record|LP]] to receive this honour.\n\nIn August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to [[London]] in November, [[Paul McCartney]] had an idea for a song involving an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] military band that formed the impetus of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept. Sessions began on 24 November at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] with two compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Penny Lane]]\", but after pressure from [[EMI]], the songs were released as a [[double A-side]] single and left off the album.\n\nIn February 1967, after recording [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|the title track]], McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This [[alter ego]] group further inspired the band to experiment artistically. During the recording sessions, there was no thought of reproducing the songs in concert, and the band were free to continue the technological experimentation marked by their previous album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer [[George Martin]] and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], the group approached the [[Recording studio as an instrument|studio as an instrument]], colouring much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" and \"[[A Day in the Life]]\". Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|tableau of celebrities and historical figures]], was designed by the [[pop art]]ists [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Jann Haworth]].\n\n''Sgt. Pepper'' is regarded by musicologists as an early [[concept album]] that advanced the use of [[Cyclic form|extended form]] in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. An important work of British [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including [[vaudeville]], [[Circus music|circus]], [[music hall]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and [[Classical music|Western]] and [[Indian classical music]]. It is described as one of the first [[art rock]] LPs, a progenitor to [[progressive rock]], and the starting point of the [[album era]]. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] placed ''Sgt. Pepper'' in the [[National Recording Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"LoC2003\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it as the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|greatest album of all time]]. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, and remains the UK's best-selling studio album. Professor Kevin Dettmar, writing in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', described it as \"the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\".{{sfn|Dettmar|2006|p=139}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{quote box|quote= We were fed up with being the Beatles.

Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=229}} In June that year, two days after finishing the album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', the group set off for a [[The Beatles' 1966 tour of Germany, Japan and the Philippines|tour that started in West Germany]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} While in [[Hamburg]] they received an anonymous telegram stating: \"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\"{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}} The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred [[Nippon Budokan]] arena.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}} As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewisohn|2010|p=211}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}}.</ref> The Beatles then performed in the [[Philippines]], where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]].

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. Gould adds that McCartney's succumbing to peer pressure allowed Lennon \"to play the role of psychedelic guide\" to his songwriting partner, thereby facilitating a closer collaboration between the two than had been evident since early in the Beatles' career.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=388\u201389}} For his part, Lennon had turned deeply introspective during the filming of ''How I Won the War'' in southern Spain in September 1966. His anxiety over his and the Beatles' future was reflected in \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\",{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=332\u201333}} a song that provided the initial theme, regarding a Liverpool childhood, of the new album.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}} On his return to London, Lennon embraced the city's arts culture, of which McCartney was a part,{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=88}} and shared his bandmate's interest in [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] and [[Electronic music|electronic-music]] composers such as [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[John Cage]] and [[Luciano Berio]].{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=165}}{{sfn|Prendergast|2003|p=193}}\n\nIn November, during his and Evans' return flight from Kenya, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the ''Sgt.

Pepper'' reflect the Beatles' general immersion in the [[blues]], [[Motown]] and other American popular musical traditions.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=62}} The author [[Ian MacDonald]] writes that when reviewing their rivals' recent work in late 1966, the Beatles identified the most significant LP as [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', which [[Brian Wilson]], the band's leader, had created in response to the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]''.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215}} McCartney was highly impressed with the \"harmonic structures\" and choice of instruments used on ''Pet Sounds'', and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could \"get further out\" than the Beach Boys had.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=197}} He identified ''Pet Sounds'' as his main musical inspiration for ''Sgt. Pepper'', adding that \"[we] nicked a few ideas\",{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=204}} although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=253}} ''[[Freak Out!]]'' by [[the Mothers of Invention]] has also been cited as having influenced ''Sgt.

Pepper'' recordings made extensive use of [[Ping-pong recording|reduction mixing]], a technique in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and [[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio.<ref>{{cite liner notes|last=Lewisohn|first=Mark|year=2009|title=Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band| publisher=Apple/EMI Records|p=29}}</ref> EMI's [[Studer]] J37 four-track machines were well suited to reduction mixing, as the high quality of the recordings that they produced minimised the increased noise associated with the process.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=199}} When recording the orchestra for \"A Day in the Life\", Martin synchronised a four-track recorder playing the Beatles' backing track to another one taping the orchestral overdub. The engineer [[Ken Townsend]] devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50&nbsp;Hz control signal between the two machines.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2010|p=244}}\n\n{{quote box|quote= Listening to each stage of their recording, once they've done the first couple of tracks, it's often hard to see what they're still looking for, it sounds so complete.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\" was the first example of the Beatles recording via direct injection (DI), which Townsend devised as a method for plugging electric guitars directly into the recording console.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=170}} In Womack's opinion, the use of DI on the album's title track \"afforded McCartney's bass with richer textures and tonal clarity\".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=170}}\n\nSome of the mixing employed [[automatic double tracking]] (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. ADT was invented by Townsend during the ''Revolver'' sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative to having to record doubled lead vocals.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2010|p=216}} Another important effect was [[Pitch shift|varispeeding]], a technique that the Beatles used extensively on ''Revolver''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190}} Martin cites \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" as having the most variations of tape speed on ''Sgt. Pepper''. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=105}} For the album's title track, the recording of Starr's drum kit was enhanced by the use of [[Damping (music)|damping]] and [[Microphone practice#Basic techniques|close-miking]].

We were all conscious that we were doing something that was great.\" He said that while McCartney effectively led the project, and sometimes annoyed his bandmates, \"Paul appreciated John's contribution on ''Pepper''.

Pepper'', you had to try to write something as good as ''Sgt. Pepper''. Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Lydon|title=Paul Williams ''Outlaw Blues: A Book of Rock Music''|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 April 1969|p=}}</ref>\n\n=== Studio as instrument ===\n{{Main|Recording studio as an instrument}}\n{{quote box|quote= Equal credit [for ''Sgt.

Pepper'' \"people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance.\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=167}}\n\nIn his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', David Howard says that many acts, \"from the Rolling Stones to [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]] to the [[Ultimate Spinach]]\", soon imitated the album's innovative production techniques, and that as a result of ''Sgt.

It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1457>{{cite NSW SHR|5051355|Beckers Bridge over Webbers Creek|hr=01457|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nErnest de Burgh, the designer of DeBurgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n===Beckers Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was advertised for tender in 1901, with W.

It has a single timber truss [[Span (architecture)|span]] of {{convert|27.7|m|ft|0}}. There is a single timber approach span at each end giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|45.4|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nThe superstructure is supported by timber trestles and provides a carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0}}. The guard rail is of timber post and rail construction and extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1902, Beckers Bridge is an early example of a DeBurgh timber truss road bridge. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest DeBurgh, the designer of this type of truss. DeBurgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works engineer Ernest M. DeBurgh, the DeBurgh truss is an adaptation of the American Pratt truss design. The DeBurgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nDeBurgh trusses were significant technical improvements over their predecessors. Situated in the Hunter region, Beckers bridge gains heritage significance because of its proximity to 15 other historic bridges, each constructed before 1905. In 1998 there were 10 surviving DeBurgh trusses in NSW of the 20 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Beckers bridge is a representative example of DeBurgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nBeckers Bridge over Webbers Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest DeBurgh, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible.

Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nErnest de Burgh, the designer of DeBurgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n===Beckers Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was advertised for tender in 1901, with W.

The guard rail is of timber post and rail construction and extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1902, Beckers Bridge is an early example of a DeBurgh timber truss road bridge. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest DeBurgh, the designer of this type of truss. DeBurgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works engineer Ernest M. DeBurgh, the DeBurgh truss is an adaptation of the American Pratt truss design. The DeBurgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nDeBurgh trusses were significant technical improvements over their predecessors. Situated in the Hunter region, Beckers bridge gains heritage significance because of its proximity to 15 other historic bridges, each constructed before 1905. In 1998 there were 10 surviving DeBurgh trusses in NSW of the 20 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Beckers bridge is a representative example of DeBurgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nBeckers Bridge over Webbers Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest DeBurgh, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible.

One thought is that the club was connected to the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club, now the St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, whose colours \u2013 blue and white \u2013 are reflected in the club's colours today.<ref>Rickard, John, An assemblage of decent men and women : a history of the Anglican parish of St Mary's North Melbourne 1853\u20132000. / John Rickard St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, North Melbourne, Vic. :  2008</ref> The association between the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club and the establishment of the North Melbourne Football Club is believed to have been an informal gathering to play some competitive sport. Information on the club's first ever match is limited, but it is known that it took place in [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]], which also served as the club's home ground until 1882. The ball used in the match was purchased by a local resident called Tom Jacks, who sold some roofing iron to pay for it.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[James Henry Gardiner]] is considered the founder of the club. He continued an active role with North Melbourne until his death in 1921.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nRegular premiership matches of Australian Football commenced in Victoria in 1870. Although North Melbourne was a part of this, it was classed as a \"junior club\". ''The Australasian'' noted them as being \"one of the best of many junior clubs\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe club continued to develop, graduating to senior ranks in 1874, finishing 4th.

In 1877, the club was re-established as a stand-alone club under the new name of \"Hotham\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Leader |location=Melbourne, VIC |title=Football Notes |author=Nomad |date=9 July 1877 |page=12}}</ref>\n\n===Association years===\n[[File:NMFCchart.png|thumb|Chart showing the progress of North Melbourne F.C. through the VFA and V/AFL]]\n\nFootball took a giant step forward in 1877, with the formation of Victoria's first colonial football league, the VFA. Hotham were prime movers in establishing this league and were afforded a place in light of their previous contributions to Australian Football.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe 1880s marked the emergence of the modern identity we now associate with North today. In 1882, the club amalgamated with the Hotham Cricket Club and moved into the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve (Arden St Oval), which remains the home of the club today. The joint venture was aimed at affecting improvements at the Hotham Cricket Ground, which was the name of the Reserve at the time. Four years later the club adopted the traditional uniform of blue and white vertical stripes at the insistence of the VFA, who wanted a visible contrast between Geelong's and Hotham's uniforms. The third significant development occurred in 1888 with the club returning to its original name of the North Melbourne Football Club. This followed the name of the local area reverting from Hotham to North Melbourne.\n\nThe 1880s saw the club develop a penchant for inter-colonial travel with trips to Tasmania (1881/1887) and South Australia (1889). Hotham also found itself well represented at the first ever inter-colonial representative game in 1879 with four players from the club gaining selection for Victoria.\n\n===Disregarded by the VFL===\n[[File:Nmfc1903.jpg|300px|thumb|[[1903 VFA season|\"The Inaugurals\"]].

Led by Geelong and Essendon, the largest clubs of the VFA formed their own break away league, the Victorian Football League (VFL), in 1896. Despite finishing 6th in 1896, North Melbourne was not invited to the breakaway competition. The main reasons for being excluded were:\n* North had not won a premiership yet, and thus was not considered a powerful club\n* The industrialisation of the locality had drained the club's income streams\n* The club had a strong reputation for hooliganism from their fans\n* There was a lot of bad blood between Collingwood and North following a torrid engagement in the previous season\n* Essendon felt threatened by the proximity of North Melbourne\n* A court case against the North Melbourne Cricket Club had damaged the Football Club's status\n\nNorth continued on in the depleted VFA, emerging as a powerhouse, finishing 2nd in 1897, 1898 and 1899. In 1903, after 34 years of competing, the club won its first premiership, defeating Richmond in the final. The club became back to back premiers in 1904 after Richmond [[1904 VFA Grand Final|forfeited the grand final]] due to the appointment of an umpire whose performance when the two teams met earlier in the year was severely criticised by Richmond players and officials.<ref name=\"Atkinson\">{{cite book |last=Atkinson |first=Graeme |title=3AW Book of Footy Records |year=1989 |publisher=Magistra Publishing Company Pty Ltd |location=South Melbourne |isbn=1-86321-009-1 |pages=278}}.</ref>\n\nNorth merged with fellow VFA football club West Melbourne in 1907, which at the time had lost its home ground. The joint venture saw a chance of promotion, and the club applied for admission to the more prestigious VFL in 1908, but Richmond and University were admitted instead. North was kicked out of the VFA during the 1907/08 offseason as a result of applying to join the VFL,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |title=North Melbourne club |date=4 April 1908 |page=15 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> before the local community reestablished the North Melbourne Football Club under a new committee, successfully enabling the club to play in the VFA in the 1908 season.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |title=Football \u2013 the Victorian Association |date=18 April 1908 |page=6 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Invincibles\"===\nThe reformation of the Club necessitated a massive clean out of the team, leaving only two players remaining from the previous season. The 1910 season was marked by one of the most sensational transfers in Victorian football history, when Andy Curran masterminded the clearance of Carlton's famed \"Big Four\" of 'Mallee' Johnson, [[Fred Jinks]], [[Charlie Hammond]] and Frank 'Silver' Caine to North Melbourne. These signings secured the Northerners' third premiership in 1910.\n[[File:SBarkerNMelb.jpg|125px|thumb|[[Syd Barker, Sr.]], club legend and star ruckman of \"The Invincibles\" era.]]\nThe 1912 finals series was one of the most amazing ever, with the semi-final having to be played three times, after North and Brunswick drew twice. North was eventually victorious and moved on to the final, but lost the game by a mere four points with the last kick of the day.\n\nThe next few years were punctuated by \"The Invincibles\". In the Northerners' most illustrious period ever, the club went undefeated from 1914 to 1919, collecting premierships in 1914, 1915 and 1918 \u2013 the league was in recess in 1916 and 1917 due to [[World War I]]. As well as this, the club won the championship in both 1915 and 1918 for finishing on top of the ladder, and accounted for VFL side St Kilda comfortably. During this period the club won 58 consecutive matches including 49 successive premiership matches, a record that has remained unmatched in Association or League history since.\n\nDespite being rejected from the VFL in both 1896 and 1907, North persisted in trying to gain admission into the League. On 30 June 1921, North told its players it would disband and try to gain entry to the VFL by the 'back-door'. Essendon League Football Club had lost its playing ground at East Melbourne and had decided to acquire the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve as a new playing ground. North accepted their proposal in the idea that the clubs would amalgamate. All of North's players were urged to join the [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon League Club]] to help facilitate the amalgamation. The amalgamation was foiled when some members of the VFA launched a successful legal challenge.<ref name=\"12AugustArgus\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |date=12 August 1921 |title=North Melbourne ground |page=6 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> As a result, the Essendon League Club moved instead to the Essendon Oval, replacing the ground's original occupants, [[Essendon Association Football Club|Essendon Association]].\n\nNorth was now without a playing team and the Essendon Association Club was now without a ground, so as a matter of convenience the two clubs amalgamated so they could compete in the 1922 season. As it had after the merger with West Melbourne, North once again managed to avert its destruction.\n\n===Entering the VFL===\n\nAfter three attempts, 29 years of waiting and numerous other applications to enter the VFL, finally North was rewarded for its persistence with admittance to the League in 1925, along with Footscray and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. Even then, the opportunity was almost lost as the League delegates debated into the early hours of the morning on which clubs should be invited to join the intake. It was only after much deliberation that North Melbourne's name was eventually substituted for [[Prahran FC|Prahran's]] making North \"the lucky side\" of the invitees that included Footscray and Hawthorn. North Melbourne was forced to change its uniform to avoid a clash when it joined the VFL.\n\nNorth Melbourne were cellar dwellers for its first twenty-five years of [[Australian Football League|VFL]] membership and struggled to win matches in the superior VFL competition, but by the late 1940s had developed a strong list and significant supporter base. In 1949 North secured the VFL Minor Premiership, finishing top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season with 14 wins and 5 losses. They failed to make the Grand Final that year (eventually won by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]), but in 1950 they did reach the final, defeated by a more efficient Essendon. It was in this year that the club adopted the \"Kangaroos\" mascot.<ref>Gerard Dowling, \"North Melbourne Football Club\", in Andrew Brown-May and [[Shurlee Swain]], ''The Encyclopedia of Melbourne'', Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2005, p.511.</ref>\n[[File:Gasometer North Melbourne 1928.jpg|thumb|North Melbourne and Arden St Oval after admission to the VFL. c. 1928]]\n\nIn February 1965, North Melbourne [[1965 VFA season#North Melbourne's move to Coburg Oval|moved its playing and training base]] from the Arden Street Oval to [[Coburg City Oval|Coburg Oval]], signing a seven-year lease with the [[City of Coburg]]<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=51 |author= |date=30 March 1965 |title=North gets lease}}</ref> after initially negotiating long-term leases for up to 40 years.<ref name=\"sun3nov\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=34 |author= |date=3 November 1964 |title=North can have a new oval}}</ref> The club came to an arrangement to merge with the VFA's [[Coburg Football Club]], whom it was displacing from the ground;<ref name=\"sun9dec\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |pages=63\u201364 |author=Scot Palmer |date=9 December 1964 |title=Coburg, North merger}}</ref> fourteen Coburg committeemen joined the North Melbourne committee, but the merger was never completed after Coburg established a rival committee which remained loyal to the VFA.<ref name=\"sun6feb\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=56 |author= |date=6 February 1965 |title=Coburg to stay in Association}}</ref> The lease at Coburg lasted only eight months; the Coburg council was hesitant to build a new grandstand without the security of a long-term lease, and neither party made the returns they expected, so it was terminated by mutual agreement in September 1965 and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=51 |author= |date=28 September 1965 |title=Coburg to drop stand?}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=52 |author= |date=29 September 1965 |title=North to quit Coburg}}</ref>\n\nOnfield, the 1950s and 1960s were lean years for North Melbourne, though the club did secure two consecutive Night Premierships in 1965 and 1966. [[Allen Aylett]] was a brilliant player in the late 1950s and early 1960s (and captain between 1961 and 1964), as was [[Noel Teasdale]], who lost the [[Brownlow Medal]] on a countback in 1965 (he was later awarded a retrospective medal when the counting system was amended).\n\n===Golden era===\nIn the late 1960s, under the leadership of [[Allen Aylett]], North Melbourne began its climb to supremacy.

In a major coup, the great [[Ron Barassi]] was appointed coach in 1973. Barrassi reversed the club's playing fortunes, taking a struggling team that was once regarded as the traditional cellar dwellers of the competition through to a golden era of success that transformed North Melbourne into one of the powerhouses of the VFL. Barassi took North to a Grand Final (losing to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] by 41 points) in 1974 and brought success in his 1975 and 1977 seasons.

McCartney wore the numbers \"88\" and \"202\" on the front of his long-sleeved {{not a typo|guernsey}} for the match, signifying the Australian and total number of victims of the Bali bombings, while many in the crowd bore signs reading \"Bali 88/202\".\n\nOnfield, the club reached the elimination finals in 2002 and 2005, but otherwise failed to reach the finals from 2001 until 2006.\nAfter two seasons of finals North Melbourne dropped to 13th in 2009, and coach Dean Laidley announced his resignation with Darren Crocker acting as caretaker coach for the rest of the season, to eventually be replaced by ex-Brisbane Lions premiership player and Collingwood assistant coach [[Brad Scott (Australian footballer)|Brad Scott]].

It is also played before every match.\n\n\"Join in the Chorus\" is believed to be the oldest club anthem of any AFL club and has been associated with North from its early VFA days.

The lyrics have occasionally been changed, including updating the year in the song (e.g. \"North Melbourne will be premiers in 1993\"), or to remove the words \"North Melbourne\" during the period when the club was competing only as the  Kangaroos.\n\nFor the 2015 premiership season, [[You Am I]]'s lead singer, [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]], a North Melbourne supporter, announced that he would assist in an updated version of the song including the two verses.

Members of the club serve as the guarantees of capital and have full voting rights at AGMs to elect directors to the club's board.\n\nThe club's board of directors has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure of the terms of the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune to a lot of the in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.\n\nNorth Melbourne is unique in its structure, because from 1986 to 2006 the club was privately owned and limited by shares. The club was floated in 1986 through a membership vote led by then chairman Bob Ansett. At the meeting, members were encouraged to buy into the club by purchasing shares. The float ended up raising over $3&nbsp;million and helped to keep the club solvent through the next decade.\n\nIn 1991, the [[John Elliott (businessman)|John Elliott]]-led [[Carlton Football Club]] attempted a hostile take over North Melbourne by purchasing a large parcel of shares formerly owned by Bob Ansett. The Blues acquired 20 per cent of the capital but that stake was eventually bought back by John Magowan, the former head of Merrill Lynch Australia, in 2001. The resulting melodrama saw the formation of B-Class shareholders who had the effective power of veto over any attempt to merge or relocate the club.\n\nFurther takeover attempts were made in the first decade of the 21st century by the [[Southport Sharks]]. Then chairman Allan Aylett knocked back a proposal from the Sharks that would have seen them gain a majority stake in the club in exchange for an injection of capital. In early 2006, another proposal from Sharks to underwrite the Kangaroos' games on the Gold Coast, in exchange for a slice of the shareholder structure at the club was knocked back after AFL intervention.\n\nDue to an [[Australian Taxation Office]] ruling in 2006, the club proposed a shareholder restructure that would have seen the B Class shareholders power reduced significantly and some voting rights returned to members. This was done to avoid extraordinary taxes being placed on the club, but the move was blocked in December by Bob Ansett and his proxies who feared that the restructure would make the club vulnerable to further takeover bids.\n\nOn 28 February 2007, another meeting was called to resolve the shareholder issue. A motion was passed that would return see some voting rights return to members and stop any future tax increments.\n\nIn April 2007 it was revealed the AFL was attempting to buy out the shareholders of the club in a bid to gain full ownership, and force a relocation of the club to the Gold Coast.\n\nDuring October 2007, a group called [[We Are North Melbourne]] emerged and launched a public campaign, calling for ordinary members to be given the final say on the relocation issue. While the group became synonymous with the push to keep the club in Melbourne, its first priority was to see the club's shareholder structure wound-up and control returned to ordinary members.\n\nNorth Melbourne reverted to public company in November 2008. A moratorium was passed at an extraordinary general meeting that will allow James Brayshaw's board to serve unopposed until 2010, so as to allow his ticket the maximum time to enact their policies to make the North Melbourne Football Club financially viable.\n\nOn 20 November 2016, former Aussie Rules footballer and Football Federation Australia chairman [[Ben Buckley]] replaced James Brayshaw as the new chairman of the club.\n\n===Sponsorship===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; width:75%;\"\n|-\n!

North supporters have long been bitter with [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] for excluding them from the VFL, and have blamed that for their small supporter base in comparison to Essendon's. North's first [[VFL Grand Final]] was against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in [[1950 VFL Grand Final|1950]]. The rivalry was reignited in the 90s as both teams were constantly in premiership contention. In 1998, following comments by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] coach labelling Kangaroos executives Greg Miller and Mark Dawson \"marshmallows\", a reference to their softness, North supporters threw marshmallows at Sheedy after the opening Qualifying Final.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sheeds still baiting the crowd on marshmallow anniversary |url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-06-30/marshmallow-moments-not-forgotten |website=AFL Website |accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> In 2014 North Melbourne versed Essendon in Elimination Final 2 Essendon was leading by 30 odd points then North came back to win by 12 points<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2014/24/nmfc-v-ess</ref>\n\n'''Hawthorn'''{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} \u2013 North and Hawthorn have a fierce rivalry that dates back to the 1970s when they played off against each other in three Grand Finals in the space of four years. From 1974 to 1978 the two clubs played against each other in ten finals, and took each other on for the Australian Championship in Adelaide in 1976. During the 1980s Hawthorn dominated North, and during the 90s the results were reversed with North dominating Hawthorn.\nNorth Melbourne defeated Hawthorn in the 1975 Grand Final by 55 points. However, Hawthorn defeated North Melbourne in the 1976 Grand Final by 30 points and in the 1978 Grand Final by 18 points.\nThe rivalry re-ignited in 2014 following a choking incident involving [[Brian Lake]] having North Melbourne forward [[Drew Petrie]] in a choking hold during a clash between the two sides at [[Docklands Stadium]] and reached fever pitch in 2015 following several fights including an all in during the first term of their round 5 clash.\n\n===Minor===\n'''Collingwood''' \u2013 North and Collingwood have a small kind of rivalry between them. As they drew in the [[1977 VFL Grand Final|1977 Grand Final]], which North went on to win in the replay by 27 points.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/afl-grand-final-countdown-no2-North-melbourne-v-collingwood-1977/story-e6frf3e3-1225778963326 AFL grand final countdown No.2: North Melbourne v Collingwood, 1977]</ref>\nIn 2019 [[North Melbourne]] and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] faced off in Round 15 and the Collingwood banner said \"Kanga, Kanga, Kanga Roo, Roo, Roo The Pies, Pies, Pies Will beat, Beat you\" Instead, North Melbourne Held Collingwood to their lowest score since 1994, and of course after a goal they chanted \"KANGA KANGA KANGA!\"ROO ROO\" To annoy Collingwood Supporters. Also the rivalry extends to the press with Collingwood President Edward Mcguire encouraging North to relocate to tasmania for being the smallest club in Melbourne and expansion if \"the game.\"<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2019/15/coll-v-nmfc</ref>\n  \n'''Carlton''' \u2013 Although not known for their on-field rivalry, North Melbourne and Carlton have endured a tumultuous off-field relationship. In 1965, North Melbourne moved to the [[Coburg City Oval]], which Carlton opposed as an invasion of its own territory: Coburg was located within Carlton's recruiting zone, and was home to about of quarter of Carlton's members at the time.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=66 |author=Rex Pullen |date=5 November 1964 |title=North move to Coburg under fire}}</ref> Later, after North Melbourne was listed on the stock market in 1987, Carlton bought 20% of the shares to become part-owner of the rival club.

This was Port's only loss in the first 12 rounds of [[2014 AFL season|2014]].\n\nPort Adelaide lost their first finals appearance to North Melbourne in 1999 in the qualifying final, and in Port's premiership year of [[2004 AFL season|2004]], North beat Port by 92 points, however, Port beat North Melbourne in both the [[2005 AFL finals series#First Elimination Final (5 vs 8)|2005 Elimination Final]] and [[2007 AFL season#Preliminary Finals|2007 Preliminary Final]] by 87 points. In 2019 North beat Port Adelaide by 86 points to end Port's finals hopes for 2019, restarting the rivalry.\n\n'''Richmond''' \u2013 A rivalry that began as a result of North's loss to Richmond in the 1974 Grand Final, the two sides have shared an on and off rivalry ever since. Both sides since their 1975 preliminary final meeting (which North Melbourne won) have mostly been unsuccessful on the field. The rivalry re-ignited in the 2010s due to the clubs recent on field success and accumulated in a clash during the [[2015 AFL finals series]] which North won by 17 points and was preceded by a provocative banner which read, 'Tigers Don't Win Finals, We Do'.\n\n==Club honour board==\n\n===Honour roll===\n{{Main|North Melbourne Football Club honour roll}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#BDB76B;\"\n!

From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a [[reserve team|reserves competition]], and from 1992 to 1999 a ''de facto'' AFL reserves competition was run by the [[Victorian State Football League]], and North Melbourne fielded its reserves team in both of these competitions while it was in the VFL/AFL, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for North Melbourne in the lower grade. During that time, the North Melbourne reserves team won seven premierships (1947, 1957, 1967, 1978, 1979, 1995, 1996).\n\nFollowing the demise of the AFL reserves competition, North Melbourne's reserves team was dissolved, and over the following eighteen years the club entered [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliations]] with a range of [[Victorian Football League]] clubs.

the '''Kangaroos''' or less formally the '''Roos''', the '''Kangas''' or '''North''', is an [[Australian rules football]] club that competes in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), the sport's premier competition. Founded in [[North Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1869, it is based at its traditional home ground, [[Arden Street Oval]], and currently plays its home matches at both the nearby [[Docklands Stadium]] and [[Blundstone Arena]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].\n\nThe club's mascot is a grey [https://www.nmfc.com.au/news/2018-05-03/meet-ruby kangaroo donning the club uniform], and its use dates from the mid-20th century. The club is also unofficially known as \"The Shinboners\", a term which dates back to its 19th-century abattoir-worker origins. The club's motto is ''Victoria amat curam'', Latin for \"Victory Demands Dedication\". Aside from their representation in the AFL, the Kangaroos also field teams in the following competitions; [[AFL Women's]], [[VFL Women's]] and [[Victorian Football League]].\n\n==Club history==\n{{quote|In two aspects North Melbourne stands second to none.

Founding father of the NMFC.]]\n\nNorth Melbourne Football Club was founded in [[North Melbourne]] in 1869 by local cricketers desiring to keep fit over the winter months. One thought is that the club was connected to the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club, now the St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, whose colours \u2013 blue and white \u2013 are reflected in the club's colours today.<ref>Rickard, John, An assemblage of decent men and women : a history of the Anglican parish of St Mary's North Melbourne 1853\u20132000. / John Rickard St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, North Melbourne, Vic. :  2008</ref> The association between the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club and the establishment of the North Melbourne Football Club is believed to have been an informal gathering to play some competitive sport. Information on the club's first ever match is limited, but it is known that it took place in [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]], which also served as the club's home ground until 1882. The ball used in the match was purchased by a local resident called Tom Jacks, who sold some roofing iron to pay for it.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[James Henry Gardiner]] is considered the founder of the club. He continued an active role with North Melbourne until his death in 1921.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nRegular premiership matches of Australian Football commenced in Victoria in 1870. Although North Melbourne was a part of this, it was classed as a \"junior club\". ''The Australasian'' noted them as being \"one of the best of many junior clubs\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe club continued to develop, graduating to senior ranks in 1874, finishing 4th. Along with the promotion, the club adopted its first uniform of blue and white horizontal stripes.<ref name=\"Timetoast 2019\">{{cite web |title=The evolution of the football jumper - North Melbourne Football Club 1874 |website=Timetoast |date=4 May 2019 |url=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-evolution-of-the-football-jumper-north-melbourne-football-club-1874-2015 |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1876, North Melbourne disbanded, and many of its player and members joined [[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert-park]],<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=North Melbourne Advertiser |location=North Melbourne, VIC |title=Football |author=Tonball |page=3 |date=26 May 1876}}</ref> giving the club such a strong North Melbourne character that many described it as \"Albert-park ''cum'' North Melbourne\". In 1877, the club was re-established as a stand-alone club under the new name of \"Hotham\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Leader |location=Melbourne, VIC |title=Football Notes |author=Nomad |date=9 July 1877 |page=12}}</ref>\n\n===Association years===\n[[File:NMFCchart.png|thumb|Chart showing the progress of North Melbourne F.C. through the VFA and V/AFL]]\n\nFootball took a giant step forward in 1877, with the formation of Victoria's first colonial football league, the VFA. Hotham were prime movers in establishing this league and were afforded a place in light of their previous contributions to Australian Football.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe 1880s marked the emergence of the modern identity we now associate with North today. In 1882, the club amalgamated with the Hotham Cricket Club and moved into the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve (Arden St Oval), which remains the home of the club today. The joint venture was aimed at affecting improvements at the Hotham Cricket Ground, which was the name of the Reserve at the time. Four years later the club adopted the traditional uniform of blue and white vertical stripes at the insistence of the VFA, who wanted a visible contrast between Geelong's and Hotham's uniforms. The third significant development occurred in 1888 with the club returning to its original name of the North Melbourne Football Club. This followed the name of the local area reverting from Hotham to North Melbourne.\n\nThe 1880s saw the club develop a penchant for inter-colonial travel with trips to Tasmania (1881/1887) and South Australia (1889). Hotham also found itself well represented at the first ever inter-colonial representative game in 1879 with four players from the club gaining selection for Victoria.\n\n===Disregarded by the VFL===\n[[File:Nmfc1903.jpg|300px|thumb|[[1903 VFA season|\"The Inaugurals\"]].

To commemorate the achievement, club President [[George Prendergast|G/M Prendergast]] presented the 26 players and head trainer with a gold medal at the club's general meeting that year.]]\n\nThe VFA grew to 13 senior clubs in the 1890s. Led by Geelong and Essendon, the largest clubs of the VFA formed their own break away league, the Victorian Football League (VFL), in 1896. Despite finishing 6th in 1896, North Melbourne was not invited to the breakaway competition. The main reasons for being excluded were:\n* North had not won a premiership yet, and thus was not considered a powerful club\n* The industrialisation of the locality had drained the club's income streams\n* The club had a strong reputation for hooliganism from their fans\n* There was a lot of bad blood between Collingwood and North following a torrid engagement in the previous season\n* Essendon felt threatened by the proximity of North Melbourne\n* A court case against the North Melbourne Cricket Club had damaged the Football Club's status\n\nNorth continued on in the depleted VFA, emerging as a powerhouse, finishing 2nd in 1897, 1898 and 1899. In 1903, after 34 years of competing, the club won its first premiership, defeating Richmond in the final. The club became back to back premiers in 1904 after Richmond [[1904 VFA Grand Final|forfeited the grand final]] due to the appointment of an umpire whose performance when the two teams met earlier in the year was severely criticised by Richmond players and officials.<ref name=\"Atkinson\">{{cite book |last=Atkinson |first=Graeme |title=3AW Book of Footy Records |year=1989 |publisher=Magistra Publishing Company Pty Ltd |location=South Melbourne |isbn=1-86321-009-1 |pages=278}}.</ref>\n\nNorth merged with fellow VFA football club West Melbourne in 1907, which at the time had lost its home ground. The joint venture saw a chance of promotion, and the club applied for admission to the more prestigious VFL in 1908, but Richmond and University were admitted instead. North was kicked out of the VFA during the 1907/08 offseason as a result of applying to join the VFL,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |title=North Melbourne club |date=4 April 1908 |page=15 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> before the local community reestablished the North Melbourne Football Club under a new committee, successfully enabling the club to play in the VFA in the 1908 season.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |title=Football \u2013 the Victorian Association |date=18 April 1908 |page=6 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Invincibles\"===\nThe reformation of the Club necessitated a massive clean out of the team, leaving only two players remaining from the previous season. The 1910 season was marked by one of the most sensational transfers in Victorian football history, when Andy Curran masterminded the clearance of Carlton's famed \"Big Four\" of 'Mallee' Johnson, [[Fred Jinks]], [[Charlie Hammond]] and Frank 'Silver' Caine to North Melbourne. These signings secured the Northerners' third premiership in 1910.\n[[File:SBarkerNMelb.jpg|125px|thumb|[[Syd Barker, Sr.]], club legend and star ruckman of \"The Invincibles\" era.]]\nThe 1912 finals series was one of the most amazing ever, with the semi-final having to be played three times, after North and Brunswick drew twice. North was eventually victorious and moved on to the final, but lost the game by a mere four points with the last kick of the day.\n\nThe next few years were punctuated by \"The Invincibles\". In the Northerners' most illustrious period ever, the club went undefeated from 1914 to 1919, collecting premierships in 1914, 1915 and 1918 \u2013 the league was in recess in 1916 and 1917 due to [[World War I]]. As well as this, the club won the championship in both 1915 and 1918 for finishing on top of the ladder, and accounted for VFL side St Kilda comfortably. During this period the club won 58 consecutive matches including 49 successive premiership matches, a record that has remained unmatched in Association or League history since.\n\nDespite being rejected from the VFL in both 1896 and 1907, North persisted in trying to gain admission into the League. On 30 June 1921, North told its players it would disband and try to gain entry to the VFL by the 'back-door'. Essendon League Football Club had lost its playing ground at East Melbourne and had decided to acquire the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve as a new playing ground. North accepted their proposal in the idea that the clubs would amalgamate. All of North's players were urged to join the [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon League Club]] to help facilitate the amalgamation. The amalgamation was foiled when some members of the VFA launched a successful legal challenge.<ref name=\"12AugustArgus\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |date=12 August 1921 |title=North Melbourne ground |page=6 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> As a result, the Essendon League Club moved instead to the Essendon Oval, replacing the ground's original occupants, [[Essendon Association Football Club|Essendon Association]].\n\nNorth was now without a playing team and the Essendon Association Club was now without a ground, so as a matter of convenience the two clubs amalgamated so they could compete in the 1922 season. As it had after the merger with West Melbourne, North once again managed to avert its destruction.\n\n===Entering the VFL===\n\nAfter three attempts, 29 years of waiting and numerous other applications to enter the VFL, finally North was rewarded for its persistence with admittance to the League in 1925, along with Footscray and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. Even then, the opportunity was almost lost as the League delegates debated into the early hours of the morning on which clubs should be invited to join the intake. It was only after much deliberation that North Melbourne's name was eventually substituted for [[Prahran FC|Prahran's]] making North \"the lucky side\" of the invitees that included Footscray and Hawthorn. North Melbourne was forced to change its uniform to avoid a clash when it joined the VFL.\n\nNorth Melbourne were cellar dwellers for its first twenty-five years of [[Australian Football League|VFL]] membership and struggled to win matches in the superior VFL competition, but by the late 1940s had developed a strong list and significant supporter base. In 1949 North secured the VFL Minor Premiership, finishing top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season with 14 wins and 5 losses. They failed to make the Grand Final that year (eventually won by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]), but in 1950 they did reach the final, defeated by a more efficient Essendon. It was in this year that the club adopted the \"Kangaroos\" mascot.<ref>Gerard Dowling, \"North Melbourne Football Club\", in Andrew Brown-May and [[Shurlee Swain]], ''The Encyclopedia of Melbourne'', Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2005, p.511.</ref>\n[[File:Gasometer North Melbourne 1928.jpg|thumb|North Melbourne and Arden St Oval after admission to the VFL. c. 1928]]\n\nIn February 1965, North Melbourne [[1965 VFA season#North Melbourne's move to Coburg Oval|moved its playing and training base]] from the Arden Street Oval to [[Coburg City Oval|Coburg Oval]], signing a seven-year lease with the [[City of Coburg]]<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=51 |author= |date=30 March 1965 |title=North gets lease}}</ref> after initially negotiating long-term leases for up to 40 years.<ref name=\"sun3nov\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=34 |author= |date=3 November 1964 |title=North can have a new oval}}</ref> The club came to an arrangement to merge with the VFA's [[Coburg Football Club]], whom it was displacing from the ground;<ref name=\"sun9dec\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |pages=63\u201364 |author=Scot Palmer |date=9 December 1964 |title=Coburg, North merger}}</ref> fourteen Coburg committeemen joined the North Melbourne committee, but the merger was never completed after Coburg established a rival committee which remained loyal to the VFA.<ref name=\"sun6feb\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=56 |author= |date=6 February 1965 |title=Coburg to stay in Association}}</ref> The lease at Coburg lasted only eight months; the Coburg council was hesitant to build a new grandstand without the security of a long-term lease, and neither party made the returns they expected, so it was terminated by mutual agreement in September 1965 and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=51 |author= |date=28 September 1965 |title=Coburg to drop stand?}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=52 |author= |date=29 September 1965 |title=North to quit Coburg}}</ref>\n\nOnfield, the 1950s and 1960s were lean years for North Melbourne, though the club did secure two consecutive Night Premierships in 1965 and 1966. [[Allen Aylett]] was a brilliant player in the late 1950s and early 1960s (and captain between 1961 and 1964), as was [[Noel Teasdale]], who lost the [[Brownlow Medal]] on a countback in 1965 (he was later awarded a retrospective medal when the counting system was amended).\n\n===Golden era===\nIn the late 1960s, under the leadership of [[Allen Aylett]], North Melbourne began its climb to supremacy.

In a major coup, the great [[Ron Barassi]] was appointed coach in 1973. Barrassi reversed the club's playing fortunes, taking a struggling team that was once regarded as the traditional cellar dwellers of the competition through to a golden era of success that transformed North Melbourne into one of the powerhouses of the VFL. Barassi took North to a Grand Final (losing to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] by 41 points) in 1974 and brought success in his 1975 and 1977 seasons.

McCartney wore the numbers \"88\" and \"202\" on the front of his long-sleeved {{not a typo|guernsey}} for the match, signifying the Australian and total number of victims of the Bali bombings, while many in the crowd bore signs reading \"Bali 88/202\".\n\nOnfield, the club reached the elimination finals in 2002 and 2005, but otherwise failed to reach the finals from 2001 until 2006.\nAfter two seasons of finals North Melbourne dropped to 13th in 2009, and coach Dean Laidley announced his resignation with Darren Crocker acting as caretaker coach for the rest of the season, to eventually be replaced by ex-Brisbane Lions premiership player and Collingwood assistant coach [[Brad Scott (Australian footballer)|Brad Scott]].

It is also played before every match.\n\n\"Join in the Chorus\" is believed to be the oldest club anthem of any AFL club and has been associated with North from its early VFA days.

The lyrics have occasionally been changed, including updating the year in the song (e.g. \"North Melbourne will be premiers in 1993\"), or to remove the words \"North Melbourne\" during the period when the club was competing only as the  Kangaroos.\n\nFor the 2015 premiership season, [[You Am I]]'s lead singer, [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]], a North Melbourne supporter, announced that he would assist in an updated version of the song including the two verses.

Members of the club serve as the guarantees of capital and have full voting rights at AGMs to elect directors to the club's board.\n\nThe club's board of directors has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure of the terms of the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune to a lot of the in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.\n\nNorth Melbourne is unique in its structure, because from 1986 to 2006 the club was privately owned and limited by shares. The club was floated in 1986 through a membership vote led by then chairman Bob Ansett. At the meeting, members were encouraged to buy into the club by purchasing shares. The float ended up raising over $3&nbsp;million and helped to keep the club solvent through the next decade.\n\nIn 1991, the [[John Elliott (businessman)|John Elliott]]-led [[Carlton Football Club]] attempted a hostile take over North Melbourne by purchasing a large parcel of shares formerly owned by Bob Ansett. The Blues acquired 20 per cent of the capital but that stake was eventually bought back by John Magowan, the former head of Merrill Lynch Australia, in 2001. The resulting melodrama saw the formation of B-Class shareholders who had the effective power of veto over any attempt to merge or relocate the club.\n\nFurther takeover attempts were made in the first decade of the 21st century by the [[Southport Sharks]]. Then chairman Allan Aylett knocked back a proposal from the Sharks that would have seen them gain a majority stake in the club in exchange for an injection of capital. In early 2006, another proposal from Sharks to underwrite the Kangaroos' games on the Gold Coast, in exchange for a slice of the shareholder structure at the club was knocked back after AFL intervention.\n\nDue to an [[Australian Taxation Office]] ruling in 2006, the club proposed a shareholder restructure that would have seen the B Class shareholders power reduced significantly and some voting rights returned to members. This was done to avoid extraordinary taxes being placed on the club, but the move was blocked in December by Bob Ansett and his proxies who feared that the restructure would make the club vulnerable to further takeover bids.\n\nOn 28 February 2007, another meeting was called to resolve the shareholder issue. A motion was passed that would return see some voting rights return to members and stop any future tax increments.\n\nIn April 2007 it was revealed the AFL was attempting to buy out the shareholders of the club in a bid to gain full ownership, and force a relocation of the club to the Gold Coast.\n\nDuring October 2007, a group called [[We Are North Melbourne]] emerged and launched a public campaign, calling for ordinary members to be given the final say on the relocation issue. While the group became synonymous with the push to keep the club in Melbourne, its first priority was to see the club's shareholder structure wound-up and control returned to ordinary members.\n\nNorth Melbourne reverted to public company in November 2008. A moratorium was passed at an extraordinary general meeting that will allow James Brayshaw's board to serve unopposed until 2010, so as to allow his ticket the maximum time to enact their policies to make the North Melbourne Football Club financially viable.\n\nOn 20 November 2016, former Aussie Rules footballer and Football Federation Australia chairman [[Ben Buckley]] replaced James Brayshaw as the new chairman of the club.\n\n===Sponsorship===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; width:75%;\"\n|-\n!

North supporters have long been bitter with [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] for excluding them from the VFL, and have blamed that for their small supporter base in comparison to Essendon's. North's first [[VFL Grand Final]] was against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in [[1950 VFL Grand Final|1950]]. The rivalry was reignited in the 90s as both teams were constantly in premiership contention. In 1998, following comments by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] coach labelling Kangaroos executives Greg Miller and Mark Dawson \"marshmallows\", a reference to their softness, North supporters threw marshmallows at Sheedy after the opening Qualifying Final.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sheeds still baiting the crowd on marshmallow anniversary |url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-06-30/marshmallow-moments-not-forgotten |website=AFL Website |accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> In 2014 North Melbourne versed Essendon in Elimination Final 2 Essendon was leading by 30 odd points then North came back to win by 12 points<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2014/24/nmfc-v-ess</ref>\n\n'''Hawthorn'''{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} \u2013 North and Hawthorn have a fierce rivalry that dates back to the 1970s when they played off against each other in three Grand Finals in the space of four years. From 1974 to 1978 the two clubs played against each other in ten finals, and took each other on for the Australian Championship in Adelaide in 1976. During the 1980s Hawthorn dominated North, and during the 90s the results were reversed with North dominating Hawthorn.\nNorth Melbourne defeated Hawthorn in the 1975 Grand Final by 55 points. However, Hawthorn defeated North Melbourne in the 1976 Grand Final by 30 points and in the 1978 Grand Final by 18 points.\nThe rivalry re-ignited in 2014 following a choking incident involving [[Brian Lake]] having North Melbourne forward [[Drew Petrie]] in a choking hold during a clash between the two sides at [[Docklands Stadium]] and reached fever pitch in 2015 following several fights including an all in during the first term of their round 5 clash.\n\n===Minor===\n'''Collingwood''' \u2013 North and Collingwood have a small kind of rivalry between them. As they drew in the [[1977 VFL Grand Final|1977 Grand Final]], which North went on to win in the replay by 27 points.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/afl-grand-final-countdown-no2-North-melbourne-v-collingwood-1977/story-e6frf3e3-1225778963326 AFL grand final countdown No.2: North Melbourne v Collingwood, 1977]</ref>\nIn 2019 [[North Melbourne]] and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] faced off in Round 15 and the Collingwood banner said \"Kanga, Kanga, Kanga Roo, Roo, Roo The Pies, Pies, Pies Will beat, Beat you\" Instead, North Melbourne Held Collingwood to their lowest score since 1994, and of course after a goal they chanted \"KANGA KANGA KANGA!\"ROO ROO\" To annoy Collingwood Supporters. Also the rivalry extends to the press with Collingwood President Edward Mcguire encouraging North to relocate to tasmania for being the smallest club in Melbourne and expansion if \"the game.\"<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2019/15/coll-v-nmfc</ref>\n  \n'''Carlton''' \u2013 Although not known for their on-field rivalry, North Melbourne and Carlton have endured a tumultuous off-field relationship. In 1965, North Melbourne moved to the [[Coburg City Oval]], which Carlton opposed as an invasion of its own territory: Coburg was located within Carlton's recruiting zone, and was home to about of quarter of Carlton's members at the time.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=66 |author=Rex Pullen |date=5 November 1964 |title=North move to Coburg under fire}}</ref> Later, after North Melbourne was listed on the stock market in 1987, Carlton bought 20% of the shares to become part-owner of the rival club.

This was Port's only loss in the first 12 rounds of [[2014 AFL season|2014]].\n\nPort Adelaide lost their first finals appearance to North Melbourne in 1999 in the qualifying final, and in Port's premiership year of [[2004 AFL season|2004]], North beat Port by 92 points, however, Port beat North Melbourne in both the [[2005 AFL finals series#First Elimination Final (5 vs 8)|2005 Elimination Final]] and [[2007 AFL season#Preliminary Finals|2007 Preliminary Final]] by 87 points. In 2019 North beat Port Adelaide by 86 points to end Port's finals hopes for 2019, restarting the rivalry.\n\n'''Richmond''' \u2013 A rivalry that began as a result of North's loss to Richmond in the 1974 Grand Final, the two sides have shared an on and off rivalry ever since. Both sides since their 1975 preliminary final meeting (which North Melbourne won) have mostly been unsuccessful on the field. The rivalry re-ignited in the 2010s due to the clubs recent on field success and accumulated in a clash during the [[2015 AFL finals series]] which North won by 17 points and was preceded by a provocative banner which read, 'Tigers Don't Win Finals, We Do'.\n\n==Club honour board==\n\n===Honour roll===\n{{Main|North Melbourne Football Club honour roll}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#BDB76B;\"\n!

He explained: \"There's so much that goes on in an experience like that. On the one hand, the guy is struggling with his sexuality and feeling unable to express himself as anything other than straight while also desiring me.

Alexander stated that he has \"felt more empowered to be even more confessional in [his] writing\" and is \"not shying away from certain topics anymore\". He concluded by saying: \"I feel like being gay is a blessing.

Though it might be facile to suggest that the phrase applies equally to the music on this album, it wouldn't be far from wrong. The Deftones have always had a way with instrumental sound, pulling elements from metal, alt-rock and shoegaze to create an emotionally evocative wall of guitars, but this time around the textures are even more closely tied to the songwriting. Perhaps that's why the songs seem more deeply engrossing, from the darkly churning textures of Gauze to the almost pop-flavoured melodies of Entombed. -J.D.

Vega said the group was able to \"bring Fractal into hotel rooms and run it into software and record ideas and flesh them out later\".

Though it might be facile to suggest that the phrase applies equally to the music on this album, it wouldn't be far from wrong. The Deftones have always had a way with instrumental sound, pulling elements from metal, alt-rock and shoegaze to create an emotionally evocative wall of guitars, but this time around the textures are even more closely tied to the songwriting. Perhaps that's why the songs seem more deeply engrossing, from the darkly churning textures of Gauze to the almost pop-flavoured melodies of Entombed. -J.D.
