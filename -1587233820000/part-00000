Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized the [[Miami Pop Festival (May 1968)|Miami Pop Festival]] on the East Coast the prior year, where an estimated 25,000 people attended the two-day event.\n\nEarly in 1969, Roberts and Rosenman were New York City entrepreneurs, in the process of building Media Sound, a large audio recording studio complex in Manhattan. Lang and Kornfeld's lawyer, Miles Lourie, who had done legal work on the Media Sound project, suggested that they contact Roberts and Rosenman about financing a similar, but much smaller, studio Kornfeld and Lang hoped to build in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Unpersuaded by this Studio-in-the-Woods proposal, Roberts and Rosenman counter-proposed a concert featuring the kind of artists known to frequent the Woodstock area (such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Band]]). Kornfeld and Lang agreed to the new plan, and Woodstock Ventures was formed in January 1969.<ref name=\"Making Woodstock\">{{cite book|last1=Rosenman |first=Joel |first2=John |last2=Roberts |first3=Robert |last3=Pilpel |title=Making Woodstock|date=1974|edition=Kindle eBook|url=https://www.amazon.com/Making-Woodstock-Joel-Rosenman-ebook/dp/B002KMI7H4}}</ref> The company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan.

Similar differences about financial discipline made Roberts and Rosenman wonder whether to pull the plug or to continue pumping money into the project.<ref name=\"spitz-babylon\" />\n\nIn April 1969, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] became the first act to sign a contract for the event, agreeing to play for $10,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10000|1969|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dowling |first1=Stephen |title=50 Facts about Woodstock at 50: Money |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190813-50-facts-about-woodstock-at-50-money |accessdate=25 January 2020 |publisher=BBC |date=15 August 2019}}</ref> The promoters had experienced difficulty landing big-name groups prior to Creedence committing to play.

It became a \"free concert\" only after the event drew hundreds of thousands more people than the organizers had prepared for. Tickets for the three-day event cost $18 in advance and $24 at the gate (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18|1969|r=-1}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24|1969|r=-1}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}).

At a meeting three days before the event, organizers felt they had two options: one was to complete the fencing and ticket booths, without which the promoters would lose any profit or go into debt; the other option involved putting their remaining available resources into building the stage, without which the promoters feared they would have a disappointed and disgruntled audience. When the audience began arriving by the tens of thousands the next day, the Wednesday before the weekend, the decision was made for them. Those without tickets simply walked through gaps in the fences, and the organizers were forced to make the event free of charge. Though the festival left its promoters nearly bankrupt, their ownership of the film and recording rights more than compensated for the losses after the release of the hit documentary film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' in March 1970.<ref name=\"Making Woodstock\"/>\n\n==Festival==\n[[File:Woodstock redmond stage.JPG|thumb|Woodstock festival site with the stage]]\n[[File:Woodstock redmond crowd.JPG|thumb|Part of the crowd on the first day of the festival]]\nThe influx of attendees to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam.

[[Artie Kornfeld]] (one of the promoters of the festival) went to [[Fred Weintraub]], an executive at [[Warner Bros.]], and asked for money to film the festival. Artie had been turned down everywhere else, but against the express wishes of other Warner Bros. executives, Weintraub put his job on the line and gave Kornfeld $100,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|100000|1969|r=-4|fmt=c}} today) to make the film. ''Woodstock'' helped to save Warner Bros at a time when the company was on the verge of going out of business. The book ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'' details the making of the film.\n\nWadleigh rounded up a crew of about 100 from the New York film scene. With no money to pay the crew, he agreed to a double-or-nothing scheme, in which the crew would receive double pay if the film succeeded and nothing if it bombed. Wadleigh strove to make the film as much about the hippies as the music, listening to their feelings about compelling events contemporaneous with the festival (such as the [[Vietnam War]]), as well as the views of the townspeople.<ref name=\"geocities\">{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/~music-festival/how-w2.htm |title=How Woodstock Came To Be ...

The first, ''[[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More]]'', was a 3-[[LP record|LP]] (later 2-CD) album containing a sampling of one or two songs by most of the acts who performed. A year later, ''[[Woodstock 2]]'' was released as a 2-LP album. Both albums included recordings of stage announcements (many by Production Coordinator John Morris, e.g., \"[We're told] that the brown acid is not specifically too good\", \"Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain\") and crowd noises (i.e., the rain chant) between songs. In August 1994, a third album, ''[[Woodstock Diary]]'' was released.\n\nTracks from all three albums, as well as numerous additional, previously unreleased performances from the festival (but not the stage announcements and crowd noises) were reissued by Atlantic, also in August 1994, as a 4-CD [[box set]] titled ''[[Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music]]''.\n\nAn album titled ''[[Woodstock (Jimi Hendrix album)|Jimi Hendrix: Woodstock]]'' was also released in August 1994, featuring only selected recordings of Jimi Hendrix at the festival.\n\n====30th anniversary releases====\nIn July 1999, [[MCA Records]] released ''[[Live at Woodstock (Jimi Hendrix album)|Live at Woodstock]]'', a double-disc recording (longer than ''Jimi Hendrix: Woodstock'') featuring nearly every song of Hendrix's performance, omitting just two pieces that were sung by his rhythm guitarist [[Larry Lee (musician)|Larry Lee]].\n\n====40th anniversary releases====\nIn June 2009, complete performances from Woodstock by [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Sly & the Family Stone]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], and [[Johnny Winter]] were released separately by [[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment|SME Records]], and were also collected in a box set titled ''[[The Woodstock Experience]]''.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Rhino Records|Rhino]]/[[Atlantic Records]] issued a 6-CD box set titled ''[[Woodstock 40 Years On: Back To Yasgur's Farm]]'', which included further musical performances as well as stage announcements and other ancillary material.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Woodstock\u201440 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm boxed set |website=[[Rhino Entertainment]] |accessdate=August 16, 2009 |date=June 5, 2009 |url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=628 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905043240/http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=628 |archivedate=September 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, [[Joe Cocker]] released  ''[[Live at Woodstock (Joe Cocker album)|Live at Woodstock]]'', a live album of his entire Woodstock set.

Due to various production and warehousing issues, the release of the box set was delayed dramatically, causing massive backlash and dissatisfaction towards Rhino and Warner Music. More condensed versions\u2014an album on 10 CDs, and an album on either 3 CDs or 5 LPs\u2014were also released.

Roberts]]. Roberts and Rosenman financed the project. Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized the [[Miami Pop Festival (May 1968)|Miami Pop Festival]] on the East Coast the prior year, where an estimated 25,000 people attended the two-day event.\n\nEarly in 1969, Roberts and Rosenman were New York City entrepreneurs, in the process of building Media Sound, a large audio recording studio complex in Manhattan. Lang and Kornfeld's lawyer, Miles Lourie, who had done legal work on the Media Sound project, suggested that they contact Roberts and Rosenman about financing a similar, but much smaller, studio Kornfeld and Lang hoped to build in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Unpersuaded by this Studio-in-the-Woods proposal, Roberts and Rosenman counter-proposed a concert featuring the kind of artists known to frequent the Woodstock area (such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Band]]). Kornfeld and Lang agreed to the new plan, and Woodstock Ventures was formed in January 1969.<ref name=\"Making Woodstock\">{{cite book|last1=Rosenman |first=Joel |first2=John |last2=Roberts |first3=Robert |last3=Pilpel |title=Making Woodstock|date=1974|edition=Kindle eBook|url=https://www.amazon.com/Making-Woodstock-Joel-Rosenman-ebook/dp/B002KMI7H4}}</ref> The company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan.

Similar differences about financial discipline made Roberts and Rosenman wonder whether to pull the plug or to continue pumping money into the project.<ref name=\"spitz-babylon\" />\n\nIn April 1969, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] became the first act to sign a contract for the event, agreeing to play for $10,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10000|1969|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dowling |first1=Stephen |title=50 Facts about Woodstock at 50: Money |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190813-50-facts-about-woodstock-at-50-money |accessdate=25 January 2020 |publisher=BBC |date=15 August 2019}}</ref> The promoters had experienced difficulty landing big-name groups prior to Creedence committing to play.

It became a \"free concert\" only after the event drew hundreds of thousands more people than the organizers had prepared for. Tickets for the three-day event cost $18 in advance and $24 at the gate (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18|1969|r=-1}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24|1969|r=-1}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}). Ticket sales were limited to record stores in the greater New York City area, or by mail via a post office box at the [[Radio City Music Hall|Radio City]] Station Post Office located in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Around 186,000 advance tickets were sold, and the organizers anticipated approximately 200,000 festival-goers would turn up.<ref name=\"bbc-woodstockends\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/18/newsid_2760000/2760911.stm |department=On this Day: 1950\u20132005 |title=1969: Woodstock music festival ends |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=August 18, 1969}}</ref>\n\n===Selection of the venue===\nThe original venue plan was for the festival to take place in [[Wallkill, Orange County, New York|Wallkill, New York]], possibly near the proposed recording studio site owned by Alexander Tapooz.

At a meeting three days before the event, organizers felt they had two options: one was to complete the fencing and ticket booths, without which the promoters would lose any profit or go into debt; the other option involved putting their remaining available resources into building the stage, without which the promoters feared they would have a disappointed and disgruntled audience. When the audience began arriving by the tens of thousands the next day, the Wednesday before the weekend, the decision was made for them. Those without tickets simply walked through gaps in the fences, and the organizers were forced to make the event free of charge. Though the festival left its promoters nearly bankrupt, their ownership of the film and recording rights more than compensated for the losses after the release of the hit documentary film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' in March 1970.<ref name=\"Making Woodstock\"/>\n\n==Festival==\n[[File:Woodstock redmond stage.JPG|thumb|Woodstock festival site with the stage]]\n[[File:Woodstock redmond crowd.JPG|thumb|Part of the crowd on the first day of the festival]]\nThe influx of attendees to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam.

[[Artie Kornfeld]] (one of the promoters of the festival) went to [[Fred Weintraub]], an executive at [[Warner Bros.]], and asked for money to film the festival. Artie had been turned down everywhere else, but against the express wishes of other Warner Bros. executives, Weintraub put his job on the line and gave Kornfeld $100,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|100000|1969|r=-4|fmt=c}} today) to make the film. ''Woodstock'' helped to save Warner Bros at a time when the company was on the verge of going out of business. The book ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'' details the making of the film.\n\nWadleigh rounded up a crew of about 100 from the New York film scene. With no money to pay the crew, he agreed to a double-or-nothing scheme, in which the crew would receive double pay if the film succeeded and nothing if it bombed. Wadleigh strove to make the film as much about the hippies as the music, listening to their feelings about compelling events contemporaneous with the festival (such as the [[Vietnam War]]), as well as the views of the townspeople.<ref name=\"geocities\">{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/~music-festival/how-w2.htm |title=How Woodstock Came To Be ...

A year later, ''[[Woodstock 2]]'' was released as a 2-LP album. Both albums included recordings of stage announcements (many by Production Coordinator John Morris, e.g., \"[We're told] that the brown acid is not specifically too good\", \"Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain\") and crowd noises (i.e., the rain chant) between songs. In August 1994, a third album, ''[[Woodstock Diary]]'' was released.\n\nTracks from all three albums, as well as numerous additional, previously unreleased performances from the festival (but not the stage announcements and crowd noises) were reissued by Atlantic, also in August 1994, as a 4-CD [[box set]] titled ''[[Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music]]''.\n\nAn album titled ''[[Woodstock (Jimi Hendrix album)|Jimi Hendrix: Woodstock]]'' was also released in August 1994, featuring only selected recordings of Jimi Hendrix at the festival.\n\n====30th anniversary releases====\nIn July 1999, [[MCA Records]] released ''[[Live at Woodstock (Jimi Hendrix album)|Live at Woodstock]]'', a double-disc recording (longer than ''Jimi Hendrix: Woodstock'') featuring nearly every song of Hendrix's performance, omitting just two pieces that were sung by his rhythm guitarist [[Larry Lee (musician)|Larry Lee]].\n\n====40th anniversary releases====\nIn June 2009, complete performances from Woodstock by [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Sly & the Family Stone]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], and [[Johnny Winter]] were released separately by [[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment|SME Records]], and were also collected in a box set titled ''[[The Woodstock Experience]]''.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Rhino Records|Rhino]]/[[Atlantic Records]] issued a 6-CD box set titled ''[[Woodstock 40 Years On: Back To Yasgur's Farm]]'', which included further musical performances as well as stage announcements and other ancillary material.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Woodstock\u201440 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm boxed set |website=[[Rhino Entertainment]] |accessdate=August 16, 2009 |date=June 5, 2009 |url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=628 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905043240/http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=628 |archivedate=September 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, [[Joe Cocker]] released  ''[[Live at Woodstock (Joe Cocker album)|Live at Woodstock]]'', a live album of his entire Woodstock set.

[[Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867|Section 91 (clause 24) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'']] gives the federal government (as opposed to the provinces) the sole responsibility for \"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\". The government inherited treaty obligations from the British colonial authorities in Eastern Canada and signed treaties itself with First Nations in Western Canada (the [[Numbered Treaties]]). It also passed the ''[[Indian Act]]'' in 1876 which governed its interactions with all treaty and non-treaty peoples. Members of First Nations bands that are subject to the ''Indian Act'' with the Crown are compiled on a list called the [[Indian Register]], and such people are called ''Status Indians''. Many non-treaty First Nations and all Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples are not subject to the ''Indian Act''. However, two court cases have clarified that Inuit, M\u00e9tis, and non-status First Nations people, all are covered by the term \"Indians\" in the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. The first was ''[[Re Eskimos]]'' in 1939 covering the Inuit, the second being ''[[Daniels v.

[[Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867|Section 91 (clause 24) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'']] gives the federal government (as opposed to the provinces) the sole responsibility for \"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\". The government inherited treaty obligations from the British colonial authorities in Eastern Canada and signed treaties itself with First Nations in Western Canada (the [[Numbered Treaties]]). It also passed the ''[[Indian Act]]'' in 1876 which governed its interactions with all treaty and non-treaty peoples. Members of First Nations bands that are subject to the ''Indian Act'' with the Crown are compiled on a list called the [[Indian Register]], and such people are called ''Status Indians''. Many non-treaty First Nations and all Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples are not subject to the ''Indian Act''. However, two court cases have clarified that Inuit, M\u00e9tis, and non-status First Nations people, all are covered by the term \"Indians\" in the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. The first was ''[[Re Eskimos]]'' in 1939 covering the Inuit, the second being ''[[Daniels v.
