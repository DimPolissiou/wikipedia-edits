It stars [[Malcolm McDowell]] in the title role, alongside [[Teresa Ann Savoy]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[John Steiner]] and [[John Gielgud]]. It is the only feature film produced by the men's magazine ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. Producer [[Bob Guccione]], the magazine's founder, intended to produce an explicit [[pornographic film]] with a feature film narrative and high production values. He cast [[List of Penthouse Pets|Penthouse Pets]] as extras in [[Unsimulated sex|unsimulated sex scenes]] filmed during post-production by himself and Giancarlo Lui.\n\nGuccione hired screenwriter [[Gore Vidal]] to draft the film's script and [[Tinto Brass]] to direct the film. Brass extensively altered Vidal's original screenplay, leading Vidal to disavow the film. The final screenplay focuses on the idea that \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\". However, both Brass and Vidal disagreed with Guccione's use of unsimulated sexual content, which Brass refused to film.<ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=5 What Culture#14]: Caligula</ref> Because the producers did not allow Brass to edit the film, they changed its tone and style significantly and added hardcore sex scenes not filmed by Brass, thus turning ''Caligula'' into a pornographic drama that disregarded the director's intentions to present the film as a [[political satire]]. As a result, Brass also disavowed the film.\n\n''Caligula''{{'}}s release was met with legal issues and controversies over its violent and sexual content. Its uncut form remains banned in several countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.refused-classification.com/censorship/films/caligula-1979.html |title=Film Censorship: Caligula (1979) |work=Refused-Classification.com |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref> Although contemporary reviews were overwhelmingly negative, ''Caligula'' is now considered to be a [[cult film|cult classic]] in retrospect, and its political content is considered to have significant merit.\n\nThe script was later adapted into a [[novelization]] written by [[William Joseph Johnston (novelist)|William Johnston]] under the pseudonym William Howard.<ref name=\"Spencer\">{{cite journal |last=Spencer |first=David |date=January\u2013February 2010 |url=http://iamtw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/news-1-10.pdf |title=IAMTW's Grand Master Scribe Award, The ''Faust'', Goes to the Genre's Most Prolific Practitioner |journal=Tied-In: The Newsletter of the International Association of Media Tie-in Writers |publisher=International Association of Media Tie-in Writers |location=Calabasas, California |volume=4 |issue=1 |accessdate=26 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084524/http://iamtw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/news-1-10.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Penthouse announced that a new Director's Cut of the film was being edited by [[Alexander Tuschinski]], with the approval of Brass's family.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Citation|last=Tuschinski|first=Alexander|title=Mission: Caligula|date=2018-07-26|url=https://vimeo.com/281814277|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref> No release date for that cut has been confirmed. In 2020, another version of the film was announced to be released in the fall of that year, edited by [[E. Elias Merhige]] to follow more closely Gore Vidal's original screenplay instead of Tinto Brass' or Bob Guccione's vision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.caligulammxx.com |title=Caligula MMXX - announcement on website for 2020 re-release.|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCaligula is the young heir to the throne of his [[uncle|great uncle]], the Emperor [[Tiberius]].  One morning, a blackbird flies into his room; Caligula considers this a bad omen.  Shortly afterward, the head of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]], tells Caligula that Tiberius demands his immediate presence at [[Capri]], where the Emperor lives with his close friend [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva (jurist)|Nerva]], a dim-witted relative [[Claudius]], and Caligula's adopted son (Tiberius\u2019s grandson) [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]]. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave but his sister and lover [[Julia Drusilla|Drusilla]] persuades him to go.\n\nAt Capri, Caligula finds that Tiberius has become depraved, showing signs of advanced [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal diseases]], and embittered with Rome and politics.  Tiberius enjoys swimming with naked youths and watching degrading [[sex show]]s that include deformed people and animals.  Caligula observes with fascination and horror.  Tensions rise when Tiberius tries to poison Caligula in front of Gemellus.  Nerva commits suicide and Caligula tries to kill Tiberius but loses his nerve.  Proving his loyalty to Caligula, Macro kills Tiberius instead with Gemellus as a witness.\n\nAfter Tiberius' death and burial, Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, then proclaims Drusilla as his equal, to the apparent disgust of the  [[Roman Senate]].  Drusilla, fearful of Macro's influence, persuades Caligula to get rid of him.  Caligula sets up a [[Kangaroo court|mock trial]] in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro murdered Tiberius, then has Macro's wife [[Ennia Thrasylla|Ennia]] banished from Rome.  After Macro  is executed in a gruesome [[Ludi|public game]], Caligula appoints Tiberius' former adviser Longinus as his personal assistant while pronouncing the docile Senator [[Cassius Chaerea|Chaerea]] as the new head of the Praetorian Guard.\n\nDrusilla tries to find Caligula a wife among the priestesses of the goddess [[Isis]], the cult they secretly practice.  Caligula wants to marry Drusilla, but she insists they cannot marry because she is his sister.  Instead, Caligula marries [[Milonia Caesonia|Caesonia]], a priestess and notorious [[courtesan]], after she bears him an heir.  Drusilla reluctantly supports their marriage.  Meanwhile, despite Caligula's popularity with the masses, the Senate expresses disapproval for what initially seem to be light eccentricities.  Darker aspects of Caligula's personality emerge when he rapes a bride and groom on their wedding day in a minor fit of jealousy and orders Gemellus's execution to provoke a reaction from Drusilla.\n\nAfter discovering that Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula suffers severe fever.  Drusilla nurses him back to health.  Just as he fully recovers, Caesonia bears him a daughter, [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]].  During the celebration, Drusilla collapses with the same fever he suffered.  Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the form of a blackbird.  Despite his praying to Isis out of desperation, Drusilla dies from her fever.  Initially unable to accept her death, Caligula suffers a [[mental disorder|nervous breakdown]] and rampages through the palace, destroying a statue of Isis while clutching Drusilla's body.\n\nNow in a deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], Caligula walks the Roman streets disguised as a beggar; he causes a disturbance after watching an amateur performance mocking his relationship with Drusilla.  After a brief stay in a city jail, Caligula proclaims himself a god and becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe.  The new reign he leads becomes a series of humiliations against the foundations of Rome{{mdash}}senators' wives are forced to work in the service of the state as prostitutes, estates are confiscated, the old religion is desecrated and the army is made to embark on a mock invasion of Britain.  Unable to further tolerate his actions, Longinus conspires with Chaerea to assassinate Caligula.\n\nCaligula enters his bedroom where a nervous Caesonia awaits him.  Another blackbird appears but only Caesonia is frightened of it.  The next morning, after rehearsing an Egyptian play, Caligula and his family are attacked in a coup headed by Chaerea.  Caesonia and Julia are murdered, and Chaerea stabs Caligula in the stomach.  With his final breath, the Emperor defiantly whimpers \"I live!\" as Caligula and his family's bodies are thrown down the stadium's steps and their blood is washed off the marble floor.  Claudius witnesses the entire ordeal and becomes traumatized, despite the people proclaiming him the new Emperor.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast listed in order of closing credits-->\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Caligula]]\n* [[Teresa Ann Savoy]] as [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]]\n* [[Guido Mannari]] as [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]]\n** [[Patrick Allen]] as Macro (English [[Dubbing (filmaking)|dub]] voice) (uncredited)<ref name=Hawes233 />\n* [[John Gielgud]] as [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva (jurist)|Nerva]]\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Tiberius]]\n* [[Giancarlo Badessi]] as [[Claudius]]\n* Bruno Brive as [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]]\n* [[Adriana Asti]] as [[Ennia Thrasylla|Ennia]]\n* [[Leopoldo Trieste]] as Charicles\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as [[Cassius Chaerea]]\n** [[Joss Ackland]] as Cassius Chaerea (English [[Dubbing (filmaking)|dub]] voice) (uncredited)\n* [[John Steiner]] as Longinus\n* [[Mirella D'Angelo|Mirella Dangelo]] as Livia\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Caesonia]]\n* [[Rick Parets|Richard Parets]] as [[Mnester]]\n* Paula Mitchell as Subura Singer\n* [[Osiride Pevarello]] as Giant\n* Donato Placido as Proculus\n* [[Anneka Di Lorenzo]] as [[Messalina]]\n* Lori Wagner as [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]]\n* Davide as [[Incitatus|Caligula's horse]] (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Gore Vidal 3 Shankbone 2009 NYC cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gore Vidal]] was paid $200,000 to write the screenplay for ''Caligula'';<ref name=\"Guccione interview\"/> ultimately, the film credited no official screenwriter, only that it was \"adapted from a screenplay\" by Vidal.]]\n\nThe men's magazine ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' had long been involved in film funding, helping invest in films made by other studios, including ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'', but it had never produced a film on its own.<ref name=\"Guccione interview\"/> The magazine's founder [[Bob Guccione]] wanted to produce an explicit adult film within a feature film narrative that had high production values; he decided to produce a film about the rise and fall of the Roman emperor [[Caligula]].<ref name=epicencyclopedia115>{{cite book|author1=Constantine Santas|author2=James M.

[[Caligula]]. It stars [[Malcolm McDowell]] in the title role, alongside [[Teresa Ann Savoy]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[John Steiner]] and [[John Gielgud]]. It is the only feature film produced by the men's magazine ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. Producer [[Bob Guccione]], the magazine's founder, intended to produce an explicit [[pornographic film]] with a feature film narrative and high production values. He cast [[List of Penthouse Pets|Penthouse Pets]] as extras in [[Unsimulated sex|unsimulated sex scenes]] filmed during post-production by himself and Giancarlo Lui.\n\nGuccione hired screenwriter [[Gore Vidal]] to draft the film's script and [[Tinto Brass]] to direct the film. Brass extensively altered Vidal's original screenplay, leading Vidal to disavow the film. The final screenplay focuses on the idea that \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\". However, both Brass and Vidal disagreed with Guccione's use of unsimulated sexual content, which Brass refused to film.<ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=5 What Culture#14]: Caligula</ref> Because the producers did not allow Brass to edit the film, they changed its tone and style significantly and added hardcore sex scenes not filmed by Brass, thus turning ''Caligula'' into a pornographic drama that disregarded the director's intentions to present the film as a [[political satire]]. As a result, Brass also disavowed the film.\n\n''Caligula''{{'}}s release was met with legal issues and controversies over its violent and sexual content. Its uncut form remains banned in several countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.refused-classification.com/censorship/films/caligula-1979.html |title=Film Censorship: Caligula (1979) |work=Refused-Classification.com |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref> Although contemporary reviews were overwhelmingly negative, ''Caligula'' is now considered to be a [[cult film|cult classic]] in retrospect, and its political content is considered to have significant merit.\n\nThe script was later adapted into a [[novelization]] written by [[William Joseph Johnston (novelist)|William Johnston]] under the pseudonym William Howard.<ref name=\"Spencer\">{{cite journal |last=Spencer |first=David |date=January\u2013February 2010 |url=http://iamtw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/news-1-10.pdf |title=IAMTW's Grand Master Scribe Award, The ''Faust'', Goes to the Genre's Most Prolific Practitioner |journal=Tied-In: The Newsletter of the International Association of Media Tie-in Writers |publisher=International Association of Media Tie-in Writers |location=Calabasas, California |volume=4 |issue=1 |accessdate=26 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084524/http://iamtw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/news-1-10.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Penthouse announced that a new Director's Cut of the film was being edited by [[Alexander Tuschinski]], with the approval of Brass's family.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Citation|last=Tuschinski|first=Alexander|title=Mission: Caligula|date=2018-07-26|url=https://vimeo.com/281814277|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref> No release date for that cut has been confirmed. In 2020, another version of the film was announced to be released in the fall of that year, edited by [[E. Elias Merhige]] to follow more closely Gore Vidal's original screenplay instead of Tinto Brass' or Bob Guccione's vision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.caligulammxx.com |title=Caligula MMXX - announcement on website for 2020 re-release.|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCaligula is the young heir to the throne of his [[uncle|great uncle]], the Emperor [[Tiberius]].  One morning, a blackbird flies into his room; Caligula considers this a bad omen.  Shortly afterward, the head of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]], tells Caligula that Tiberius demands his immediate presence at [[Capri]], where the Emperor lives with his close friend [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva (jurist)|Nerva]], a dim-witted relative [[Claudius]], and Caligula's adopted son (Tiberius\u2019s grandson) [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]]. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave but his sister and lover [[Julia Drusilla|Drusilla]] persuades him to go.\n\nAt Capri, Caligula finds that Tiberius has become depraved, showing signs of advanced [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal diseases]], and embittered with Rome and politics.  Tiberius enjoys swimming with naked youths and watching degrading [[sex show]]s that include deformed people and animals.  Caligula observes with fascination and horror.  Tensions rise when Tiberius tries to poison Caligula in front of Gemellus.  Nerva commits suicide and Caligula tries to kill Tiberius but loses his nerve.  Proving his loyalty to Caligula, Macro kills Tiberius instead with Gemellus as a witness.\n\nAfter Tiberius' death and burial, Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, then proclaims Drusilla as his equal, to the apparent disgust of the  [[Roman Senate]].  Drusilla, fearful of Macro's influence, persuades Caligula to get rid of him.  Caligula sets up a [[Kangaroo court|mock trial]] in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro murdered Tiberius, then has Macro's wife [[Ennia Thrasylla|Ennia]] banished from Rome.  After Macro  is executed in a gruesome [[Ludi|public game]], Caligula appoints Tiberius' former adviser Longinus as his personal assistant while pronouncing the docile Senator [[Cassius Chaerea|Chaerea]] as the new head of the Praetorian Guard.\n\nDrusilla tries to find Caligula a wife among the priestesses of the goddess [[Isis]], the cult they secretly practice.  Caligula wants to marry Drusilla, but she insists they cannot marry because she is his sister.  Instead, Caligula marries [[Milonia Caesonia|Caesonia]], a priestess and notorious [[courtesan]], after she bears him an heir.  Drusilla reluctantly supports their marriage.  Meanwhile, despite Caligula's popularity with the masses, the Senate expresses disapproval for what initially seem to be light eccentricities.  Darker aspects of Caligula's personality emerge when he rapes a bride and groom on their wedding day in a minor fit of jealousy and orders Gemellus's execution to provoke a reaction from Drusilla.\n\nAfter discovering that Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula suffers severe fever.  Drusilla nurses him back to health.  Just as he fully recovers, Caesonia bears him a daughter, [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]].  During the celebration, Drusilla collapses with the same fever he suffered.  Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the form of a blackbird.  Despite his praying to Isis out of desperation, Drusilla dies from her fever.  Initially unable to accept her death, Caligula suffers a [[mental disorder|nervous breakdown]] and rampages through the palace, destroying a statue of Isis while clutching Drusilla's body.\n\nNow in a deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], Caligula walks the Roman streets disguised as a beggar; he causes a disturbance after watching an amateur performance mocking his relationship with Drusilla.  After a brief stay in a city jail, Caligula proclaims himself a god and becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe.  The new reign he leads becomes a series of humiliations against the foundations of Rome{{mdash}}senators' wives are forced to work in the service of the state as prostitutes, estates are confiscated, the old religion is desecrated and the army is made to embark on a mock invasion of Britain.  Unable to further tolerate his actions, Longinus conspires with Chaerea to assassinate Caligula.\n\nCaligula enters his bedroom where a nervous Caesonia awaits him.  Another blackbird appears but only Caesonia is frightened of it.  The next morning, after rehearsing an Egyptian play, Caligula and his family are attacked in a coup headed by Chaerea.  Caesonia and Julia are murdered, and Chaerea stabs Caligula in the stomach.  With his final breath, the Emperor defiantly whimpers \"I live!\" as Caligula and his family's bodies are thrown down the stadium's steps and their blood is washed off the marble floor.  Claudius witnesses the entire ordeal and becomes traumatized, despite the people proclaiming him the new Emperor.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast listed in order of closing credits-->\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Caligula]]\n* [[Teresa Ann Savoy]] as [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]]\n* [[Guido Mannari]] as [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]]\n** [[Patrick Allen]] as Macro (English [[Dubbing (filmaking)|dub]] voice) (uncredited)<ref name=Hawes233 />\n* [[John Gielgud]] as [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva (jurist)|Nerva]]\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Tiberius]]\n* [[Giancarlo Badessi]] as [[Claudius]]\n* Bruno Brive as [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]]\n* [[Adriana Asti]] as [[Ennia Thrasylla|Ennia]]\n* [[Leopoldo Trieste]] as Charicles\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as [[Cassius Chaerea]]\n** [[Joss Ackland]] as Cassius Chaerea (English [[Dubbing (filmaking)|dub]] voice) (uncredited)\n* [[John Steiner]] as Longinus\n* [[Mirella D'Angelo|Mirella Dangelo]] as Livia\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Caesonia]]\n* [[Rick Parets|Richard Parets]] as [[Mnester]]\n* Paula Mitchell as Subura Singer\n* [[Osiride Pevarello]] as Giant\n* Donato Placido as Proculus\n* [[Anneka Di Lorenzo]] as [[Messalina]]\n* Lori Wagner as [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]]\n* Davide as [[Incitatus|Caligula's horse]] (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Gore Vidal 3 Shankbone 2009 NYC cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gore Vidal]] was paid $200,000 to write the screenplay for ''Caligula'';<ref name=\"Guccione interview\"/> ultimately, the film credited no official screenwriter, only that it was \"adapted from a screenplay\" by Vidal.]]\n\nThe men's magazine ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' had long been involved in film funding, helping invest in films made by other studios, including ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'', but it had never produced a film on its own.<ref name=\"Guccione interview\"/> The magazine's founder [[Bob Guccione]] wanted to produce an explicit adult film within a feature film narrative that had high production values; he decided to produce a film about the rise and fall of the Roman emperor [[Caligula]].<ref name=epicencyclopedia115>{{cite book|author1=Constantine Santas|author2=James M.

She was the second of three daughters to Andrew Peter Tanning (Andreas Peter Georg Thaning, 1875\u20131943) and Amanda Marie Hansen (1879\u20131967), who named her for her maternal grandmother. After graduating from Galesburg Public High School in 1926, Tanning worked in the Galesburg Public Library (1927) and attended [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] (1928\u201330).  After two years of college she quit to pursue an artistic career, moving first to [[Chicago]] in 1930 and then to New York in 1935, where she supported herself as a [[commercial artist]] while working on her own painting.  Tanning was married briefly to the writer Homer Shannon in 1941, after an eight-year relationship.<ref>\"Artist's Chronology.\" Bailly, Jean Christopher, et al.  ''Dorothea Tanning''.  New York: George Braziller, 1995</ref>\n\nIn New York, Tanning discovered [[Surrealism]] at the [[MOMA|Museum of Modern Art]]'s seminal 1936 exhibition, ''Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism.'' In 1941, impressed by her creativity and talent in illustrating fashion advertisements, the art director at [[Macy\u2019s]] department store introduced her to the gallery owner [[Julien Levy]], who immediately offered to show her work. (Tanning would also become good friends with Levy and his wife, the painter Muriel Streeter, as seen in letters they exchanged in the 1940s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://harpers.org/archive/2016/06/beating-around-the-bush/|title=Beating Around the Bush|last=Tanning|first=Dorothea|date=June 2016|work=Harper's Magazine|access-date=2019-03-04|issn=0017-789X}}</ref>) Levy gave Tanning two solo exhibitions (in 1944 and 1948), and also introduced her to the circle of \u00e9migr\u00e9 Surrealists whose work he was showing in his New York gallery, including the German painter [[Max Ernst]].<ref>Tanning, Dorothea. ''Between Lives: An Artist and Her World''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2001.</ref>\n\nTanning first met Ernst at a party in 1942.

As Tanning recounts in her memoirs, he was enchanted by her iconic self-portrait ''Birthday'' (1942, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]).

Tanning read many Gothic and Romantic novels from her local library in her hometown of Galesburg.

Through the late 1940s, she continued to paint depictions of unreal scenes, some of which combined erotic subjects with enigmatic symbols and desolate space. During this period she formed enduring friendships with, among others, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and [[John Cage]].  She also designed sets and costumes for several of [[George Balanchine]]'s ballets, including ''The Night Shadow'' (the original version of his ballet ''[[La Sonnambula (Balanchine)|La Sonnambula]]'', which premiered in 1946 at [[New York City Center|City Center of Music and Drama]] in New York), and performed in two of [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]]'s avant-garde films, ''[[Dreams That Money Can Buy]]'' (1947) and ''[[8 x 8: A Chess Sonata in 8 Movements]]'' (1957).\n\nOver the next decade, Tanning's painting evolved, becoming less explicit and more suggestive.  Now working in [[Paris]] and Huismes, France, she began to move away from Surrealism and develop her own style.  During the mid-1950s, her work radically changed and her images became increasingly fragmented and prismatic, exemplified in works such as ''Insomnias'' (1957, [[Moderna Museet]], [[Stockholm]]).  As she explains, \"Around 1955 my canvases literally splintered... I broke the mirror, you might say\".\n\n[[File:Dorothea Tanning, \"Hotel de Pavot,\" 1970-73.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Dorothea Tanning, ''H\u00f4tel du Pavot, Chambre 202 (Poppy Hotel, Room 202)'' 1970-73, mixed media, 133 7/8 x 122 1/8 x 185 in./340 x 310 x 470&nbsp;cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, \u00a9The Estate of Dorothea Tanning]]\nBy the late 1960s, Tanning\u2019s paintings were almost completely abstract, yet always suggestive of the female form. From 1969 to 1973, Tanning embarked on what she described as \"an intense five- year adventure in soft sculpture,\"<ref name=\"Dorothea Tanning\"/> concentrating on a body of three-dimensional works in fabric.  Five of these sculptures comprise the installation ''H\u00f4tel du Pavot, Chambre 202''  (1970\u201373) that is now in the permanent collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris. During her time in France in the 1950s to 1970s, Tanning also became an active [[Printmaking|printmaker]], working in ateliers of Georges Visat and Pierre Chave and collaborating on a number of limited edition artists' books with such poets as [[Alain Bosquet]], [[Rene Crevel]], Lena Leclerq, and [[Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues]].<ref>Waddell, Roberta, and Ruby, Louisa Wood, eds., ''Dorothea Tanning: Hail Delirium!

New York: The New York Public Library, 1992.</ref> After her husband's death in 1976, Tanning remained in France for several years with a renewed concentration on her painting.  By 1980 she had relocated her home and studio to New York and embarked on an energetic creative period in which she produced paintings, drawings, collages, and prints.\n\nTanning's work has been recognized in numerous one-person exhibitions, both in the United States and in Europe, including major retrospectives in 1974 at the Centre National d\u2019Art Contemporain in Paris (which became the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1977), and in 1993 at the [[Malm\u00f6 Konsthall]] in Sweden and the at the [[Camden Arts Centre]] in London.

A collection of her poems, ''A Table of Content'', and a short novel, ''Chasm: A Weekend'', were both published in 2004.

She was the second of three daughters to Andrew Peter Tanning (Andreas Peter Georg Thaning, 1875\u20131943) and Amanda Marie Hansen (1879\u20131967), who named her for her maternal grandmother. After graduating from Galesburg Public High School in 1926, Tanning worked in the Galesburg Public Library (1927) and attended [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] (1928\u201330).  After two years of college she quit to pursue an artistic career, moving first to [[Chicago]] in 1930 and then to New York in 1935, where she supported herself as a [[commercial artist]] while working on her own painting.  Tanning was married briefly to the writer Homer Shannon in 1941, after an eight-year relationship.<ref>\"Artist's Chronology.\" Bailly, Jean Christopher, et al.  ''Dorothea Tanning''.  New York: George Braziller, 1995</ref>\n\nIn New York, Tanning discovered [[Surrealism]] at the [[MOMA|Museum of Modern Art]]'s seminal 1936 exhibition, ''Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism.'' In 1941, impressed by her creativity and talent in illustrating fashion advertisements, the art director at [[Macy\u2019s]] department store introduced her to the gallery owner [[Julien Levy]], who immediately offered to show her work. (Tanning would also become good friends with Levy and his wife, the painter Muriel Streeter, as seen in letters they exchanged in the 1940s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://harpers.org/archive/2016/06/beating-around-the-bush/|title=Beating Around the Bush|last=Tanning|first=Dorothea|date=June 2016|work=Harper's Magazine|access-date=2019-03-04|issn=0017-789X}}</ref>) Levy gave Tanning two solo exhibitions (in 1944 and 1948), and also introduced her to the circle of \u00e9migr\u00e9 Surrealists whose work he was showing in his New York gallery, including the German painter [[Max Ernst]].<ref>Tanning, Dorothea.

As Tanning recounts in her memoirs, he was enchanted by her iconic self-portrait ''Birthday'' (1942, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]).  The two played chess, fell in love, and embarked on a life together that took them to [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]] in Arizona, and later to France.<ref>Tanning, Dorothea. ''Birthday''.

Like other Surrealist painters, she was meticulous in her attention to details and in building up surfaces with carefully muted brushstrokes.  Through the late 1940s, she continued to paint depictions of unreal scenes, some of which combined erotic subjects with enigmatic symbols and desolate space. During this period she formed enduring friendships with, among others, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and [[John Cage]].  She also designed sets and costumes for several of [[George Balanchine]]'s ballets, including ''The Night Shadow'' (the original version of his ballet ''[[La Sonnambula (Balanchine)|La Sonnambula]]'', which premiered in 1946 at [[New York City Center|City Center of Music and Drama]] in New York), and performed in two of [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]]'s avant-garde films, ''[[Dreams That Money Can Buy]]'' (1947) and ''[[8 x 8: A Chess Sonata in 8 Movements]]'' (1957).\n\nOver the next decade, Tanning's painting evolved, becoming less explicit and more suggestive.  Now working in [[Paris]] and Huismes, France, she began to move away from Surrealism and develop her own style.  During the mid-1950s, her work radically changed and her images became increasingly fragmented and prismatic, exemplified in works such as ''Insomnias'' (1957, [[Moderna Museet]], [[Stockholm]]).  As she explains, \"Around 1955 my canvases literally splintered... I broke the mirror, you might say\".\n\n[[File:Dorothea Tanning, \"Hotel de Pavot,\" 1970-73.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Dorothea Tanning, ''H\u00f4tel du Pavot, Chambre 202 (Poppy Hotel, Room 202)'' 1970-73, mixed media, 133 7/8 x 122 1/8 x 185 in./340 x 310 x 470&nbsp;cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, \u00a9The Estate of Dorothea Tanning]]\nBy the late 1960s, Tanning\u2019s paintings were almost completely abstract, yet always suggestive of the female form.

Five of these sculptures comprise the installation ''H\u00f4tel du Pavot, Chambre 202''  (1970\u201373) that is now in the permanent collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris. During her time in France in the 1950s to 1970s, Tanning also became an active [[Printmaking|printmaker]], working in ateliers of Georges Visat and Pierre Chave and collaborating on a number of limited edition artists' books with such poets as [[Alain Bosquet]], [[Rene Crevel]], Lena Leclerq, and [[Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues]].<ref>Waddell, Roberta, and Ruby, Louisa Wood, eds., ''Dorothea Tanning: Hail Delirium!

By 1980 she had relocated her home and studio to New York and embarked on an energetic creative period in which she produced paintings, drawings, collages, and prints.\n\nTanning's work has been recognized in numerous one-person exhibitions, both in the United States and in Europe, including major retrospectives in 1974 at the Centre National d\u2019Art Contemporain in Paris (which became the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1977), and in 1993 at the [[Malm\u00f6 Konsthall]] in Sweden and the at the [[Camden Arts Centre]] in London.

It\u2019s enough to say that most of it comes straight out of dada, 1917. I get the impression that the idea is to shock. So many people laboring to outdo Duchamp\u2019s urinal. It isn\u2019t even shocking anymore, just kind of sad.\"<ref>Glassie, 2002.</ref>\n\nWhen speaking on her relationship with Ernst in an interview, Tanning said: \"I was a loner, am a loner, good Lord, it's the only way I can imagine working. And then when I hooked up with Max Ernst, he was clearly the only person I needed and, I assure you, we never, never talked art.

{"title_page": "E8 lattice", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:E<sub>8</sub> lattice}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''E<sub>8</sub> lattice''' is a special [[lattice (group)|lattice]] in '''R'''<sup>8</sup>. It can be characterized as the unique positive-definite, even, [[unimodular lattice]] of rank 8. The name derives from the fact that it is the [[root lattice]] of the [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub> root system]].\n\nThe norm<ref name=\"norm\">In this article, the ''norm'' of a vector refers to its length squared (the square of the ordinary [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]).</ref> of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice (divided by 2) is a positive definite even unimodular [[quadratic form]] in 8 variables, and conversely such a quadratic form can be used to construct a positive-definite, even, [[unimodular lattice]] of rank 8.\nThe existence of such a form was first shown by [[H. J. S. Smith]] in 1867,<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal| last=Smith | first=H. J. S. | title= On the orders and genera of quadratic forms containing more than three indeterminates | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society | volume=16 | year=1867 | pages=197\u2013208 | doi= 10.1098/rspl.1867.0036| doi-access=free }}</ref> and the first explicit construction of this quadratic form was given by [[Aleksandr Korkin|A. Korkin]] and [[Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev|G. Zolotarev]] in 1873.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Korkine | first1 = A. | last2 = Zolotareff| first2 = G. | title=Sur les formes quadratiques |journal = Mathematische Annalen | volume = 6 | pages = 366\u2013389 | year = 1873|doi=10.1007/BF01442795}}</ref>\n<!-- Conway claims this, but I can't find it in the paper.\nIn 1877 they constructed the corresponding E<sub>8</sub> lattice explicitly as part of a study of sphere packings.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Korkine and Zolotareff | first1 = A. | last2 = Zolotareff | first2 = G. | title=Sur les formes quadratique positives |journal = Mathematische Annalen | volume = 11 | pages = 242\u2013292 | year = 1877|doi=10.1007/BF01442667}}</ref> \n-->\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice is also called the '''Gosset lattice''' after [[Thorold Gosset]] who was one of the first to study the geometry of the lattice itself around 1900.<ref name=\"gosset\">{{Cite journal| last=Gosset | first=Thorold | title = On the regular and semi-regular figures in space of ''n'' dimensions | journal = [[Messenger of Mathematics]] | volume = 29 | pages = 43\u201348 | year = 1900}}</ref>\n\n==Lattice points==\nThe '''E<sub>8</sub> lattice''' is a [[discrete subgroup]] of '''R'''<sup>8</sup> of full rank (i.e. it spans all of '''R'''<sup>8</sup>). It can be given explicitly by the set of points \u0393<sub>8</sub> \u2282 '''R'''<sup>8</sup> such that\n*all the coordinates are [[integer]]s or all the coordinates are [[half-integer]]s (a mixture of integers and half-integers is not allowed), and\n*the sum of the eight coordinates is an [[even integer]].\nIn symbols,\n\n:<math>\\Gamma_8 = \\left\\{(x_i) \\in \\mathbb Z^8 \\cup (\\mathbb Z + \\tfrac{1}{2})^8 : {\\textstyle\\sum_i} x_i \\equiv 0\\;(\\mbox{mod }2)\\right\\}.</math>\nIt is not hard to check that the sum of two lattice points is another lattice point, so that \u0393<sub>8</sub> is indeed a subgroup.\n\nAn alternative description of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice which is sometimes convenient is the set of all points in \u0393&prime;<sub>8</sub> \u2282 '''R'''<sup>8</sup> such that\n*all the coordinates are integers and the sum of the coordinates is even, or\n*all the coordinates are half-integers and the sum of the coordinates is odd.\nIn symbols,\n:<math>\\Gamma_8' = \\left\\{(x_i) \\in \\mathbb Z^8 \\cup (\\mathbb Z + \\tfrac{1}{2})^8 : {{\\textstyle\\sum_i} x_i} \\equiv 2x_1 \\equiv 2x_2 \\equiv 2x_3 \\equiv 2x_4 \\equiv 2x_5 \\equiv 2x_6 \\equiv 2x_7 \\equiv 2x_8\\;(\\mbox{mod }2)\\right\\}.</math>\n\n:<math>\\Gamma_8' = \\left\\{(x_i) \\in \\mathbb Z^8 : {{\\textstyle\\sum_i} x_i} \\equiv 0(\\mbox{mod }2)\\right\\} \n\\cup \\left\\{(x_i) \\in (\\mathbb Z + \\tfrac{1}{2})^8 : {{\\textstyle\\sum_i} x_i} \\equiv 1(\\mbox{mod }2)\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe lattices \u0393<sub>8</sub> and \u0393&prime;<sub>8</sub> are [[isomorphic]] and one may pass from one to the other by changing the signs of any odd number of coordinates. The lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub> is sometimes called the ''even coordinate system'' for E<sub>8</sub> while the lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub>' is called the ''odd coordinate system''. Unless we specify otherwise we shall work in the even coordinate system.\n\n==Properties==\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub> can be characterized as the unique lattice in '''R'''<sup>8</sup> with the following properties:\n*It is ''integral'', meaning that all scalar products of lattice elements are integer numbers.\n*It is ''[[unimodular lattice|unimodular]]'', meaning that it is integral, and can be generated by the columns of an 8&times;8 matrix with [[determinant]] \u00b11 (i.e. the volume of the [[fundamental parallelotope]] of the lattice is 1). Equivalently, \u0393<sub>8</sub> is ''self-dual'', meaning it is equal to its [[dual lattice]].\n*It is ''even'', meaning that the norm<ref name=\"norm\"/> of any lattice vector is even.\nEven unimodular lattices can occur only in dimensions divisible by 8. In dimension 16 there are two such lattices: \u0393<sub>8</sub> \u2295 \u0393<sub>8</sub> and \u0393<sub>16</sub> (constructed in an analogous fashion to \u0393<sub>8</sub>). In dimension 24 there are 24 such lattices, called [[Niemeier lattice]]s. The most important of these is the [[Leech lattice]].\n\nOne possible basis for \u0393<sub>8</sub> is given by the columns of the ([[upper triangular matrix|upper triangular]]) matrix\n:<math>\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}\n2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  & 1/2\n\\end{smallmatrix}\\right].</math>\n\u0393<sub>8</sub> is then the integral span of these vectors. All other possible bases are obtained from this one by right multiplication by elements of GL(8,'''Z''').\n\nThe shortest nonzero vectors in \u0393<sub>8</sub> have norm squared 2. There are 240 such vectors:\n\n*All half-integer (can only be \u00b11/2):\n**All positive or all negative: 2\n**Four positive, four negative: (8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2*1)=70\n**Two of one, six of the other: 2*(8*7)/(2*1) = 56\n*All integer (can only be 0, \u00b11):\n**Two \u00b11, six zeroes: 4*(8*7)/(2*1)=112\n\nThese form a [[root system]] of type [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]]. The lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub> is equal to the E<sub>8</sub> root lattice, meaning that it is given by the integral span of the 240 roots. Any choice of 8 [[Simple root (root system)|simple root]]s gives a basis for \u0393<sub>8</sub>.\n\n==Symmetry group==\nThe [[automorphism group]] (or [[symmetry group]]) of a lattice in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is defined as the subgroup of the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') that preserves the lattice. The symmetry group of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice is the [[Weyl group|Weyl]]/[[Coxeter group]] of type E<sub>8</sub>. This is the group generated by [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s in the hyperplanes orthogonal to the 240 roots of the lattice.

All of the ''k''-faces for ''k'' \u2264 7 are simplices.\n\nThe [[vertex figure]] of Gosset's honeycomb is the semiregular [[E8 polytope|E<sub>8</sub> polytope]] (4<sub>21</sub> in Coxeter's notation) given by the [[convex hull]] of the 240 roots of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice.\n\nEach point of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice is surrounded by 2160 8-orthoplexes and 17280 8-simplices. The 2160 deep holes near the origin are exactly the halves of the norm 4 lattice points. The 17520 norm 8 lattice points fall into two classes (two [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]s under the action of the E<sub>8</sub> automorphism group): 240 are twice the norm 2 lattice points while 17280 are 3 times the shallow holes surrounding the origin.\n\nA [[lattice hole|hole]] in a lattice is a point in the ambient Euclidean space whose distance to the nearest lattice point is a [[local maximum]]. (In a lattice defined as a [[uniform honeycomb]] these points correspond to the centers of the [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] volumes.) A deep hole is one whose distance to the lattice is a global maximum. There are two types of holes in the E<sub>8</sub> lattice:\n*''Deep holes'' such as the point (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) are at a distance of 1 from the nearest lattice points. There are 16 lattice points at this distance which form the vertices of an [[8-orthoplex]] centered at the hole (the [[Delaunay cell]] of the hole).\n*''Shallow holes'' such as the point <math>(\\tfrac{5}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6})</math> are at a distance of <math>\\tfrac{2\\sqrt 2}{3}</math> from the nearest lattice points. There are 9 lattice points at this distance forming the vertices of an [[8-simplex]] centered at the hole.\n\n==Sphere packings and kissing numbers==\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice is remarkable in that it gives optimal solutions to the [[sphere packing problem]] and the [[kissing number problem]] in 8 dimensions.\n\nThe [[sphere packing problem]] asks what is the densest way to pack (solid) ''n''-dimensional spheres of a fixed radius in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> so that no two spheres overlap. Lattice packings are special types of sphere packings where the spheres are centered at the points of a lattice. Placing spheres of radius 1/{{radic|2}} at the points of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice gives a lattice packing in '''R'''<sup>8</sup> with a density of\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi^4}{2^4 4!} \\cong 0.25367.</math>\nIt has long been known that this is the maximum density that can be achieved by a lattice packing in 8 dimensions.<ref>{{Cite journal| first = H.

The fact that solutions are known in dimensions 8 and 24 follows in part from the special properties of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice and its 24-dimensional cousin, the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n==Theta function==\nOne can associate to any (positive-definite) lattice \u039b a [[theta function]] given by\n:<math>\\Theta_\\Lambda(\\tau) = \\sum_{x\\in\\Lambda}e^{i\\pi\\tau\\|x\\|^2}\\qquad\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\tau > 0.</math>\nThe theta function of a lattice is then a [[holomorphic function]] on the [[upper half-plane]]. Furthermore, the theta function of an even unimodular lattice of rank ''n'' is actually a [[modular form]] of weight ''n''/2. The theta function of an integral lattice is often written as a power series in <math>q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}</math> so that the coefficient of ''q''<sup>''n''</sup> gives the number of lattice vectors of norm ''n''.\n\nUp to normalization, there is a unique modular form of weight 4: the [[Eisenstein series]] ''G''<sub>4</sub>(\u03c4). The theta function for the E<sub>8</sub> lattice must then be proportional to ''G''<sub>4</sub>(\u03c4). The normalization can be fixed by noting that there is a unique vector of norm 0. This gives\n:<math>\\Theta_{\\Gamma_8}(\\tau) = 1 + 240\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sigma_3(n) q^{2n}</math>\nwhere \u03c3<sub>3</sub>(''n'') is the [[divisor function]]. It follows that the number of E<sub>8</sub> lattice vectors of norm 2''n'' is 240 times the sum of the cubes of the divisors of ''n''. The first few terms of this series are given by {{OEIS|id=A004009}}:\n:<math>\\Theta_{\\Gamma_8}(\\tau) = 1 + 240\\,q^2 + 2160\\,q^4 + 6720\\,q^6 + 17520\\,q^8 + 30240\\, q^{10} + 60480\\,q^{12} + O(q^{14}).</math>\nThe E<sub>8</sub> theta function may be written in terms of the [[Jacobi theta function]]s  as follows:\n:<math>\\Theta_{\\Gamma_8}(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\theta_2(q)^8 + \\theta_3(q)^8 + \\theta_4(q)^8\\right)</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\n\\theta_2(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}q^{(n+\\frac{1}{2})^2}\\qquad\n\\theta_3(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}q^{n^2}\\qquad\n\\theta_4(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}(-1)^n q^{n^2}.\n</math>\n\n==Other constructions==\n\n===Hamming code===\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice is very closely related to the (extended) [[Hamming code]] ''H''(8,4) and can, in fact, be constructed from it. The Hamming code ''H''(8,4) is a [[linear code|binary code]] of length 8 and rank 4; that is, it is a 4-dimensional subspace of the finite vector space ('''F'''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>8</sup>. Writing elements of ('''F'''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>8</sup> as 8-bit integers in [[hexadecimal]], the code ''H''(8,4) can by given explicitly as the set\n:{00, 0F, 33, 3C, 55, 5A, 66, 69, 96, 99, A5, AA, C3, CC, F0, FF}.\nThe code ''H''(8,4) is significant partly because it is a [[Self-dual code|Type II self-dual code]]. It has a minimum [[Hamming weight]] 4, meaning that any two codewords differ by at least 4 bits. It is the largest length 8 binary code with this property.\n\nOne can construct a lattice \u039b from a binary code ''C'' of length ''n'' by taking the set of all vectors ''x'' in '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that ''x'' is congruent (modulo 2) to a codeword of ''C''.<ref>This is the so-called \"Construction A\" in Conway and Sloane (1998). See &sect;2 of Ch. 5.</ref> It is often convenient to rescale \u039b by a factor of 1/{{radic|2}},\n\n:<math>\\Lambda = \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb Z^n : x\\,\\bmod\\,2 \\in C\\right\\}.</math>\n\nApplying this construction a Type II self-dual code gives an even, unimodular lattice. In particular, applying it to the Hamming code ''H''(8,4) gives an E<sub>8</sub> lattice. It is not entirely trivial, however, to find an explicit isomorphism between this lattice and the lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub> defined above.\n\n===Integral octonions===\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice is also closely related to the [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|nonassociative algebra]] of real [[octonion]]s '''O'''. It is possible to define the concept of an [[integral octonion]] analogous to that of an [[integral quaternion]]. The integral octonions naturally form a lattice inside '''O'''. This lattice is just a rescaled E<sub>8</sub> lattice. (The minimum norm in the integral octonion lattice is 1 rather than 2). Embedded in the octonions in this manner the E<sub>8</sub> lattice takes on the structure of a [[nonassociative ring]].\n\nFixing a basis (1, ''i'', ''j'', ''k'', \u2113, \u2113''i'', \u2113''j'', \u2113''k'')  of unit octonions,\none can define the integral octonions as a [[maximal order]] containing this basis. (One must, of course, extend the definitions of ''order'' and ''ring'' to include the nonassociative case). This amounts to finding the largest [[subring]] of '''O''' containing the units on which the expressions ''x''*''x'' (the norm of ''x'') and ''x'' + ''x''* (twice the real part of ''x'') are integer-valued. There are actually seven such maximal orders, one corresponding to each of the seven imaginary units. However, all seven maximal orders are isomorphic. One such maximal order is generated by the octonions ''i'', ''j'', and \u00bd (''i'' + ''j'' + ''k'' + \u2113).\n\nA detailed account of the integral octonions and their relation to the E<sub>8</sub> lattice can be found in Conway and Smith (2003).\n\n====Example definition of integral octonions====\nConsider octonion multiplication defined by triads: 137, 267, 457, 125, 243, 416, 356. Then integral octonions form vectors:\n\n1) <math>\\pm e_i</math>,  i=0, 1, ..., 7\n\n2) <math>\\pm e_0\\pm e_a\\pm e_b\\pm e_c</math>,  indexes abc run through the seven triads 124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 672, 713\n\n3) <math>\\pm e_p\\pm e_q\\pm e_r\\pm e_s</math>,  indexes pqrs run through the seven tetrads 3567, 1467, 1257, 1236, 2347, 1345, 2456.\n\nImaginary octonions in this set, namely 14 from 1) and 7*16=112 from 3), form the roots of the Lie algebra <math>E_7</math>. Along with the remaining 2+112 vectors we obtain 240 vectors that form roots of Lie algebra <math>E_8</math>. See the Koca work on this subject.<ref>Mehmet Koca, Ramazan Koc, Nazife O. Koca, The Chevalley group <math>G_{2}(2)</math> of order 12096 and the octonionic root system of <math>E_{7}</math>,Linear Algebra and its Applications Volume 422, Issues 2-3, 15 April 2007, Pages 808-823 [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509189]</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nIn 1982 [[Michael Freedman]] produced an example of a topological [[4-manifold]], called the [[E8 manifold|E<sub>8</sub> manifold]], whose [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] is given by the E<sub>8</sub> lattice. This manifold is an example of a topological manifold which admits no [[smooth structure]] and is not even [[triangulation (topology)|triangulable]].\n\nIn [[string theory]], the [[heterotic string]] is a peculiar hybrid of a 26-dimensional [[bosonic string]] and a 10-dimensional [[superstring]]. In order for the theory to work correctly, the 16 mismatched dimensions must be compactified on an even, unimodular lattice of rank 16. There are two such lattices: \u0393<sub>8</sub>\u2295\u0393<sub>8</sub> and \u0393<sub>16</sub> (constructed in a fashion analogous to that of \u0393<sub>8</sub>). These lead to two version of the heterotic string known as the E<sub>8</sub>&times;E<sub>8</sub> heterotic string and the SO(32) heterotic string.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Leech lattice]]\n*[[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub> (mathematics)]]\n*[[Semiregular E-polytope]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{Cite book |last1=Conway |first1=John H. |authorlink1=John Horton Conway |last2=Sloane |first2=Neil J.

The lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub> is sometimes called the ''even coordinate system'' for E<sub>8</sub> while the lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub>' is called the ''odd coordinate system''. Unless we specify otherwise we shall work in the even coordinate system.\n\n==Properties==\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub> can be characterized as the unique lattice in '''R'''<sup>8</sup> with the following properties:\n*It is ''integral'', meaning that all scalar products of lattice elements are integer numbers.\n*It is ''[[unimodular lattice|unimodular]]'', meaning that it is integral, and can be generated by the columns of an 8&times;8 matrix with [[determinant]] \u00b11 (i.e. the volume of the [[fundamental parallelotope]] of the lattice is 1). Equivalently, \u0393<sub>8</sub> is ''self-dual'', meaning it is equal to its [[dual lattice]].\n*It is ''even'', meaning that the norm<ref name=\"norm\"/> of any lattice vector is even.\nEven unimodular lattices can occur only in dimensions divisible by 8. In dimension 16 there are two such lattices: \u0393<sub>8</sub> \u2295 \u0393<sub>8</sub> and \u0393<sub>16</sub> (constructed in an analogous fashion to \u0393<sub>8</sub>). In dimension 24 there are 24 such lattices, called [[Niemeier lattice]]s. The most important of these is the [[Leech lattice]].\n\nOne possible basis for \u0393<sub>8</sub> is given by the columns of the ([[upper triangular matrix|upper triangular]]) matrix\n:<math>\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}\n2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  & 1/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  & 1/2\n\\end{smallmatrix}\\right].</math>\n\u0393<sub>8</sub> is then the integral span of these vectors. All other possible bases are obtained from this one by right multiplication by elements of GL(8,'''Z''').\n\nThe shortest nonzero vectors in \u0393<sub>8</sub> have norm squared 2. There are 240 such vectors:\n\n*All half-integer: (can only be \u00b11/2)\n**All positive or all negative: 2\n**Four positive, four negative: (8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2*1)=70\n**Two of one, six of the other: 2*(8*7)/(2*1) = 56\n*All integer: (can only be 0, \u00b11)\n**Two \u00b11, six zeroes: 4*(8*7)/(2*1)=112\n\nThese form a [[root system]] of type [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]]. The lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub> is equal to the E<sub>8</sub> root lattice, meaning that it is given by the integral span of the 240 roots. Any choice of 8 [[Simple root (root system)|simple root]]s gives a basis for \u0393<sub>8</sub>.\n\n==Symmetry group==\nThe [[automorphism group]] (or [[symmetry group]]) of a lattice in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is defined as the subgroup of the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') that preserves the lattice. The symmetry group of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice is the [[Weyl group|Weyl]]/[[Coxeter group]] of type E<sub>8</sub>. This is the group generated by [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s in the hyperplanes orthogonal to the 240 roots of the lattice. Its [[order (group theory)|order]] is given by\n:<math>|W(\\mathrm{E}_8)| = 696729600 = 4!\\cdot 6!\\cdot 8!.</math>\n\nThe E<sub>8</sub> Weyl group contains a subgroup of order 128\u00b78! consisting of all [[permutation]]s of the coordinates and all even sign changes. This subgroup is the Weyl group of type D<sub>8</sub>. The full E<sub>8</sub> Weyl group is generated by this subgroup and the [[block diagonal matrix]] ''H''<sub>4</sub>\u2295''H''<sub>4</sub> where ''H''<sub>4</sub> is the [[Hadamard matrix]]\n:<math>H_4 = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 & -1\\\\\n1 & 1 & -1 & -1\\\\\n1 & -1 & -1 & 1\\\\\n\\end{smallmatrix}\\right].</math>\n\n==Geometry==\n: See [[5 21 honeycomb|5<sub>21</sub> honeycomb]]\n\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice points are the vertices of the [[5 21 honeycomb|5<sub>21</sub>]] honeycomb, which is composed of regular [[8-simplex]] and [[8-orthoplex]] [[Facet (geometry)|facets]]. This honeycomb was first studied by Gosset who called it a ''9-ic semi-regular figure''<ref name=\"gosset\"/> (Gosset regarded honeycombs in ''n'' dimensions as degenerate ''n''+1 polytopes). In [[H.

All of the ''k''-faces for ''k'' \u2264 7 are simplices.\n\nThe [[vertex figure]] of Gosset's honeycomb is the semiregular [[E8 polytope|E<sub>8</sub> polytope]] (4<sub>21</sub> in Coxeter's notation) given by the [[convex hull]] of the 240 roots of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice.\n\nEach point of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice is surrounded by 2160 8-orthoplexes and 17280 8-simplices. The 2160 deep holes near the origin are exactly the halves of the norm 4 lattice points. The 17520 norm 8 lattice points fall into two classes (two [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]s under the action of the E<sub>8</sub> automorphism group): 240 are twice the norm 2 lattice points while 17280 are 3 times the shallow holes surrounding the origin.\n\nA [[lattice hole|hole]] in a lattice is a point in the ambient Euclidean space whose distance to the nearest lattice point is a [[local maximum]]. (In a lattice defined as a [[uniform honeycomb]] these points correspond to the centers of the [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] volumes.) A deep hole is one whose distance to the lattice is a global maximum. There are two types of holes in the E<sub>8</sub> lattice:\n*''Deep holes'' such as the point (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) are at a distance of 1 from the nearest lattice points. There are 16 lattice points at this distance which form the vertices of an [[8-orthoplex]] centered at the hole (the [[Delaunay cell]] of the hole).\n*''Shallow holes'' such as the point <math>(\\tfrac{5}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6}, \\tfrac{1}{6})</math> are at a distance of <math>\\tfrac{2\\sqrt 2}{3}</math> from the nearest lattice points. There are 9 lattice points at this distance forming the vertices of an [[8-simplex]] centered at the hole.\n\n==Sphere packings and kissing numbers==\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice is remarkable in that it gives optimal solutions to the [[sphere packing problem]] and the [[kissing number problem]] in 8 dimensions.\n\nThe [[sphere packing problem]] asks what is the densest way to pack (solid) ''n''-dimensional spheres of a fixed radius in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> so that no two spheres overlap. Lattice packings are special types of sphere packings where the spheres are centered at the points of a lattice. Placing spheres of radius 1/{{radic|2}} at the points of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice gives a lattice packing in '''R'''<sup>8</sup> with a density of\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi^4}{2^4 4!} \\cong 0.25367.</math>\nIt has long been known that this is the maximum density that can be achieved by a lattice packing in 8 dimensions.<ref>{{Cite journal| first = H.

This is because there are 240 lattice vectors of minimum nonzero norm (the roots of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice). It was shown in 1979 that this is the maximum possible number in 8 dimensions.<ref>{{Cite journal| first = V.

The fact that solutions are known in dimensions 8 and 24 follows in part from the special properties of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice and its 24-dimensional cousin, the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n==Theta function==\nOne can associate to any (positive-definite) lattice \u039b a [[theta function]] given by\n:<math>\\Theta_\\Lambda(\\tau) = \\sum_{x\\in\\Lambda}e^{i\\pi\\tau\\|x\\|^2}\\qquad\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\tau > 0.</math>\nThe theta function of a lattice is then a [[holomorphic function]] on the [[upper half-plane]]. Furthermore, the theta function of an even unimodular lattice of rank ''n'' is actually a [[modular form]] of weight ''n''/2. The theta function of an integral lattice is often written as a power series in <math>q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}</math> so that the coefficient of ''q''<sup>''n''</sup> gives the number of lattice vectors of norm ''n''.\n\nUp to normalization, there is a unique modular form of weight 4: the [[Eisenstein series]] ''G''<sub>4</sub>(\u03c4). The theta function for the E<sub>8</sub> lattice must then be proportional to ''G''<sub>4</sub>(\u03c4). The normalization can be fixed by noting that there is a unique vector of norm 0. This gives\n:<math>\\Theta_{\\Gamma_8}(\\tau) = 1 + 240\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sigma_3(n) q^{2n}</math>\nwhere \u03c3<sub>3</sub>(''n'') is the [[divisor function]]. It follows that the number of E<sub>8</sub> lattice vectors of norm 2''n'' is 240 times the sum of the cubes of the divisors of ''n''. The first few terms of this series are given by {{OEIS|id=A004009}}:\n:<math>\\Theta_{\\Gamma_8}(\\tau) = 1 + 240\\,q^2 + 2160\\,q^4 + 6720\\,q^6 + 17520\\,q^8 + 30240\\, q^{10} + 60480\\,q^{12} + O(q^{14}).</math>\nThe E<sub>8</sub> theta function may be written in terms of the [[Jacobi theta function]]s  as follows:\n:<math>\\Theta_{\\Gamma_8}(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\theta_2(q)^8 + \\theta_3(q)^8 + \\theta_4(q)^8\\right)</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\n\\theta_2(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}q^{(n+\\frac{1}{2})^2}\\qquad\n\\theta_3(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}q^{n^2}\\qquad\n\\theta_4(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}(-1)^n q^{n^2}.\n</math>\n\n==Other constructions==\n\n===Hamming code===\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice is very closely related to the (extended) [[Hamming code]] ''H''(8,4) and can, in fact, be constructed from it. The Hamming code ''H''(8,4) is a [[linear code|binary code]] of length 8 and rank 4; that is, it is a 4-dimensional subspace of the finite vector space ('''F'''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>8</sup>. Writing elements of ('''F'''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>8</sup> as 8-bit integers in [[hexadecimal]], the code ''H''(8,4) can by given explicitly as the set\n:{00, 0F, 33, 3C, 55, 5A, 66, 69, 96, 99, A5, AA, C3, CC, F0, FF}.\nThe code ''H''(8,4) is significant partly because it is a [[Self-dual code|Type II self-dual code]]. It has a minimum [[Hamming weight]] 4, meaning that any two codewords differ by at least 4 bits. It is the largest length 8 binary code with this property.\n\nOne can construct a lattice \u039b from a binary code ''C'' of length ''n'' by taking the set of all vectors ''x'' in '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that ''x'' is congruent (modulo 2) to a codeword of ''C''.<ref>This is the so-called \"Construction A\" in Conway and Sloane (1998). See &sect;2 of Ch. 5.</ref> It is often convenient to rescale \u039b by a factor of 1/{{radic|2}},\n\n:<math>\\Lambda = \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb Z^n : x\\,\\bmod\\,2 \\in C\\right\\}.</math>\n\nApplying this construction a Type II self-dual code gives an even, unimodular lattice. In particular, applying it to the Hamming code ''H''(8,4) gives an E<sub>8</sub> lattice. It is not entirely trivial, however, to find an explicit isomorphism between this lattice and the lattice \u0393<sub>8</sub> defined above.\n\n===Integral octonions===\nThe E<sub>8</sub> lattice is also closely related to the [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|nonassociative algebra]] of real [[octonion]]s '''O'''. It is possible to define the concept of an [[integral octonion]] analogous to that of an [[integral quaternion]]. The integral octonions naturally form a lattice inside '''O'''. This lattice is just a rescaled E<sub>8</sub> lattice. (The minimum norm in the integral octonion lattice is 1 rather than 2). Embedded in the octonions in this manner the E<sub>8</sub> lattice takes on the structure of a [[nonassociative ring]].\n\nFixing a basis (1, ''i'', ''j'', ''k'', \u2113, \u2113''i'', \u2113''j'', \u2113''k'')  of unit octonions,\none can define the integral octonions as a [[maximal order]] containing this basis. (One must, of course, extend the definitions of ''order'' and ''ring'' to include the nonassociative case). This amounts to finding the largest [[subring]] of '''O''' containing the units on which the expressions ''x''*''x'' (the norm of ''x'') and ''x'' + ''x''* (twice the real part of ''x'') are integer-valued. There are actually seven such maximal orders, one corresponding to each of the seven imaginary units. However, all seven maximal orders are isomorphic. One such maximal order is generated by the octonions ''i'', ''j'', and \u00bd (''i'' + ''j'' + ''k'' + \u2113).\n\nA detailed account of the integral octonions and their relation to the E<sub>8</sub> lattice can be found in Conway and Smith (2003).\n\n====Example definition of integral octonions====\nConsider octonion multiplication defined by triads: 137, 267, 457, 125, 243, 416, 356. Then integral octonions form vectors:\n\n1) <math>\\pm e_i</math>,  i=0, 1, ..., 7\n\n2) <math>\\pm e_0\\pm e_a\\pm e_b\\pm e_c</math>,  indexes abc run through the seven triads 124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 672, 713\n\n3) <math>\\pm e_p\\pm e_q\\pm e_r\\pm e_s</math>,  indexes pqrs run through the seven tetrads 3567, 1467, 1257, 1236, 2347, 1345, 2456.\n\nImaginary octonions in this set, namely 14 from 1) and 7*16=112 from 3), form the roots of the Lie algebra <math>E_7</math>. Along with the remaining 2+112 vectors we obtain 240 vectors that form roots of Lie algebra <math>E_8</math>. See the Koca work on this subject.<ref>Mehmet Koca, Ramazan Koc, Nazife O. Koca, The Chevalley group <math>G_{2}(2)</math> of order 12096 and the octonionic root system of <math>E_{7}</math>,Linear Algebra and its Applications Volume 422, Issues 2-3, 15 April 2007, Pages 808-823 [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509189]</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nIn 1982 [[Michael Freedman]] produced an example of a topological [[4-manifold]], called the [[E8 manifold|E<sub>8</sub> manifold]], whose [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] is given by the E<sub>8</sub> lattice. This manifold is an example of a topological manifold which admits no [[smooth structure]] and is not even [[triangulation (topology)|triangulable]].\n\nIn [[string theory]], the [[heterotic string]] is a peculiar hybrid of a 26-dimensional [[bosonic string]] and a 10-dimensional [[superstring]]. In order for the theory to work correctly, the 16 mismatched dimensions must be compactified on an even, unimodular lattice of rank 16. There are two such lattices: \u0393<sub>8</sub>\u2295\u0393<sub>8</sub> and \u0393<sub>16</sub> (constructed in a fashion analogous to that of \u0393<sub>8</sub>). These lead to two version of the heterotic string known as the E<sub>8</sub>&times;E<sub>8</sub> heterotic string and the SO(32) heterotic string.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Leech lattice]]\n*[[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub> (mathematics)]]\n*[[Semiregular E-polytope]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{Cite book |last1=Conway |first1=John H. |authorlink1=John Horton Conway |last2=Sloane |first2=Neil J.
