{"title_page": "The Pickwick Papers (1913 film)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n[[File:Pickwick 1913.jpg|thumb|John Bunny as Samuel Pickwick]]\n'''''The Pickwick Papers''''' is a 1913 three-reel [[silent film]] based on the [[The Pickwick Papers|novel of the same name]] by Charles Dickens. The film was produced by [[Vitagraph Studios]] and features [[John Bunny]] in the title role of Samuel Pickwick. Bunny and the Vitagraph Company desired to make an authentic recreation of Dickens's novel, and filming took place in England rather than at Vitagraph's New York studio. Bunny himself regarded ''The Pickwick Papers'' highly, and ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' praised its fidelity to Dickens's work. The film did not achieve popularity among audiences, however, who preferred Bunny's usual output of one-reel comedies. Only two reels of the film survive in the holdings of the [[British Film Institute]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Plot==\n''The Pickwick Papers'' comprised three [[Film reel|reels]], individually titled \"The Adventure of the Honourable Event\", \"The Adventure at the Westgate Seminary\", and \"The Adventure of the Shooting Party\".{{sfn|Millar|n.d.}} The film does not adapt Dickens's novel in its entirety; each reel depicts a distinct episode from the beginning of the book.<ref>See {{harvnb|Hoffman|1913|p=663}}. ''The Pickwick Papers'' was originally published as a serial. The film scholar Michael Pointer observes that the novel's \"short, self-contained sequences were extremely handy for early filmmakers, who were limited both by their apparatus and the conventions of the time.\" Earlier films that drew from the novel include ''Mr. Pickwick's Christmas at Wardles'' (1901), ''Gabriel Grub'' (1904), ''A Knight for a Night'' (1909), and ''Mr. Pickwick's Predicament'' (1912) {{harv|Pointer|1996|pp=8, 15, 33, 119}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pickwick and company.jpg|thumb|left|Dinner at the Bull Inn. From left to right: Tupman and Jingle (foreground); Snodgrass, Winkle, and Pickwick (background).]]\nIn \"The Honourable Event\", Mr. Pickwick catches a cab to meet three friends from his club but gets in an altercation with the cab driver upon arrival. The cabman is placated by a tall, thin gentleman named Mr. Jingle, whom Pickwick invites to dine at the Bull Inn in Rochester with his three friends\u2014Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Tupman. The group catches a coach to Rochester and dinner is served. As the evening progresses, all but Jingle and Tupman doze off, and the two decide to attend a charity ball being held that evening at the inn. As Jingle does not have the proper attire, Tupman takes clothes from the room of the sleeping Winkle for him to wear.\n\nAt the ball, Jingle incites the envy of one of the other guests, Dr. Slammer, by escorting a woman named Mrs. Budger to her carriage. The next morning, Slammer sends a message to the inn requesting a duel with \"the slim gentleman\" who had insulted him. The bewildered Winkle accepts the duel, believing he had inadvertently insulted someone while drunk the night before. The duel is about to commence when Slammer realizes that a mix-up has occurred. The two men return to the inn, whereupon Slammer recognizes Jingle as the man who had insulted him and again demands a duel. Pickwick, however, refuses to accept that Jingle has done anything wrong and sends Slammer on his way.<ref name=\"BFI synopsis\" />{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|pp=663\u2013664|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:The Shooting Party.jpg|thumb|Pickwick as he is wheeled to the town jail]]\n\"The Shooting Party\" begins with Pickwick and a group of friends\u2014including Winkle, Tupman, and Pickwick's servant Sam Weller\u2014setting out on a hunting expedition. As Pickwick is lame, he is carried in a wheelbarrow along the way by his servant. The party sits down for lunch on land belonging to an adjacent estate. Pickwick falls asleep, and the others continue with the expedition. The owner of the estate, Captain Boldwig, discovers Pickwick as he is making an inspection of his land and angrily sends Pickwick\u2014still asleep in his wheelbarrow\u2014off to the town jail, where his friends discover him that evening.{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|p=664|ps=none}}\n\n\"The Westgate Seminary\" opens with a conversation between Sam Weller and Mr. Jingle's servant, Job Trotter. Trotter falsely informs Weller that his master is planning to elope with a girl from the nearby Westgate boarding school for young ladies. Pickwick resolves to foil this elopement and scales the school walls that night with the goal of catching Jingle. Jingle does not arrive, however, and Pickwick is discovered by the frightened residents of the school, who lock him in a closet until the veracity of his story can be established. Upon the arrival of his friends, Pickwick is freed.{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|p=664|ps=none}}\n\n==Cast==\nThe [[British Film Institute]] lists the following cast for the film:<ref name=\"BFI cast\" />\n{{div col}}\n* John Bunny as Samuel Pickwick\n* Arthur Ricketts as Mr. Jingle\n* Sidney Hunt as Mr. Snodgrass\n* [[Minnie Rayner]] as Mrs. Budger\n* James Pryor as Mr. Tupman\n* Fred Hornby as Mr. Winkle\n* Arthur White as Dr. Slammer\n* H.

Bunny, along with director [[Laurence Trimble]] and camera operator Arthur Ross, left for England on May 25, 1912. The principal goal of the trip was to film authentic scenes from Dickens's novel, with Bunny to select the actors for the other roles upon arrival in England.<ref>See {{cite magazine |title=John Bunny Sails for England |work=The Moving Picture World |volume=12 |issue=10 |date=June 8, 1912 |page=911 |url=https://archive.org/stream/movingpicturewor12newy#page/910/mode/2up |mode=cs2}}. 1912 was the centenary of Dickens's birth, and many screen adaptations of his works entered production that year. In all, at least twenty films based on Dickens's works were released in 1912 and 1913 {{harv|Pointer|1996|p=29}}.</ref> The group did not attempt to adapt ''The Pickwick Papers'' in its entirety\u2014only three episodes from the beginning of the book were filmed, with the idea of adapting the rest of the novel if the initial releases should prove popular.{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|p=663|ps=none}}\n\nBunny had floated the idea of filming scenes from the novel in England to Vitagraph executives around a year before production took place.{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|p=663|ps=none}} As he recounted in September 1912: \"The making of Pickwick has been one of my fondest dreams for several years. It has been my desire to produce in pictures the famous character of Pickwick amid the very scenes of which Dickens wrote, and I think when these pictures we have made are shown to the public it will be said that our work has not been in vain.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Hoffman|1912|p=1157}}</ref>\n\nBunny's popularity was at its peak at the time he traveled to England.{{sfn|Smith|1952|p=208|ps=none}} Regarding his time there, ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' reported: \"Whenever he appears upon the street in London he has to 'keep moving.' If he stops for any length of time he is in danger of arrest for blockading the sidewalk. He is so well-known by sight, through his appearances in the Vitagraph pictures, that everywhere he goes he is recognized and hailed with glee by the general run of mankind.\"<ref name=\"Bunny in England\" /> While filming was taking place, Bunny was offered a contract by an English producer with a salary that considerably exceeded the $200 a week he was making at Vitagraph. Bunny cabled news of the offer to Vitagraph, and was promptly offered a raise that he found satisfactory.{{sfn|Smith|1952|p=208|ps=none}}{{sfn|Dunham 1968\u201369|ps=, n.p.}}\n\nVitagraph was committed to producing an accurate and authentic adaptation of Dickens's novel.<ref name=\"Bunny Sails\" /> Bunny recounted to ''The Moving Picture World'' how the Vitagraph party attempted to borrow an original two-wheeled cab from the British Museum to use in the film, but were refused by the museum curators. The group apparently made an exact replica of this vehicle, and used it frequently in the film. According to Bunny, the four-wheeled coach used for the ride to Rochester in \"The Honorable Event\" was an original from the times of Pickwick. Bunny related that while filming in Rochester, large crowds gathered each day to watch the filming take place, and that nearly all of Rochester's police force was required to keep them at a proper distance.{{sfn|Hoffman|1912|p=1157|ps=none}}\n\nBesides ''The Pickwick Papers'', the Vitagraph party shot several one-reel films while abroad, including ''Bunny at Sea'', filmed on board ship to England; ''Bunny at the Derby'', filmed at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom Downs]]; ''Cork and Vicinity'', filmed in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]]; and ''The Blarney Stone'', filmed at [[Blarney Castle]].{{sfn|Hoffman|1912|p=1157|ps=none}}{{sfn|Gill|1972|pp=12\u201313|ps=none}} The group returned to the United States after three months abroad and incidental stops in Paris and Berlin.{{sfn|Hoffman|1912|p=1157|ps=none}}<ref name=\"Bunny Returns\" />\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"The Honourable Event\" and \"The Adventure of Westgate Seminary\" were released in the United States on February 28, 1913, and \"The Adventure of the Shooting Party\" was released on September 5, 1913.<ref>See {{harvnb|Gill|1972|pp=13\u201314}}. The third reel was released as a split reel along with ''The Baby Elephant'' {{harv|Slide|Gevinson|1987|p=235}}.</ref> The first two reels were released in the United Kingdom on June 9, 1913, and the third reel was released on December 18, 1913.{{sfn|Pointer|1996|p=123|ps=none}}\n\nDespite the effort Bunny and his associates invested in ''The Pickwick Papers'', contemporary audiences did not take to the film, instead preferring the one-reel comedies Bunny was used to producing for Vitagraph. As Bunny recalled in 1915: \"Listen, I went to England and put in some of the hardest work of my life in producing ''Mr. Pickwick''. I found every place that was unchanged, from Dingley Dell to the White Hart Tavern, and we worked it all out true to life. I'm proud of those pictures \u2013 but they haven't sold at all in comparison with these things I'm turning out every week.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Lanier|1915|p=577}}</ref> According to Vitagraph's co-founder [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert E. Smith]]: \"As Mr. Pickwick, Bunny won no new laurels, though we felt he deserved them. His followers would have no part of this sort of artistry; they preferred the old-line Bunny farce: the comic terror, the panic, the despair.\"{{sfn|Smith|1952|p=208|ps=none}}\n\nHugh Hoffman of ''The Moving Picture World'' praised the film for using the original locations Dickens had wrote of, finding that \"[t]he pictures are saturated with local color and in every instance they live up to the very letter of the word of Dickens\".

The film was produced by [[Vitagraph Studios]] and features [[John Bunny]] in the title role of Samuel Pickwick. Bunny and the Vitagraph Company desired to make an authentic recreation of Dickens's novel, and filming took place in England rather than at Vitagraph's New York studio. Bunny himself regarded ''The Pickwick Papers'' highly, and ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' praised its fidelity to Dickens's work. The film did not achieve popularity among audiences, however, who preferred Bunny's usual output of one-reel comedies. Only two reels of the film survive in the holdings of the [[British Film Institute]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Plot==\n''The Pickwick Papers'' comprised three [[Film reel|reels]], individually titled \"The Adventure of the Honourable Event\", \"The Adventure at the Westgate Seminary\", and \"The Adventure of the Shooting Party\".{{sfn|Millar|n.d.}} The film does not adapt Dickens's novel in its entirety; each reel depicts a distinct episode from the beginning of the book.<ref>See {{harvnb|Hoffman|1913|p=663}}. ''The Pickwick Papers'' was originally published as a serial. The film scholar Michael Pointer observes that the novel's \"short, self-contained sequences were extremely handy for early filmmakers, who were limited both by their apparatus and the conventions of the time.\" Earlier films that drew from the novel include ''Mr. Pickwick's Christmas at Wardles'' (1901), ''Gabriel Grub'' (1904), ''A Knight for a Night'' (1909), and ''Mr. Pickwick's Predicament'' (1912) {{harv|Pointer|1996|pp=8, 15, 33, 119}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pickwick and company.jpg|thumb|left|Dinner at the Bull Inn. From left to right: Tupman and Jingle (foreground); Snodgrass, Winkle, and Pickwick (background).]]\nIn \"The Honourable Event\", Mr. Pickwick catches a cab to meet three friends from his club but gets in an altercation with the cab driver upon arrival. The cabman is placated by a tall, thin gentleman named Mr. Jingle, whom Pickwick invites to dine at the Bull Inn in Rochester with his three friends\u2014Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Tupman. The group catches a coach to Rochester and dinner is served. As the evening progresses, all but Jingle and Tupman doze off, and the two decide to attend a charity ball being held that evening at the inn. As Jingle does not have the proper attire, Tupman takes clothes from the room of the sleeping Winkle for him to wear.\n\nAt the ball, Jingle incites the envy of one of the other guests, Dr. Slammer, by escorting a woman named Mrs. Budger to her carriage. The next morning, Slammer sends a message to the inn requesting a duel with \"the slim gentleman\" who had insulted him. The bewildered Winkle accepts the duel, believing he had inadvertently insulted someone while drunk the night before. The duel is about to commence when Slammer realizes that a mix-up has occurred. The two men return to the inn, whereupon Slammer recognizes Jingle as the man who had insulted him and again demands a duel. Pickwick, however, refuses to accept that Jingle has done anything wrong and sends Slammer on his way.<ref name=\"BFI synopsis\" />{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|pp=663\u2013664|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:The Shooting Party.jpg|thumb|Pickwick as he is wheeled to the town jail]]\n\"The Shooting Party\" begins with Pickwick and a group of friends\u2014including Winkle, Tupman, and Pickwick's servant Sam Weller\u2014setting out on a hunting expedition. As Pickwick is lame, he is carried in a wheelbarrow along the way by his servant. The party sits down for lunch on land belonging to an adjacent estate. Pickwick falls asleep, and the others continue with the expedition. The owner of the estate, Captain Boldwig, discovers Pickwick as he is making an inspection of his land and angrily sends Pickwick\u2014still asleep in his wheelbarrow\u2014off to the town jail, where his friends discover him that evening.{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|p=664|ps=none}}\n\n\"The Westgate Seminary\" opens with a conversation between Sam Weller and Mr. Jingle's servant, Job Trotter. Trotter falsely informs Weller that his master is planning to elope with a girl from the nearby Westgate boarding school for young ladies. Pickwick resolves to foil this elopement and scales the school walls that night with the goal of catching Jingle. Jingle does not arrive, however, and Pickwick is discovered by the frightened residents of the school, who lock him in a closet until the veracity of his story can be established.

Bunny, along with director [[Laurence Trimble]] and camera operator Arthur Ross, left for England on May 25, 1912. The principal goal of the trip was to film authentic scenes from Dickens's novel, with Bunny to select the actors for the other roles upon arrival in England.<ref>See {{cite magazine |title=John Bunny Sails for England |work=The Moving Picture World |volume=12 |issue=10 |date=June 8, 1912 |page=911 |url=https://archive.org/stream/movingpicturewor12newy#page/910/mode/2up |mode=cs2}}. 1912 was the centenary of Dickens's birth, and many screen adaptations of his works entered production that year. In all, at least twenty films based on Dickens's works were released in 1912 and 1913 {{harv|Pointer|1996|p=29}}.</ref> The group did not attempt to adapt ''The Pickwick Papers'' in its entirety\u2014only three episodes from the beginning of the book were filmed, with the idea of adapting the rest of the novel if the initial releases should prove popular.{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|p=663|ps=none}}\n\nBunny had floated the idea of filming scenes from the novel in England to Vitagraph executives around a year before production took place.{{sfn|Hoffman|1913|p=663|ps=none}} As he recounted in September 1912: \"The making of Pickwick has been one of my fondest dreams for several years. It has been my desire to produce in pictures the famous character of Pickwick amid the very scenes of which Dickens wrote, and I think when these pictures we have made are shown to the public it will be said that our work has not been in vain.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Hoffman|1912|p=1157}}</ref>\n\nBunny's popularity was at its peak at the time he traveled to England.{{sfn|Smith|1952|p=208|ps=none}} Regarding his time there, ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' reported: \"Whenever he appears upon the street in London he has to 'keep moving.' If he stops for any length of time he is in danger of arrest for blockading the sidewalk. He is so well-known by sight, through his appearances in the Vitagraph pictures, that everywhere he goes he is recognized and hailed with glee by the general run of mankind.\"<ref name=\"Bunny in England\" /> While filming was taking place, Bunny was offered a contract by an English producer with a salary that considerably exceeded the $200 a week he was making at Vitagraph. Bunny cabled news of the offer to Vitagraph, and was promptly offered a raise that he found satisfactory.{{sfn|Smith|1952|p=208|ps=none}}{{sfn|Dunham 1968\u201369|ps=, n.p.}}\n\nVitagraph was committed to producing an accurate and authentic adaptation of Dickens's novel.<ref name=\"Bunny Sails\" /> Bunny recounted to ''The Moving Picture World'' how the Vitagraph party attempted to borrow an original two-wheeled cab from the British Museum to use in the film, but were refused by the museum curators. The group apparently made an exact replica of this vehicle, and used it frequently in the film. According to Bunny, the four-wheeled coach used for the ride to Rochester in \"The Honorable Event\" was an original from the times of Pickwick. Bunny related that while filming in Rochester, large crowds gathered each day to watch the filming take place, and that nearly all of Rochester's police force was required to keep them at a proper distance.{{sfn|Hoffman|1912|p=1157|ps=none}}\n\nBesides ''The Pickwick Papers'', the Vitagraph party shot several one-reel films while abroad, including ''Bunny at Sea'', filmed on board ship to England; ''Bunny at the Derby'', filmed at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom Downs]]; ''Cork and Vicinity'', filmed in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]]; and ''The Blarney Stone'', filmed at [[Blarney Castle]].{{sfn|Hoffman|1912|p=1157|ps=none}}{{sfn|Gill|1972|pp=12\u201313|ps=none}} The group returned to the United States after three months abroad and incidental stops in Paris and Berlin.{{sfn|Hoffman|1912|p=1157|ps=none}}<ref name=\"Bunny Returns\" />\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"The Honourable Event\" and \"The Adventure of Westgate Seminary\" were released in the United States on February 28, 1913, and \"The Adventure of the Shooting Party\" was released on September 5, 1913.<ref>See {{harvnb|Gill|1972|pp=13\u201314}}. The third reel was released as a split reel along with ''The Baby Elephant'' {{harv|Slide|Gevinson|1987|p=235}}.</ref> The first two reels were released in the United Kingdom on June 9, 1913, and the third reel was released on December 18, 1913.{{sfn|Pointer|1996|p=123|ps=none}}\n\nDespite the effort Bunny and his associates invested in ''The Pickwick Papers'', contemporary audiences did not take to the film, instead preferring the one-reel comedies Bunny was used to producing for Vitagraph. As Bunny recalled in 1915: \"Listen, I went to England and put in some of the hardest work of my life in producing ''Mr. Pickwick''. I found every place that was unchanged, from Dingley Dell to the White Hart Tavern, and we worked it all out true to life. I'm proud of those pictures \u2013 but they haven't sold at all in comparison with these things I'm turning out every week.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Lanier|1915|p=577}}</ref> According to Vitagraph's co-founder [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert E. Smith]]: \"As Mr. Pickwick, Bunny won no new laurels, though we felt he deserved them. His followers would have no part of this sort of artistry; they preferred the old-line Bunny farce: the comic terror, the panic, the despair.\"{{sfn|Smith|1952|p=208|ps=none}}\n\nHugh Hoffman of ''The Moving Picture World'' praised the film for using the original locations Dickens had wrote of, finding that \"[t]he pictures are saturated with local color and in every instance they live up to the very letter of the word of Dickens\".

Initially a [[punk rock]] band, they are considered one of the pioneers of [[alternative rock]]. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist [[Paul Westerberg]], guitarist [[Bob Stinson]], bass guitarist [[Tommy Stinson]] and drummer [[Chris Mars]] for most of its career. Following several acclaimed albums, including ''[[Let It Be (The Replacements album)|Let It Be]]'' and ''[[Tim (The Replacements album)|Tim]]'', Bob Stinson was kicked out of the band in 1986, and [[Slim Dunlap]] joined as lead guitarist. [[Steve Foley (drummer)|Steve Foley]] replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over the creative output. The group disbanded in 1991, with the members eventually pursuing various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012.<ref name=\"reunion\">{{cite magazine|author=Greenwald, David|title=The Replacements Reuniting for Covers Set|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474799/the-replacements-reuniting-for-covers-set|date=October 3, 2012|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> The band is referred to by their nickname \"The 'Mats\" by fans, which originated as a truncation of \"The Placemats,\" a mispronunciation of their name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/08/20/the-currents-guide-to-the-replacements|title=The Current's Guide to The Replacements|website=Thecurrent.org|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Replacements' music was influenced by [[Rock music|rock]] artists such as the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], [[Faces (band)|Faces]], [[Big Star]], [[Slade]], [[Badfinger]], [[Lou Reed]] and the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] as well as [[punk rock]] bands such as the [[The Ramones|Ramones]], the [[New York Dolls]], [[Dead Boys]] and [[the Clash]]. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played \"heart-on-the-sleeve\"<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=196}}</ref> rock songs that combined Westerberg's \"raw-throated adolescent howl\"<ref name=\"a202\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=202}}</ref> with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act, often performing under the influence of alcohol and playing fragments of covers instead of their own material.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (1978\u20131980)===\nThe Replacements' history began in Minneapolis in 1978, when nineteen-year-old Bob Stinson gave his eleven-year-old brother Tommy Stinson a [[bass guitar]] to keep him off the streets.<ref name=\"a198-9\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=198\u20139}}</ref> That year Bob met Mars, a high school dropout. With Mars playing guitar and then switching to drums, the trio called themselves \"Dogbreath\" and began covering songs by [[Aerosmith]], [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]]<ref name=\"a198\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=198}}</ref> without a singer.<ref>Heibutzki, Ralph (October 29, 1993). \"Brats in Babylon\". ''Goldmine''.</ref> One day as Westerberg, a janitor in U.S. Senator [[David Durenberger]]'s office,<ref>Valania, Jonathan.

Mars knew Westerberg and invited him over to jam. Westerberg was unaware Mars drummed in Dogbreath.<ref name=\"a198\" />\n\nDogbreath auditioned several vocalists, including a hippie who read lyrics off a sheet.<ref>Ayers, Dave (December 1983). \"The Replacements: Getting No Place?\". ''Matter''.</ref> The band eventually found a vocalist, but Westerberg wanted to be the singer and took him aside one day to say, \"The band doesn't like you.\" The vocalist soon left and Westerberg replaced him.<ref name=\"a198\" /> Before Westerberg joined the band, Dogbreath often drank and took various drugs during rehearsals, playing songs as an afterthought.<ref name=\"a198-9\" /> In contrast to the rest of the band, the relatively disciplined Westerberg appeared at rehearsals in neat clothes and insisted on practicing songs until he was happy with them.<ref name=\"a199\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=199}}</ref>\n\n\"They didn't even know what punk was. They didn't like punk. Chris had hair down to his shoulders,\" Westerberg chortled to an interviewer.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Gumprecht |first=Blake |date=December 1983 |title=The Replacements: 'I Feel Lonely In A Crowd' |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/the-replacements-i-feel-lonely-in-a-crowd |magazine=Matter |location=Chicago |access-date=August 14, 2019 |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> But after the band members discovered first-generation English punk bands like the [[The Clash|Clash]], the [[The Jam|Jam]], the [[The Damned (band)|Damned]] and the [[The Buzzcocks|Buzzcocks]], Dogbreath changed its name to the Impediments and played a drunken performance without Tommy Stinson at a church hall gig in June 1980.<ref name=\"a200\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=200}}</ref> After being banned from the venue for disorderly behavior, they changed the name to the Replacements.<ref>{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5255|pure_url=yes}} | title=The Replacements: Biography | accessdate=February 3, 2008 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | website=Allmusic.com}}</ref> In an unpublished memoir, Mars later explained the band's choice of name: \"Like maybe the main act doesn't show, and instead the crowd has to settle for an earful of us dirtbags....It seemed to sit just right with us, accurately describing our collective 'secondary' social esteem\".<ref name=\"a199\" />\n\n===Demo tape and Twin/Tone Records (1980\u20131981)===\nThe band soon recorded a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=56}}</ref> and handed it to [[Peter Jesperson]] in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of [[Oar Folkjokeopus]], a [[punk rock]] record store in Minneapolis,<ref>\"Rock's Rudder Works at the Oar\". ''[[Minneapolis Star]]''. September 11, 1979.</ref> and had also founded [[Twin/Tone Records]] with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at [[Jay's Longhorn Bar]], a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey.<ref name=\"w61\">{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=61}}</ref> (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.)<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=11}}</ref> He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, \"Raised in the City\", played.<ref name=\"a199\" /> Jesperson played the song again and again. \"If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in\", said Jesperson. \"I didn't even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode\".<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\nJesperson called Westerberg the next day, asking, \"So do you want to do a single or an album?\"<ref name=\"a200\" /><ref name=\"w61\" /> With the agreement of Stark and the rest of the band, the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone Records in 1980.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thereplacements/biography | title=The Replacements: Biography | accessdate=February 4, 2008 | website=RollingStone.com}}</ref> Jesperson's support of the band was welcomed, and they asked him to be their manager after their second show. Later that summer they played at the Longhorn on a Wednesday \"New Band Night\". They also played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low hum of conversation, the band would hear Jesperson's loud whistle and fast clapping. \"His enthusiasm kept us going at times, definitely,\" Mars later said. \"His vision, his faith in the band was a binding force.\"<ref name=\"a200\" />\n\nAfter the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone, Westerberg began to write new songs and soon had a whole album's worth of material. Mere weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, time spent in the studio was intermittent, and it took about six months to record the album.<ref name=\"a201\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=201}}</ref> Although not important at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981. Because they were suspicious of the music business in general, the Replacements had not signed a written contract with Twin/Tone Records.<ref name=\"a202\"/>\n\n===Early releases (1981\u20131982)===\nWhen the band's first album, ''[[Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash]]'', was released in August 1981, it received positive reviews in local fanzines. ''Option''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Blake Gumprecht wrote, \"Westerberg has the ability to make you feel like you're right in the car with him, alongside him at the door, drinking from the same bottle.\"<ref name=\"a201\" /> The album contained the band's first single, \"[[I'm in Trouble]]\", Westerberg's \"first truly good song\".<ref name=\"a201\" /> ''Sorry Ma'' included the song, \"Somethin to D\u00fc\", a homage to another Minneapolis punk band, [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]].<ref>{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t806154|pure_url=yes}} | title=Somethin to D\u00fc | accessdate=February 3, 2008 | author=Mason, Stewart | website=Allmusic.com}}</ref> The Replacements had a friendly rivalry with the band, which started when Twin/Tone chose the Replacements over H\u00fcsker D\u00fc,<ref name=\"a205\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=205}}</ref> and H\u00fcsker D\u00fc landed an opening slot at a [[Johnny Thunders]] gig that the Replacements had wanted.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=204\u20135}}</ref> H\u00fcsker D\u00fc also influenced the band's music. The Replacements began playing faster and became more influenced by [[hardcore punk]]. Despite this, the band did not feel part of the hardcore scene. As Mars later stated, \"We were confused about what we were.\"<ref name=\"a205\" />\n\nSometime in late 1981, the Replacements played a song called \"Kids Don't Follow\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Jesperson was convinced the song sounded like a hit<ref name=\"a206\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=206}}</ref> and pleaded with the Twin/Tone co-owners Stark and Hallman, \"I will do anything to get this out. I will hand-stamp jackets if I have to.\"<ref name=\"w89\">{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=89}}</ref> The partners agreed to fund the recording, but Jesperson and virtually everyone he knew had to hand-stamp ten thousand white record jackets.<ref name=\"w89\" /> The band recorded eight tracks within a week, with Jesperson as producer. Their \"balls-to-the-wall hardcore punk attempt\",<ref name=\"a206\" /> their first EP ''[[Stink (album)|Stink]]'', containing \"Kids Don't Follow\" and seven other songs, was released in June 1982, six months after the Chicago show.<ref name=\"a206\" />\n\nThe Replacements began to distance themselves from the hardcore punk scene after the release of ''Stink''. \"We write songs rather than riffs with statements,\"<ref name=\"a208\" /> Westerberg later stated. Inspired by other rock subgenres, he had been writing songs that incorporated a wide range of musical styles. He even wrote an acoustic ballad, \"You're Getting Married One Night\", but when he played it to the rest of the band, it was met with silence. \"Save that for your solo album, Paul,\" Bob Stinson said. \"That ain't the Replacements\".<ref name=\"a208\" /> The track remained unreleased for years. Westerberg realized his toughest audience was the band itself, later saying, \"If it doesn't rock enough, Bob will scoff at it, and if it isn't catchy enough, Chris won't like it, and if it isn't modern enough, Tommy won't like it.\"<ref name=\"a208\" />\n\n===''Hootenanny'' and ''Let It Be'' (1983\u20131984)===\nWith a batch of new songs, the Replacements entered a warehouse in [[Roseville, Minnesota]], to record their next album, with Twin/Tone co-owner Stark engineering. Westerberg wrote songs in stops and starts, so it took several sessions of recording to finish the album. Stark's meticulous approach to recording contrasted with that of the Replacements, often frustrating the band. In one session, Mars and Westerberg switched instruments, and the band began to improvise, with Westerberg repeatedly shouting, \"It's a hootenanny.\" The band then declared it to be \"side one, track one\" of the new album.<ref name=\"a209\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=209}}</ref> According to Stark, the recording \"was a complete joke from their point of view\u2014they did not care what they delivered\".<ref name=\"a209\" />\n\n''[[Hootenanny (The Replacements album)|Hootenanny]]'', the band's second studio album, was released in April 1983. ''Hootenanny'' saw Westerberg expand his songwriting capabilities, In songs such as \"Willpower\", with echoed vocals and a sparse arrangement, and \"Within Your Reach\", which features Westerberg on all instruments, he revealed a more sensitive side.<ref name=\"a209\" /> It was a more mature album than ''Stink'' and ''Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash''. ''Hootenanny'' was played on over two hundred radio stations across the country, with critics acclaiming the album. [[Robert Christgau]], writing in the ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'', deemed it \"the most critically independent album of 1983\".<ref name=\"a210\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=210}}</ref>\n\nBy ''Hootenanny''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, the Replacements had begun to attract a following outside of Minneapolis. The band embarked on its first tour of the United States in April 1983, joined by Bill Sullivan, a young security guard, as roadie, who approached the band after a show at the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=207}}</ref> Tommy Stinson dropped out of the tenth grade to join the rest of the band on tour. The Replacements toured venues on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], including a tense gig at [[City Gardens]], in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], where numerous punks lined the edge of the stage as the band played.<ref name=\"a208\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=208}}</ref> The band performed in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Philadelphia]], but its intended destination was [[New York City]], where they played at [[Gerde's Folk City]]; they also performed at [[Maxwell's]], in Hoboken, New Jersey.<ref name=\"a216\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=216}}</ref>\n\nThe Replacements returned to New York in June 1983, playing at [[CBGB]]. The gig was a failure; the band were almost refused entry, Bob Stinson was thrown out as soon as he walked in the door, and the Replacements were the last of five bands, which meant they played in the early morning on a Monday night. The show at Folk City was not a success, because \"The Replacements were so loud and obnoxious that the people just cleared right out,\" according to manager Jesperson.<ref name=\"a216\" /> The band supported [[R.E.M.]] on an eight-date tour later that summer, deciding that they should alienate the audience as much as possible. It was not a successful tour; by the end, various members had threatened to leave the Replacements. Band morale was low, and Westerberg later stated, \"We'd much rather play for fifty people who know us than a thousand who don't care.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=218}}</ref>\n\nFor the recording of their next studio album, the Replacements decided to return to Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983. The band considered R.E.M.'s guitarist [[Peter Buck]] as producer, but when they met him in [[Athens, Georgia]], they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album.<ref>Gray, Marcus (1997). ''It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. Companion'' (2nd ed.).

In mid-January 1986 the Replacements received a last-minute request to appear as the musical guests on the edition of January 18 of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', replacing the scheduled act, the [[The Pointer Sisters|Pointer Sisters]], who had been forced to cancel only days before the show. The invitation was partly thanks to the show's musical director of the time, [[G.E. Smith]], who was a Replacements fan but, as a result of their shambolic and profanity-laced performance during the late-night live broadcast, SNL producer [[Lorne Michaels]] banned them from ever returning to the show (although Westerberg returned as a solo artist in 1993.) They performed \"Kiss Me on the Bus\" while completely intoxicated, and after playing an out-of-tune \"Bastards of Young\" (during which Westerberg audibly called out \"Come on fucker\" just off-mic) they returned to stage wearing mismatched iterations of each other's clothing. In a 2015 interview recorded for the [[Archive of American Television]], G.&nbsp;E. Smith recalled that although the band had performed well for the early evening pre-taped dress rehearsal performance, one of the band's crew then smuggled alcohol into their dressing room and they spent the next few hours drinking (with the guest host, [[Harry Dean Stanton]]) and taking drugs. According to Smith, by the time of the late-night live broadcast they were so intoxicated that on their way to the stage to perform, Bob Stinson tripped in the corridor, fell over onto his guitar and broke it, and Smith had to hurriedly loan him one of the SNL house band's spare instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/ge-smith|title=G.E. Smith|date=October 23, 2017|website=Television Academy Interviews}}</ref> The tour ended abruptly in June 1986 because Westerberg injured his finger during a show at [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York City.\n\nIn August 1986, the Replacements either fired Bob Stinson from the band which he had founded, or he chose to leave, or a little of both.  In either case, it was due to creative and personal differences between Stinson and the remainder of the band, aggravated by Stinson's alcohol and drug abuse issues. They also fired Jesperson the same year. \"It was like being thrown out of a club that you helped start,\" Jesperson later commented. \"Everybody was drinking and doing more drugs than they needed to.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=228}}</ref>\n\nBob Stinson preferred the louder, faster style of the band's early music, while Westerberg was exploring new territory in ballads like \"Here Comes a Regular\" and \"Swingin' Party\". The remaining Replacements carried on as a trio for ''[[Pleased to Meet Me]]'' (1987), recorded in Memphis with [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]] producer [[Jim Dickinson]]. Minneapolis guitarist [[Slim Dunlap]] took over on lead guitar for the subsequent tour and soon became a full member of the band.\n\n===''Don't Tell a Soul'' and ''All Shook Down'' (1989\u20131990)===\nThe band's next album, ''[[Don't Tell a Soul]]'', was a quieter, less punky affair, largely considered an attempt at mainstream success. While the move cost the Replacements the appreciation of some hardcore fans, the album had some notable songs, such as \"Achin' to Be\" and \"[[I'll Be You]]\", which topped the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock chart. The band then made a second appearance on network television, on the short-lived ABC program ''[[International Rock Awards]]'', for which they performed a typically energetic version of \"Talent Show\" and caused a minor controversy when Westerberg responded to the network's censoring of the \"feeling good from the pills we took\" line by inserting an uncensored \"It's too late to take pills, here we go\" at the end of the song. The band appeared on the cover of ''Musician'' magazine in February 1989, in which it was described as \u201cthe last, best band of the 80s\u201d.<ref name=\"Musician\">{{cite news|url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/paul-westerberg-on-how-to-write-an-ending/|title=The Last Best Band of the 80s|work=Musician|date=February 1989}}</ref>\n\nBut there was trouble within the band following a disastrous tour opening for [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. Westerberg recorded a new album largely with session musicians but was persuaded to release it as a Replacements album. ''[[All Shook Down]]'' won critical praise and more mainstream attention, though the many guest players and Mars's quick departure from the band following the album's release led many to wonder about the band's future. They also received a nomination for a [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]].\n\n===Breakup (1991\u20132011)===\nSteve Foley was recruited as Mars's replacement in 1990, and the band toured with [[Elvis Costello]] in June 1991, the final show being at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The band then embarked on a long farewell tour, which lasted into the summer of 1991. On July 4, 1991, the band played their last show for 22 years, with the Chicago power-pop trio [[Material Issue]] at [[Taste of Chicago]] in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], referred to by fans as \"It Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Roadie Plays\", because each member disappeared during the set, their respective roadies taking their places. This show was broadcast live by the Chicago radio station [[WXRT]]. Several bootlegs are available on the [[Internet]].\n\nBob Stinson, after leaving the Replacements in 1986, played in local Minneapolis bands such as [[Static Taxi]] and the Bleeding Hearts. After several years of drug and alcohol abuse, he died in 1995, at the age of 35.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB5DEC2C70BF9E9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Replacements' 'Lunatic Guitarist,' Bob Stinson, Dies|last=Walsh|first=Jim|date=February 20, 1995|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HIasFLkTWIQC&pg=PT243&lpg=PT243&dq=%22who+gained+national+notoriety+as+the+madman+guitarist+for%22#v=onepage&q=%22who%20gained%20national%20notoriety%20as%20the%20madman%20guitarist%20for%22&f=false|title=The Replacements: All Over but the Shouting: An Oral History|last=Walsh|first=Jim|date=November 30, 2009|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-3494-2|page=240}}</ref> Tommy Stinson quickly followed his time in the Replacements with the short-lived bands [[Bash & Pop]] and [[Perfect (American band)|Perfect]].

In 2004, he released a solo CD, ''[[Village Gorilla Head]]'', followed in 2011 by ''One Man Mutiny''.\n\nWesterberg is a successful singer-songwriter signed to [[Vagrant Records]] and, under his alias Grandpaboy, to [[Fat Possum Records]]. His album ''Folker'' was released in September 2004, marking a return to the melodic low-fi of the Replacements. Dunlap kept a low national profile but remained active in the Twin Cities music scene until a suffering a massive stroke in 2012, which left him without the ability to move or eat.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Replacements\u2019 Slim Dunlap loses speech after stroke|url=https://blog.seattlepi.com/people/2015/03/25/the-replacements-slim-dunlap-loses-speech-after-stroke/|website=Celebrities and Entertainment News|accessdate=February 28, 2018|date=March 25, 2015}}</ref> Mars primarily works as a visual artist.\n\nIn 1997, [[Reprise Records]] released the two CD set ''[[All for Nothing / Nothing for All]]''.

He said, \"We'll get together again one day. It will take a while, or it might take a few legal swipes of the pen, but we ain't over.\" A partial reunion nearly occurred in March 2002, when Tommy Stinson planned to join Westerberg on a tour of the Midwest, but Stinson's prior commitments with Guns n' Roses prevented it from happening.<ref name=\"rsreunion\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thereplacements/articles/story/5934315/replacements_mull_reunion | title=Replacements Mull Reunion | accessdate=February 4, 2008 | author=Devenish, Colin | magazine=RollingStone.com | date=March 29, 2002}}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2006, [[Rhino Records]] released the compilation album ''[[Don't You Know Who I Think I Was?]]'', consisting of songs from the Twin/Tone and Sire-Reprise years and including two new songs, \"Pool & Dive\" and \"Message to the Boys\".

Early shows were consistently tight and became more aggressive following the release of the ''Stink'' EP in 1982. As their stylistic repertoire began to expand with the writing and recording of ''Hootenanny'' the following year, the band's increasingly antagonistic stage show left them with a reputation for their rowdy, often drunken live shows. The band frequently went on stage too intoxicated to play. They were famously banned permanently from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' after performing drunk before a national television audience on January 18, 1986. As one reviewer succinctly observed, the band could quite often be \"mouthing profanities into the camera, stumbling into each other, falling down, dropping their instruments, and generally behaving like the apathetic drunks they were.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Noel |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/inventory-ten-memorable-saturday-night-live-musica,1525/ |title=Inventory: Ten Memorable Saturday Night Live Musical Moments &#124; TV &#124; Inventory |work=The A.V.

Part of the mystique of The Replacements was the fact that the audience never knew until the start of a concert if the band would be sober enough to play.

music|rock]] band formed in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] in 1979. Initially a [[punk rock]] band, they are considered one of the pioneers of [[alternative rock]]. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist [[Paul Westerberg]], guitarist [[Bob Stinson]], bass guitarist [[Tommy Stinson]] and drummer [[Chris Mars]] for most of its career. Following several acclaimed albums, including ''[[Let It Be (The Replacements album)|Let It Be]]'' and ''[[Tim (The Replacements album)|Tim]]'', Bob Stinson was kicked out of the band in 1986, and [[Slim Dunlap]] joined as lead guitarist. [[Steve Foley (drummer)|Steve Foley]] replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over the creative output. The group disbanded in 1991, with the members eventually pursuing various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012.<ref name=\"reunion\">{{cite magazine|author=Greenwald, David|title=The Replacements Reuniting for Covers Set|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474799/the-replacements-reuniting-for-covers-set|date=October 3, 2012|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> The band is referred to by their nickname \"The 'Mats\" by fans, which originated as a truncation of \"The Placemats,\" a mispronunciation of their name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/08/20/the-currents-guide-to-the-replacements|title=The Current's Guide to The Replacements|website=Thecurrent.org|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Replacements' music was influenced by [[Rock music|rock]] artists such as the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], [[Faces (band)|Faces]], [[Big Star]], [[Slade]], [[Badfinger]], [[Lou Reed]] and the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] as well as [[punk rock]] bands such as the [[The Ramones|Ramones]], the [[New York Dolls]], [[Dead Boys]] and [[the Clash]]. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played \"heart-on-the-sleeve\"<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=196}}</ref> rock songs that combined Westerberg's \"raw-throated adolescent howl\"<ref name=\"a202\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=202}}</ref> with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act, often performing under the influence of alcohol and playing fragments of covers instead of their own material.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (1978\u20131980)===\nThe Replacements' history began in Minneapolis in 1978, when nineteen-year-old Bob Stinson gave his eleven-year-old brother Tommy Stinson a [[bass guitar]] to keep him off the streets.<ref name=\"a198-9\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=198\u20139}}</ref> That year Bob met Mars, a high school dropout. With Mars playing guitar and then switching to drums, the trio called themselves \"Dogbreath\" and began covering songs by [[Aerosmith]], [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]]<ref name=\"a198\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=198}}</ref> without a singer.<ref>Heibutzki, Ralph (October 29, 1993). \"Brats in Babylon\".

Mars knew Westerberg and invited him over to jam. Westerberg was unaware Mars drummed in Dogbreath.<ref name=\"a198\" />\n\nDogbreath auditioned several vocalists, including a hippie who read lyrics off a sheet.<ref>Ayers, Dave (December 1983). \"The Replacements: Getting No Place?\". ''Matter''.</ref> The band eventually found a vocalist, but Westerberg wanted to be the singer and took him aside one day to say, \"The band doesn't like you.\" The vocalist soon left and Westerberg replaced him.<ref name=\"a198\" /> Before Westerberg joined the band, Dogbreath often drank and took various drugs during rehearsals, playing songs as an afterthought.<ref name=\"a198-9\" /> In contrast to the rest of the band, the relatively disciplined Westerberg appeared at rehearsals in neat clothes and insisted on practicing songs until he was happy with them.<ref name=\"a199\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=199}}</ref>\n\n\"They didn't even know what punk was. They didn't like punk. Chris had hair down to his shoulders,\" Westerberg chortled to an interviewer.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Gumprecht |first=Blake |date=December 1983 |title=The Replacements: 'I Feel Lonely In A Crowd' |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/the-replacements-i-feel-lonely-in-a-crowd |magazine=Matter |location=Chicago |access-date=August 14, 2019 |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> But after the band members discovered first-generation English punk bands like the [[The Clash|Clash]], the [[The Jam|Jam]], the [[The Damned (band)|Damned]] and the [[The Buzzcocks|Buzzcocks]], Dogbreath changed its name to the Impediments and played a drunken performance without Tommy Stinson at a church hall gig in June 1980.<ref name=\"a200\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=200}}</ref> After being banned from the venue for disorderly behavior, they changed the name to the Replacements.<ref>{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5255|pure_url=yes}} | title=The Replacements: Biography | accessdate=February 3, 2008 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | website=Allmusic.com}}</ref> In an unpublished memoir, Mars later explained the band's choice of name: \"Like maybe the main act doesn't show, and instead the crowd has to settle for an earful of us dirtbags....It seemed to sit just right with us, accurately describing our collective 'secondary' social esteem\".<ref name=\"a199\" />\n\n===Demo tape and Twin/Tone Records (1980\u20131981)===\nThe band soon recorded a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=56}}</ref> and handed it to [[Peter Jesperson]] in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of [[Oar Folkjokeopus]], a [[punk rock]] record store in Minneapolis,<ref>\"Rock's Rudder Works at the Oar\". ''[[Minneapolis Star]]''. September 11, 1979.</ref> and had also founded [[Twin/Tone Records]] with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at [[Jay's Longhorn Bar]], a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey.<ref name=\"w61\">{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=61}}</ref> (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.)<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=11}}</ref> He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, \"Raised in the City\", played.<ref name=\"a199\" /> Jesperson played the song again and again. \"If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in\", said Jesperson. \"I didn't even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode\".<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\nJesperson called Westerberg the next day, asking, \"So do you want to do a single or an album?\"<ref name=\"a200\" /><ref name=\"w61\" /> With the agreement of Stark and the rest of the band, the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone Records in 1980.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thereplacements/biography | title=The Replacements: Biography | accessdate=February 4, 2008 | website=RollingStone.com}}</ref> Jesperson's support of the band was welcomed, and they asked him to be their manager after their second show. Later that summer they played at the Longhorn on a Wednesday \"New Band Night\". They also played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low hum of conversation, the band would hear Jesperson's loud whistle and fast clapping. \"His enthusiasm kept us going at times, definitely,\" Mars later said. \"His vision, his faith in the band was a binding force.\"<ref name=\"a200\" />\n\nAfter the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone, Westerberg began to write new songs and soon had a whole album's worth of material. Mere weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, time spent in the studio was intermittent, and it took about six months to record the album.<ref name=\"a201\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=201}}</ref> Although not important at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981. Because they were suspicious of the music business in general, the Replacements had not signed a written contract with Twin/Tone Records.<ref name=\"a202\"/>\n\n===Early releases (1981\u20131982)===\nWhen the band's first album, ''[[Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash]]'', was released in August 1981, it received positive reviews in local fanzines. ''Option''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Blake Gumprecht wrote, \"Westerberg has the ability to make you feel like you're right in the car with him, alongside him at the door, drinking from the same bottle.\"<ref name=\"a201\" /> The album contained the band's first single, \"[[I'm in Trouble]]\", Westerberg's \"first truly good song\".<ref name=\"a201\" /> ''Sorry Ma'' included the song, \"Somethin to D\u00fc\", a homage to another Minneapolis punk band, [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]].<ref>{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t806154|pure_url=yes}} | title=Somethin to D\u00fc | accessdate=February 3, 2008 | author=Mason, Stewart | website=Allmusic.com}}</ref> The Replacements had a friendly rivalry with the band, which started when Twin/Tone chose the Replacements over H\u00fcsker D\u00fc,<ref name=\"a205\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=205}}</ref> and H\u00fcsker D\u00fc landed an opening slot at a [[Johnny Thunders]] gig that the Replacements had wanted.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=204\u20135}}</ref> H\u00fcsker D\u00fc also influenced the band's music. The Replacements began playing faster and became more influenced by [[hardcore punk]]. Despite this, the band did not feel part of the hardcore scene. As Mars later stated, \"We were confused about what we were.\"<ref name=\"a205\" />\n\nSometime in late 1981, the Replacements played a song called \"Kids Don't Follow\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Jesperson was convinced the song sounded like a hit<ref name=\"a206\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=206}}</ref> and pleaded with the Twin/Tone co-owners Stark and Hallman, \"I will do anything to get this out. I will hand-stamp jackets if I have to.\"<ref name=\"w89\">{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=89}}</ref> The partners agreed to fund the recording, but Jesperson and virtually everyone he knew had to hand-stamp ten thousand white record jackets.<ref name=\"w89\" /> The band recorded eight tracks within a week, with Jesperson as producer. Their \"balls-to-the-wall hardcore punk attempt\",<ref name=\"a206\" /> their first EP ''[[Stink (album)|Stink]]'', containing \"Kids Don't Follow\" and seven other songs, was released in June 1982, six months after the Chicago show.<ref name=\"a206\" />\n\nThe Replacements began to distance themselves from the hardcore punk scene after the release of ''Stink''. \"We write songs rather than riffs with statements,\"<ref name=\"a208\" /> Westerberg later stated. Inspired by other rock subgenres, he had been writing songs that incorporated a wide range of musical styles. He even wrote an acoustic ballad, \"You're Getting Married One Night\", but when he played it to the rest of the band, it was met with silence. \"Save that for your solo album, Paul,\" Bob Stinson said. \"That ain't the Replacements\".<ref name=\"a208\" /> The track remained unreleased for years. Westerberg realized his toughest audience was the band itself, later saying, \"If it doesn't rock enough, Bob will scoff at it, and if it isn't catchy enough, Chris won't like it, and if it isn't modern enough, Tommy won't like it.\"<ref name=\"a208\" />\n\n===''Hootenanny'' and ''Let It Be'' (1983\u20131984)===\nWith a batch of new songs, the Replacements entered a warehouse in [[Roseville, Minnesota]], to record their next album, with Twin/Tone co-owner Stark engineering. Westerberg wrote songs in stops and starts, so it took several sessions of recording to finish the album. Stark's meticulous approach to recording contrasted with that of the Replacements, often frustrating the band. In one session, Mars and Westerberg switched instruments, and the band began to improvise, with Westerberg repeatedly shouting, \"It's a hootenanny.\" The band then declared it to be \"side one, track one\" of the new album.<ref name=\"a209\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=209}}</ref> According to Stark, the recording \"was a complete joke from their point of view\u2014they did not care what they delivered\".<ref name=\"a209\" />\n\n''[[Hootenanny (The Replacements album)|Hootenanny]]'', the band's second studio album, was released in April 1983. ''Hootenanny'' saw Westerberg expand his songwriting capabilities, In songs such as \"Willpower\", with echoed vocals and a sparse arrangement, and \"Within Your Reach\", which features Westerberg on all instruments, he revealed a more sensitive side.<ref name=\"a209\" /> It was a more mature album than ''Stink'' and ''Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash''. ''Hootenanny'' was played on over two hundred radio stations across the country, with critics acclaiming the album. [[Robert Christgau]], writing in the ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'', deemed it \"the most critically independent album of 1983\".<ref name=\"a210\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=210}}</ref>\n\nBy ''Hootenanny''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, the Replacements had begun to attract a following outside of Minneapolis. The band embarked on its first tour of the United States in April 1983, joined by Bill Sullivan, a young security guard, as roadie, who approached the band after a show at the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=207}}</ref> Tommy Stinson dropped out of the tenth grade to join the rest of the band on tour. The Replacements toured venues on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], including a tense gig at [[City Gardens]], in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], where numerous punks lined the edge of the stage as the band played.<ref name=\"a208\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=208}}</ref> The band performed in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Philadelphia]], but its intended destination was [[New York City]], where they played at [[Gerde's Folk City]]; they also performed at [[Maxwell's]], in Hoboken, New Jersey.<ref name=\"a216\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=216}}</ref>\n\nThe Replacements returned to New York in June 1983, playing at [[CBGB]]. The gig was a failure; the band were almost refused entry, Bob Stinson was thrown out as soon as he walked in the door, and the Replacements were the last of five bands, which meant they played in the early morning on a Monday night. The show at Folk City was not a success, because \"The Replacements were so loud and obnoxious that the people just cleared right out,\" according to manager Jesperson.<ref name=\"a216\" /> The band supported [[R.E.M.]] on an eight-date tour later that summer, deciding that they should alienate the audience as much as possible. It was not a successful tour; by the end, various members had threatened to leave the Replacements. Band morale was low, and Westerberg later stated, \"We'd much rather play for fifty people who know us than a thousand who don't care.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=218}}</ref>\n\nFor the recording of their next studio album, the Replacements decided to return to Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983. The band considered R.E.M.'s guitarist [[Peter Buck]] as producer, but when they met him in [[Athens, Georgia]], they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album.<ref>Gray, Marcus (1997). ''It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. Companion'' (2nd ed.). Da Capo. {{ISBN|0-306-80751-3}}, p. 356\u2013357</ref> By this time, the Replacements had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively; Westerberg stated, \"Now we're softening a little where we can do something that's a little more sincere without being afraid that someone's not going to like it or the punks aren't going to be able to dance to it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=221}}</ref>\n\nThe new material placed more of a focus on songwriting, and the music was influenced by [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[arena rock]] and [[Chicago blues]].

In mid-January 1986 the Replacements received a last-minute request to appear as the musical guests on the edition of January 18 of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', replacing the scheduled act, the [[The Pointer Sisters|Pointer Sisters]], who had been forced to cancel only days before the show. The invitation was partly thanks to the show's musical director of the time, [[G.E. Smith]], who was a Replacements fan but, as a result of their shambolic and profanity-laced performance during the late-night live broadcast, SNL producer [[Lorne Michaels]] banned them from ever returning to the show (although Westerberg returned as a solo artist in 1993.) They performed \"Kiss Me on the Bus\" while completely intoxicated, and after playing an out-of-tune \"Bastards of Young\" (during which Westerberg audibly called out \"Come on fucker\" just off-mic) they returned to stage wearing mismatched iterations of each other's clothing. In a 2015 interview recorded for the [[Archive of American Television]], G.&nbsp;E. Smith recalled that although the band had performed well for the early evening pre-taped dress rehearsal performance, one of the band's crew then smuggled alcohol into their dressing room and they spent the next few hours drinking (with the guest host, [[Harry Dean Stanton]]) and taking drugs. According to Smith, by the time of the late-night live broadcast they were so intoxicated that on their way to the stage to perform, Bob Stinson tripped in the corridor, fell over onto his guitar and broke it, and Smith had to hurriedly loan him one of the SNL house band's spare instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/ge-smith|title=G.E. Smith|date=October 23, 2017|website=Television Academy Interviews}}</ref> The tour ended abruptly in June 1986 because Westerberg injured his finger during a show at [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York City.\n\nIn August 1986, the Replacements either fired Bob Stinson from the band which he had founded, or he chose to leave, or a little of both.  In either case, it was due to creative and personal differences between Stinson and the remainder of the band, aggravated by Stinson's alcohol and drug abuse issues. They also fired Jesperson the same year. \"It was like being thrown out of a club that you helped start,\" Jesperson later commented. \"Everybody was drinking and doing more drugs than they needed to.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=228}}</ref>\n\nBob Stinson preferred the louder, faster style of the band's early music, while Westerberg was exploring new territory in ballads like \"Here Comes a Regular\" and \"Swingin' Party\". The remaining Replacements carried on as a trio for ''[[Pleased to Meet Me]]'' (1987), recorded in Memphis with [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]] producer [[Jim Dickinson]]. Minneapolis guitarist [[Slim Dunlap]] took over on lead guitar for the subsequent tour and soon became a full member of the band.\n\n===''Don't Tell a Soul'' and ''All Shook Down'' (1989\u20131990)===\nThe band's next album, ''[[Don't Tell a Soul]]'', was a quieter, less punky affair, largely considered an attempt at mainstream success. While the move cost the Replacements the appreciation of some hardcore fans, the album had some notable songs, such as \"Achin' to Be\" and \"[[I'll Be You]]\", which topped the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock chart. The band then made a second appearance on network television, on the short-lived ABC program ''[[International Rock Awards]]'', for which they performed a typically energetic version of \"Talent Show\" and caused a minor controversy when Westerberg responded to the network's censoring of the \"feeling good from the pills we took\" line by inserting an uncensored \"It's too late to take pills, here we go\" at the end of the song. The band appeared on the cover of ''Musician'' magazine in February 1989, in which it was described as \u201cthe last, best band of the 80s\u201d.<ref name=\"Musician\">{{cite news|url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/paul-westerberg-on-how-to-write-an-ending/|title=The Last Best Band of the 80s|work=Musician|date=February 1989}}</ref>\n\nBut there was trouble within the band following a disastrous tour opening for [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. Westerberg recorded a new album largely with session musicians but was persuaded to release it as a Replacements album. ''[[All Shook Down]]'' won critical praise and more mainstream attention, though the many guest players and Mars's quick departure from the band following the album's release led many to wonder about the band's future. They also received a nomination for a [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]].\n\n===Breakup (1991\u20132011)===\nSteve Foley was recruited as Mars's replacement in 1990, and the band toured with [[Elvis Costello]] in June 1991, the final show being at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The band then embarked on a long farewell tour, which lasted into the summer of 1991. On July 4, 1991, the band played their last show for 22 years, with the Chicago power-pop trio [[Material Issue]] at [[Taste of Chicago]] in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], referred to by fans as \"It Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Roadie Plays\", because each member disappeared during the set, their respective roadies taking their places. This show was broadcast live by the Chicago radio station [[WXRT]]. Several bootlegs are available on the [[Internet]].\n\nBob Stinson, after leaving the Replacements in 1986, played in local Minneapolis bands such as [[Static Taxi]] and the Bleeding Hearts. After several years of drug and alcohol abuse, he died in 1995, at the age of 35.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB5DEC2C70BF9E9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Replacements' 'Lunatic Guitarist,' Bob Stinson, Dies|last=Walsh|first=Jim|date=February 20, 1995|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HIasFLkTWIQC&pg=PT243&lpg=PT243&dq=%22who+gained+national+notoriety+as+the+madman+guitarist+for%22#v=onepage&q=%22who%20gained%20national%20notoriety%20as%20the%20madman%20guitarist%20for%22&f=false|title=The Replacements: All Over but the Shouting: An Oral History|last=Walsh|first=Jim|date=November 30, 2009|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-3494-2|page=240}}</ref> Tommy Stinson quickly followed his time in the Replacements with the short-lived bands [[Bash & Pop]] and [[Perfect (American band)|Perfect]].

In 2004, he released a solo CD, ''[[Village Gorilla Head]]'', followed in 2011 by ''One Man Mutiny''.\n\nWesterberg is a successful singer-songwriter signed to [[Vagrant Records]] and, under his alias Grandpaboy, to [[Fat Possum Records]]. His album ''Folker'' was released in September 2004, marking a return to the melodic low-fi of the Replacements. Dunlap kept a low national profile but remained active in the Twin Cities music scene until a suffering a massive stroke in 2012, which left him without the ability to move or eat.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Replacements\u2019 Slim Dunlap loses speech after stroke|url=https://blog.seattlepi.com/people/2015/03/25/the-replacements-slim-dunlap-loses-speech-after-stroke/|website=Celebrities and Entertainment News|accessdate=February 28, 2018|date=March 25, 2015}}</ref> Mars primarily works as a visual artist.\n\nIn 1997, [[Reprise Records]] released the two CD set ''[[All for Nothing / Nothing for All]]''.

He said, \"We'll get together again one day. It will take a while, or it might take a few legal swipes of the pen, but we ain't over.\" A partial reunion nearly occurred in March 2002, when Tommy Stinson planned to join Westerberg on a tour of the Midwest, but Stinson's prior commitments with Guns n' Roses prevented it from happening.<ref name=\"rsreunion\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thereplacements/articles/story/5934315/replacements_mull_reunion | title=Replacements Mull Reunion | accessdate=February 4, 2008 | author=Devenish, Colin | magazine=RollingStone.com | date=March 29, 2002}}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2006, [[Rhino Records]] released the compilation album ''[[Don't You Know Who I Think I Was?]]'', consisting of songs from the Twin/Tone and Sire-Reprise years and including two new songs, \"Pool & Dive\" and \"Message to the Boys\".

Early shows were consistently tight and became more aggressive following the release of the ''Stink'' EP in 1982. As their stylistic repertoire began to expand with the writing and recording of ''Hootenanny'' the following year, the band's increasingly antagonistic stage show left them with a reputation for their rowdy, often drunken live shows. The band frequently went on stage too intoxicated to play. They were famously banned permanently from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' after performing drunk before a national television audience on January 18, 1986. As one reviewer succinctly observed, the band could quite often be \"mouthing profanities into the camera, stumbling into each other, falling down, dropping their instruments, and generally behaving like the apathetic drunks they were.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Noel |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/inventory-ten-memorable-saturday-night-live-musica,1525/ |title=Inventory: Ten Memorable Saturday Night Live Musical Moments &#124; TV &#124; Inventory |work=The A.V.

Part of the mystique of The Replacements was the fact that the audience never knew until the start of a concert if the band would be sober enough to play.

It includes at least one species, '''''Troodon formosus''''', known from [[Montana]]. Discovered in October 1855, ''T. formosus'' was among the first dinosaurs found in [[North America]], although it was thought to be a [[lizard]] until 1877. Several well-known [[Troodontidae|troodontid]] specimens from the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] in [[Alberta]] were once believed to be members of this genus. However, recent analyses in 2017 have found the genus to be undiagnostic and referred some of these specimens to the genus ''[[Stenonychosaurus]]'' (long believed to be synonymous with ''Troodon'') and others to the newly created genus ''[[Latenivenatrix]]''.\n\nThe genus name is [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for \"wounding tooth\", referring to the teeth, which were different from those of most other [[theropod]]s known at the time of their discovery. The teeth bear prominent, apically oriented serrations. These \"wounding\" serrations, however, are [[morphometric]]ally more similar to those of herbivorous reptiles, and suggest a possibly omnivorous diet.<ref name=\"Holtzetal1998\">Holtz, Thomas R., Brinkman, Daniel L., Chandler, Chistine L.

''Troodon'' has historically been a highly unstable classification and has been the subject of numerous conflicting synonymies with similar theropod specimens.<ref name=Talos/>\n\nThe ''Troodon'' tooth was originally classified as a \"lacertilian\" ([[lizard]]) by Leidy, but reassigned as a [[megalosaurid]] dinosaur by Nopcsa in 1901 (Megalosauridae having historically been a [[wastebin taxon]] for most carnivorous dinosaurs). In 1924, Gilmore suggested that the tooth belonged to the herbivorous [[pachycephalosaur]] ''[[Stegoceras]]'', and that ''Stegoceras'' was in fact a junior synonym of ''Troodon'' (the similarity of troodontid teeth to those of herbivorous dinosaurs continues to lead many paleontologists to believe that these animals were omnivores). The classification of ''Troodon'' as a pachycephalosaur was followed for many years, during which the family [[Pachycephalosauridae]] was known as [[Troodontidae]]. In 1945, [[Charles Mortram Sternberg]] rejected the possibility that ''Troodon'' was a pachycephalosaur due to its stronger similarity to the teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs. With ''Troodon'' now classified as a theropod, the family Troodontidae could no longer be used for the dome-headed dinosaurs, so Sternberg named a new family for them, Pachycephalosauridae.<ref name=sternberg1945>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = C. | year = 1945 | title = Pachycephalosauridae proposed for domeheaded dinosaurs, ''Stegoceras lambei'' n. sp., described | url = | journal = Journal of Paleontology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 534\u2013538 }}</ref>\n\n===Naming of related species===\n[[File:Troodontid teeth.jpg|thumb|left|Comparison of [[troodontid]] teeth; A is the ''T. formosus'' holotype]] \nThe first specimens assigned to ''Troodon'' that were not teeth were both found by Sternberg in the early 1930s, in the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] of [[Alberta]]. The first was named ''[[Stenonychosaurus inequalis]]'' by Sternberg in 1932, based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some tail vertebrae. A remarkable feature of these remains was the enlarged claw on the second toe, which is now recognized as characteristic of early [[Paraves|paravians]]. Sternberg initially classified ''Stenonychosaurus'' as a member of the family [[Coeluridae]]. The second, a partial lower jaw bone, was described by Gilmore (1932) as a new species of lizard which he named ''[[Polyodontosaurus|Polyodontosaurus grandis]]''. Later, in 1951, Sternberg recognized ''P. grandis'' as a possible synonym of ''Troodon'', and speculated that since ''Stenonychosaurus'' had a \"very peculiar [[pes (zoology)|pes]]\" and ''Troodon'' \"equally unusual teeth\", they may be closely related.  Unfortunately, no comparable specimens were available at that time to test the idea. In a recent revision of the material by van der Reest & Currie, ''Polyodontosaurus'' was determined to be a nomen dubium, not fit for synonymy with other taxa.<ref name=LS2017/>\n\nA more complete skeleton of ''Stenonychosaurus'' was described by [[Dale Russell]] in 1969 from the Dinosaur Park Formation, which eventually formed the scientific foundation for a famous life-sized sculpture of ''Stenonychosaurus'' accompanied by its fictional, [[humanoid]] descendant, the \"dinosauroid\".<ref name=russell1982>{{Cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = D.

Along with ''[[Saurornithoides]]'', it formed the family [[Saurornithoididae]]. Based on differences in tooth structure, and the extremely fragmentary nature of the original ''Troodon formosus'' specimens, saurornithoidids were thought to be close relatives while ''Troodon'' was considered a dubious possible relative of the family. [[Phil Currie]], reviewing the pertinent specimens in 1987, showed that supposed differences in tooth and jaw structure among troodontids and saurornithoidids were based on age and position of the tooth in the jaw, rather than a difference in species. He reclassified ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'' as well as ''Polyodontosaurus grandis'' and ''[[Pectinodon bakkeri]]'' as junior synonyms of ''Troodon formosus''. Currie also made Saurornithoididae a junior synonym of Troodontidae.<ref name=currie1987>{{Cite journal | last1 = Currie | first1 = P. | year = 1987 | title = Theropods of the Judith River Formation | url = | journal = Occasional Paper of the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 52\u201360 }}</ref> In 1988, [[Gregory S.

Currie's classification of all North American troodontid material in the single species ''Troodon formosus'' became widely adopted by other [[paleontology|paleontologists]], and all of the specimens once called ''Stenonychosaurus'' were referred to as ''Troodon'' in the scientific literature through the early 21st century.\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Troodon teeth.jpg|thumb|Teeth from South Dakota assigned to ''T. formosus'', with a [[US dime]] coin for scale, [[Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]]]\n\n===Dissolution of the one species model===\nHowever, the concept that all Late Cretaceous North American troodontids belong to one species began to be questioned soon after Currie's 1987 paper was published, including by Currie himself. Currie and colleagues (1990) noted that, while they believed the Judith River troodontids were all ''T. formosus'', troodontid fossils from other formations, such as the [[Hell Creek Formation]] and [[Lance Formation]], might belong to different species. In 1991, George Olshevsky assigned the Lance formation fossils, which had first been named ''Pectinodon bakkeri'' but later synonymized with ''Troodon formosus'' to the species ''Troodon bakkeri'', and several other researchers (including Currie) have reverted to keeping the Dinosaur Park Formation fossils separate as ''Troodon inequalis'' (now ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'').<ref name=currie2005>Currie, P.

Indiana University Press, Bloomington. Pp 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Zanno and colleagues reviewed the convoluted history of troodontid classification in Late Cretaceous North America. They followed Longrich (2008) in treating ''Pectinodon bakkeri'' as a valid genus, and noted that it is likely the numerous Late Cretaceous specimens currently assigned to ''Troodon formosus'' almost certainly represent numerous new genera, but that a more thorough review  of the specimens is required. Because the holotype of ''T. formosus'' is a single tooth, this renders ''Troodon'' a ''[[nomen dubium]]''.<ref name=Talos/>\n\nIn 2017, Evans and colleagues further discussed the undiagnostic nature of the holotype of ''Troodon formosus'' and suggested that ''Stenonychosaurus'' be used for troodontid skeletal material from the Dinosaur Park Formation.<ref name=Alberavenator>{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=D.

It includes at least one species, '''''Troodon formosus''''', known from [[Montana]]. Discovered in October 1855, ''T. formosus'' was among the first dinosaurs found in [[North America]], although it was thought to be a [[lizard]] until 1877. Several well-known [[Troodontidae|troodontid]] specimens from the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] in [[Alberta]] were once believed to be members of this genus. However, recent analyses in 2017 have found the genus to be undiagnostic and referred some of these specimens to the genus ''[[Stenonychosaurus]]'' (long believed to be synonymous with ''Troodon'') and others to the newly created genus ''[[Latenivenatrix]]''.\n\nThe genus name is [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for \"wounding tooth\", referring to the teeth, which were different from those of most other [[theropod]]s known at the time of their discovery. The teeth bear prominent, apically oriented serrations. These \"wounding\" serrations, however, are [[morphometric]]ally more similar to those of herbivorous reptiles, and suggest a possibly omnivorous diet.<ref name=\"Holtzetal1998\">Holtz, Thomas R., Brinkman, Daniel L., Chandler, Chistine L.

''Troodon'' has historically been a highly unstable classification and has been the subject of numerous conflicting synonymies with similar theropod specimens.<ref name=Talos/>\n\nThe ''Troodon'' tooth was originally classified as a \"lacertilian\" ([[lizard]]) by Leidy, but reassigned as a [[megalosaurid]] dinosaur by Nopcsa in 1901 (Megalosauridae having historically been a [[wastebin taxon]] for most carnivorous dinosaurs). In 1924, Gilmore suggested that the tooth belonged to the herbivorous [[pachycephalosaur]] ''[[Stegoceras]]'', and that ''Stegoceras'' was in fact a junior synonym of ''Troodon'' (the similarity of troodontid teeth to those of herbivorous dinosaurs continues to lead many paleontologists to believe that these animals were omnivores). The classification of ''Troodon'' as a pachycephalosaur was followed for many years, during which the family [[Pachycephalosauridae]] was known as [[Troodontidae]]. In 1945, [[Charles Mortram Sternberg]] rejected the possibility that ''Troodon'' was a pachycephalosaur due to its stronger similarity to the teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs. With ''Troodon'' now classified as a theropod, the family Troodontidae could no longer be used for the dome-headed dinosaurs, so Sternberg named a new family for them, Pachycephalosauridae.<ref name=sternberg1945>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = C. | year = 1945 | title = Pachycephalosauridae proposed for domeheaded dinosaurs, ''Stegoceras lambei'' n. sp., described | url = | journal = Journal of Paleontology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 534\u2013538 }}</ref>\n\n===Naming of related species===\n[[File:Troodontid teeth.jpg|thumb|left|Comparison of [[troodontid]] teeth; A is the ''T. formosus'' holotype]] \nThe first specimens assigned to ''Troodon'' that were not teeth were both found by Sternberg in the early 1930s, in the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] of [[Alberta]]. The first was named ''[[Stenonychosaurus inequalis]]'' by Sternberg in 1932, based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some tail vertebrae. A remarkable feature of these remains was the enlarged claw on the second toe, which is now recognized as characteristic of early [[Paraves|paravians]]. Sternberg initially classified ''Stenonychosaurus'' as a member of the family [[Coeluridae]]. The second, a partial lower jaw bone, was described by Gilmore (1932) as a new species of lizard which he named ''[[Polyodontosaurus|Polyodontosaurus grandis]]''. Later, in 1951, Sternberg recognized ''P. grandis'' as a possible synonym of ''Troodon'', and speculated that since ''Stenonychosaurus'' had a \"very peculiar [[pes (zoology)|pes]]\" and ''Troodon'' \"equally unusual teeth\", they may be closely related.  Unfortunately, no comparable specimens were available at that time to test the idea. In a recent revision of the material by van der Reest & Currie, ''Polyodontosaurus'' was determined to be a nomen dubium, not fit for synonymy with other taxa.<ref name=LS2017/>\n\nA more complete skeleton of ''Stenonychosaurus'' was described by [[Dale Russell]] in 1969 from the Dinosaur Park Formation, which eventually formed the scientific foundation for a famous life-sized sculpture of ''Stenonychosaurus'' accompanied by its fictional, [[humanoid]] descendant, the \"dinosauroid\".<ref name=russell1982>{{Cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = D.

Along with ''[[Saurornithoides]]'', it formed the family [[Saurornithoididae]]. Based on differences in tooth structure, and the extremely fragmentary nature of the original ''Troodon formosus'' specimens, saurornithoidids were thought to be close relatives while ''Troodon'' was considered a dubious possible relative of the family. [[Phil Currie]], reviewing the pertinent specimens in 1987, showed that supposed differences in tooth and jaw structure among troodontids and saurornithoidids were based on age and position of the tooth in the jaw, rather than a difference in species. He reclassified ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'' as well as ''Polyodontosaurus grandis'' and ''[[Pectinodon bakkeri]]'' as junior synonyms of ''Troodon formosus''.

Currie's classification of all North American troodontid material in the single species ''Troodon formosus'' became widely adopted by other [[paleontology|paleontologists]], and all of the specimens once called ''Stenonychosaurus'' were referred to as ''Troodon'' in the scientific literature through the early 21st century.\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Troodon teeth.jpg|thumb|Teeth from South Dakota assigned to ''T. formosus'', with a [[US dime]] coin for scale, [[Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]]]\n\n===Dissolution of the one species model===\nHowever, the concept that all Late Cretaceous North American troodontids belong to one species began to be questioned soon after Currie's 1987 paper was published, including by Currie himself. Currie and colleagues (1990) noted that, while they believed the Judith River troodontids were all ''T. formosus'', troodontid fossils from other formations, such as the [[Hell Creek Formation]] and [[Lance Formation]], might belong to different species. In 1991, George Olshevsky assigned the Lance formation fossils, which had first been named ''Pectinodon bakkeri'' but later synonymized with ''Troodon formosus'' to the species ''Troodon bakkeri'', and several other researchers (including Currie) have reverted to keeping the Dinosaur Park Formation fossils separate as ''Troodon inequalis'' (now ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'').<ref name=currie2005>Currie, P.

They followed Longrich (2008) in treating ''Pectinodon bakkeri'' as a valid genus, and noted that it is likely the numerous Late Cretaceous specimens currently assigned to ''Troodon formosus'' almost certainly represent numerous new genera, but that a more thorough review  of the specimens is required. Because the holotype of ''T. formosus'' is a single tooth, this renders ''Troodon'' a ''[[nomen dubium]]''.<ref name=Talos/>\n\nIn 2017, Evans and colleagues further discussed the undiagnostic nature of the holotype of ''Troodon formosus'' and suggested that ''Stenonychosaurus'' be used for troodontid skeletal material from the Dinosaur Park Formation.<ref name=Alberavenator>{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=D.

She launders money for one of their most profitable pill mills, so she can save up and buy a better salon. She is in a relationship with Roller Husser, adopted son of his uncle, Uncle Daddy. When Uncle Daddy withholds some of her earnings, she blames Roller. She and Virginia, with whom he was cheating on Desna with, attempt to kill him. It is later revealed that Desna and her brother, Dean, spent their childhoods with abusive foster parents, explaining why she's so determined to build a life for herself. She eventually gets permission to leave the mob, but is subsequently forced to continue laundering money for the Russian Mafia. Desna ultimately sets out to build her own crime family after her brother kills the head of the Russian mob.\n* [[Carrie Preston]] as Polly Marks: a redheaded North Carolinian who helps manage Desna's criminal enterprises. A former professional con artist, pathological liar, and skilled burglar, she only recently made parole for running a [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] fraud scheme. Her relationship with Desna is one of absolute loyalty; she even threatens Virginia with a knife when she nearly implicates Desna in Roller's \"death\". She also forms a motherly bond with Marnie, an adolescent girl seeking to escape her own neglectful mother, who is trying to force Marnie into prostitution. Preston also portrays Lillian Marks, Polly's twin sister who pressures her to own up to her mistakes. \n* [[Judy Reyes]] as Annalise \"Quiet Ann\" Zayas: the salon's lookout, doorman, and Desna's enforcer. She is college-educated, with plans to become a teacher, but her career was ruined when she was convicted of attempting to murder her husband after he stabbed her girlfriend. Ann is openly bisexual and also into girls, but has difficulty balancing her relationships with her role in the mafia, especially when she falls for a female police detective investigating the salon with who she later breaks-up. Later at the end of season 3 she has sex with a handsome guy she encounters at the party.\n* [[Karrueche Tran]] as Virginia Loc: a former stripper for Uncle Daddy's strip club, She She's, but now works at Nail Artisans. Desna fires her and throws her out in disgust after finding out she is sleeping around with Roller and suspecting that Virginia was the one who told Roller about Polly's ankle bracelet. Eventually, Virginia is accepted when she shoots Roller to defend Desna and proves her willingness to master the manicurist's trade. Later, she becomes pregnant after having sex with Dean, but goes through with an abortion and says yes when he asks to marry her. A failed assassination attempt causes her to lose an eye; the transplant, taken from a practicing psychic, gives Virginia empathetic abilities. She now runs the salon on Desna's behalf.\n* [[Jenn Lyon]] as Jennifer Husser: Desna's oldest friend, right-hand woman, and Bryce's wife, with whom she has one daughter and another from a previous relationship. Having already lost more than a few relatives to the consequences of organized crime, she is adamant that Bryce not be part of his family's criminal business, but he does so nonetheless, causing a rift to form between her and Desna. When her family is absorbed by the Russians, she manages to keep her position at the salon thanks to Desna vouching on her behalf. However, an affair she has with a man named Hank threatens her marriage with Bryce, until they reconcile and she vows to be more faithful.\n* [[Jack Kesy]] as Dwayne \"Roller\" Husser: Uncle Daddy's nephew, boyfriend to Desna and a high-powered drug dealer whose supposed death in the first episode triggers conflict between the Hussers and Desna's salon. It is later revealed that he is alive, having been imprisoned by a woman as her sex slave. He escapes and rejoins his family, but when his dealings with the Russians are exposed, he and his brother and uncle are forced to work for them. He's in love with Desna even though he doesn't say it. He has sex with Desna and gets back together with her, even after she tried to kill him. He tries to shoot Desna but couldn't do it because she tells him she loves him. Eventually, he finds himself helping Desna establish her criminal empire.\n* [[Kevin Rankin (actor)|Kevin Rankin]] as Bryce Husser: Jennifer's husband and Roller's brother, who joins the Dixie Mafia to get justice for Roller's death and takes over his narcotics racket, though he is struggling to control his own addiction. When Roller unexpectedly returns, the two clash over his success. Bryce is subsequently forced to relinquish control of his business to the Russians when they absorb the Husser family, and is later shot while taking part in an attack on his boss, Zlata. He and Jenn fix their relationship and try to leave the mob life behind, but return once they realize that they can't.\n* [[Jason Antoon]] as Ken Brickman: a shady medical doctor who runs one of the Husser family's pill mills. He suffers from emotional instability stemming from his failed marriage, but ends up finding a potential new romance with Polly. However, she dumps him when his work as a police informant is exposed.\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Dean Simms: Desna's [[autism|autistic]] brother whom she takes care of. He takes up bodybuilding as a hobby following Roller's \"death\", and falls in love with Virginia, one of his sister's associates. He also frees his sister from the grip of the Russians when he kills her boss, Zlata.\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Clay \"Uncle Daddy\" Husser: Bryce's and Roller's uncle and the ruthless head of the [[Dixie Mafia|Husser crime family]]. After the latter disappears, he starts grooming the former to succeed him, but realizes too late that Roller's actions have put the family into deep debt with the Russians. Stripped of his independence, he turns to the Haitian mob for assistance. He now seeks to rebuild the Husser family by any means necessary.\n* [[Jimmy Jean-Louis]] as Gregory Ruval (recurring season 1, starring season 2): A doctor and Desna's love interest, whose role as a boss in the Haitian mafia is unknown to her.

Desna launders money from selling painkillers for her off-and-on boyfriend Roller, the nephew of bi-sexual [[Dixie Mafia]] boss Clay \"Uncle Daddy\" Husser, through her salon. She hopes to save enough money to buy a nicer salon and a house where she can better care for her autistic brother, Dean, to whom she is deeply devoted. One of her colleagues, Polly, who has just been [[parole]]d for fraud, joins Desna and her friends at a [[New Year's Day]] celebration at Clay's bar, \"She She's\", a transsexual strip club. Pleased with Roller's success as a dealer, Clay gives him a larger cut of the profits. Desna discovers that Clay has reneged on a substantial bonus he had promised her, and she confronts Roller, but he refuses to help her. Furthermore, Roller insists that Desna fire Polly and permanently replace her with his current mistress Virginia, who Desna regards as nothing more than a freeloading whore. Instead, she and her crew assault Virginia and publicly humiliate her. The stress convinces her to split her cut with the girls, the only ones she can really trust. Later, during a visit to Roller's house, Desna snaps, attacks Roller and tries to drown him.

When Desna goes to check on Virginia the next day, Desna finds she has run away. Desna's oldest friend, Jenn, is the wife of Roller's older brother, Bryce, a [[life coach]] who also has ties to the mafia. Bryce, a former crackhead, informs the other girls that Roller is missing. Polly is revealed to be a pathological liar when she seems to take on another personality while talking to a group of teenagers in a court-ordered program.

Clay demands that Virginia identify the supposed perpetrator of Roller's death and then executes the man Virginia names, forcing the girls to clean up the murder scene. Bryce, a loving family man and reluctant gangster, is deeply traumatized by being forced by Clay to help him dismember the victim. Polly ditches the others to spend more time with Sally ([[Gina Torres]]), who offers her the chance to move into her guest house, but she is quickly exposed as a fraud when her ankle monitor goes off and Sally spots inconsistencies in her cover story.

She launders money for one of their most profitable pill mills, so she can save up and buy a better salon. She is in a relationship with Roller Husser, adopted son of his uncle, Uncle Daddy. When Uncle Daddy withholds some of her earnings, she blames Roller. She and Virginia, with whom he was cheating on Desna with, attempt to kill him. It is later revealed that Desna and her brother, Dean, spent their childhoods with abusive foster parents, explaining why she's so determined to build a life for herself. She eventually gets permission to leave the mob, but is subsequently forced to continue laundering money for the Russian Mafia. Desna ultimately sets out to build her own crime family after her brother kills the head of the Russian mob.\n* [[Carrie Preston]] as Polly Marks: a redheaded North Carolinian who helps manage Desna's criminal enterprises. A former professional con artist, pathological liar, and skilled burglar, she only recently made parole for running a [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] fraud scheme. Her relationship with Desna is one of absolute loyalty; she even threatens Virginia with a knife when she nearly implicates Desna in Roller's \"death\".

Preston also portrays Lillian Marks, Polly's twin sister who pressures her to own up to her mistakes. \n* [[Judy Reyes]] as Annalise \"Quiet Ann\" Zayas: the salon's lookout, doorman, and Desna's enforcer. She is college-educated, with plans to become a teacher, but her career was ruined when she was convicted of attempting to murder her husband after he stabbed her girlfriend.

Eventually, Virginia is accepted when she shoots Roller to defend Desna and proves her willingness to master the manicurist's trade. Later, she becomes pregnant after having sex with Dean, but goes through with an abortion and says yes when he asks to marry her. A failed assassination attempt causes her to lose an eye; the transplant, taken from a practicing psychic, gives Virginia empathetic abilities. She now runs the salon on Desna's behalf.\n* [[Jenn Lyon]] as Jennifer Husser: Desna's oldest friend, right-hand woman, and Bryce's wife, with whom she has one daughter and another from a previous relationship. Having already lost more than a few relatives to the consequences of organized crime, she is adamant that Bryce not be part of his family's criminal business, but he does so nonetheless, causing a rift to form between her and Desna. When her family is absorbed by the Russians, she manages to keep her position at the salon thanks to Desna vouching on her behalf. However, an affair she has with a man named Hank threatens her marriage with Bryce, until they reconcile and she vows to be more faithful.\n* [[Jack Kesy]] as Dwayne \"Roller\" Husser: Uncle Daddy's nephew, boyfriend to Desna and a high-powered drug dealer whose supposed death in the first episode triggers conflict between the Hussers and Desna's salon.

He's in love with Desna even though he doesn't say it. He has sex with Desna and gets back together with her, even after she tried to kill him.

Eventually, he finds himself helping Desna establish her criminal empire.\n* [[Kevin Rankin (actor)|Kevin Rankin]] as Bryce Husser: Jennifer's husband and Roller's brother, who joins the Dixie Mafia to get justice for Roller's death and takes over his narcotics racket, though he is struggling to control his own addiction.

Desna launders money from selling painkillers for her off-and-on boyfriend Roller, the nephew of bi-sexual [[Dixie Mafia]] boss Clay \"Uncle Daddy\" Husser, through her salon. She hopes to save enough money to buy a nicer salon and a house where she can better care for her autistic brother, Dean, to whom she is deeply devoted. One of her colleagues, Polly, who has just been [[parole]]d for fraud, joins Desna and her friends at a [[New Year's Day]] celebration at Clay's bar, \"She She's\", a transsexual strip club. Pleased with Roller's success as a dealer, Clay gives him a larger cut of the profits. Desna discovers that Clay has reneged on a substantial bonus he had promised her, and she confronts Roller, but he refuses to help her. Furthermore, Roller insists that Desna fire Polly and permanently replace her with his current mistress Virginia, who Desna regards as nothing more than a freeloading whore. Instead, she and her crew assault Virginia and publicly humiliate her. The stress convinces her to split her cut with the girls, the only ones she can really trust. Later, during a visit to Roller's house, Desna snaps, attacks Roller and tries to drown him. He gains the upper hand and starts to strangle Desna, but is subsequently shot by Virginia.\n |LineColor       = 7C00B9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Funerary\n |DirectedBy      = [[Howard Deutch]]\n |WrittenBy       = Eliot Laurence \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|6|18}}\n |ProdCode        = U13.12752\n |Viewers         = 1.20<ref name=\"1.02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-6-18-2017.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 6.18.2017|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=June 20, 2017|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Finding Roller's boat with the body of his murder victim inside, Desna and Virginia put Roller's body in the boat, set it on fire and set it adrift. Unbeknownst to them, the half-burnt boat strands on the nearby coast and the police find the burned remains of one man, which everyone assumes is Roller. When Desna goes to check on Virginia the next day, Desna finds she has run away. Desna's oldest friend, Jenn, is the wife of Roller's older brother, Bryce, a [[life coach]] who also has ties to the mafia. Bryce, a former crackhead, informs the other girls that Roller is missing. Polly is revealed to be a pathological liar when she seems to take on another personality while talking to a group of teenagers in a court-ordered program. Clay summons Desna to a meeting and asks her to find Virginia, as he is suspicious of her disappearance. Desna finds her living out of a dirty motel and convinces her to return. Clay offers Bryce the chance to run his [[pill mill]]s, but Jenn, a recovering alcoholic, begs him to turn it down, afraid of gangster life and the temptation of getting back into drugs.

Desna's real estate agent, Mandy, ditches her as a client after the salon deal seemingly falls through for good. When Chip ([[Elvis Nolasco]]), a corrupt detective with the Palmetto PD, (who also happens to be an enforcer for the Hussers) comes by to check Virginia's story, Desna places a fake witness to back her up. Bryce agrees to temporarily take over Roller's operation under Desna's supervision. Dr. Brickman's instability grows worse after learning that his ex-wife is remarrying, and Bryce gets distracted, allowing a thief to steal the clinic's entire supply of pills. The girls take Mandy and some other clients on a drinking spree, during which Desna learns of the robbery as well as Clay's insistence that she and Bryce repay the $88,000 they now owe him for the loss of the pills.

Polly maintains the \"Heather\" persona and claims she's not a manicurist, but now a rich widow conducting research for a novel. Clay calls in Desna's debt, but allows her to repay it in installments. She comes up with a plan to increase sales at the clinic in order to free herself from his grip. Clay demands that Virginia identify the supposed perpetrator of Roller's death and then executes the man Virginia names, forcing the girls to clean up the murder scene. Bryce, a loving family man and reluctant gangster, is deeply traumatized by being forced by Clay to help him dismember the victim. Polly ditches the others to spend more time with Sally ([[Gina Torres]]), who offers her the chance to move into her guest house, but she is quickly exposed as a fraud when her ankle monitor goes off and Sally spots inconsistencies in her cover story. Desna's efforts raise enough to cover all but $15,000 of the debt, which Polly collects by [[blackmail]]ing Sally. Desna learns that Clay has put a hit on Dr. Brickman, who gets thrown out of his ex-wife's engagement party after showing up drunk.

Afterwards, Olga reveals to Roller that he is not her baby's father. Seeking revenge, Desna recruits Clay, Roller, Ann, and Virginia to burn Ruval's coke supply. However, Clay talks Desna into stealing the coke instead of burning it, upsetting Ann and convincing her to leave the crew. Jenn briefly contemplates stabbing Zlata at the salon, but chooses not to when she realizes that doing so would make them the same. When Desna ponders why Zlata has been grooming her, Clay explains that her clean record--something none of the Hussers had--makes her ideal for running the clinics, and that Ruval would have gotten her business license when she died. Enraged, she throws him out. Ann goes to see Arlene for emotional support. Desna has Roller plant coke on Zlata's enforcer Boris, leading Ruval to kill him.

The NPC saw many alterations to its format and brand. Since 2006, it has been replaced by two competitions, the [[Mitre 10 Cup]] (originally the Air New Zealand or ITM Cup) and the [[Heartland Championship]]. From the [[2011 ITM Cup|2011 Season]], the top Division was split into two tiers based on the [[2010 ITM Cup|2010]] Table after Pool Play. Teams 1\u20137 were assigned to the Premiership and teams 8\u201314 to the Championship. There is automatic Promotion/Relegation between the two tiers and also \"crossover\" matches, as well as full Round Robin Matches within each tier. The Heartland Championship is also split into two tiers after pool play with the top tier playing for the [[Meads Cup]] and bottom tier playing for the [[Lochore Cup]]. Currently, all 26 of New Zealand's Provincial Unions participate in either the Mitre 10 Cup or Heartland Championship.\nThe NPC was first contested in 1976, and although the basic format of Division One was much the same from then until the 2006 reorganisation, there were a number of changes to the lower divisions.\n\n[[File:Oldnpcrugbylogo.gif|right|thumb|100px|The former NPC logo]]\n\nInitially, Division One was made up of 11 teams, 7 from the North Island and 4 from the South. The remaining unions contested a split Division Two, with teams from each island playing amongst themselves. The bottom placed Division One team from the South Island played the winner of the Southern Division Two to determine whether they switched divisions, whilst the bottom placed Division One team from the North Island was automatically relegated, switching places with the winner of the Northern Division Two.\n\nIn 1980, there was a change in format. There was no automatic relegation for any team from Division One. Instead, the Division Two North Island and South Island winning teams played each other to determine who played in a promotion/relegation match against the bottom team in Division One.\n\nThis format continued until 1985, when the split Division Two was replaced by a united Division Two and a Division Three. The top and bottom placed teams in each division were automatically promoted and relegated each year.\n\nIn 1992, three teams from Division One were relegated so there were 9 teams in each division. Also, 1992 saw the introduction of semi-finals and a final to determine the champion in each division\u2014previously, a league system had been used.\n\nAuckland were the most successful team in the NPC championship, having won 15 of the 30 series.\n\nThe only change before 2006 was in 1998, when the number of teams in each division was changed to 10 in Division One, 9 in Division Two, and 8 in Division Three. Having an even number of teams in Division One removed the necessity for byes. Starting that year, automatic promotion/relegation between the top two divisions was ended. In its place, the winner of Division Two played a promotion-relegation match against the bottom club in Division One to determine whether the clubs would switch places. Through 2002, this match was hosted by the bottom team in Division One, but the site was changed in 2003 to the home field of the Division Two champion.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1976, the original founded [[New Zealand Rugby Football Union]] organised a new provincial competition, unifying the various [[List of New Zealand rugby union teams|football unions]] across [[New Zealand]]. This was due to the demand after administered interprovincial matches were only arranged and scheduled for in an independent manner since the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzru.co.nz/what-we-do/competitions/national-competitions | title=National Competitions | work=New Zealand Rugby | date=22 March 2020 | accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> The National Provincial Championship was established with the [[1976 National Provincial Championship|inaugural tournament]] kicked off in May 1976.

Island competitions. From 1985 to 2005, there were three divisions, all organised on a nationwide basis. From 2006 onward there are 2 divisions of the National Championship, the [[ITM Cup]] (Air New Zealand Cup from 2006 through 2009) and [[Heartland Championship]]. From 2011 onwards, the top Division was split into 2 tiers, based on the [[2010 ITM Cup|2010]] Table after Round Robin play. Teams 1\u20137 were assigned to the Premiership and teams 8\u201314 to the Championship, with Promotion/Relegation between the two. The Heartland Championship is split into two tiers after pool play with the top tier playing for the [[Meads Cup]] and bottom tier playing for the [[Lochore Cup]], with Promotion/Relegation between the [[Meads Cup]] winner and bottom-placed ITM Cup Championship side.\n\n==List of New Zealand Premiers==\n1 \u2013 Auckland \u2013 17 titles;\n2 \u2013 Canterbury \u2013 14 titles;\n3 \u2013 Wellington \u2013 4 titles;\n4 \u2013 Otago and Waikato \u2013 2 titles;\n6 \u2013 Bay of Plenty, Counties Manukau, Manawatu, Taranaki and Tasman \u2013 1 title.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mitre 10 Cup]]\n* [[Heartland Championship]]\n* [[Ranfurly Shield]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{National Provincial Championship}}\n{{NPC}}\n{{Women's Provincial Championship}}\n{{Heartland Championship}}\n{{Ranfurly Shield}}\n{{Rugby union in New Zealand}}\n{{Southern Hemisphere Provincial Rugby Competitions}}\n\n[[Category:National Provincial Championship| ]]\n[[Category:Rugby union leagues in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Rugby union competitions for provincial teams]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=June 2010}}\n{{Infobox sports league\n|current_season=\n|logo=Npc.jpg\n|caption=Competition logo\n|sport=[[Rugby union]]\n|founded=1976\n|teams=\n|pixels=123\n|country={{NZL}}\n|champion= [[Tasman Rugby Union|Tasman]]\n}}\n\nThe '''National Provincial Championship''', or '''NPC''', was the major domestic rugby competition in New Zealand. The NPC saw many alterations to its format and brand. Since 2006, it has been replaced by two competitions, the [[Mitre 10 Cup]] (originally the Air New Zealand or ITM Cup) and the [[Heartland Championship]]. From the [[2011 ITM Cup|2011 Season]], the top Division was split into two tiers based on the [[2010 ITM Cup|2010]] Table after Pool Play. Teams 1\u20137 were assigned to the Premiership and teams 8\u201314 to the Championship. There is automatic Promotion/Relegation between the two tiers and also \"crossover\" matches, as well as full Round Robin Matches within each tier. The Heartland Championship is also split into two tiers after pool play with the top tier playing for the [[Meads Cup]] and bottom tier playing for the [[Lochore Cup]]. Currently, all 26 of New Zealand's Provincial Unions participate in either the Mitre 10 Cup or Heartland Championship.\nThe NPC was first contested in 1976, and although the basic format of Division One was much the same from then until the 2006 reorganisation, there were a number of changes to the lower divisions.\n\n[[File:Oldnpcrugbylogo.gif|right|thumb|100px|The former NPC logo]]\n\nInitially, Division One was made up of 11 teams, 7 from the North Island and 4 from the South. The remaining unions contested a split Division Two, with teams from each island playing amongst themselves. The bottom placed Division One team from the South Island played the winner of the Southern Division Two to determine whether they switched divisions, whilst the bottom placed Division One team from the North Island was automatically relegated, switching places with the winner of the Northern Division Two.\n\nIn 1980, there was a change in format. There was no automatic relegation for any team from Division One. Instead, the Division Two North Island and South Island winning teams played each other to determine who played in a promotion/relegation match against the bottom team in Division One.\n\nThis format continued until 1985, when the split Division Two was replaced by a united Division Two and a Division Three. The top and bottom placed teams in each division were automatically promoted and relegated each year.\n\nIn 1992, three teams from Division One were relegated so there were 9 teams in each division. Also, 1992 saw the introduction of semi-finals and a final to determine the champion in each division\u2014previously, a league system had been used.\n\nAuckland were the most successful team in the NPC championship, having won 15 of the 30 series.\n\nThe only change before 2006 was in 1998, when the number of teams in each division was changed to 10 in Division One, 9 in Division Two, and 8 in Division Three. Having an even number of teams in Division One removed the necessity for byes. Starting that year, automatic promotion/relegation between the top two divisions was ended. In its place, the winner of Division Two played a promotion-relegation match against the bottom club in Division One to determine whether the clubs would switch places. Through 2002, this match was hosted by the bottom team in Division One, but the site was changed in 2003 to the home field of the Division Two champion.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1976, the original founded [[New Zealand Rugby Football Union]] organised a new provincial competition, unifying the various [[List of New Zealand rugby union teams|football unions]] across [[New Zealand]]. This was due to the demand after administered interprovincial matches were only arranged and scheduled for in an independent manner since the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzru.co.nz/what-we-do/competitions/national-competitions | title=National Competitions | work=New Zealand Rugby | date=22 March 2020 | accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> The National Provincial Championship was established with the [[1976 National Provincial Championship|inaugural tournament]] kicked off in May 1976. The football unions were divided into two divisions, a Division One and a Division Two, the latter split into [[North Island]] and [[South Island]] sub-divisions. The title was awarded to the top-placed team on each division's competition ladder at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/regional-rugby/provincial-competitions | title=Regional rugby | work=New Zealand History | date=22 March 2020 | accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> After ten games in all, [[Bay of Plenty Rugby Union|Bay of Plenty]] were crowned the winners, on 18 September 1976.

From 2006 onward there are 2 divisions of the National Championship, the [[ITM Cup]] (Air New Zealand Cup from 2006 through 2009) and [[Heartland Championship]]. From 2011 onwards, the top Division was split into 2 tiers, based on the [[2010 ITM Cup|2010]] Table after Round Robin play. Teams 1\u20137 were assigned to the Premiership and teams 8\u201314 to the Championship, with Promotion/Relegation between the two.

It was there that the local militia were drilled. During drills, a frequent command given by the drill sergeant was, \"front the Royal Oak!\" The command was repeated and eventually shortened to simply \"Front Royal\".<ref name=nameOrigin_1>{{cite book|last1=Federal Writers' Project|title=Virginia: A Guide to the Old Dominion |date=1952|publisher=US History Publishers|isbn=1603540458|page=443|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2VzSg9hfp0C&pg=PA443 |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=nameOrigin_2>{{cite book |last1=Lillard |first1=David Edwin |title=Appalachian Trail names: Origins of place names along the AT |date=2002 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |isbn=081172672X |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRsC_EBRPEwC&pg=PA42 |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}</ref> This theory is supported by a bulletin published by the [[United States Geological Survey]] in 1905, which states that the town was first known as Royal Oak, with the current name being derived from the commands of a confused colonel.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA132 |title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States, Issue 258 of the U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |author=Gannett, Henry |year=1905 |page=132 |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA second account holds that when local militia were stationed around the town during the American Revolution, the sentry would call out \"Front\", to which the required entry password was to respond \"Royal\".

French settlers, trappers, and explorers in the [[Ohio Country]] of the mid-18th century were referring to the land grant made by King Charles II, then in control of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, Baron of Cameron. In English, \"le front royal\" is translated to the \"Royal Frontier\". The British themselves may have called the area \"Front Royal\" after 1763, when they set the so-called [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation Line]] along the spine of the Alleghenies to demarcate the settled portion of the colonies from the Indian Reserve in the interior.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Battle of Front Royal 1.png|thumb|250px|left|The [[Battle of Front Royal]] was fought during the US Civil War]]\nThe entire [[Shenandoah Valley]] including the area to become Front Royal was annexed and claimed for hunting by the [[Iroquois Confederation]] during the later [[Beaver Wars]], by 1672. Some bands of the [[Shawnee]] settled in the area as client groups to the Iroquois and alternately to the Cherokee after 1721. The Iroquois formally sold their entire claim east of the Alleghenies to the [[Virginia Colony]] at the [[Treaty of Lancaster]] in 1744.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hofstra|first=Warren|title=The Planting of New Virginia: Settlement and Landscape in the Shenandoah Valley|year=2005|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=0801882710|pages=10\u201312}}</ref>   Front Royal, originally settled in 1754 under the name '''LeHewtown''', had been known to European explorers as early as the 1670s, and the nearby settlement of Chester's Ferry was in existence by 1736. The town also had a well-known nickname by the 1790s, \"Helltown,\" due to the many livestock wranglers and boatmen on the Shenandoah coming through the area, who came into town looking for alcohol. It was incorporated as \"Front Royal\" in 1788.\n\nRail service was established in 1854 with the construction of the Alexandria, Orange and Manassas Gap Railroad between Manassas and Riverton. This line was soon extended to Strasburg in time to become a factor in the [[Battle of Front Royal]] on May 23, 1862 and throughout the Civil War. Lumber, agriculture, manufacturing and grain mills provided employment in the region for decades after the Civil War.\n\n[[File:American Viscose Plant Front Royal VA postcard.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Mid-20th century postcard showing an aerial view of the American Viscose Corporation Plant in Front Royal, Virginia.]]\nThe American Viscose rayon plant, once Front Royal's principal employer, with 3,000 workers at its peak, operated between the 1930 and 1989.

It was there that the local militia were drilled. During drills, a frequent command given by the drill sergeant was, \"front the Royal Oak!\" The command was repeated and eventually shortened to simply \"Front Royal\".<ref name=nameOrigin_1>{{cite book|last1=Federal Writers' Project|title=Virginia: A Guide to the Old Dominion |date=1952|publisher=US History Publishers|isbn=1603540458|page=443|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2VzSg9hfp0C&pg=PA443 |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=nameOrigin_2>{{cite book |last1=Lillard |first1=David Edwin |title=Appalachian Trail names: Origins of place names along the AT |date=2002 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |isbn=081172672X |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRsC_EBRPEwC&pg=PA42 |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}</ref> This theory is supported by a bulletin published by the [[United States Geological Survey]] in 1905, which states that the town was first known as Royal Oak, with the current name being derived from the commands of a confused colonel.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA132 |title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States, Issue 258 of the U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |author=Gannett, Henry |year=1905 |page=132 |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA second account holds that when local militia were stationed around the town during the American Revolution, the sentry would call out \"Front\", to which the required entry password was to respond \"Royal\".

French settlers, trappers, and explorers in the [[Ohio Country]] of the mid-18th century were referring to the land grant made by King Charles II, then in control of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, Baron of Cameron. In English, \"le front royal\" is translated to the \"Royal Frontier\". The British themselves may have called the area \"Front Royal\" after 1763, when they set the so-called [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation Line]] along the spine of the Alleghenies to demarcate the settled portion of the colonies from the Indian Reserve in the interior.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Battle of Front Royal 1.png|thumb|250px|left|The [[Battle of Front Royal]] was fought during the US Civil War]]\nThe entire [[Shenandoah Valley]] including the area to become Front Royal was annexed and claimed for hunting by the [[Iroquois Confederation]] during the later [[Beaver Wars]], by 1672. Some bands of the [[Shawnee]] settled in the area as client groups to the Iroquois and alternately to the Cherokee after 1721. The Iroquois formally sold their entire claim east of the Alleghenies to the [[Virginia Colony]] at the [[Treaty of Lancaster]] in 1744.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hofstra|first=Warren|title=The Planting of New Virginia: Settlement and Landscape in the Shenandoah Valley|year=2005|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=0801882710|pages=10\u201312}}</ref>   Front Royal, originally settled in 1754 under the name '''LeHewtown''', had been known to European explorers as early as the 1670s, and the nearby settlement of Chester's Ferry was in existence by 1736. The town also had a well-known nickname by the 1790s, \"Helltown,\" due to the many livestock wranglers and boatmen on the Shenandoah coming through the area, who came into town looking for alcohol. It was incorporated as \"Front Royal\" in 1788.\n\nRail service was established in 1854 with the construction of the Alexandria, Orange and Manassas Gap Railroad between Manassas and Riverton. This line was soon extended to Strasburg in time to become a factor in the [[Battle of Front Royal]] on May 23, 1862 and throughout the Civil War. Lumber, agriculture, manufacturing and grain mills provided employment in the region for decades after the Civil War.\n\n[[File:American Viscose Plant Front Royal VA postcard.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Mid-20th century postcard showing an aerial view of the American Viscose Corporation Plant in Front Royal, Virginia.]]\nThe American Viscose rayon plant, once Front Royal's principal employer, with 3,000 workers at its peak, operated between the 1930 and 1989.

Duke won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance. The following year, she played the [[dual role]] of \"identical cousins\" Cathy and Patty Lane on her own show: ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. She later progressed to more mature roles, such as Neely O'Hara in the film ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967). Over the course of her career, Duke received three [[Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], and two [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe Awards]]. Duke also served as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] from 1985 to 1988.\n\nDuke was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] in 1982. Following her diagnosis, she devoted much of her time to advocating for and educating the public on [[mental health]]. Duke was the mother of actors [[Sean Astin]] and [[Mackenzie Astin]].\n\n==Early life==\nDuke was born in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the youngest of three children of Frances Margaret ([[Maiden and married names|n\u00e9e]] McMahon; 1913\u20131993), a cashier, and John Patrick Duke (1913\u20131964), a handyman and cab driver.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BsRZAAAAMAAJ&q=%22John+Patrick+Duke%22+mcmahon&dq=%22John+Patrick+Duke%22+mcmahon|title=Patty Duke|publisher=|isbn=9780313256752|last1=Eberly|first1=Stephen L.|year=1988}}</ref> She was of [[Ireland|Irish]], and more distant [[Germany|German]], descent.<ref name=\"FilmReference\"/><ref name=\"Duke1987\"/>\n\nDuke, her brother Raymond, and her sister Carol experienced a difficult childhood. Their father was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], and their mother suffered from [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] and was prone to violence. When Duke was six, her mother forced her father to leave the family home. When Duke was eight, her care was turned over to talent managers John and Ethel Ross, who, after promoting Patty's brother, were looking for a girl to add to their stable of child actors.<ref name=\"Lipton_People_19990503\"/><ref name=\":7\"/>\n\nThe Rosses' methods of managing Duke's career were often unscrupulous and exploitative.

Duke's first major starring role was [[Helen Keller]], (with [[Anne Bancroft]] as [[Anne Sullivan]]), in the Broadway play ''[[The Miracle Worker (play)|The Miracle Worker]]'', which ran from October 1959 to July 1961.

At that time, it was not known that Duke had [[bipolar disorder]], but Sheldon did notice that she had two distinct sides to her personality and thus developed the concept of identical cousins with contrasting personalities.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last2=|first2=|date=1996|title=Special Collectors' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time|journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume=|pages= |last1=|first1=}}</ref> Duke portrayed both main characters: Patricia \"Patty\" Lane, a fun-loving American teenager who occasionally got into trouble at school and home, and her prim and proper \"identical cousin\" from Scotland, Catherine \"Cathy\" Lane. [[William Schallert]] portrayed Patty's father, Martin as well as his twin brother Kenneth- Cathy's father; [[Jean Byron]] played her mother, Natalie; [[Paul O'Keefe]] was her younger brother, Ross; and [[Eddie Applegate]] portrayed her boyfriend, Richard Harrison (though the actor was married and several years Duke's senior.)<ref name=\":3\" /> The show also featured such high-profile guest stars as [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Paul Lynde]], and [[Sal Mineo]]. The series lasted three seasons and earned Duke an [[Emmy Award]] nomination. In 1999, the program's characters were revisited and updated in ''The Patty Duke Show: Still Rockin' in Brooklyn Heights'', with [[Cindy Williams]] taking on the villain role of Sue Ellen Turner when Kitty Sullivan was unable to reprise her role.\n\nAfter the cancellation of ''The Patty Duke Show'' in 1966, Duke began her adult acting career by playing Neely O'Hara in ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967).<ref name=\":0\" /> The film was a box-office success, but audiences and critics had a difficult time accepting all-American-teenager Duke as an alcoholic, drug-addicted singing star.

In 1969, Duke starred in ''[[Me, Natalie]]'', in which she played an \"ugly duckling\" Brooklyn teenager struggling to make a life for herself in the [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] world of [[Greenwich Village]].

Her portrayal of a pregnant teenager on the run won Duke her first [[Emmy Award]]. Her acceptance speech was rambling and disjointed,<ref name=\":7\" /> leading many in the industry to believe she was drunk or using drugs at the time. In fact, Duke was experiencing a manic phase of her bipolar disorder, which would remain undiagnosed until 1982.<ref name=\"Duke1987\" /> She received her second Emmy in 1977 for the TV miniseries ''[[Captains and the Kings]]'' and her third in 1980 for a TV version of her 1979 stage revival of ''The Miracle Worker'', this time playing Anne Sullivan to [[Melissa Gilbert]]'s Helen Keller. Her turns in the made-for-TV movies ''The Women's Room'' (1980) and ''George Washington'' (1984) both garnered her Emmy nominations. In the 1980s, Duke was cast in a number of short-lived TV series: the ABC sitcom ''[[It Takes Two (U.S. TV series)|It Takes Two]]'', from ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' and ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]'' creator [[Susan Harris]], was cancelled after one season; ''[[Hail to the Chief (TV series)|Hail to the Chief]]'', in which she appeared as the first female President of the United States;<ref name=\":3\" /> and a comedy, ''[[Karen's Song]]'', which aired on the fledgling [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/karens-song/202484/|title=Karen's Song |website=TV Guide|access-date=March 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuke's film roles in the 1980s included the Canadian film ''[[By Design]]'' (1981), which garnered her a [[Genie Awards|Genie Award]] nomination for Best Foreign Actress, and the made-for-TV movie ''A Time to Triumph'' (1986), the true story of Concetta Hassan, a woman who struggles to support her family after her husband is injured but who eventually becomes a United States Army helicopter pilot.
