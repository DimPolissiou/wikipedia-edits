It took place on 25 October 1415 ([[Saint Crispin's Day]]) near [[Azincourt]], in northern France.{{efn|Dates in the fifteenth century are difficult to reconcile with modern calendars: see {{harvnb|Barker|2015|pp=226\u2013228}} for the way the date of the battle was established.}} England's unexpected victory against the numerically superior French army boosted English morale and prestige, crippled France, and started a new period of English dominance in the war.\n\nAfter several decades of relative peace, the English had [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|renewed their war effort]] in 1415 amid the failure of negotiations with the French. In the ensuing campaign, many soldiers died from disease, and the English numbers dwindled; they tried to withdraw to [[Pale of Calais|English-held Calais]] but found their path blocked by a considerably larger French army. Despite the disadvantage, the following battle ended in an overwhelming tactical victory for the English.\n\nKing [[Henry V of England]] led his troops into battle and participated in hand-to-hand fighting. King [[Charles VI of France]] did not command the French army himself, as he suffered from psychotic illnesses and associated mental incapacity. Instead, the French were commanded by [[Grand Constable of France|Constable]] [[Charles I of Albret|Charles d'Albret]] and various prominent French noblemen of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac party]].  This battle is notable for the use of the [[English longbow]] in very large numbers, with the English and [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages|Welsh]] archers comprising nearly 80 percent of Henry's army.\n\nAgincourt is one of England's most celebrated victories and was one of the most important English triumphs in the Hundred Years' War, along with the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356). It forms the centrepiece of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599.\n\n==Contemporary accounts==\nThe Battle of Agincourt is well documented by at least seven contemporary accounts, three from eyewitnesses. The approximate location of the battle has never been disputed, and the site remains relatively unaltered after 600 years. \n\nImmediately after the battle, Henry summoned the [[herald]]s of the two armies who had watched the battle together with principal French herald Montjoie, and they settled on the name of the battle as ''Azincourt'', after the nearest fortified place.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=86}} Two of the most frequently cited accounts come from [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources, one from [[Jean Le F\u00e8vre de Saint-Remy]] who was present at the battle, and the other from [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]. The English eyewitness account comes from the anonymous ''Gesta Henrici Quinti'', believed to have been written by a [[chaplain]] in the King's household who would have been in the [[Wagon train|baggage train]] at the battle.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=22\u201326}} A recent re-appraisal of Henry's strategy of the Agincourt campaign incorporates these three accounts and argues that war was seen as a legal [[due process]] for solving the disagreement over claims to the French throne.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Honig|first1=Jan Willem|title=Reappraising Late Medieval Strategy: The Example of the 1415 Agincourt Campaign|journal=War in History|date=2012|volume=19|issue=123|pages=123\u2013151|doi=10.1177/0968344511432975}} {{pn|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n{{Main article|Hundred Years' War}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather [[Edward III of England]], although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on [[Aquitaine]] and other French lands (the terms of the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]]).{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=14}} He initially called a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the ensuing negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of [[John II of France|John II]] (who had been captured at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of [[Anjou]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Normandy]], and [[Touraine]], as well as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. Henry would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]'s young daughter, and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. \n\nThe French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415, negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=67\u201369}} In December 1414, the English [[Parliament of England|parliament]] was persuaded to grant Henry a \"double subsidy\", a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French.

The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease. Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through [[Normandy]] to the port of [[Calais]], the English stronghold in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim.{{sfn|Hibbert|1971|p=67}} He also intended the manoeuvre as a deliberate provocation to battle aimed at [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|the dauphin]], who had failed to respond to Henry's personal challenge to combat at Harfleur.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=221}}\n\nDuring the siege, the French had raised an army which assembled around [[Rouen]].

By 24 October, both armies faced each other for battle, but the French declined, hoping for the arrival of more troops. The two armies spent the night of 24 October on open ground. The next day the French initiated negotiations as a delaying tactic, but Henry ordered his army to advance and to start a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid, or to fight defensively: that was how [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and the other famous longbow victories had been won. The English had very little food, had marched {{convert|260|mi}} in two and a half weeks, were suffering from sickness such as [[dysentery]], and were greatly outnumbered by well-equipped French men-at-arms.

It may be in the narrow strip of open land formed between the woods of [[Tramecourt]] and Azincourt (close to the modern village of [[Azincourt]]).

The army was divided into three battalions, with the right wing led by [[Edward, Duke of York]], the centre led by the king himself, and the left wing under the old and experienced Baron [[Thomas Camoys, Baron Camoys|Thomas Camoys]]. The archers were commanded by Sir [[Thomas Erpingham]], another elderly veteran.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=454}} It is likely that the English adopted their usual battle line of longbowmen on either flank, with men-at-arms and knights in the centre. They might also have deployed some archers in the centre of the line. The English men-at-arms in plate and mail were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English and Welsh archers on the flanks drove pointed wooden [[archer's stake|stakes]], or palings, into the ground at an angle to force [[cavalry]] to veer off. This use of stakes could have been inspired by the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] of 1396, where forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] used the tactic against French cavalry.{{efn|The first known use of angled stakes to thwart a mounted charge was at the Battle of Nicopolis, an engagement between European states and Turkish forces in 1396, twenty years before Agincourt. French knights, charging uphill, were unseated from their horses, either because their mounts were injured on the stakes or because they dismounted to uproot the obstacles, and were overpowered. News of the contrivance circulated within Europe and was described in a book of tactics written in 1411 by [[Jean le Maingre|Boucicault]], Marshal of France.{{sfn|Bennett|1994|pp=7, 15\u201316}} }}\n\nThe English made their [[Sacrament of Penance|confessions]] before the battle, as was customary.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=166}} Henry, worried about the enemy launching surprise raids, and wanting his troops to remain focused, ordered all his men to spend the night before the battle in silence, on pain of having an ear cut off. He told his men that he would rather die in the coming battle than be captured and [[ransom]]ed.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=269\u2013270}}\n\nHenry made a speech emphasising the justness of his cause, and reminding his army of previous great defeats the kings of England had inflicted on the French. The [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources have him concluding the speech by telling his men that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so that he could never draw a longbow again. Whether this was true is open to question; death was the normal fate of any soldier who could not be ransomed.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=286}}\n\n===French deployment===\nThe French army had 10,000 men-at arms{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=57\u201359}}{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=429, 565}}{{sfn|Sumption|2015|pp=452\u2013453}} plus some 4,000\u20135,000 miscellaneous footmen (''gens de trait'') including archers, crossbowmen{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=422, 565}} (''arbal\u00e9triers'') and shield-bearers (''pavisiers''), totaling 14,000\u201315,000 men.

The recently ploughed land hemmed in by dense woodland favoured the English, both because of its narrowness, and because of the thick mud through which the French knights had to walk.{{sfn|Wason|2004|p=74}}{{sfn|Holmes|1996|p=48}}\n\nAccounts of the battle describe the French engaging the English men-at-arms before being rushed from the sides by the longbowmen as the [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed. The English account in the ''Gesta Henrici'' says: \"For when some of them, killed when battle was first joined, fall at the front, so great was the undisciplined violence and pressure of the mass of men behind them that the living fell on top of the dead, and others falling on top of the living were killed as well.\"{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\n\nAlthough the French initially pushed the English back, they became so closely packed that they were described as having trouble using their weapons properly. The French monk of St. Denis says: \"Their vanguard, composed of about 5,000 men, found itself at first so tightly packed that those who were in the third rank could scarcely use their swords,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=107}}.</ref> and the Burgundian sources have a similar passage.\n\nRecent heavy rain made the battle field very muddy, proving very tiring to walk through in full [[plate armour]]. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as \"marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy\". The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the m\u00eal\u00e9e. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=303}}\n\n==Fighting==\n===Opening moves===\n[[File:Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25th October 1415.PNG|thumb|''Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25 October 1415'', painted by Sir [[John Gilbert (painter)|John Gilbert]] in the 19th century]]\nOn the morning of 25 October, the French were still waiting for additional troops to arrive. The [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (about 2,000 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} the [[Louis II of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]] (about 600 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} and the [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] (6,000 men, according to Monstrelet),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=416}} were all marching to join the army.\n\nFor three hours after sunrise there was no fighting. Military textbooks of the time stated: \"Everywhere and on all occasions that foot soldiers march against their enemy face to face, those who march lose and those who remain standing still and holding firm win.\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=290}} On top of this, the French were expecting thousands of men to join them if they waited. They were blocking Henry's retreat, and were perfectly happy to wait for as long as it took. There had even been a suggestion that the English would run away rather than give battle when they saw that they would be fighting so many French princes.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=291}}\n\nHenry's men were already very weary from hunger, illness and retreat. Apparently Henry believed his fleeing army would perform better on the defensive, but had to halt the retreat and somehow engage the French\nbefore a defensive battle was possible.\n{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436\u2013437}} This entailed abandoning his chosen position and pulling out, advancing, and then re-installing the long sharpened wooden stakes pointed outwards toward the enemy, which helped protect the longbowmen from cavalry charges.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=90\u201391}} (The use of stakes was an innovation for the English: during the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], for example, the archers had been instead protected by pits and other obstacles.{{sfn|Bennett|1994}})\n\nThe tightness of the terrain also seems to have restricted the planned deployment of the French forces. The French had originally drawn up a battle plan that had archers and crossbowmen in front of their men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to \"fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them,\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=275}} but in the event, the French archers and crossbowmen were deployed ''behind'' and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle). The cavalry force, which could have devastated the English line if it had attacked while they moved their stakes, charged only ''after'' the initial volley of arrows from the English. It is unclear whether the delay occurred because the French were hoping the English would launch a frontal assault (and were surprised when the English instead started shooting from their new defensive position), or whether the French mounted knights instead did not react quickly enough to the English advance. French chroniclers agree that when the mounted charge did come, it did not contain as many men as it should have; Gilles le Bouvier states that some had wandered off to warm themselves and others were walking or feeding their horses.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=294}}\n\n===French cavalry attack===\nThe French cavalry, despite being disorganised and not at full numbers, charged towards the longbowmen, but it was a disaster, with the French knights unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the forest of sharpened stakes that protected the archers. [[John Keegan]] argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle at this point was injuries to horses: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation, long-range shots used as the charge started.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=92\u201396}} The mounted charge and subsequent retreat churned up the already muddy terrain between the French and the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk of [[Saint Denis Basilica|St. Denis]] who reports how the wounded and panicking horses galloped through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight from the battlefield.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=297}}\n\n===Main French assault===\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415, by Sir John Gilbert in the 19th century.]]\nThe plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 1,000 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as \"a terrifying hail of arrow shot\". A complete coat of plate was considered such good protection that shields were generally not used,{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=109}} although the Burgundian contemporary sources distinguish between Frenchmen who used shields and those who did not, and Rogers has suggested that the front elements of the French force used axes and shields.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=90}} Modern historians are divided on how effective the longbows would have been against plate armour of the time. Modern test and contemporary accounts conclude that arrows could not penetrate the better quality steel armour, which became available to knights and men-at-arms of fairly modest means by the middle of the 14th century, but could penetrate the poorer quality [[wrought iron]] armour<ref>Nicolle, D.

Rogers suggested that the longbow could penetrate a wrought iron breastplate at short range and penetrate the thinner armour on the limbs even at {{convert|220|yd}}. He considered a knight in the best-quality steel armour invulnerable to an arrow on the breastplate or top of the helmet, but vulnerable to shots hitting the limbs, particularly at close range.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=110\u2013113}} In any case, to protect themselves as much as possible from the arrows, the French had to lower their visors and bend their helmeted heads to avoid being shot in the face, as the eye- and air-holes in their helmets were among the weakest points in the armour. This head-lowered position restricted their breathing and their vision. Then they had to walk a few hundred yards (metres) through thick mud and a press of comrades while wearing armour weighing {{convert|50|\u2013|60|lb}}, gathering sticky clay all the way. Increasingly, they had to walk around or over fallen comrades.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=301}}\n\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 57.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII.

As the [[Melee|m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed, the French second line also joined the attack, but they too were swallowed up, with the narrow terrain meaning the extra numbers could not be used effectively. Rogers suggested that the French at the back of their deep formation would have been attempting to literally add their weight to the advance, without realising that they were hindering the ability of those at the front to manoeuvre and fight by pushing them into the English formation of lancepoints. After the initial wave, the French would have had to fight over and on the bodies of those who had fallen before them. In such a \"press\" of thousands of men, Rogers suggested that many could have suffocated in their armour, as was described by several sources, and which was also known to have happened in other battles.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=95\u201398}}\n\nThe French men-at-arms were taken prisoner or killed in the thousands. The fighting lasted about three hours, but eventually the leaders of the second line were killed or captured, as those of the first line had been. The English ''Gesta Henrici'' described three great heaps of the slain around the three main English standards.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\nAccording to contemporary English accounts, Henry fought hand to hand. Upon hearing that his youngest brother [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] had been wounded in the groin, Henry took his household guard and stood over his brother, in the front rank of the fighting, until Humphrey could be dragged to safety. The king received an axe blow to the head, which knocked off a piece of the crown that formed part of his helmet.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=443}}\n\n===Attack on the English baggage train===\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt.jpg|thumb|upright|1915 depiction of Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt : The King wears on this surcoat the Royal Arms of England, quartered with the Fleur de Lys of France as a symbol of his claim to the throne of France.]]\nThe only French success was an attack on the lightly protected English baggage train, with Ysembart d'Azincourt (leading a small number of men-at-arms and [[Squire|varlets]] plus about 600 peasants) seizing some of Henry's personal treasures, including a crown.{{sfn|Curry|2006|pp=207\u2013209}} Whether this was part of a deliberate French plan or an act of local [[brigandage]] is unclear from the sources. Certainly, d'Azincourt was a local knight but he might have been chosen to lead the attack because of his local knowledge and the lack of availability of a more senior soldier.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=311}} In some accounts the attack happened towards the end of the battle, and led the English to think they were being attacked from the rear. Barker, following the ''Gesta Henrici'', believed to have been written by an English chaplain who was actually in the baggage train, concluded that the attack happened at the ''start'' of the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=311}}\n\n===Henry executes the prisoners===\nRegardless of when the baggage assault happened, at some point after the initial English victory, Henry became alarmed that the French were regrouping for another attack. The ''Gesta Henrici'' places this after the English had overcome the onslaught of the French men-at-arms and the weary English troops were eyeing the French rearguard (\"in incomparable number and still fresh\").{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}} Le F\u00e8vre and Wavrin similarly say that it was signs of the French rearguard regrouping and \"marching forward in battle order\" which made the English think they were still in danger.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=163}} A slaughter of the French prisoners ensued. It seems it was purely a decision of Henry, since the English knights found it contrary to [[chivalry]], and contrary to their interests to kill valuable hostages for whom it was commonplace to ask [[ransom]]. Henry threatened to hang whoever did not obey his orders.\n\nIn any event, Henry ordered the slaughter of what were perhaps several thousand French prisoners, sparing only the highest ranked (presumably those most likely to fetch a large ransom under the chivalric system of warfare). According to most chroniclers, Henry's fear was that the prisoners (who, in an unusual turn of events, actually outnumbered their captors) would realise their advantage in numbers, rearm themselves with the weapons strewn about the field and overwhelm the exhausted English forces. Contemporary chroniclers did not criticise him for it.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=305\u2013308}} In his study of the battle [[John Keegan]] argued that the main aim was not to actually kill the French knights but rather to terrorise them into submission and quell any possibility they might resume the fight, which would probably have caused the uncommitted French reserve forces to join the fray, as well.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=107\u2013112}} Such an event would have posed a risk to the still-outnumbered English and could have easily turned a stunning victory into a mutually destructive defeat, as the English forces were now largely intermingled with the French and would have suffered grievously from the arrows of their own longbowmen had they needed to resume shooting. Keegan also speculated that due to the relatively low number of archers actually involved in killing the French knights (roughly 200 by his estimate), together with the refusal of the English knights to assist in a duty they saw as distastefully unchivalrous, and combined with the sheer difficulty of killing such a large number of prisoners in such a short space of time, the actual number of French prisoners put to death may not have been substantial before the French reserves fled the field and Henry rescinded the order.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=112}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe French had suffered a catastrophic defeat.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} In all, around 6,000 of their fighting men lay dead on the ground.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 121, 127}}{{sfn|Curry|2005|pp=187, 192, 233, 248}}{{sfn|Sumption|2015|pp=459, 461}} The list of casualties, one historian has noted, \"read like a roll call of the military and political leaders of the past generation\".{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} Among them were 90\u2013120 great lords and [[Knight banneret|banneret]]s killed, including{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 53, 93, 168, 169}} three dukes ([[John I, Duke of Alen\u00e7on|Alen\u00e7on]], [[Edward III of Bar|Bar]] and [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Brabant]]), nine counts ([[Henry II, Count of Bl\u00e2mont|Bl\u00e2mont]], [[Charles I of Albret|Dreux]], Fauquembergue, [[Edward II, Count of Grandpr\u00e9|Grandpr\u00e9]], [[Robert of Bar, Count of Marle|Marle]], [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Nevers]], [[John VI, Count of Roucy|Roucy]], Vaucourt, [[Frederick of Lorraine, Count of Vaud\u00e9mont|Vaud\u00e9mont]]) and one viscount ([[John of Bar|Puisaye]]), also an archbishop.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=325}} Of the great royal office holders, France lost its constable (Albret), an [[admiral of France|admiral]] (the [[Jacques de Ch\u00e2tillon de Dampierre|lord of Dampierre]]), the [[Master of Crossbowmen]] ([[David de Rambures]], dead along with three sons), Master of the Royal Household (Guichard Dauphin) and ''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t'' of the marshals.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=xxii, 325, 327}} According to the heralds, 3,069 knights and squires were killed,{{efn|As reported by [[Thomas Walsingham]].{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=53}} Other sources agree closely, citing 4,000 dead in this group.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=131, 182}} Reportedly 1,500 knights died.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 93}} }} while at least 2,600 more corpses were found without coats of arms to identify them.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} Entire noble families were wiped out in the male line, and in some regions an entire generation of landed nobility was annihilated.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=460}} The [[Bailiff (France)|bailiffs]] of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle \"cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Ponthieu]], [[Normandy]], [[Picardy]].\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=326\u2013327}}\n\nEstimates of the number of prisoners vary between 700 and 2,200, amongst them the dukes of [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[John I of Bourbon|Bourbon]], the counts of [[Charles of Artois, Count of Eu|Eu]], [[Louis, Count of Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me]], [[Arthur de Richemont|Richemont]] (brother of the [[John V, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] and stepbrother of Henry V) and [[John VII of Harcourt|Harcourt]], and marshal [[Jean Le Maingre]].{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=337, 367, 368}} Record evidence identifies at least 112 Englishmen killed in the fighting,{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=324}} while [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet|Monstrelet]] reported 600 English dead.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} These included the [[Edward, 2nd Duke of York|Duke of York]], the young [[Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]] and the Welsh esquire [[Dafydd Gam|Dafydd (\"Davy\") Gam]].\n\nAlthough the victory had been militarily decisive, its impact was complex. It did not lead to further English conquests immediately as Henry's priority was to return to England, which he did on 16 November, to be received in [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in London on the 23rd.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=475, 479}} Henry returned a conquering hero, seen as blessed by God in the eyes of his subjects and European powers outside France. It established the legitimacy of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian monarchy]] and the future campaigns of Henry to pursue his \"rights and privileges\" in France.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=547\u2013549}} Other benefits to the English were longer term. Very quickly after the battle, the fragile truce between the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] and [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundian]] factions broke down. The brunt of the battle had fallen on the Armagnacs and it was they who suffered the majority of senior casualties and carried the blame for the defeat. The Burgundians seized on the opportunity and within 10 days of the battle had mustered their armies and marched on Paris.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=358}} This lack of unity in France allowed Henry eighteen months to prepare militarily and politically for a renewed campaign. When that campaign took place, it was made easier by the damage done to the political and military structures of Normandy by the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=385}}\n\n==Numbers at Agincourt==\n[[Anne Curry]] in her 2005 book ''Agincourt: A New History'', argues (based on research into the surviving administrative records) that the French army was about 12,000 strong, and the English army about 9,000, giving proportions of four to three.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=192}} By contrast, [[Juliet Barker]] in her book ''Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle'' (also published in 2005) argues the English and Welsh were outnumbered \"at least four to one and possibly as much as six to one\".{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=x}} She suggests figures of about 6,000 for the English and 36,000 for the French, based on the ''Gesta Henrici''{{'}}s figures of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms for the English, and [[Jean de Wavrin]]'s statement \"that the French were six times more numerous than the English\".{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=274}} The 2009 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' uses the figures of about 6,000 for the English and 20,000 to 30,000 for the French. The 1911 ''Britannica'' use somewhat different figures of 6,000 archers, 1,000 men-at-arms and \"a few thousands of other foot\" for the English, with the French outnumbering them by \"at least four times\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=375}}\n\nWhile not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, states the French probably had 12,000\u201315,000 troops.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}} Ian Mortimer, in his 2009 book ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', notes how Curry \"minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)\", but agrees that previous estimates have exaggerated the odds, and suggests that \"the most extreme imbalance which is credible is fifteen thousand French troops against 8,100 English: a ratio of about two-to-one\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=566}}\n\nHowever, Clifford J. Rogers, professor of history at the United States Military Academy at West Point, has recently argued that archival records are too incomplete to substantially change his view that the English were outnumbered about 4\u20131.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}}{{sfn|Rogers|2008a|pp=114\u2013121}} Juliet Barker also disagrees with Curry's arguments in the acknowledgements section of her 2005 book on Agincourt, saying: \"Surviving administrative records on both sides, but especially the French, are simply too incomplete to support [Curry's] assertion that nine thousand English were pitted against an army only twelve thousand strong. And if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries.\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=xvi}}\n\nThose supporting a greater imbalance have generally put more store by contemporary (and especially eyewitness) accounts. The ''Gesta Henrici'' gives plausible figures for the English of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms, but Mortimer notes it is \"wildly inaccurate\" in stating the English were outnumbered 30\u20131, and there have also been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. The proportions also seem incorrect, as from surviving records we know that Henry set out with about four times as many archers as men-at-arms, not five and a half times as many. Those who have supported the Gesta figures for the English army have generally thought that although the English army may have left Harfleur with eight or nine thousand men, it is plausible that after weeks of campaigning and disease in hostile territory they would have lost two or three thousand fighting men; however Mortimer states: \"Despite the trials of the march, Henry had lost very few men to illness or death; and we have independent testimony that no more than 160 had been captured on the way.\"{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}}\n\nAs Mortimer notes, the Burgundian numbers for the size of the French vanguard of 8,000 men-at-arms in the vanguard with 1,400 (or 2,400) men-at-arms in the wings correspond roughly with the figures of ten thousand men-at-arms recorded by the duke of Berry's herald. The Burgundians also recorded 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the \"vanguard\", which would suggest \"fourteen or fifteen thousand fighting men\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}} The Burgundians actually give the total size of the French army as an implausible 50,000,{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} and the numbers they use do not correspond closely to the odds they describe. Using very similar numbers, Jean Le Fevre states that the English were outnumbered 3\u20131, whereas Wavrin states that the English were outnumbered 6\u20131.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=157}}\n\nOne particular cause of confusion may have been the number of servants on both sides. Mortimer suggests that because there were a much higher proportion of men-at-arms on the French side, the number of non-combatants was much higher. Each man-at-arms could be expected to have a page, who would have ridden one of his spare horses. If the French army had an extra 10,000 mounted men (as opposed to only 1,500 extra for the English), then \"the English probably did see an army about three times the size of their own fighting force\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\nIt is open to debate whether these should all be counted as non-combatants; Rogers (for example) accepts that the French probably had about 10,000 men-at-arms, but explicitly includes one \"gros valet\" (an armed, armoured and mounted military servant) per French man-at-arms in his calculation of the odds.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n==Popular representations==\n[[File:Agincourtcarol.jpg|thumb|The 15th century [[Agincourt Carol]]]]\nThe battle remains an important symbol in popular culture. Some notable examples are listed below.\n===Music===\nSoon after the  victory at Agincourt, a number of popular folk songs were created about the battle, the most famous being the \"[[Agincourt Carol]]\", produced in the first half of the 15th century.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=280\u2013283}} Other ballads followed, including \"[[King Henry Fifth's Conquest of France]]\", raising the popular prominence of particular events mentioned only in passing by the original chroniclers, such as the gift of tennis balls before the campaign.{{sfn|Woolf|2003|p=323}}\n\n===Literature===\nThe most famous cultural depiction of the battle today is [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599. The play focuses on the pressures of kingship, the tensions between how a king should ''appear'' \u2013 chivalric, honest, and just \u2013 and how a king must sometimes ''act'' \u2013 [[Machiavelli]]an and ruthless.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=15}} Shakespeare illustrates these tensions by depicting Henry's decision to kill some of the French prisoners, whilst attempting to justify it and distance himself from the event. This moment of the battle is portrayed both as a break with the traditions of chivalry and as key example of the paradox of kingship.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nShakespeare's depiction of the battle also plays on the theme of modernity. He contrasts the modern, English king and his army with the medieval, chivalric, older model of the French.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=20}}\n\nShakespeare's play presented Henry as leading a truly English force into battle, playing on the importance of the link between the monarch and the common soldiers in the fight.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=16}} The original play does not, however, feature any scenes of the actual battle itself, leading critic Rose Zimbardo to characterise it as \"full of warfare, yet empty of conflict.\"{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=193}}\n\nThe play introduced the famous [[St Crispin's Day Speech]], considered one of Shakespeare's most heroic speeches, which Henry delivers movingly to his soldiers just before the battle, urging his \"band of brothers\" to stand together in the forthcoming fight.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}} Critic David Margolies describes how it \"oozes honour, military glory, love of country and self-sacrifice\", and forms one of the first instances of English literature linking solidarity and comradeship to success in battle.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}}{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=31}} Partially as a result, the battle was used as a metaphor at the beginning of the [[First World War]], when the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s attempts to stop the German advances were widely likened to it.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=183}}\n\n===Films===\nShakespeare's version of the battle of Agincourt has been turned into several minor and two major films. The latter, each titled ''Henry V'', star [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] in [[Henry V (1989 film)|1989]]. Made just prior to the invasion of Normandy, Olivier's rendition gives the battle what Sarah Hatchuel has termed an \"exhilarating and heroic\" tone, with an artificial, cinematic look to the battle scenes.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|pp=194\u2013195}} Branagh's version gives a longer, more [[Realism (arts)|realist]] portrayal of the battle itself, drawing on both historical sources and images from the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Falkland War]]s.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=195}} \n\nIn his 2007 film adaptation, director Peter Babakitis uses digital effects to exaggerate realist features during the battle scenes, producing a more ''[[Experimental film|avant-garde]]'' interpretation of the fighting at Agincourt.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=200}} The battle also forms a central component of the 2019 Netflix film [[The King (2019 film)|''The King'']] (2019).\n\n===Mock trial===\nIn March 2010, a mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the slaughter of the prisoners was held in Washington, D.C., drawing from both the historical record and Shakespeare's play. Participating as judges were Justices [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The trial ranged widely over whether there was just cause for war and not simply the prisoner issue. Although an audience vote was \"too close to call\", Henry was unanimously found guilty by the court on the basis of \"evolving standards of civil society\".<ref name=\"mock-trial-cspan\">{{cite web | url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/221111 | title=Judgment at Agincourt | date=16 March 2010 | website=[[C-SPAN]] }} link to video</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-cd\">{{cite web | url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2010/03/18/high-court-rules-for-french-at-agincourt/ | title=High Court Rules for French at Agincourt | website=DC Theater Scene | first=Tim | last=Treanor | date=18 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-lawj\">{{cite web | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446381186 | title=High Court Justices, Legal Luminaries Debate Shakespeare's 'Henry V' | last=Jones | first=Andy | website=[[National Law Journal]] | date=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|AGINCOURT.hto3.jpg|1100px|Battlefield today|left}}\n\n==Azincourt today==\n[[File:Agincourt Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Agincourt Memorial]]\n[[File:Agincourt archers memorial.jpg|thumb|A list of English archers killed at Azincourt, as recorded in the village's museum]]\nThere is a modern museum in Azincourt village dedicated to the battle.<ref>[http://illucolor.fr/7_vallees_comm/Azincourt/index.html Agincourt Museum]</ref> The museum lists the names of combatants of both sides who died in the battle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[V sign]], for more on the \"two-finger salute\" which legends claim derives from the gestures of longbowmen fighting in the English army at the battle of Agincourt.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=y}}\n* {{cite book |last=Adams |first=Michael C. |year=2002 |title=Echoes of War: A Thousand Years of Military History in Popular Culture |url = https://books.google.com/?id=dDqWvwezm0YC&printsec=frontcover |publisher=University of Kentucky Press |isbn=978-0-8131-2240-3 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Barker |date=2015 |first=Juliet |title=Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle |trans-title=''US title:'' Agincourt: Henry V and the Battle that Made England |edition=revised and updated |publisher=Abacus |place=London |origyear=2005 |isbn=978-0-349-11918-2 |url={{googlebooks|QDVTKcmqHjcC|plainurl=y}} |authorlink=Juliet Barker |ref=harv}}\n<!-- Book not cited in text* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=M. |authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian) |date=23 May 1991 |title=Agincourt 1415: Triumph against the odds |url= |series=Campaign |volume=9 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-85532-132-8 |ref=harv }}-->\n* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=M. |authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian) |year=1994 |chapter=The Development of Battle Tactics in the Hundred Years War |chapterurl = http://concours.histegeo.org/Battle_Tactics.pdf |editor=Anne Curry |editorlink=Anne Curry |editor2=Michael L.

It took place on 25 October 1415 ([[Saint Crispin's Day]]) near [[Azincourt]], in northern France.{{efn|Dates in the fifteenth century are difficult to reconcile with modern calendars: see {{harvnb|Barker|2015|pp=226\u2013228}} for the way the date of the battle was established.}} England's unexpected victory against the numerically superior French army boosted English morale and prestige, crippled France, and started a new period of English dominance in the war.\n\nAfter several decades of relative peace, the English had [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|renewed their war effort]] in 1415 amid the failure of negotiations with the French. In the ensuing campaign, many soldiers died from disease, and the English numbers dwindled; they tried to withdraw to [[Pale of Calais|English-held Calais]] but found their path blocked by a considerably larger French army. Despite the disadvantage, the following battle ended in an overwhelming tactical victory for the English.\n\nKing [[Henry V of England]] led his troops into battle and participated in hand-to-hand fighting. King [[Charles VI of France]] did not command the French army himself, as he suffered from psychotic illnesses and associated mental incapacity. Instead, the French were commanded by [[Grand Constable of France|Constable]] [[Charles I of Albret|Charles d'Albret]] and various prominent French noblemen of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac party]].  This battle is notable for the use of the [[English longbow]] in very large numbers, with the English and [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages|Welsh]] archers comprising nearly 80 percent of Henry's army.\n\nAgincourt is one of England's most celebrated victories and was one of the most important English triumphs in the Hundred Years' War, along with the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356). It forms the centrepiece of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599.\n\n==Contemporary accounts==\nThe Battle of Agincourt is well documented by at least seven contemporary accounts, three from eyewitnesses. The approximate location of the battle has never been disputed, and the site remains relatively unaltered after 600 years. \n\nImmediately after the battle, Henry summoned the [[herald]]s of the two armies who had watched the battle together with principal French herald Montjoie, and they settled on the name of the battle as ''Azincourt'', after the nearest fortified place.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=86}} Two of the most frequently cited accounts come from [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources, one from [[Jean Le F\u00e8vre de Saint-Remy]] who was present at the battle, and the other from [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]. The English eyewitness account comes from the anonymous ''Gesta Henrici Quinti'', believed to have been written by a [[chaplain]] in the King's household who would have been in the [[Wagon train|baggage train]] at the battle.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=22\u201326}} A recent re-appraisal of Henry's strategy of the Agincourt campaign incorporates these three accounts and argues that war was seen as a legal [[due process]] for solving the disagreement over claims to the French throne.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Honig|first1=Jan Willem|title=Reappraising Late Medieval Strategy: The Example of the 1415 Agincourt Campaign|journal=War in History|date=2012|volume=19|issue=123|pages=123\u2013151|doi=10.1177/0968344511432975}} {{pn|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n{{Main article|Hundred Years' War}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather [[Edward III of England]], although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on [[Aquitaine]] and other French lands (the terms of the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]]).{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=14}} He initially called a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the ensuing negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of [[John II of France|John II]] (who had been captured at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of [[Anjou]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Normandy]], and [[Touraine]], as well as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. Henry would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]'s young daughter, and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. \n\nThe French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415, negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=67\u201369}} In December 1414, the English [[Parliament of England|parliament]] was persuaded to grant Henry a \"double subsidy\", a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French.

The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease. Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through [[Normandy]] to the port of [[Calais]], the English stronghold in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim.{{sfn|Hibbert|1971|p=67}} He also intended the manoeuvre as a deliberate provocation to battle aimed at [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|the dauphin]], who had failed to respond to Henry's personal challenge to combat at Harfleur.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=221}}\n\nDuring the siege, the French had raised an army which assembled around [[Rouen]]. This was not strictly a [[feudal]] army, but an army paid through a system similar to that of the English.

By 24 October, both armies faced each other for battle, but the French declined, hoping for the arrival of more troops. The two armies spent the night of 24 October on open ground. The next day the French initiated negotiations as a delaying tactic, but Henry ordered his army to advance and to start a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid, or to fight defensively: that was how [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and the other famous longbow victories had been won. The English had very little food, had marched {{convert|260|mi}} in two and a half weeks, were suffering from sickness such as [[dysentery]], and were greatly outnumbered by well-equipped French men-at-arms.

It may be in the narrow strip of open land formed between the woods of [[Tramecourt]] and Azincourt (close to the modern village of [[Azincourt]]).

The army was divided into three battalions, with the right wing led by [[Edward, Duke of York]], the centre led by the king himself, and the left wing under the old and experienced Baron [[Thomas Camoys, Baron Camoys|Thomas Camoys]]. The archers were commanded by Sir [[Thomas Erpingham]], another elderly veteran.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=454}} It is likely that the English adopted their usual battle line of longbowmen on either flank, with men-at-arms and knights in the centre. They might also have deployed some archers in the centre of the line. The English men-at-arms in plate and mail were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English and Welsh archers on the flanks drove pointed wooden [[archer's stake|stakes]], or palings, into the ground at an angle to force [[cavalry]] to veer off. This use of stakes could have been inspired by the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] of 1396, where forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] used the tactic against French cavalry.{{efn|The first known use of angled stakes to thwart a mounted charge was at the Battle of Nicopolis, an engagement between European states and Turkish forces in 1396, twenty years before Agincourt. French knights, charging uphill, were unseated from their horses, either because their mounts were injured on the stakes or because they dismounted to uproot the obstacles, and were overpowered. News of the contrivance circulated within Europe and was described in a book of tactics written in 1411 by [[Jean le Maingre|Boucicault]], Marshal of France.{{sfn|Bennett|1994|pp=7, 15\u201316}} }}\n\nThe English made their [[Sacrament of Penance|confessions]] before the battle, as was customary.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=166}} Henry, worried about the enemy launching surprise raids, and wanting his troops to remain focused, ordered all his men to spend the night before the battle in silence, on pain of having an ear cut off. He told his men that he would rather die in the coming battle than be captured and [[ransom]]ed.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=269\u2013270}}\n\nHenry made a speech emphasising the justness of his cause, and reminding his army of previous great defeats the kings of England had inflicted on the French. The [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources have him concluding the speech by telling his men that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so that he could never draw a longbow again. Whether this was true is open to question; death was the normal fate of any soldier who could not be ransomed.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=286}}\n\n===French deployment===\nThe French army had 10,000 men-at arms{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=57\u201359}}{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=429, 565}}{{sfn|Sumption|2015|pp=452\u2013453}} plus some 4,000\u20135,000 miscellaneous footmen (''gens de trait'') including archers, crossbowmen{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=422, 565}} (''arbal\u00e9triers'') and shield-bearers (''pavisiers''), totaling 14,000\u201315,000 men.

The recently ploughed land hemmed in by dense woodland favoured the English, both because of its narrowness, and because of the thick mud through which the French knights had to walk.{{sfn|Wason|2004|p=74}}{{sfn|Holmes|1996|p=48}}\n\nAccounts of the battle describe the French engaging the English men-at-arms before being rushed from the sides by the longbowmen as the [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed. The English account in the ''Gesta Henrici'' says: \"For when some of them, killed when battle was first joined, fall at the front, so great was the undisciplined violence and pressure of the mass of men behind them that the living fell on top of the dead, and others falling on top of the living were killed as well.\"{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\n\nAlthough the French initially pushed the English back, they became so closely packed that they were described as having trouble using their weapons properly. The French monk of St. Denis says: \"Their vanguard, composed of about 5,000 men, found itself at first so tightly packed that those who were in the third rank could scarcely use their swords,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=107}}.</ref> and the Burgundian sources have a similar passage.\n\nRecent heavy rain made the battle field very muddy, proving very tiring to walk through in full [[plate armour]]. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as \"marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy\". The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the m\u00eal\u00e9e. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=303}}\n\n==Fighting==\n===Opening moves===\n[[File:Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25th October 1415.PNG|thumb|''Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25 October 1415'', painted by Sir [[John Gilbert (painter)|John Gilbert]] in the 19th century]]\nOn the morning of 25 October, the French were still waiting for additional troops to arrive. The [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (about 2,000 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} the [[Louis II of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]] (about 600 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} and the [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] (6,000 men, according to Monstrelet),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=416}} were all marching to join the army.\n\nFor three hours after sunrise there was no fighting. Military textbooks of the time stated: \"Everywhere and on all occasions that foot soldiers march against their enemy face to face, those who march lose and those who remain standing still and holding firm win.\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=290}} On top of this, the French were expecting thousands of men to join them if they waited. They were blocking Henry's retreat, and were perfectly happy to wait for as long as it took. There had even been a suggestion that the English would run away rather than give battle when they saw that they would be fighting so many French princes.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=291}}\n\nHenry's men were already very weary from hunger, illness and retreat. Apparently Henry believed his fleeing army would perform better on the defensive, but had to halt the retreat and somehow engage the French\nbefore a defensive battle was possible.\n{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436\u2013437}} This entailed abandoning his chosen position and pulling out, advancing, and then re-installing the long sharpened wooden stakes pointed outwards toward the enemy, which helped protect the longbowmen from cavalry charges.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=90\u201391}} (The use of stakes was an innovation for the English: during the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], for example, the archers had been instead protected by pits and other obstacles.{{sfn|Bennett|1994}})\n\nThe tightness of the terrain also seems to have restricted the planned deployment of the French forces. The French had originally drawn up a battle plan that had archers and crossbowmen in front of their men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to \"fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them,\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=275}} but in the event, the French archers and crossbowmen were deployed ''behind'' and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle). The cavalry force, which could have devastated the English line if it had attacked while they moved their stakes, charged only ''after'' the initial volley of arrows from the English. It is unclear whether the delay occurred because the French were hoping the English would launch a frontal assault (and were surprised when the English instead started shooting from their new defensive position), or whether the French mounted knights instead did not react quickly enough to the English advance. French chroniclers agree that when the mounted charge did come, it did not contain as many men as it should have; Gilles le Bouvier states that some had wandered off to warm themselves and others were walking or feeding their horses.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=294}}\n\n===French cavalry attack===\nThe French cavalry, despite being disorganised and not at full numbers, charged towards the longbowmen, but it was a disaster, with the French knights unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the forest of sharpened stakes that protected the archers. [[John Keegan]] argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle at this point was injuries to horses: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation, long-range shots used as the charge started.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=92\u201396}} The mounted charge and subsequent retreat churned up the already muddy terrain between the French and the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk of [[Saint Denis Basilica|St. Denis]] who reports how the wounded and panicking horses galloped through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight from the battlefield.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=297}}\n\n===Main French assault===\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415, by Sir John Gilbert in the 19th century.]]\nThe plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 1,000 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as \"a terrifying hail of arrow shot\". A complete coat of plate was considered such good protection that shields were generally not used,{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=109}} although the Burgundian contemporary sources distinguish between Frenchmen who used shields and those who did not, and Rogers has suggested that the front elements of the French force used axes and shields.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=90}} Modern historians are divided on how effective the longbows would have been against plate armour of the time. Modern test and contemporary accounts conclude that arrows could not penetrate the better quality steel armour, which became available to knights and men-at-arms of fairly modest means by the middle of the 14th century, but could penetrate the poorer quality [[wrought iron]] armour<ref>Nicolle, D.

Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yewwhjUYEPQ</ref>. Rogers suggested that the longbow could penetrate a wrought iron breastplate at short range and penetrate the thinner armour on the limbs even at {{convert|220|yd}}. He considered a knight in the best-quality steel armour invulnerable to an arrow on the breastplate or top of the helmet, but vulnerable to shots hitting the limbs, particularly at close range.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=110\u2013113}} In any case, to protect themselves as much as possible from the arrows, the French had to lower their visors and bend their helmeted heads to avoid being shot in the face, as the eye- and air-holes in their helmets were among the weakest points in the armour. This head-lowered position restricted their breathing and their vision. Then they had to walk a few hundred yards (metres) through thick mud and a press of comrades while wearing armour weighing {{convert|50|\u2013|60|lb}}, gathering sticky clay all the way. Increasingly, they had to walk around or over fallen comrades.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=301}}\n\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 57.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII. The battle of Azincourt 1415.]]\nThe surviving French men-at-arms reached the front of the English line and pushed it back, with the longbowmen on the flanks continuing to shoot at point-blank range. When the archers ran out of arrows, they dropped their bows and using [[hatchet]]s, [[sword]]s and the [[mallet]]s they had used to drive their stakes in, attacked the now disordered, fatigued and wounded French men-at-arms massed in front of them. The French could not cope with the thousands of lightly armoured longbowmen assailants (who were much less hindered by the mud and weight of their armour) combined with the English men-at-arms.

As the [[Melee|m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed, the French second line also joined the attack, but they too were swallowed up, with the narrow terrain meaning the extra numbers could not be used effectively. Rogers suggested that the French at the back of their deep formation would have been attempting to literally add their weight to the advance, without realising that they were hindering the ability of those at the front to manoeuvre and fight by pushing them into the English formation of lancepoints. After the initial wave, the French would have had to fight over and on the bodies of those who had fallen before them. In such a \"press\" of thousands of men, Rogers suggested that many could have suffocated in their armour, as was described by several sources, and which was also known to have happened in other battles.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=95\u201398}}\n\nThe French men-at-arms were taken prisoner or killed in the thousands. The fighting lasted about three hours, but eventually the leaders of the second line were killed or captured, as those of the first line had been. The English ''Gesta Henrici'' described three great heaps of the slain around the three main English standards.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\nAccording to contemporary English accounts, Henry fought hand to hand. Upon hearing that his youngest brother [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] had been wounded in the groin, Henry took his household guard and stood over his brother, in the front rank of the fighting, until Humphrey could be dragged to safety. The king received an axe blow to the head, which knocked off a piece of the crown that formed part of his helmet.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=443}}\n\n===Attack on the English baggage train===\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt.jpg|thumb|upright|1915 depiction of Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt : The King wears on this surcoat the Royal Arms of England, quartered with the Fleur de Lys of France as a symbol of his claim to the throne of France.]]\nThe only French success was an attack on the lightly protected English baggage train, with Ysembart d'Azincourt (leading a small number of men-at-arms and [[Squire|varlets]] plus about 600 peasants) seizing some of Henry's personal treasures, including a crown.{{sfn|Curry|2006|pp=207\u2013209}} Whether this was part of a deliberate French plan or an act of local [[brigandage]] is unclear from the sources. Certainly, d'Azincourt was a local knight but he might have been chosen to lead the attack because of his local knowledge and the lack of availability of a more senior soldier.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=311}} In some accounts the attack happened towards the end of the battle, and led the English to think they were being attacked from the rear. Barker, following the ''Gesta Henrici'', believed to have been written by an English chaplain who was actually in the baggage train, concluded that the attack happened at the ''start'' of the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=311}}\n\n===Henry executes the prisoners===\nRegardless of when the baggage assault happened, at some point after the initial English victory, Henry became alarmed that the French were regrouping for another attack. The ''Gesta Henrici'' places this after the English had overcome the onslaught of the French men-at-arms and the weary English troops were eyeing the French rearguard (\"in incomparable number and still fresh\").{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}} Le F\u00e8vre and Wavrin similarly say that it was signs of the French rearguard regrouping and \"marching forward in battle order\" which made the English think they were still in danger.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=163}} A slaughter of the French prisoners ensued. It seems it was purely a decision of Henry, since the English knights found it contrary to [[chivalry]], and contrary to their interests to kill valuable hostages for whom it was commonplace to ask [[ransom]]. Henry threatened to hang whoever did not obey his orders.\n\nIn any event, Henry ordered the slaughter of what were perhaps several thousand French prisoners, sparing only the highest ranked (presumably those most likely to fetch a large ransom under the chivalric system of warfare). According to most chroniclers, Henry's fear was that the prisoners (who, in an unusual turn of events, actually outnumbered their captors) would realise their advantage in numbers, rearm themselves with the weapons strewn about the field and overwhelm the exhausted English forces. Contemporary chroniclers did not criticise him for it.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=305\u2013308}} In his study of the battle [[John Keegan]] argued that the main aim was not to actually kill the French knights but rather to terrorise them into submission and quell any possibility they might resume the fight, which would probably have caused the uncommitted French reserve forces to join the fray, as well.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=107\u2013112}} Such an event would have posed a risk to the still-outnumbered English and could have easily turned a stunning victory into a mutually destructive defeat, as the English forces were now largely intermingled with the French and would have suffered grievously from the arrows of their own longbowmen had they needed to resume shooting. Keegan also speculated that due to the relatively low number of archers actually involved in killing the French knights (roughly 200 by his estimate), together with the refusal of the English knights to assist in a duty they saw as distastefully unchivalrous, and combined with the sheer difficulty of killing such a large number of prisoners in such a short space of time, the actual number of French prisoners put to death may not have been substantial before the French reserves fled the field and Henry rescinded the order.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=112}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe French had suffered a catastrophic defeat.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} In all, around 6,000 of their fighting men lay dead on the ground.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 121, 127}}{{sfn|Curry|2005|pp=187, 192, 233, 248}}{{sfn|Sumption|2015|pp=459, 461}} The list of casualties, one historian has noted, \"read like a roll call of the military and political leaders of the past generation\".{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} Among them were 90\u2013120 great lords and [[Knight banneret|banneret]]s killed, including{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 53, 93, 168, 169}} three dukes ([[John I, Duke of Alen\u00e7on|Alen\u00e7on]], [[Edward III of Bar|Bar]] and [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Brabant]]), nine counts ([[Henry II, Count of Bl\u00e2mont|Bl\u00e2mont]], [[Charles I of Albret|Dreux]], Fauquembergue, [[Edward II, Count of Grandpr\u00e9|Grandpr\u00e9]], [[Robert of Bar, Count of Marle|Marle]], [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Nevers]], [[John VI, Count of Roucy|Roucy]], Vaucourt, [[Frederick of Lorraine, Count of Vaud\u00e9mont|Vaud\u00e9mont]]) and one viscount ([[John of Bar|Puisaye]]), also an archbishop.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=325}} Of the great royal office holders, France lost its constable (Albret), an [[admiral of France|admiral]] (the [[Jacques de Ch\u00e2tillon de Dampierre|lord of Dampierre]]), the [[Master of Crossbowmen]] ([[David de Rambures]], dead along with three sons), Master of the Royal Household (Guichard Dauphin) and ''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t'' of the marshals.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=xxii, 325, 327}} According to the heralds, 3,069 knights and squires were killed,{{efn|As reported by [[Thomas Walsingham]].{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=53}} Other sources agree closely, citing 4,000 dead in this group.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=131, 182}} Reportedly 1,500 knights died.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 93}} }} while at least 2,600 more corpses were found without coats of arms to identify them.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} Entire noble families were wiped out in the male line, and in some regions an entire generation of landed nobility was annihilated.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=460}} The [[Bailiff (France)|bailiffs]] of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle \"cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Ponthieu]], [[Normandy]], [[Picardy]].\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=326\u2013327}}\n\nEstimates of the number of prisoners vary between 700 and 2,200, amongst them the dukes of [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[John I of Bourbon|Bourbon]], the counts of [[Charles of Artois, Count of Eu|Eu]], [[Louis, Count of Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me]], [[Arthur de Richemont|Richemont]] (brother of the [[John V, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] and stepbrother of Henry V) and [[John VII of Harcourt|Harcourt]], and marshal [[Jean Le Maingre]].{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=337, 367, 368}} Record evidence identifies at least 112 Englishmen killed in the fighting,{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=324}} while [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet|Monstrelet]] reported 600 English dead.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} These included the [[Edward, 2nd Duke of York|Duke of York]], the young [[Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]] and the Welsh esquire [[Dafydd Gam|Dafydd (\"Davy\") Gam]].\n\nAlthough the victory had been militarily decisive, its impact was complex. It did not lead to further English conquests immediately as Henry's priority was to return to England, which he did on 16 November, to be received in [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in London on the 23rd.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=475, 479}} Henry returned a conquering hero, seen as blessed by God in the eyes of his subjects and European powers outside France. It established the legitimacy of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian monarchy]] and the future campaigns of Henry to pursue his \"rights and privileges\" in France.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=547\u2013549}} Other benefits to the English were longer term. Very quickly after the battle, the fragile truce between the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] and [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundian]] factions broke down. The brunt of the battle had fallen on the Armagnacs and it was they who suffered the majority of senior casualties and carried the blame for the defeat. The Burgundians seized on the opportunity and within 10 days of the battle had mustered their armies and marched on Paris.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=358}} This lack of unity in France allowed Henry eighteen months to prepare militarily and politically for a renewed campaign. When that campaign took place, it was made easier by the damage done to the political and military structures of Normandy by the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=385}}\n\n==Numbers at Agincourt==\n[[Anne Curry]] in her 2005 book ''Agincourt: A New History'', argues (based on research into the surviving administrative records) that the French army was about 12,000 strong, and the English army about 9,000, giving proportions of four to three.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=192}} By contrast, [[Juliet Barker]] in her book ''Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle'' (also published in 2005) argues the English and Welsh were outnumbered \"at least four to one and possibly as much as six to one\".{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=x}} She suggests figures of about 6,000 for the English and 36,000 for the French, based on the ''Gesta Henrici''{{'}}s figures of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms for the English, and [[Jean de Wavrin]]'s statement \"that the French were six times more numerous than the English\".{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=274}} The 2009 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' uses the figures of about 6,000 for the English and 20,000 to 30,000 for the French. The 1911 ''Britannica'' use somewhat different figures of 6,000 archers, 1,000 men-at-arms and \"a few thousands of other foot\" for the English, with the French outnumbering them by \"at least four times\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=375}}\n\nWhile not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, states the French probably had 12,000\u201315,000 troops.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}} Ian Mortimer, in his 2009 book ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', notes how Curry \"minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)\", but agrees that previous estimates have exaggerated the odds, and suggests that \"the most extreme imbalance which is credible is fifteen thousand French troops against 8,100 English: a ratio of about two-to-one\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=566}}\n\nHowever, Clifford J. Rogers, professor of history at the United States Military Academy at West Point, has recently argued that archival records are too incomplete to substantially change his view that the English were outnumbered about 4\u20131.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}}{{sfn|Rogers|2008a|pp=114\u2013121}} Juliet Barker also disagrees with Curry's arguments in the acknowledgements section of her 2005 book on Agincourt, saying: \"Surviving administrative records on both sides, but especially the French, are simply too incomplete to support [Curry's] assertion that nine thousand English were pitted against an army only twelve thousand strong. And if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries.\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=xvi}}\n\nThose supporting a greater imbalance have generally put more store by contemporary (and especially eyewitness) accounts. The ''Gesta Henrici'' gives plausible figures for the English of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms, but Mortimer notes it is \"wildly inaccurate\" in stating the English were outnumbered 30\u20131, and there have also been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. The proportions also seem incorrect, as from surviving records we know that Henry set out with about four times as many archers as men-at-arms, not five and a half times as many. Those who have supported the Gesta figures for the English army have generally thought that although the English army may have left Harfleur with eight or nine thousand men, it is plausible that after weeks of campaigning and disease in hostile territory they would have lost two or three thousand fighting men; however Mortimer states: \"Despite the trials of the march, Henry had lost very few men to illness or death; and we have independent testimony that no more than 160 had been captured on the way.\"{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}}\n\nAs Mortimer notes, the Burgundian numbers for the size of the French vanguard of 8,000 men-at-arms in the vanguard with 1,400 (or 2,400) men-at-arms in the wings correspond roughly with the figures of ten thousand men-at-arms recorded by the duke of Berry's herald. The Burgundians also recorded 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the \"vanguard\", which would suggest \"fourteen or fifteen thousand fighting men\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}} The Burgundians actually give the total size of the French army as an implausible 50,000,{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} and the numbers they use do not correspond closely to the odds they describe. Using very similar numbers, Jean Le Fevre states that the English were outnumbered 3\u20131, whereas Wavrin states that the English were outnumbered 6\u20131.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=157}}\n\nOne particular cause of confusion may have been the number of servants on both sides. Mortimer suggests that because there were a much higher proportion of men-at-arms on the French side, the number of non-combatants was much higher. Each man-at-arms could be expected to have a page, who would have ridden one of his spare horses. If the French army had an extra 10,000 mounted men (as opposed to only 1,500 extra for the English), then \"the English probably did see an army about three times the size of their own fighting force\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\nIt is open to debate whether these should all be counted as non-combatants; Rogers (for example) accepts that the French probably had about 10,000 men-at-arms, but explicitly includes one \"gros valet\" (an armed, armoured and mounted military servant) per French man-at-arms in his calculation of the odds.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n==Popular representations==\n[[File:Agincourtcarol.jpg|thumb|The 15th century [[Agincourt Carol]]]]\nThe battle remains an important symbol in popular culture. Some notable examples are listed below.\n===Music===\nSoon after the  victory at Agincourt, a number of popular folk songs were created about the battle, the most famous being the \"[[Agincourt Carol]]\", produced in the first half of the 15th century.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=280\u2013283}} Other ballads followed, including \"[[King Henry Fifth's Conquest of France]]\", raising the popular prominence of particular events mentioned only in passing by the original chroniclers, such as the gift of tennis balls before the campaign.{{sfn|Woolf|2003|p=323}}\n\n===Literature===\nThe most famous cultural depiction of the battle today is [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599. The play focuses on the pressures of kingship, the tensions between how a king should ''appear'' \u2013 chivalric, honest, and just \u2013 and how a king must sometimes ''act'' \u2013 [[Machiavelli]]an and ruthless.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=15}} Shakespeare illustrates these tensions by depicting Henry's decision to kill some of the French prisoners, whilst attempting to justify it and distance himself from the event. This moment of the battle is portrayed both as a break with the traditions of chivalry and as key example of the paradox of kingship.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nShakespeare's depiction of the battle also plays on the theme of modernity. He contrasts the modern, English king and his army with the medieval, chivalric, older model of the French.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=20}}\n\nShakespeare's play presented Henry as leading a truly English force into battle, playing on the importance of the link between the monarch and the common soldiers in the fight.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=16}} The original play does not, however, feature any scenes of the actual battle itself, leading critic Rose Zimbardo to characterise it as \"full of warfare, yet empty of conflict.\"{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=193}}\n\nThe play introduced the famous [[St Crispin's Day Speech]], considered one of Shakespeare's most heroic speeches, which Henry delivers movingly to his soldiers just before the battle, urging his \"band of brothers\" to stand together in the forthcoming fight.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}} Critic David Margolies describes how it \"oozes honour, military glory, love of country and self-sacrifice\", and forms one of the first instances of English literature linking solidarity and comradeship to success in battle.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}}{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=31}} Partially as a result, the battle was used as a metaphor at the beginning of the [[First World War]], when the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s attempts to stop the German advances were widely likened to it.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=183}}\n\n===Films===\nShakespeare's version of the battle of Agincourt has been turned into several minor and two major films. The latter, each titled ''Henry V'', star [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] in [[Henry V (1989 film)|1989]]. Made just prior to the invasion of Normandy, Olivier's rendition gives the battle what Sarah Hatchuel has termed an \"exhilarating and heroic\" tone, with an artificial, cinematic look to the battle scenes.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|pp=194\u2013195}} Branagh's version gives a longer, more [[Realism (arts)|realist]] portrayal of the battle itself, drawing on both historical sources and images from the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Falkland War]]s.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=195}} \n\nIn his 2007 film adaptation, director Peter Babakitis uses digital effects to exaggerate realist features during the battle scenes, producing a more ''[[Experimental film|avant-garde]]'' interpretation of the fighting at Agincourt.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=200}} The battle also forms a central component of the 2019 Netflix film [[The King (2019 film)|''The King'']] (2019).\n\n===Mock trial===\nIn March 2010, a mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the slaughter of the prisoners was held in Washington, D.C., drawing from both the historical record and Shakespeare's play. Participating as judges were Justices [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The trial ranged widely over whether there was just cause for war and not simply the prisoner issue. Although an audience vote was \"too close to call\", Henry was unanimously found guilty by the court on the basis of \"evolving standards of civil society\".<ref name=\"mock-trial-cspan\">{{cite web | url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/221111 | title=Judgment at Agincourt | date=16 March 2010 | website=[[C-SPAN]] }} link to video</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-cd\">{{cite web | url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2010/03/18/high-court-rules-for-french-at-agincourt/ | title=High Court Rules for French at Agincourt | website=DC Theater Scene | first=Tim | last=Treanor | date=18 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-lawj\">{{cite web | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446381186 | title=High Court Justices, Legal Luminaries Debate Shakespeare's 'Henry V' | last=Jones | first=Andy | website=[[National Law Journal]] | date=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|AGINCOURT.hto3.jpg|1100px|Battlefield today|left}}\n\n==Azincourt today==\n[[File:Agincourt Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Agincourt Memorial]]\n[[File:Agincourt archers memorial.jpg|thumb|A list of English archers killed at Azincourt, as recorded in the village's museum]]\nThere is a modern museum in Azincourt village dedicated to the battle.<ref>[http://illucolor.fr/7_vallees_comm/Azincourt/index.html Agincourt Museum]</ref> The museum lists the names of combatants of both sides who died in the battle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[V sign]], for more on the \"two-finger salute\" which legends claim derives from the gestures of longbowmen fighting in the English army at the battle of Agincourt.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=y}}\n* {{cite book |last=Adams |first=Michael C. |year=2002 |title=Echoes of War: A Thousand Years of Military History in Popular Culture |url = https://books.google.com/?id=dDqWvwezm0YC&printsec=frontcover |publisher=University of Kentucky Press |isbn=978-0-8131-2240-3 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Barker |date=2015 |first=Juliet |title=Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle |trans-title=''US title:'' Agincourt: Henry V and the Battle that Made England |edition=revised and updated |publisher=Abacus |place=London |origyear=2005 |isbn=978-0-349-11918-2 |url={{googlebooks|QDVTKcmqHjcC|plainurl=y}} |authorlink=Juliet Barker |ref=harv}}\n<!-- Book not cited in text* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=M. |authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian) |date=23 May 1991 |title=Agincourt 1415: Triumph against the odds |url= |series=Campaign |volume=9 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-85532-132-8 |ref=harv }}-->\n* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=M. |authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian) |year=1994 |chapter=The Development of Battle Tactics in the Hundred Years War |chapterurl = http://concours.histegeo.org/Battle_Tactics.pdf |editor=Anne Curry |editorlink=Anne Curry |editor2=Michael L.

First conceived during [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration]] as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person [[Project Mercury]], which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person [[Project Gemini]] conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the [[Apollo 11]] mission when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last, [[Apollo 17]], in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].\n\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] (pictured) walked on the [[Moon]] with [[Neil Armstrong]], on [[Apollo 11]], July 20\u201321, 1969.|alt=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|alt=|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', the iconic 1968 image from [[Apollo 8|Apollo{{nbsp}}8]] taken by astronaut [[William Anders]]]]\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three crewed missions in 1973\u201374, and the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]], a joint US-[[Soviet Union]] Earth-orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957\u20131969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and [[Apollo 11]] was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.\n\nOverall the Apollo program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its [[Johnson Space Center]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[human spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.\n\n==Background==\n===Origin and spacecraft feasibility studies===\n{{main|Apollo spacecraft feasibility study}}\n\nThe Apollo program was conceived during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]]. While the Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] could support only one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a [[space station]], [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar flight]]s, and eventual crewed [[Moon landing|lunar landing]]s.\n\nThe program was named after [[Apollo]], the Greek god of light, music, and the Sun, by [[NASA]] manager [[Abe Silverstein]], who later said, \"I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.\"<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 55</ref> Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt \"Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.\"<ref name=\"pressrelease\">{{cite press release |title=Release 69-36 |date=July 14, 1969 |publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]] |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/apollo_press_release.html |location=Cleveland, OH |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh L. Dryden]] announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of [[Space Task Group]] conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and reentry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by [[Maxime Faget]], to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.<ref name=\"chariots_feasibility\">[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 1.7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html \"Feasility Studies\"]. pp. 16-21</ref>\n\n===Political pressure builds===\n{{main|Space Race}}\n\nIn November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the [[Soviet Union]] in the fields of [[space exploration]] and [[missile defense]].

At a meeting of the US House [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science and Astronautics]] one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.<ref>[[#87th Congress|87th Congress 1961]]</ref> Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.<ref>[[#Sidey|Sidey 1963]], p. 114</ref>\n\n[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

Many engineers feared that rendezvous and docking, maneuvers which had not been attempted in [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]], would be nearly impossible in [[lunar orbit]]. LOR advocates including [[John Houbolt]] at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness\", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-4.html \"Early Reaction to LOR\"]. p. 71</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Nicholas E.

In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph Shea]], who became a champion of LOR.<ref name=\"hansen24\">[[#Hansen|Hansen 1999]], pp. 35-39</ref> The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.6: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-6.html \"Settling the Mode Issue\"]. pp. 81-83</ref>\n\nBut even after NASA reached internal agreement, it was far from smooth sailing.

Wiesner blurted out \"No, that's no good\" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm and issued a [[request for proposal]] to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, \"The [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] [as lifeboat]{{nbsp}}... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|SPS]].\"<ref>Letterman, p. 404 (James Lovell, \"Explosion on Apollo 13; April 1970: From the Earth to the Moon and Back\".

Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a ''command and service Module'' (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the ''Lunar Excursion Module'' (LEM, later shortened to ''Lunar Module'', LM, but still pronounced \"lem\") which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.<ref name=\"SummaryReport\" />\n\n===Command and service module===\n{{main|Apollo command and service module}}\n[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] in lunar orbit|alt=The cone-shaped command module, attached to the cylindrical service module, orbits the Moon with a panel removed, exposing the scientific instrument module]]\n\nThe [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.

Each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed, and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary; therefore letters were used instead of numbers. The '''A''' missions were uncrewed Saturn V validation; '''B''' was uncrewed LM validation using the Saturn IB; '''C''' was crewed CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB; '''D''' was the first crewed CSM/LM flight (this replaced AS-258, using a single Saturn V launch); '''E''' would be a higher Earth orbit CSM/LM flight; '''F''' would be the first lunar mission, testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing (a \"dress rehearsal\"); and '''G''' would be the first crewed landing. The list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to include '''H''' lunar landings, '''I''' for lunar orbital survey missions, and '''J''' for extended-stay lunar landings.<ref name=\"3Q1967\">[[#Ertel et al.|Ertel et al. 1978]], p. 157</ref>\n\nThe delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on human-rating the LM and Saturn{{nbsp}}V. Apollo{{nbsp}}4 (AS-501) was the first uncrewed flight of the Saturn{{nbsp}}V, carrying a Block{{nbsp}}I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.\n\n[[Apollo 5]] (AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second uncrewed test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be crewed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Low |first=George M. |authorlink=George Low |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M |editor-link=Edgar Cortright |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |date=1975 |publisher=Scientific and Technical Information Office, NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1623434 |lccn=75600071 |id=NASA SP-350 |chapter=Testing and Retesting To Get Ready For flight |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-4-6.html}}</ref>\n\nThis was followed on April 4, 1968, by [[Apollo 6]] (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo{{nbsp}}6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo{{nbsp}}6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn{{nbsp}}V ready to fly men, canceling a third uncrewed test.<ref>[[Apollo program#Brooks.2C et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 10.5: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html \"Apollo 6: Saturn V's Shaky Dress Rehearsal\"]</ref>\n\n===Crewed development missions===\n\n<imagemap>\nFile:Apollo manned development missions insignia.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Apollo crewed development mission patches.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.<ref name=\"KSC-Apollo_13\" /> Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch11-7.html \"Mission to Fra Mauro\"]. p. 199</ref>\n\nThe contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was [[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|revised for the extended missions]] to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 12-4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-4.html \"Changes for Extended Lunar Missions\"]. pp. 211-214</ref>\n\n====Mission cutbacks====\n{{main|Canceled Apollo missions}}\n\nAbout the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming [[Space Shuttle]]. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-2.html \"Cutbacks and Program Changes\"]. pp. 201-202</ref> The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the [[John F.

The Apollo Extension Series (''Apollo X'',) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter]] (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch4.htm|title=A Science Program for Manned Spaceflight|access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a [[Manned Venus Flyby|Venus fly-by mission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=j74hfnr889reqoinelc27u5877&action=dlattach;topic=34776.0;attach=584256;sess=0 |title=Manned Venus Flyby |date=February 1, 1967 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board.

First conceived during [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration]] as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person [[Project Mercury]], which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person [[Project Gemini]] conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the [[Apollo 11]] mission when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last, [[Apollo 17]], in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].\n\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] (pictured) walked on the [[Moon]] with [[Neil Armstrong]], on [[Apollo 11]], July 20\u201321, 1969.|alt=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|alt=|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', the iconic 1968 image from [[Apollo 8|Apollo{{nbsp}}8]] taken by astronaut [[William Anders]]]]\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three crewed missions in 1973\u201374, and the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]], a joint US-[[Soviet Union]] Earth-orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957\u20131969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and [[Apollo 11]] was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.\n\nOverall the Apollo program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its [[Johnson Space Center]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[human spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.\n\n==Background==\n===Origin and spacecraft feasibility studies===\n{{main|Apollo spacecraft feasibility study}}\n\nThe Apollo program was conceived during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]]. While the Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] could support only one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a [[space station]], [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar flight]]s, and eventual crewed [[Moon landing|lunar landing]]s.\n\nThe program was named after [[Apollo]], the Greek god of light, music, and the Sun, by [[NASA]] manager [[Abe Silverstein]], who later said, \"I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.\"<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 55</ref> Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt \"Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.\"<ref name=\"pressrelease\">{{cite press release |title=Release 69-36 |date=July 14, 1969 |publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]] |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/apollo_press_release.html |location=Cleveland, OH |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh L. Dryden]] announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of [[Space Task Group]] conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and reentry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by [[Maxime Faget]], to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.<ref name=\"chariots_feasibility\">[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 1.7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html \"Feasility Studies\"]. pp. 16-21</ref>\n\n===Political pressure builds===\n{{main|Space Race}}\n\nIn November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the [[Soviet Union]] in the fields of [[space exploration]] and [[missile defense]]. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the \"[[missile gap]]\" that he and many other senators felt had developed between the Soviet Union and the United States due to the inaction of President Eisenhower.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Christopher A. |last=Preble |title=\"Who Ever Believed in the 'Missile Gap'?\": John F.

Webb]] requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.<ref>[[#Beschloss|Beschloss 1997]], p. 55</ref>\n\nOn April 12, 1961, Soviet [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US House [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science and Astronautics]] one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.<ref>[[#87th Congress|87th Congress 1961]]</ref> Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.<ref>[[#Sidey|Sidey 1963]], p. 114</ref>\n\n[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

LOR advocates including [[John Houbolt]] at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness\", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-4.html \"Early Reaction to LOR\"]. p. 71</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Nicholas E.

Wiesner blurted out \"No, that's no good\" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm and issued a [[request for proposal]] to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, \"The [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] [as lifeboat]{{nbsp}}... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|SPS]].\"<ref>Letterman, p. 404 (James Lovell, \"Explosion on Apollo 13; April 1970: From the Earth to the Moon and Back\".

Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a ''command and service Module'' (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the ''Lunar Excursion Module'' (LEM, later shortened to ''Lunar Module'', LM, but still pronounced \"lem\") which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.<ref name=\"SummaryReport\" />\n\n===Command and service module===\n{{main|Apollo command and service module}}\n[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] in lunar orbit|alt=The cone-shaped command module, attached to the cylindrical service module, orbits the Moon with a panel removed, exposing the scientific instrument module]]\n\nThe [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.

The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.\n\n[[Apollo 5]] (AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage.

The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.<ref name=\"KSC-Apollo_13\" /> Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch11-7.html \"Mission to Fra Mauro\"]. p. 199</ref>\n\nThe contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was [[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|revised for the extended missions]] to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 12-4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-4.html \"Changes for Extended Lunar Missions\"]. pp. 211-214</ref>\n\n====Mission cutbacks====\n{{main|Canceled Apollo missions}}\n\nAbout the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming [[Space Shuttle]]. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-2.html \"Cutbacks and Program Changes\"]. pp. 201-202</ref> The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the [[John F.

The final fiscal year of Apollo funding was 1973.\n\n==Apollo Applications Program==\n{{main|Apollo Applications Program}}\n\nLooking beyond the crewed lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (''Apollo X'',) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter]] (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch4.htm|title=A Science Program for Manned Spaceflight|access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a [[Manned Venus Flyby|Venus fly-by mission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=j74hfnr889reqoinelc27u5877&action=dlattach;topic=34776.0;attach=584256;sess=0 |title=Manned Venus Flyby |date=February 1, 1967 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board.

The film is based on the [[1975 in music|1975]] [[country and western]] [[novelty song]] \"[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]\" by [[C. W. McCall]]. The film was made when the [[citizens band radio|CB radio]]/[[Trucking industry in popular culture (United States)|trucking]] craze was at its peak in the [[United States]], and followed the similarly themed films ''[[White Line Fever (film)|White Line Fever]]'' (1975) and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977). It was the most commercially successful film of Peckinpah's career.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Rubber Duck Metal-Ente.JPG|thumb|Replica of the hood ornament of Rubber Duck's truck]]\n\nIn the Arizona desert, [[truck driver]] Martin \"Rubber Duck\" Penwald is passed by a woman in a [[Jaguar XK-E]], which leads to an encounter with a state trooper. Proceeding on his way, Rubber Duck runs into fellow truck drivers Pig Pen/Love Machine and Spider Mike, when another \"trucker\" informs them over the C.B. that they are okay to increase their speed. The \"trucker\" turns out to be Sheriff \"Dirty Lyle\" Wallace, a long-time nemesis of the Duck, who extorts them for $70 each. \n\nThe truckers head on to Rafael's Glide-In where the Duck's sometime girlfriend, and Lyle's wife Violet, works as a waitress. Melissa, the driver of the XK-E, is also there; the car broke down and she had to sell it and some of her belongings in an effort to leave Arizona, as she's due in Dallas for a job. The Duck offers Melissa a ride; Violet is unimpressed and ushers him away to give him a special birthday present. While they're away, Wallace shows up at the Glide-In checking plates. Pig Pen and Spider Mike start making fun of Wallace over the diner's base-station [[CB radio]], leading to Wallace attempting to arrest Spider Mike for \"vagrancy\".\n\nThe Duck, having been warned by Widow Woman, enters and tries to smooth things over. But Lyle is determined and insults Mike, who is desperate to get home to his pregnant wife. Mike punches Wallace, leading to a brawl in the diner when some troopers arrive to assist Wallace. The assorted truckers prevail, and the Duck handcuffs Wallace to a bar stool. After pulling the spark plug wires and distributor caps out of the police cars, they all decide to head for the state line to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe truckers drive across [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], with Wallace in belated pursuit after he forces a local youth outside the diner to give up his vehicle when he finds him possessing drugs.  He catches up with Duck,  but matters are made worse when Melissa accidentally causes Duck to veer into the path of Wallace's vehicle, forcing him to crash through a billboard and into a ditch, only infuriating him further.   The initial police pursuit is foiled when Duck leads the truckers off the main highway and down a rough dusty desert trail, causing several of the police cars to crash.  Wallace in yet another vehicle, this time commandeered from one of the state troopers, is again thwarted when Pig Pen and Spider Mike crush his vehicle between their rigs while in motion. Additional independent truckers join them to form a mile-long [[convoy]] in support of the Rubber Duck's vendetta against the abusive Wallace. The truckers communicate with each other via [[CB radio]], and much CB jargon is sprinkled throughout the film. As the rebellious truckers evade and confront the police, Rubber Duck becomes a reluctant [[hero]].\n\nIt becomes apparent the truckers have a great deal of political support and the Governor of New Mexico, Jerry Haskins, meets Rubber Duck. At about the same time, Wallace and a brutal Alvarez, Texas, sheriff, arrest Spider Mike, who left the convoy to be with his wife after giving birth to their son. Wallace's plan is to use Mike as \"bait\" to trap Rubber Duck. A janitor at the jail, aware of the plan, messages by CB radio that Spider Mike has been wrongfully arrested and beaten. Various truckers relay the message to New Mexico.\n\nRubber Duck ends the meeting with Haskins and leaves to rescue Spider Mike. Several other truckers join him and head east to Texas. The truckers eventually destroy half of the town and the jail and rescue Spider Mike. Knowing they will now be hunted by the authorities, the truckers head for the border of [[Mexico]]. On the way, Rubber Duck gets separated from the rest of the convoy when the others get stopped by a traffic accident. The film culminates with a showdown near the [[United States-Mexico border]] where Rubber Duck is forced to face Wallace and a [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] unit stationed on a bridge. Firing a [[machine gun]], Wallace and the Guardsmen cause the truck's tanker trailer to explode, while Rubber Duck deliberately steers the tractor unit over the side of the bridge, plummeting into the churning river below, sending Duck presumably to his death.\n\nA public funeral is held for Rubber Duck, in which Haskins promises to work for the truckers by taking their case to [[Washington, D.C.]] Disgusted with the politics of the situation, Pig Pen abruptly leaves the funeral. A distraught Melissa is led to a school bus with several \"long-haired friends of Jesus\" inside. There she finds Rubber Duck in disguise sitting in the back. He asks, \"You ever seen a duck that couldn't swim?\" The convoy takes to the road with the coffin in tow, abruptly ending the politicians' speeches. As the bus passes Wallace, he spies the Duck and bursts into laughter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Martin 'Rubber Duck' Penwald\n* [[Ali MacGraw]] as Melissa\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Sheriff Lyle \"Cottonmouth\" Wallace of Natoosha County, Arizona\n* [[Burt Young]] as Bobby \"Love Machine\" \"Pig Pen\"\n* [[Madge Sinclair]] as Widow Woman\n* [[Franklyn Ajaye]] as Spider Mike\n* Brian Davies as Chuck Arnoldi\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Governor Jerry Haskins\n* [[Cassie Yates]] as Violet\n* Walter Kelley as Federal Agent Hamilton\n* [[Billy Hughes (actor)|Billy Hughes]] as Pack Rat\n* Jorge Russek as Texas Alvarez Sheriff Tiny Alvarez\n* [[Patrice Martinez]] as Maria\n* [[Donnie Fritts]] as Reverend Sloane\n* [[Tommy Bush]] as Chief Stacey Love\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Convoy'' was filmed almost entirely in the state of [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Internet Movie Database, Filming Locations for ''Convoy'' |work=IMDb.com |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077369/locations |accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> Production began in 1977 when the [[CB radio]]/trucking craze was at its peak, made during the same period as such films as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977), ''[[Handle with Care (1977 film)|Handle with Care]]'' (1977), ''[[Breaker!

According to the book ''If They Move&nbsp;... Kill 'Em!: The Life and Times of Sam Peckinpah'' by [[David Weddle]] and the ''Convoy'' documentary ''Passion & Poetry: Sam's Trucker Movie'', Peckinpah's rough cut did not have any musical score other than the title song and \"Blow The Gates To Heaven\" by Richard Gillis (who had previously worked with Peckinpah on ''[[The Ballad of Cable Hogue]]''). [[Jerry Fielding]], who composed music for many of Peckinpah's previous films, was also hired to do the score for ''Convoy''.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this whole paragraph and the following paragraph added at rev ID 813133048 (a dubious revision)|date=February 2018}}<!-- This paragraph and the paragraph after it were added at rev ID 813133048.

Peckinpah essentially disowned the released version. Garner Simmons, author of ''Peckinpah: A Portrait in Montage'', said that EMI and Clifford's version of ''Convoy'' \"cut the guts out of it\".<ref>If They Move . . .

The film is based on the [[1975 in music|1975]] [[country and western]] [[novelty song]] \"[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]\" by [[C. W. McCall]]. The film was made when the [[citizens band radio|CB radio]]/[[Trucking industry in popular culture (United States)|trucking]] craze was at its peak in the [[United States]], and followed the similarly themed films ''[[White Line Fever (film)|White Line Fever]]'' (1975) and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977). It was the most commercially successful film of Peckinpah's career.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Rubber Duck Metal-Ente.JPG|thumb|Replica of the hood ornament of Rubber Duck's truck]]\n\nIn the Arizona desert, [[truck driver]] Martin \"Rubber Duck\" Penwald is passed by a woman in a [[Jaguar XK-E]], which leads to an encounter with a state trooper. Proceeding on his way, Rubber Duck runs into fellow truck drivers Pig Pen/Love Machine and Spider Mike, when another \"trucker\" informs them over the C.B. that they are okay to increase their speed. The \"trucker\" turns out to be Sheriff \"Dirty Lyle\" Wallace, a long-time nemesis of the Duck, who extorts them for $70 each. \n\nThe truckers head on to Rafael's Glide-In where the Duck's sometime girlfriend, and Lyle's wife Violet, works as a waitress. Melissa, the driver of the XK-E, is also there; the car broke down and she had to sell it and some of her belongings in an effort to leave Arizona, as she's due in Dallas for a job. The Duck offers Melissa a ride; Violet is unimpressed and ushers him away to give him a special birthday present. While they're away, Wallace shows up at the Glide-In checking plates. Pig Pen and Spider Mike start making fun of Wallace over the diner's base-station [[CB radio]], leading to Wallace attempting to arrest Spider Mike for \"vagrancy\".\n\nThe Duck, having been warned by Widow Woman, enters and tries to smooth things over. But Lyle is determined and insults Mike, who is desperate to get home to his pregnant wife. Mike punches Wallace, leading to a brawl in the diner when some troopers arrive to assist Wallace. The assorted truckers prevail, and the Duck handcuffs Wallace to a bar stool. After pulling the spark plug wires and distributor caps out of the police cars, they all decide to head for the state line to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe truckers drive across [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], with Wallace in belated pursuit after he forces a local youth outside the diner to give up his vehicle when he finds him possessing drugs.  He catches up with Duck,  but matters are made worse when Melissa accidentally causes Duck to veer into the path of Wallace's vehicle, forcing him to crash through a billboard and into a ditch, only infuriating him further.   The initial police pursuit is foiled when Duck leads the truckers off the main highway and down a rough dusty desert trail, causing several of the police cars to crash.  Wallace in yet another vehicle, this time commandeered from one of the state troopers, is again thwarted when Pig Pen and Spider Mike crush his vehicle between their rigs while in motion. Additional independent truckers join them to form a mile-long [[convoy]] in support of the Rubber Duck's vendetta against the abusive Wallace. The truckers communicate with each other via [[CB radio]], and much CB jargon is sprinkled throughout the film. As the rebellious truckers evade and confront the police, Rubber Duck becomes a reluctant [[hero]].\n\nIt becomes apparent the truckers have a great deal of political support and the Governor of New Mexico, Jerry Haskins, meets Rubber Duck. At about the same time, Wallace and a brutal Alvarez, Texas, sheriff, arrest Spider Mike, who left the convoy to be with his wife after giving birth to their son. Wallace's plan is to use Mike as \"bait\" to trap Rubber Duck. A janitor at the jail, aware of the plan, messages by CB radio that Spider Mike has been wrongfully arrested and beaten. Various truckers relay the message to New Mexico.\n\nRubber Duck ends the meeting with Haskins and leaves to rescue Spider Mike. Several other truckers join him and head east to Texas. The truckers eventually destroy half of the town and the jail and rescue Spider Mike. Knowing they will now be hunted by the authorities, the truckers head for the border of [[Mexico]]. On the way, Rubber Duck gets separated from the rest of the convoy when the others get stopped by a traffic accident. The film culminates with a showdown near the [[United States-Mexico border]] where Rubber Duck is forced to face Wallace and a [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] unit stationed on a bridge. Firing a [[machine gun]], Wallace and the Guardsmen cause the truck's tanker trailer to explode, while Rubber Duck deliberately steers the tractor unit over the side of the bridge, plummeting into the churning river below, sending Duck presumably to his death.\n\nA public funeral is held for Rubber Duck, in which Haskins promises to work for the truckers by taking their case to [[Washington, D.C.]] Disgusted with the politics of the situation, Pig Pen abruptly leaves the funeral. A distraught Melissa is led to a school bus with several \"long-haired friends of Jesus\" inside. There she finds Rubber Duck in disguise sitting in the back. He asks, \"You ever seen a duck that couldn't swim?\" The convoy takes to the road with the coffin in tow, abruptly ending the politicians' speeches. As the bus passes Wallace, he spies the Duck and bursts into laughter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Martin 'Rubber Duck' Penwald\n* [[Ali MacGraw]] as Melissa\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Sheriff Lyle \"Cottonmouth\" Wallace of Natoosha County, Arizona\n* [[Burt Young]] as Bobby \"Love Machine\" \"Pig Pen\"\n* [[Madge Sinclair]] as Widow Woman\n* [[Franklyn Ajaye]] as Spider Mike\n* Brian Davies as Chuck Arnoldi\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Governor Jerry Haskins\n* [[Cassie Yates]] as Violet\n* Walter Kelley as Federal Agent Hamilton\n* [[Billy Hughes (actor)|Billy Hughes]] as Pack Rat\n* Jorge Russek as Texas Alvarez Sheriff Tiny Alvarez\n* [[Patrice Martinez]] as Maria\n* [[Donnie Fritts]] as Reverend Sloane\n* [[Tommy Bush]] as Chief Stacey Love\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Convoy'' was filmed almost entirely in the state of [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Internet Movie Database, Filming Locations for ''Convoy'' |work=IMDb.com |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077369/locations |accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> Production began in 1977 when the [[CB radio]]/trucking craze was at its peak, made during the same period as such films as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977), ''[[Handle with Care (1977 film)|Handle with Care]]'' (1977), ''[[Breaker! Breaker!]]'' (1977) and ''[[High-Ballin']]'' (1978), as well as the television series ''[[Movin' On (TV series)|Movin' On]]'' (1974\u20131976) and ''[[B. J. and the Bear]]'' (1979\u20131981).\n\nDuring this period of Sam Peckinpah's life, it was reported he suffered from [[alcoholism]] and [[drug addiction]]. His four previous films, ''[[Cross of Iron]]'' (1977), ''[[The Killer Elite]]'' (1975), ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974), and ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973), had struggled at the box office and the director needed a genuine blockbuster success.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Weddle|authorlink= David Weddle| title=If They Move...Kill 'Em!| publisher=Grove Press |year = 1994|pages=514 | isbn= 0-8021-3776-8}}</ref> Unhappy with the screenplay written by B.W.L.

According to the book ''If They Move&nbsp;... Kill 'Em!: The Life and Times of Sam Peckinpah'' by [[David Weddle]] and the ''Convoy'' documentary ''Passion & Poetry: Sam's Trucker Movie'', Peckinpah's rough cut did not have any musical score other than the title song and \"Blow The Gates To Heaven\" by Richard Gillis (who had previously worked with Peckinpah on ''[[The Ballad of Cable Hogue]]''). [[Jerry Fielding]], who composed music for many of Peckinpah's previous films, was also hired to do the score for ''Convoy''.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this whole paragraph and the following paragraph added at rev ID 813133048 (a dubious revision)|date=February 2018}}<!-- This paragraph and the paragraph after it were added at rev ID 813133048.

Peckinpah essentially disowned the released version. Garner Simmons, author of ''Peckinpah: A Portrait in Montage'', said that EMI and Clifford's version of ''Convoy'' \"cut the guts out of it\".<ref>If They Move . . .

The organization made radical changes to survive, such as changing its ideology and setting new goals. During the 7th Party congress in January 2000, the former military wing the [[Peoples Liberation Army of Kurdistan]] (''Art\u00ea\u015fa Rizgariya G\u00eale Kurdistan'' -ARGK) was succeeded by the People's Defense Forces (''[[People's Defence Forces|Hezen Parastine G\u00eal]] -'' HPG) and also declared that it wanted to aim for a democratic solution for the conflict.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Paul|title=The PKK|date=2015|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=9781783600373|location=London|page=19}}</ref> At the same time, the PKK continued to recruit new members and sustain its fighting force.\n\nAccording to Paul White, in April 2002, the PKK changed its name to the ''Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress (KADEK)'' and proclaimed a commitment to nonviolent activities.<ref name=\":2\" /> A PKK/KADEK spokesman stated that its armed wing, the HPG, would not disband or surrender its weapons for reasons of self-defense. This statement by the PKK/KADEK avowing it would not lay down its arms underscores that the organization maintained its capability to carry out armed operations. PKK/KADEK established a new ruling council in April, its membership virtually identical to the PKK's Presidential Council. The PKK/KADEK did not conduct an armed attack in 2002; however, the group periodically issued veiled threats that it will resume violence if the conditions of its imprisoned leader are not improved and its forces are attacked by Turkish military, and it continued its military training like before.\n\nIn November 2003, another congress was held which lead to renaming itself as the ''People's Congress of Kurdistan'' or ''Kongra-Gel (KGK)''. The stated purpose of the organizational change was to leave behind nationalistic and state-building goals, in favor of creating a political structure to work within the existing nation-states.<ref name=\"PKK in the 2000s p149\">{{cite book|last1=Akkaya|first1=Ahmet Hamdi|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|editor1-last=Casier|editor1-first=Marlies|editor2-last=Jongerden|editor2-first=Joost|title=Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey: Political Islam, Kemalism and the Kurdish Issue|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136938672|page=149|chapter=The PKK in the 2000s: Continuity through Breaks?}}</ref> Through further internal conflict during this period, it is reported that 1500 militants left the organization,<ref name=\"PKK in the 2000s p149\"/> along with many of the leading reformists, including [[Nizamettin Ta\u015f]] and [[Abdullah \u00d6calan]]'s younger brother [[Osman \u00d6calan]]<ref name=\"Cemil Bayik\">[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4938 Leading PKK Commander Cemil Bayik Crosses into Iran], Jamestown.org, 20 May 2008</ref>\n\n===Second insurgency 2004\u20132006===\nKongra-Gel called off the cease-fire at the start of June 2004, saying Turkish security forces had refused to respect the truce.
