Kilmarnock initially defeated [[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]] 6\u20131 at Drumbiehill Park but a protest over a breach of registration rules was upheld and the result was declared void. The match was replayed and this time Hurlford won 3\u20131, however a similar protest by Kilmarnock was also upheld and Hurlford were disqualified from the competition. In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals. On 31 January 1885, Kilmarnock thumped [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]] 5\u20132 at [[Rugby Park]] to reach the final for the second consecutive season. They retained the cup after defeating Hurlford 2\u20130 in the final at Holm Quarry.\n\nThe two charity cups saw similar fates for Kilmarnock.

Hurlford won through with a 5\u20131 victory in the fifth match on 14 November 1885.\n\nA third successive Ayrshire Cup triumph began with an 8\u20131 win over [[Maybole F.C.

In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals.

He began painting in earnest while convalescing and, though he did at first return to bank work, he continued to paint and in 1951 he began exhibiting his work.\n\nIn 1955 O'Malley holidayed in [[St Ives, Cornwall]], then an important center of abstract art, and home to the artists [[Peter Lanyon]], [[Patrick Heron]], and [[Bryan Wynter]], who he met and worked with. He returned again in 1957 and in 1958 retired from the bank to paint full-time. Prompted by a mixture of frustration at the indifference shown in Ireland to his work, an attraction to the sense of freedom he felt among the artists in Cornwall, and an engagement with the attempt to represent natural forms current in their abstraction, he settled in St Ives in 1960. While he was strongly influenced by the St Ives artistic community, his relationship was one of engagement rather than direct participation. His painting never completely assimilated the rigour and formality of the British abstract painters; it retained a muscular extravagance which is central to his artistic identity. Speaking to John O'Regan in an interview reproduced in ''Works 14: Tony O'Malley'' he explained:\n:\"Not so much abstract as essence. I could not paint for the sake of the pigment of whatever, but I like abstract form in the painting which instills it with meaning and power. Abstraction does enable you to get under the surface, to get beyond appearance, and to express the mind. But abstraction for its own sake does not interest me.\"\n\nTony O'Malley adopted a sombre palette in the second half of the 1960s and many of his paintings are dedicated to the memory of his friend and mentor Peter Lanyon who was killed when the glider he was piloting crashed in 1964.\n\nIn 1973 O'Malley married Jane Harris, and through the mid 70s they spent time in the [[Bahamas]] and in O'Malley's native Callan. During this period, his paintings became less sombre and the Bahamas paintings are extremely colourful and vibrant. In 1990 they moved back to Ireland. In 1993 Tony O'Malley was elected a [[Saoi]] of [[Aosd\u00e1na]]. When he died in 2003 he was regarded as one of Ireland's leading painters. The [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] displayed a major retrospective of his work in 2005.\n\nIn 2010 under the guidance of Jane O'Malley the RHA established an artist's residency in the house where Tony O'Malley grew up in Callan, Co.

Unbeknownst to either, Tissaia and Stregobor were using Yennefer and Istredd respectively to spy on each other. Later, Yennefer witnesses Tissaia turning three students into eels to act as conduits powering Aretuza with magic. In 1240, Geralt is hired to investigate grain thefts in Posada and is followed by Jaskier the bard. They encounter a [[Silvanus (mythology)|Sylvan]] named Torque, who knocks them unconscious and takes them to his mountain cave. There, Geralt meets Filavandrel, the elven king and urges he lead his people to better lands after being banished by the humans. Instead of killing them, Filavandrel frees Geralt and Jaskier, taking the former's words to heart. In 1263, Cirilla encounters Dara, a boy in the woods, who guides her to a refugee camp.

While Yennefer has the chance to transform her body into her ideal image during graduation, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers discuss the allocation of their newly initiated to their respective kingdoms. But through Stregobor's scheme, Yennefer is assigned to Nilfgaard instead of her preferred Aedirn due to her elven blood. Realizing what happened, Yennefer angrily breaks up with Istredd, knowing only he could have told Stregobor about her blood. Having missed graduation, Yennefer undergoes the painful transformation to be beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Wearing her new body, Yennefer charms Aedirn's King Virfuril into taking her as advisor, sending Fringilla to Nilfgaard instead. In 1243, Geralt enters the kingdom of Temeria to investigate a monster, assisted by Triss Merigold, King Foltest's sorceress advisor. He identifies the monster as a [[Shtriga]], a creature born from a curse he later discovers was placed by the [[courtier]] Ostrit who learned about the [[incest|affair]] between Foltest and his sister, Princess Adda. Using Ostrit as bait, Geralt battles to contain the shtriga until dawn, which lifts the curse.

The assassin follows them through multiple portals, killing Kalis. Although Yennefer escapes with Kalis's newborn daughter, the baby dies from a thrown dagger. In 1249, Geralt accompanies Jaskier to the betrothal feast of Princess Pavetta, Queen Calanthe's daughter. Urcheon of Erlenwald (also named Duny) interrupts to demand Pavetta's hand through the Law of Surprise, having saved her father years earlier. Urcheon suffers from a curse that transformed him into a hedgehog/man creature. Despite Pavetta's acceptance, Calanthe refuses and a brawl ensues. When Calanthe tries killing Urcheon, Pavetta activates her power, unleashing a maelstrom until Geralt and Mousesack intervene. Wanting her daughter happy, Calanthe marries Duny and Pavetta, which lifts Duny's curse. Duny, thankful for Geralt's aid, insists he take a reward, so Geralt jokingly invokes the Law of Surprise for something Duny has but doesn't yet know. The crowd then immediately learns Pavetta is pregnant with Duny's child. In 1263, Nilfgaard's forces resume their pursuit of Cirilla with Mousesack as their prisoner. Meanwhile, Cirilla and Dara encounter Queen Eithne and her Dryads in Brokilon Forest, while Cahir and Fringilla track Ciri's location.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"A Question of Price\" from ''The Last Wish'', and \"Sword of Destiny\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bottled Appetites\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sneha Koorse\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Seven years after Pavetta's betrothal, in 1256, Geralt and Jaskier discover a [[Jinn|Djinn]] and accidentally release it. Initially, it seems that Jaskier is the Djinn's 'master' but then he falls seriously ill. Geralt seeks help from the nearest healer, the elf Chireadan, but as they need a mage to heal Jaskier, Chireadan reluctantly refers them to Yennefer. Although Yennefer cures Jaskier, her plan is to use him to capture the Djinn to grant her wish of regaining her fertility. As Jaskier uses his last wish, nothing happens and it's revealed that it is Geralt, not Jaskier, who actually has the wishes. Geralt realises the Djinn will kill Yennefer, so he uses his third and final wish to save her (but the wish itself is not revealed). The Djinn leaves. Now free and safe, Geralt and Yennefer act on their attraction and have sex. Yennefer asks what his third wish was, but Geralt does not answer as he has finally fallen asleep. In 1263, Cahir hires a doppler to assume the identity of Mousesack by copying his form and memories, then kills him.

Yennefer's knight joins the party along with a band of [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] and Reavers, professional monster hunters. After camping overnight, the party finds the knight dead and the Reavers have departed. The dwarves take their party to a mountain shortcut, but the bridge gives way. Borch's group sacrifices themselves rather than endanger the party. Geralt and Yennefer reconcile before reaching the dragon's den, but find it dead with T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a alive guarding the dragon's egg. Borch reveals himself as Vilentretenmerth, a golden dragon. The five of them defend the egg from the Reavers. Borch later pays off the dwarves with dragon teeth, and Geralt reveals to Yennefer his third wish bound their fates together. Believing her feelings for Geralt to be artificial, Yennefer declares that she can't be with him and leaves. Hurt, Geralt snaps at Jaskier, blaming him for all of his misfortunes and hopes that they never meet again. Dara grows suspicious over \"Mousesack\", so Ciri questions him and the doppler reveals himself. In the scuffle, Dara is knocked out as Ciri escapes, but is captured by Cahir. \"Ciri\" reveals itself as the Doppler and fights Cahir before escaping. Dara frees the real Ciri, but leaves her.

Having escaped from Cintra and searching for Ciri, the girl who is his destiny, Geralt encounters a merchant burying the bodies of dead refugees. He defends the man from undead monsters, but is wounded and loses consciousness. Ciri is awakened by the woman she met earlier and discovers the dead bodies of her harassers around her, killed in gruesome ways. The woman takes her to her farm. The Nilfgaardians launch their attack, with both sides utilizing magic and inflicting heavy casualties on each other. Tissaia attempts to talk down Fringilla, but Fringilla disables her. Vilgefortz fights Cahir, but loses and is thrown down a hill. Geralt wakes to find himself on the merchant's cart en route to the man's farm. When Vilgefortz wakes up, he kills a Northern sorcerer, revealing himself to be a turncoat. When Nilfgaardian soldiers begin to overrun the fort, Yennefer channels a massive stream of fire, then seemingly disappears. In his delirious state, Geralt dreams about his mother Visenna, who abandoned him as a child in order for him to be made into a witcher. He later arrives at the same farm, and upon hearing the woman talk to the man about Ciri, heads into the forest.

She is taken to Aretuza for training in magic, but finds difficulty in the practice. She makes a friendship with Istredd, even revealing her quarter-[[elf]] heritage, a cause of her deformity. Unbeknownst to either, Tissaia and Stregobor were using Yennefer and Istredd respectively to spy on each other. Later, Yennefer witnesses Tissaia turning three students into eels to act as conduits powering Aretuza with magic. In 1240, Geralt is hired to investigate grain thefts in Posada and is followed by Jaskier the bard. They encounter a [[Silvanus (mythology)|Sylvan]] named Torque, who knocks them unconscious and takes them to his mountain cave. There, Geralt meets Filavandrel, the elven king and urges he lead his people to better lands after being banished by the humans. Instead of killing them, Filavandrel frees Geralt and Jaskier, taking the former's words to heart. In 1263, Cirilla encounters Dara, a boy in the woods, who guides her to a refugee camp.

While Yennefer has the chance to transform her body into her ideal image during graduation, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers discuss the allocation of their newly initiated to their respective kingdoms. But through Stregobor's scheme, Yennefer is assigned to Nilfgaard instead of her preferred Aedirn due to her elven blood. Realizing what happened, Yennefer angrily breaks up with Istredd, knowing only he could have told Stregobor about her blood. Having missed graduation, Yennefer undergoes the painful transformation to be beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Wearing her new body, Yennefer charms Aedirn's King Virfuril into taking her as advisor, sending Fringilla to Nilfgaard instead. In 1243, Geralt enters the kingdom of Temeria to investigate a monster, assisted by Triss Merigold, King Foltest's sorceress advisor. He identifies the monster as a [[Shtriga]], a creature born from a curse he later discovers was placed by the [[courtier]] Ostrit who learned about the [[incest|affair]] between Foltest and his sister, Princess Adda. Using Ostrit as bait, Geralt battles to contain the shtriga until dawn, which lifts the curse.

In 1249, Geralt accompanies Jaskier to the betrothal feast of Princess Pavetta, Queen Calanthe's daughter. Urcheon of Erlenwald (also named Duny) interrupts to demand Pavetta's hand through the Law of Surprise, having saved her father years earlier. Urcheon suffers from a curse that transformed him into a hedgehog/man creature. Despite Pavetta's acceptance, Calanthe refuses and a brawl ensues. When Calanthe tries killing Urcheon, Pavetta activates her power, unleashing a maelstrom until Geralt and Mousesack intervene. Wanting her daughter happy, Calanthe marries Duny and Pavetta, which lifts Duny's curse. Duny, thankful for Geralt's aid, insists he take a reward, so Geralt jokingly invokes the Law of Surprise for something Duny has but doesn't yet know. The crowd then immediately learns Pavetta is pregnant with Duny's child. In 1263, Nilfgaard's forces resume their pursuit of Cirilla with Mousesack as their prisoner. Meanwhile, Cirilla and Dara encounter Queen Eithne and her Dryads in Brokilon Forest, while Cahir and Fringilla track Ciri's location.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"A Question of Price\" from ''The Last Wish'', and \"Sword of Destiny\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bottled Appetites\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sneha Koorse\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Seven years after Pavetta's betrothal, in 1256, Geralt and Jaskier discover a [[Jinn|Djinn]] and accidentally release it.

Geralt seeks help from the nearest healer, the elf Chireadan, but as they need a mage to heal Jaskier, Chireadan reluctantly refers them to Yennefer. Although Yennefer cures Jaskier, her plan is to use him to capture the Djinn to grant her wish of regaining her fertility. As Jaskier uses his last wish, nothing happens and it's revealed that it is Geralt, not Jaskier, who actually has the wishes. Geralt realises the Djinn will kill Yennefer, so he uses his third and final wish to save her (but the wish itself is not revealed). The Djinn leaves. Now free and safe, Geralt and Yennefer act on their attraction and have sex. Yennefer asks what his third wish was, but Geralt does not answer as he has finally fallen asleep.

Borch's group sacrifices themselves rather than endanger the party. Geralt and Yennefer reconcile before reaching the dragon's den, but find it dead with T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a alive guarding the dragon's egg. Borch reveals himself as Vilentretenmerth, a golden dragon. The five of them defend the egg from the Reavers. Borch later pays off the dwarves with dragon teeth, and Geralt reveals to Yennefer his third wish bound their fates together.

In his delirious state, Geralt dreams about his mother Visenna, who abandoned him as a child in order for him to be made into a witcher. He later arrives at the same farm, and upon hearing the woman talk to the man about Ciri, heads into the forest. Seeing a vision of Geralt, Ciri wakes up and wanders into the forest, where she and Geralt finally meet, and hug each other.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"Something More\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n}}The timeline for the episodes, along with in-depth summaries of events, was later created by Netflix to further describe these episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.witchernetflix.com/en-gb|title=Netflix {{!}} The Witcher {{!}} Map of the Continent|website=www.witchernetflix.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s ''[[The Witcher]]'' book series was almost adapted into a standalone Netflix film, but Kelly Luegenbiehl, Vice President of International Originals at Netflix, dissuaded the producers.
