The name \"[[wild onion (disambiguation)|wild onion]]\" is applied to a number of ''Allium'' species, but ''A. cepa'' is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.<ref name=\"FNA\">{{eFloras|1|200027457|Allium cepa |first1=Dale W. |last1=McNeal Jr. |first2=T. D. |last2=Jacobsen |volume=26}}</ref> The onion is most frequently a [[biennial plant|biennial]] or a [[perennial plant]], but is usually treated as an [[Annual plant|annual]] and harvested in its first growing season.\n\nThe onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the [[Delia antiqua|onion fly]], the [[Ditylenchus dipsaci|onion eelworm]], and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of ''A. cepa'', such as [[shallot]]s and [[potato onion]]s, produce multiple bulbs.\n\nOnions are cultivated and used around the world.

The English word [[chive]] is also derived from the Old French ''cive'', which derived from ''cepa''.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe onion plant has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years.  It is a [[biennial plant]], but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of {{convert|15|to|45|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of a [[basal disc]]. From the underside of the disc, a bundle of [[Fibrous root system|fibrous roots]] extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.<ref name=RHS />\n\nIn the autumn, the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then normally harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The [[inflorescence]] takes the form of a globular [[umbel]] of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.<ref name=RHS /> The average pH of an onion is around 5.5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foodsafety.wisc.edu/business_food/files/Approximate_pH.pdf|title=Approximate pH Values of Common Foods and Ingredients|website=Wisconsin Food Safety and Health|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224184605/http://www.foodsafety.wisc.edu/business_food/files/Approximate_pH.pdf|archive-date=2012-12-24|url-status=dead|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Origin and history ===\n[[File:An onion, woodcut, 1547 Wellcome L0029214.jpg|thumb|Woodcut, 1547]]\n\nBecause the wild onion is [[extinction|extinct]] and ancient records of using onions span [[Western Asia|western]] and [[Eastern Asia|eastern]] Asia, the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain,<ref name=\"cumo\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WqfACQAAQBAJ&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248 |title=Onion.

Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require a high level of [[Soil#Nutrients|nutrients]] in the soil. [[Phosphorus]] is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. [[Nitrogen]] and [[potash]] can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/publications/pubDetail.cfm?pk_id=7749 |title=2007 Onion Production Guide |author=Boyhan, George E.; Kelley, W.

Most traditional European onions are referred to as \"long-day\" onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as \"intermediate-day\" types, requiring only 12\u201313 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, \"short-day\" onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11\u201312 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/onion-bulb-formation-strongly-linked-day-length |title=Onion bulb formation is strongly linked with day length |author=Savonen, Carol |date=2006-07-13 |website= |publisher=Oregon State University Extension Service |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in [[Hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;9.<ref name=almanac /> Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to \"[[Bolting (horticulture)|bolt]]\", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/onion/onion-bolting.htm |title=What is Onion Bolting and how to Keep an Onion from Bolting |author=Rhoades, Jackie |website=Gardening Know How |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref>\n\nOnions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown [[bulb|bulbs called \"sets\"]].

The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need much water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be stored, they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying, then placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes.

The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.<ref name=Hessayon>{{cite book |title=Be your own Vegetable Doctor |last=Hessayon |first=D.G. |authorlink = D. G.

The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Delia_antiqua/ |title=''Delia antiqua'' (Meigen): Onion Fly |website=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nThe onion eelworm (''[[Ditylenchus dipsaci]]''), a tiny parasitic soil-living [[nematode]], causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing [[carrot]]s, [[parsnip]]s, and [[bean]]s, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/techniques/pests/onion_eelworm.htm |title=Onion Eelworm (''Ditylenchus dipsaci'') |year=2011 |website=GardenAction  |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWhite rot of onions, leeks, and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus ''[[Stromatinia cepivora|Sclerotium cepivorum]]''. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of [[Mycelium|mycelia]], which later produces small, globular black structures called [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]]. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=226 |title=Onion white rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nNeck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage. It is caused by ''[[Botrytis allii]]'', which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of [[spore]]s are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=747 |title=Onion neck rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Storage in the home ===\n[[File:\u0c09\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Pickled onion]]\n\nCooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at [[room temperature]], optimally in a single layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears.

The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs from a master. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.<ref name=\"Rabinowitch 20-21\" />\n\nI'itoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the [[Baboquivari Peak Wilderness]], Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and is easy to grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1&nbsp;in below the surface and 12&nbsp;in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall.

The name \"[[wild onion (disambiguation)|wild onion]]\" is applied to a number of ''Allium'' species, but ''A. cepa'' is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.<ref name=\"FNA\">{{eFloras|1|200027457|Allium cepa |first1=Dale W. |last1=McNeal Jr. |first2=T. D. |last2=Jacobsen |volume=26}}</ref> The onion is most frequently a [[biennial plant|biennial]] or a [[perennial plant]], but is usually treated as an [[Annual plant|annual]] and harvested in its first growing season.\n\nThe onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the [[Delia antiqua|onion fly]], the [[Ditylenchus dipsaci|onion eelworm]], and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of ''A. cepa'', such as [[shallot]]s and [[potato onion]]s, produce multiple bulbs.\n\nOnions are cultivated and used around the world. As a food item, they are usually served cooked, as a [[vegetable]] or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make [[Pickled onion|pickles]] or [[chutney]]s. They are [[pungent]] when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\n[[File:ARS red onion.jpg|thumb|Roots, leaves and developing bulb]]\nThe onion plant (''Allium cepa''), also known as the bulb onion<ref name=GRIN>{{GRIN | ''Allium cepa'' var.

The English word [[chive]] is also derived from the Old French ''cive'', which derived from ''cepa''.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe onion plant has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years.  It is a [[biennial plant]], but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of {{convert|15|to|45|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of a [[basal disc]]. From the underside of the disc, a bundle of [[Fibrous root system|fibrous roots]] extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.<ref name=RHS />\n\nIn the autumn, the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then normally harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The [[inflorescence]] takes the form of a globular [[umbel]] of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.<ref name=RHS /> The average pH of an onion is around 5.5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foodsafety.wisc.edu/business_food/files/Approximate_pH.pdf|title=Approximate pH Values of Common Foods and Ingredients|website=Wisconsin Food Safety and Health|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224184605/http://www.foodsafety.wisc.edu/business_food/files/Approximate_pH.pdf|archive-date=2012-12-24|url-status=dead|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Origin and history ===\n[[File:An onion, woodcut, 1547 Wellcome L0029214.jpg|thumb|Woodcut, 1547]]\n\nBecause the wild onion is [[extinction|extinct]] and ancient records of using onions span [[Western Asia|western]] and [[Eastern Asia|eastern]] Asia, the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain,<ref name=\"cumo\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WqfACQAAQBAJ&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248 |title=Onion.

Most traditional European onions are referred to as \"long-day\" onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs.

The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need much water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be stored, they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying, then placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes.

The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.<ref name=Hessayon>{{cite book |title=Be your own Vegetable Doctor |last=Hessayon |first=D.G. |authorlink = D. G.

The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Delia_antiqua/ |title=''Delia antiqua'' (Meigen): Onion Fly |website=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nThe onion eelworm (''[[Ditylenchus dipsaci]]''), a tiny parasitic soil-living [[nematode]], causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing [[carrot]]s, [[parsnip]]s, and [[bean]]s, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/techniques/pests/onion_eelworm.htm |title=Onion Eelworm (''Ditylenchus dipsaci'') |year=2011 |website=GardenAction  |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWhite rot of onions, leeks, and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus ''[[Stromatinia cepivora|Sclerotium cepivorum]]''. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of [[Mycelium|mycelia]], which later produces small, globular black structures called [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]]. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=226 |title=Onion white rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nNeck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage. It is caused by ''[[Botrytis allii]]'', which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of [[spore]]s are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=747 |title=Onion neck rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Storage in the home ===\n[[File:\u0c09\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Pickled onion]]\n\nCooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at [[room temperature]], optimally in a single layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw moisture from [[vegetables]] with which they are stored which may cause them to [[Decomposition|decay]].<ref name=almanac /><ref name=Jauron>{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/news/2009/jul/062201.htm |title=Harvesting and storing onions |author=Jauron, Richard |date=2009-07-27 |publisher=Iowa State University Extension |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref>\n\nSweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.<ref name=FAQ />\n\n== Varieties ==\n=== Common onion group (var. ''cepa'') ===\n\nMost of the diversity within ''A. cepa'' occurs within this group, the most economically important ''Allium'' crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, [[Allium fistulosum#Ambiguous names|salad onions]], and pickling onions belong to this group.<ref name=\"Rabinowitch 20-21\">{{cite book |last=Fritsch |first=R.M. |author2=N.

''aggregatum'') ===\nThis group contains shallots and potato onions, also referred to as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs from a master. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.<ref name=\"Rabinowitch 20-21\" />\n\nI'itoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the [[Baboquivari Peak Wilderness]], Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and is easy to grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1&nbsp;in below the surface and 12&nbsp;in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/programs/ark_product_detail/iitoi_onion/ |title=I'Itoi Onion |year=2010 |website=Ark of Taste |publisher=Slow Food USA |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==== Hybrids with ''A. cepa'' parentage ====\nA number of hybrids are cultivated that have ''A. cepa'' parentage, such as the [[Diploid#Polyploid types|diploid]] [[tree onion]] or Egyptian onion (''A.'' \u00d7''proliferum''), and the [[Triploid#Polyploid types|triploid]] onion (''A.'' \u00d7''cornutum'').\n\nThe tree onion or Egyptian onion produces bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers, and is now known to be a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of ''A. cepa'' and ''A. fistulosum''.

[[CORBA]] and [[Component Object Model|COM]] are the most popular object models. These standards provide a base set of rules for how object oriented languages would implement their data models to allow for a language-neutral way of implementing objects that can be used in environments different from the one in which they were created.\n\n=== Virtual machines (VMs) ===\n[[File:Common Language Runtime diagram.svg|thumb|Different Languages compile into a shared CLI]]\n[[Virtual machine|A Virtual machine]] is software that emulates operating systems, and acts a buffer between the language and the hardware. This allows a program to run on any hardware or OS. An advantage to VMs can use these type systems to ensure the correctness of participating languages and gives languages a common ground for their type information. Another advantage is that languages designed for VMs compile into a low level intermediate language. The intermediate language then goes through its own compiler or interpreter which can do more types of optimization.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n=== Object model differences ===\nWith object oriented languages attempt to pair containers of data with code, but how each language chooses how to do that may be slightly different. Those design decision do not always map to another language easily. An example of this would be how different languages handle [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]]. A single class may have zero ([[Go (programming language)|Go]]), one ([[Java (programming language)|Java]]), or many ([[C++]]) [[Superclass (computer science)|superclasses]]. A common approach to this issue is defining a subset of a language that maps directly to the other, but can also fully understand the other language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chisnall|first=David|date=2013-10-01|title=The Challenge of Cross-language Interoperability|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2542661.2543971|journal=Queue|volume=11|issue=10|pages=20|doi=10.1145/2542661.2543971|issn=1542-7730|doi-broken-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> This approach does mean in order for the superset to communicate down it will need to wrap some of its interfaces into classes that can be understood by the subset.\n\n=== Memory models ===\nDifferences in how programming languages handle deallocation of memory is another issue when trying create interoperability. Manual and automatic deallocation is not the only issue but if it has deterministic and nondeterministic destruction. Based on the constraints of the language there are many different strategies for bridging the different behaviors. C++ which uses manual deallocation could use a Java styled garbage collector by changing deallocation behavior to delete the object, but not reclaim the memory. This requires that each object will have to manually be deallocated, in order for the garbage collector to release the memory safely.\n\n=== Mutability ===\nMutability becomes an issue when trying to create interoperability between functional and object oriented languages. Languages like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] have no mutable types, where in C++ there are some constructs to flag classes as immutable but lack support of determining if something is mutable or not. Many functional types when bridged to object oriented languages can not guarantee that the underlying objects won't be modified.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Foreign function interface]]\n* [[Language-independent specification]]\n* [[Language binding]]\n* [[Glue language]]\n* [[Api#API sharing and reuse via virtual machine|API reuse]]\n* [[List of JVM languages|JVM languages]]\n* [[List of CLI languages|CLI Languages]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Programming languages]]\n", "text_old": "'''Language interoperability''' is the capability of two different [[programming languages]] to natively interact as part of the same system.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Interoperability in Programming Languages|last=Malone|first=Todd|date=2014|citeseerx = 10.1.1.684.337}}</ref> Interoperability is advantageous, because different programming language are optimized for specific tasks, and allowing them to communicate can create better systems.\n\nThere are many different ways programming languages are interoperable with one another.
