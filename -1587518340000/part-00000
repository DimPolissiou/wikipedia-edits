The first map identified the land under cultivation, urban area and plan for growth, with the island of Pessegueiro and coastal fort identified. The representation shows urban area close to the beach/cove, laid down as a series of parallel and perdendicular streets, with two squares (Pra\u00e7a do Poleirinho and Pra\u00e7a do Mercado), a hospital alongside the church, with other buildings logically planned-out, including residences, farms, coal warehouses, hospedes, municipal hall and jail, tax office and fishing suppliers.</ref> Jacinto Fernandes became the [[alcalde]] of  Vila Nova de Milfontes on 14 November 1802 and later the council to the Royal Finances.

By this time, Porto Covo had little more than 20 residences: little more than the original nucleus left behind on the death of the first Baron.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Porto Covo never really achieved an important place along the Alentejo coast. The area on which it was located remained unsettled; the area between Sines and the River Mira were likely destinations for fishermen and traders then the village.

A coastal parish, it is located about {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the municipal seat Sines, but comprises an interior catchment that extends seven kilometres into the interior. While it is fronted to its north by the civil parish of [[Sines (parish)|Sines]], it is surrounded to the west by the civil parish of [[Cercal]] (in the municipality of [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m Municipality|Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]]) and south by the civil parish of [[Vila Nova de Milfontes]] (in the municipality of [[Odemira Municipality|Odemira]]).\n\nIts northern frontier extends from the beach of Vieirinha into the interior, until reaching the IC4 motorway (each of Brejos do Morgave) and extending south to the village of Sonega. Its eastern border with Cercal meanders along the foothills until southeast of Herdade da Cabe\u00e7a da Cabra, before the border joins that of the civil parish of Vila de Milfontes meandering west (following the Ribeira da Azenha) reaching the coast 1.5 kilometres south of the island of Pessegueiro. The space includes, apart from the town of Porto Covo, several other localities, including: Barradinha, Brejos do Morgave, Caeiro, Cabe\u00e7a da Cabra, Camarneira, Casa Nova, Fonte do Muro, Fonte Nova, Foros da Pouca Farinha, Herdade de Cabe\u00e7a da Cabra, Monte das Pias and Vale Travesso.

The first map identified the land under cultivation, urban area and plan for growth, with the island of Pessegueiro and coastal fort identified. The representation shows urban area close to the beach/cove, laid down as a series of parallel and perdendicular streets, with two squares (Pra\u00e7a do Poleirinho and Pra\u00e7a do Mercado), a hospital alongside the church, with other buildings logically planned-out, including residences, farms, coal warehouses, hospedes, municipal hall and jail, tax office and fishing suppliers.</ref> Jacinto Fernandes became the [[alcalde]] of  Vila Nova de Milfontes on 14 November 1802 and later the council to the Royal Finances. He was given the title of Baron of Porto Covo on 15 August 1805.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nWhile he lived Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira strove to grow the community, a fact that did not influence his successors, following his death on 30 May 1806.<ref name=JFHistoria/> A bachelor, he left his enormous fortune to his two nephews, children of his sister, Maria Josefa Cristina Bandeira.<ref name=JFHistoria/> It was the eldest nephew, Jacinto Fernandes da Costa Bandeira, that inherited the majority from his uncle, succeeding his uncle as the [[alcalde]] of Vila Nova de Milfontes, and second Baron of Porto Covo on 26 February 1822.<ref name=JFHistoria/> For his contribution to the Crown, he went as far as Minister for Finances and President of the Bank of Lisbon, eventually achieving the title of Viscount of Porto Covo da Bandeira on 15 September 1843. By this time, Porto Covo had little more than 20 residences: little more than the original nucleus left behind on the death of the first Baron.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Porto Covo never really achieved an important place along the Alentejo coast. The area on which it was located remained unsettled; the area between Sines and the River Mira were likely destinations for fishermen and traders then the village. Fishing tended to remain archaic and never really commercialized by its population.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nDemographically, by 1940, Porto Covo had little more than 55 residences, comprising 246 inhabitants.<ref name=JFHistoria/> After 1980 the numbers had grown significantly: 194 residences, comprising 539 inhabitants.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Its growth was, in some part, achieved through the development of the Sines Industrial Complex and container port.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nPorto Covo became a civil parish on 31 December 1984, that included the island of Pessegueiro.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|left|235px|The Atlantic Ocean, as seen from Porto Covo]]\n[[File:Porto Covo June 2009-3a.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The port of Porto Covo, view from the East]]\nThe civil parish of Porto Covo has {{convert|48.73|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of area, and today includes 1400 inhabitants (based on 2008 census). A coastal parish, it is located about {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the municipal seat Sines, but comprises an interior catchment that extends seven kilometres into the interior. While it is fronted to its north by the civil parish of [[Sines (parish)|Sines]], it is surrounded to the west by the civil parish of [[Cercal]] (in the municipality of [[Santiago do Cac\u00e9m Municipality|Santiago do Cac\u00e9m]]) and south by the civil parish of [[Vila Nova de Milfontes]] (in the municipality of [[Odemira Municipality|Odemira]]).\n\nIts northern frontier extends from the beach of Vieirinha into the interior, until reaching the IC4 motorway (each of Brejos do Morgave) and extending south to the village of Sonega. Its eastern border with Cercal meanders along the foothills until southeast of Herdade da Cabe\u00e7a da Cabra, before the border joins that of the civil parish of Vila de Milfontes meandering west (following the Ribeira da Azenha) reaching the coast 1.5 kilometres south of the island of Pessegueiro. The space includes, apart from the town of Porto Covo, several other localities, including: Barradinha, Brejos do Morgave, Caeiro, Cabe\u00e7a da Cabra, Camarneira, Casa Nova, Fonte do Muro, Fonte Nova, Foros da Pouca Farinha, Herdade de Cabe\u00e7a da Cabra, Monte das Pias and Vale Travesso. The area is part of the [[Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park]] consisting of protected landscapes and habitats for migratory and endemic species.\n\nThe original projects for the community never materialized in the plans of Henrique Guilherme de Oliveira.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Rather than a seaside settlement, the architect laid-down the settlement further to the interior, mindful of the farmers distance from their lands.<ref name=JFHistoria/> The square, although simple, developed from the original plans of the Pombaline-era architects that favoured a visible square grid and squares, the repetition in the facades, the volume and rhythm of the groups of buildings (including the placement of the structures, such as the church).<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\n==Economy==\nAlthough characterized as a \"small fishing community\", its move towards the tourist market has driven its growth since the 1990s.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Influenced by its white, fine sand beaches, natural rock-cliff shores, secluded coves and warm temperatures (water temperatures reaching a minimum 15&nbsp;\u00b0C), the local economy absorves a constant number of summer visitors and foreign vacationers.<ref name=JFHistoria/> During the summer the population increases ten-fold with visitors, who occupy vacation homes, rented apartments and campgrounds, helped by the classification of many of its beaches as [[Blue Flag beach]]es, including the popular ''Praia do Espingardeiro'', ''Praia Pequena'' and ''Praia dos Buizinhos''.\nIn front of the island of Pessegueiro is one of the more popular beaches, attracting windsurfers, boaters and sport fishermen to the waters off the coast.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Alongside the beach of Pessegueiro is the 17th-century fortress, partially destroyed by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.<ref name=JFHistoria/> On the island of Pessegueiro, which inspired the contemporary musician [[Rui Veloso]] to pen a composition, is another 17th-century fortress, the ruins of a Roman porto and 15th-century chapel.

In 1924, it was incorporated as a ''cidade'' and became known merely as Portim\u00e3o. Historically a fishing and shipbuilding centre, it has nonetheless developed into a strong tourist centre oriented along its beaches and southern coast. The two most populous towns in the Algarve are Portim\u00e3o and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Rio Arade.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A replica of a [[Caravel]] sailing by the Arade River in old Portim\u00e3o]]\n[[File:2007.03.28.pt.Portimao.ForteSantaCatarina.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The Castle of Santa Catarina overlooking the coastal roads of Portim\u00e3o]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe area was settled during the prehistoric epoch: the [[Cynetes]], influenced by the [[Celts]] and [[Tartessos]] lived during the Algarve for many centuries.  In the area of Alcalar there are several remnants of [[Neolithic]] funerary sites of which only one, [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar|Alcalar monument number seven]], comprising a circular chamber composed of schist stone and long corridor, remains. Comparable to western European and Irish monuments, the funeral crypt, with two lateral ritual niches, was protected by a [[tumulus]]: a similar site exists in Monte Canelas.\n\n===Antiquity===\nThe mouth of the [[Arade River]] proved an important natural shelter that soon became a small commercial port for the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. The Carthaginians founded two settlements nearby in the mid-6th century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, known by their [[Roman Empire|Roman]] names {{nowrap|'''Portus Magonis'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Portus Hannibalis'''}} (\"[[Hannibal]]'s Port\"). The former was the nucleus of present-day Portim\u00e3o.\n\nObvious vestiges of the Roman occupation are situated near Figueira, at [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada|Quinta da Abicada]], in the confluence of two rivers, where the remains of various rooms were unearthed. Also, in the area of Coca Maravilhas was discovered a well-preserved period [[cistern]], while along the Arade River there have been identified gold coins.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 5th century, the Algarve was inhabited by the [[Visigoths]] until the invasion of the [[Moors]]. It was during the Moorish occupation that the settlement changed to {{nowrap|'''Burj Munt'''}}. The river and its ocean access to the ancient city of Shilb ([[Silves, Portugal|Silves]]), then capital of the Arabian Algarve.\n\n===Kingdom===\nAlong with Silves and Alvor, the small fishing centre in Portim\u00e3o was reconquered in 1249 from the Arabs by Knights of the Order of Santiago and forcibly integrated into the fledgling kingdom, during the reign of [[Afonso III of Portugal]].\n[[File:Igreja_de_Nossa_Senhora_da_Concei\u00e7\u00e3o,_Portim\u00e3o_(1).jpg|thumb|right|230px|Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o church. Built in the 15th century and partially rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake]]\nIts geographic location created strong economic conditions to allow the region to prosper, eventually allowing Portim\u00e3o to obtain the status of town in 1435. The inhabitants understood the necessity of constructing walls, in order to protect themselves from constant invasions. The construction of two forts, the Castle of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (in Ferragudo) and the Castle of Santa Catarin (in Praia da Rocha), protected the centre from attacks from pirates and privateers during this period.\n\nIn Portim\u00e3o, a major part of the commerce was accomplished across the sea. The transport across the Arade River was done across a boat that docked at the ''Largo de Barca''. Until bridge and road was constructed, 400 years later, it was the only form of crossing the river.\n\nIn 1463, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], under petition from several inhabitants in Portim\u00e3o, authorized the founding of new settlement, which became the urbanized centre of Portim\u00e3o (then named ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o Barrosa''). In 1476, Vila Nova de Portim\u00e3o is donated by [[Afonso V of Portugal]] to his financial inspector, [[Dom (title)|D.]] Gon\u00e7alo Vaz de Castelo Branco, remaining in the family until the 17th century.\n\nThe shipbuilding industry took on an important place in the city's development. These activities were registered in the royal documents that included authorization of [[Sebastian of Portugal]] (in 1536). The king visited in 1573, passing the night and assisting a solemn mass in the Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco.\n\nIn the port of Portim\u00e3o local products, such as figs, olives, oil, wine and fish were regularly exported, while other products from the African and Brazilian colonies, such as slaves and sugar, were introduced into the Portuguese territory. But, by the 17th and 18th century, the rhythm of growth slowed considerably. As commerce decreased the inhabitants emigrated, a fact that accelerated after the 1755 earthquake, causing the destruction within the city. The main church was destroyed, while many of the small chapels were damaged. The city walls were severely damaged, not just by the earthquake but also the resulting tsunami. The [[Fort of Santa Catarina (Portim\u00e3o)|Fort of Santa Catarina]] also suffered damage, but was reconstructed in 1792 and 1794, by the Count of Val de Reys. Twenty years after the earthquake, the Marquess of Pombal, wanted to make Portim\u00e3o a bishopric, and in this evolution, he elevated the town to the status of city. Unfortunately, Queen Maria I of Portugal vetoed these intentions. The civil statute was only issued in 1924, by the Marquess' illustrious son Manuel Teixeira Gomes, as Republican president.\n\n[[File:Portimao skyline.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Portim\u00e3o, Algarve, Portugal]]\n\n===Republic===\nIn the 19th century, a fishing conserving industry reinvigorated the old city. Now renamed Portim\u00e3o, the city turned into one of the more important fishing and packing centres in the Algarve, until the 20th century, when the 1980s recession finally caused these businesses to fold. At the end of the 20th century, visitors to the region began travelling to the beaches of Praia da Rocha or Praia da Santa Catarina. On 1 August 1910, the Praia da Rocha Casino was opened, symptom of the growing influx of tourists to the region, many aristocrats from the southern part of the country and [[Andalusia]].\n\nThe place became populated by houses and chalets built for, or rented to, the numerous tourists. The first hotel constructed, the Hotel Viola, dated to the first part of the 20th century, and was expanded after 1932, when the space became too small to support the influx of travellers. In 1936, the Hotel Bela Vista was constructed as total tourists began to exceed a thousand people annually. It turned into a popular destination for sport fishing, and among popular nautical sports, jet skiing, sailing, windsurfing, diving and dolphin watching.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o 2.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The white sand beach and cliffs of the beach of Praia da Rocha]]\nThe municipality is located on the western coast of the Algarve, bordering the municipalities of [[Lagos Municipality|Lagos]], [[Lagoa Municipality (Algarve)|Lagoa]], [[Monchique Municipality]] and [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]].\n\nPortim\u00e3o is the most important urbanized city in the ''Barlavento Algarvio'' (the western Algarve), supporting a sizeable population with harbour and a small airfield ([[Portim\u00e3o Airport]]) of its own with schedules flights to some domestic destinations by [[Aero VIP (Portugal)|Aero VIP]] (the larger [[Faro Airport|Faro International Airport]] is in the nearby district capital of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]).\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 3 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 99|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=29 July 2014|author=''[[Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica]]''|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n* [[Alvor (Portim\u00e3o)|Alvor]] (6,154 inhabitants, 2011)\n* [[Mexilhoeira Grande]] (4,029 inhabitants, 2011)\n* [[Portim\u00e3o (parish)|Portim\u00e3o]] (45,431 inhabitants, 2011)\n\nThe municipality is primarily serviced by the A22 motorway (the ''Via do Infante''), and the E.N.125 roadway that links it directly to \nthe communities of [[Alvor (Portim\u00e3o)|Alvor]] (4 kilometres), [[Mexilhoeira Grande (Portim\u00e3o)|Mexilhoeira Grande]] (9 kilometres) and [[Praia da Rocha]] (3 kilometres).\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|\n{{stack|\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Population of the<br> municipality of Portim\u00e3o<br><small>(1981\u20132011)</small>\n| 1981 | 34464\n| 1991 | 38883\n| 2001 | 44818\n| 2004 | 47189\n| 2011 | 55614 \n}}\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Portim\u00e3o\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan high C = 15.9\n|Feb high C = 16.6\n|Mar high C = 17.8\n|Apr high C = 19.7\n|May high C = 22.2\n|Jun high C = 25.3\n|Jul high C = 28.4\n|Aug high C = 28.8\n|Sep high C = 26.3\n|Oct high C = 22.9\n|Nov high C = 19.0\n|Dec high C = 16.6\n|year high C =\n\n|Jan mean C = 12.0\n|Feb mean C = 12.6\n|Mar mean C = 13.8\n|Apr mean C = 15.4\n|May mean C = 17.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.4\n|Jul mean C = 22.9\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 21.6\n|Oct mean C = 18.8\n|Nov mean C = 15.1\n|Dec mean C = 12.7\n|year mean C =\n\n|Jan low C = 8.2\n|Feb low C = 8.6\n|Mar low C = 9.9\n|Apr low C = 11.1\n|May low C = 13.0\n|Jun low C = 15.6\n|Jul low C = 17.5\n|Aug low C = 18.0\n|Sep low C = 16.9\n|Oct low C = 14.7\n|Nov low C = 11.3\n|Dec low C = 8.8\n|year low C =\n\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 79\n|Feb rain mm = 64\n|Mar rain mm = 45\n|Apr rain mm = 36\n|May rain mm = 21\n|Jun rain mm = 12\n|Jul rain mm = 1\n|Aug rain mm = 2\n|Sep rain mm = 14\n|Oct rain mm = 53\n|Nov rain mm = 77\n|Dec rain mm = 77\n|year rain mm =\n\n|Jan sun = 175\n|Feb sun = 191\n|Mar sun = 219\n|Apr sun = 276\n|May sun = 322\n|Jun sun = 352\n|Jul sun = 387\n|Aug sun = 363\n|Sep sun = 281\n|Oct sun = 235\n|Nov sun = 181\n|Dec sun = 180\n|year sun =\n\n|source 1 = Climate-data.org<ref name=Climate-data.org>{{cite web\n|url =https://en.climate-data.org/europe/portugal/portimao/portimao-999359/ |title =Portim\u00e3o Climate|publisher=climate-data.org|year=2020}}\nRetrieved on April 12, 2020.\n</ref>|source 2 = weather-and-climate.com<ref name=weather-and-climate>{{cite web\n|url = https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,praia-da-rocha,Portugal|title =Average Monthly Hours Of Sunshine In Praia Da Rocha (Algarve), Portugal|publisher=weather-and-climate|year=2020}}\nRetrieved on April 11, 2020.\n</ref>|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Aqua Shopping centre, Portim\u00e3o (2).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Aqua Shopping centre in Portim\u00e3o]] \n[[File:Praia da Rocha beach, Portim\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Praia da Rocha attracts numerous tourists]]\n\nThe community, which was founded on the right margin of the Arade River, and oriented towards the sea, is inserted in a region whose geography and physical characteristics justify a seafaring economy. Its maritime economy allowed the development of industries oriented towards salination of fish, the open-water fishing industry, conservation and canning, the construction of ships and transport. Further, the Arade basin permitted rural commerce associated with cultivation of [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]], fig, almonds and the saw-milling/forestry industry (including cork), among others.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, tourism became an accentuated economic factor in the regions growth, with the development of activities oriented towards the sea and development of seasonal infrastructures that permitted an influx of new money. By the beginning of the 21st century, 74% of the roughly 2000 annual overnight stays originated from the United Kingdom, Portugal and Ireland. Seasonal concentration (44%) usually occurred around the high-summer months (July, August and September).\n\nThe Algarve in general is a major draw for tourists. In 2018, the region's income from tourism was over a billion euros; the number of visitors totaled 4.2 million. The region's tourism contributed \u20ac1.08 billion to the economy in that year.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://algarvedailynews.com/news/16144-algarve-tourism-figures-now-in-for-2018 |title=Algarve tourism figures now in for 2018 |date=14 February 2019 |publisher=Algarve Daily News|access-date=25 November 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Prehistoric===\n* [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar]] ({{lang-pt|Monumentos de Alcalar/Conjunto Pr\u00e9-hist\u00f3rico de Alcalar}})\n\n===Civic===\n* [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada]] ({{lang-pt|Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Romana da Quinta da Abicada}})\n\n== Sports ==\nPortim\u00e3o is known for its sporting events, mostly [[water sports]], including [[surfing]] and [[kitesurfing]]; [[motorsport]]; [[beach soccer]]; and the professional football team [[Portimonense S.C. (football team)|Portimonense S.C.]].\n\n===Team sports===\n[[Portimonense S.C.]] is the local sports club, with team in such sports such as [[basketball]]. It is best known for its [[Portimonense S.C. (football team)|professional association football section]], who play at the [[Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Portim\u00e3o]]. In the summer, a [[beach soccer]] tournament called the [[Mundialito de Futebol de Praia]] ('Little World Cup') is held.\n\n=== Sailing ===\nBeing located on the South coast of Portugal, Portim\u00e3o is well known in the sailing world for being an ideal location for sailing on the Atlantic Ocean, boasting much calmer seas and weather conditions than the Western coastline.\n\nPortim\u00e3o is the host venue for many prestigious sailing events including the annual '''Portim\u00e3o, Portugal Match Cup''' event which is a part of the [[World Match Racing Tour]]. The event draws the world's best sailing teams to Portim\u00e3o. The identical supplied (SM-40) boats are raced two at a time. Points accrued count towards the World Match Race Tour and a place in the final event of the season, with the overall winner taking the title [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is an ideal sport for spectators in Portim\u00e3o.\n\n=== Powerboating ===\nThe Portim\u00e3o coastline has also been host to the sport of powerboating. The Portuguese Grand Prix of the Sea run by Powerboat P1 as part of its international championship is also held in Portim\u00e3o. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Motorsport ===\nIn the hills near Portim\u00e3o stands the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional do Algarve]]. Finished in October 2008, it is a race and test circuit officially recognised for the highest categories both for cars and motorcycles. [[Superbike racing|Superbike]] races, [[Le Mans Series]] races and F1 tests are scheduled. The Lisbon to Dakar [[Rallying|Rally]] passed through here.\n\n=== Rhythmic gymnastics ===\nThere is also an annual grand prix of [[rhythmic gymnastics]], with an individual all-round competition, a team all-round competition, and finals by apparatus and by group at senior and junior levels.\n\n=== Scuba Diving ===\nThe Ocean Revival Project saw 4 Portuguese Navy Warships deliberately sunk to form the largest single artificial reef structure in the world.\n\n==Town Twinning==\n{{Main|List of twin towns and sister cities in Portugal}}\n\nThe following places are [[sister cities]] to Portim\u00e3o:\n\n*{{flagicon|POR}} [[Maia Municipality|Maia]], Portugal\n*{{flagicon|POR}} [[Vila Real]], Portugal\n\n==See also==\n*[[Portim\u00e3o DOC]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Portim\u00e3o}}\n*[http://www.cm-portimao.pt Portim\u00e3o's City Hall Official Website] {{in lang|pt}}\n\n{{Municipality of Faro District (Algarve)}}\n{{Phoenician cities and colonies|collapse=yes}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Portimao}}\n[[Category:Phoenician colonies]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of the Algarve]]\n[[Category:Towns of the Algarve]]\n[[Category:Cities in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Seaside resorts in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Portim\u00e3o| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Faro District]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Faro District]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the civil parish or wine|Portim\u00e3o (parish)|Portim\u00e3o DOC}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox Portuguese subdivision\n| type            = municipality\n|official_name      = Portim\u00e3o\n|image_flag         = [[File:Pt-ptm1.png|120px]]\n|image_shield       = PTM.png \n| image_skyline           = {{Photomontage\n| photo1a                 = Apartment buildings at Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o (cropped).jpg\n| photo2a                 = Col\u00e9gio dos Jesu\u00edtas (2).jpg\n| photo2b                 = Edificio de la Fregues\u00eda de Portimao.jpg\n| photo3a                 = Teatro Municipal de Portim\u00e3o (1).jpg\n| photo3b                 = View of Portimao - Ferragudo - The Algarve, Portugal (1469904980) (cropped).jpg\n| spacing                 = 2\n| position                = center\n| color_border            = white\n| color                   = white\n| size                    = 280\n| foot_montage            = \n}}\n|image_location     = LocalPortimao.svg\n|region             = [[Algarve]]\n|CIM                = [[Algarve]]\n|district           = [[Faro District|Faro]]\n|parishes           = [[#Human geography|3]]\n|leader_name        = Manuel Ant\u00f3nio da Luz\n|leader_party       = [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]\n|coordinates        = {{coord|37|8|13|N|8|32|18|W|type:adm1st_region:PT_dim:100000|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation          = \n|elevation_min      = \n|elevation_max      = \n|area_total         = 182.06\n|population_as_of   = 2011\n|population_total   = 55614\n|patron             = [[Immaculate Conception|Imaculada Concei\u00e7\u00e3o]]\n|postal_code        = 8500\n|area_code          = \n|website            = http://www.cm-portimao.pt\n}}\n'''Portim\u00e3o''' ({{IPA-pt|pu\u027eti\u02c8m\u0250\u0303w|-|Pt-pt Portim\u00e3o FF.ogg}}) is a town (''cidade'') and a municipality in the district of [[Faro (district)|Faro]], in the [[Algarve]] region of southern [[Portugal]].<ref>Detail Regional Map, Algarve- Southern Portugal, {{ISBN|3-8297-6235-6}}</ref> The population in 2011 was 55,614,<ref>[http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xlang=en&xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_indicadores&indOcorrCod=0005889&contexto=pi&selTab=tab0 Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]</ref> in an area of 182.06&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ |title=\u00c1reas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e pa\u00eds |access-date=5 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105172426/http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ |archive-date=5 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was formerly known as '''Vila Nova de Portim\u00e3o''' ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8vil\u0250 \u02c8n\u0254v\u0250 \u00f0\u0268 pu\u027eti\u02c8m\u0250\u0303w|IPA}}). In 1924, it was incorporated as a ''cidade'' and became known merely as Portim\u00e3o. Historically a fishing and shipbuilding centre, it has nonetheless developed into a strong tourist centre oriented along its beaches and southern coast. The two most populous towns in the Algarve are Portim\u00e3o and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Rio Arade.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A replica of a [[Caravel]] sailing by the Arade River in old Portim\u00e3o]]\n[[File:2007.03.28.pt.Portimao.ForteSantaCatarina.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The Castle of Santa Catarina overlooking the coastal roads of Portim\u00e3o]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe area was settled during the prehistoric epoch: the [[Cynetes]], influenced by the [[Celts]] and [[Tartessos]] lived during the Algarve for many centuries.  In the area of Alcalar there are several remnants of [[Neolithic]] funerary sites of which only one, [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar|Alcalar monument number seven]], comprising a circular chamber composed of schist stone and long corridor, remains. Comparable to western European and Irish monuments, the funeral crypt, with two lateral ritual niches, was protected by a [[tumulus]]: a similar site exists in Monte Canelas.\n\n===Antiquity===\nThe mouth of the [[Arade River]] proved an important natural shelter that soon became a small commercial port for the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. The Carthaginians founded two settlements nearby in the mid-6th century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, known by their [[Roman Empire|Roman]] names {{nowrap|'''Portus Magonis'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Portus Hannibalis'''}} (\"[[Hannibal]]'s Port\"). The former was the nucleus of present-day Portim\u00e3o.\n\nObvious vestiges of the Roman occupation are situated near Figueira, at [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada|Quinta da Abicada]], in the confluence of two rivers, where the remains of various rooms were unearthed. Also, in the area of Coca Maravilhas was discovered a well-preserved period [[cistern]], while along the Arade River there have been identified gold coins.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 5th century, the Algarve was inhabited by the [[Visigoths]] until the invasion of the [[Moors]]. It was during the Moorish occupation that the settlement changed to {{nowrap|'''Burj Munt'''}}. The river and its ocean access to the ancient city of Shilb ([[Silves, Portugal|Silves]]), then capital of the Arabian Algarve.\n\n===Kingdom===\nAlong with Silves and Alvor, the small fishing centre in Portim\u00e3o was reconquered in 1249 from the Arabs by Knights of the Order of Santiago and forcibly integrated into the fledgling kingdom, during the reign of [[Afonso III of Portugal]].\n[[File:Igreja_de_Nossa_Senhora_da_Concei\u00e7\u00e3o,_Portim\u00e3o_(1).jpg|thumb|right|230px|Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o church. Built in the 15th century and partially rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake]]\nIts geographic location created strong economic conditions to allow the region to prosper, eventually allowing Portim\u00e3o to obtain the status of town in 1435. The inhabitants understood the necessity of constructing walls, in order to protect themselves from constant invasions. The construction of two forts, the Castle of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (in Ferragudo) and the Castle of Santa Catarin (in Praia da Rocha), protected the centre from attacks from pirates and privateers during this period.\n\nIn Portim\u00e3o, a major part of the commerce was accomplished across the sea. The transport across the Arade River was done across a boat that docked at the ''Largo de Barca''. Until bridge and road was constructed, 400 years later, it was the only form of crossing the river.\n\nIn 1463, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], under petition from several inhabitants in Portim\u00e3o, authorized the founding of new settlement, which became the urbanized centre of Portim\u00e3o (then named ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o Barrosa''). In 1476, Vila Nova de Portim\u00e3o is donated by [[Afonso V of Portugal]] to his financial inspector, [[Dom (title)|D.]] Gon\u00e7alo Vaz de Castelo Branco, remaining in the family until the 17th century.\n\nThe shipbuilding industry took on an important place in the city's development. These activities were registered in the royal documents that included authorization of [[Sebastian of Portugal]] (in 1536). The king visited in 1573, passing the night and assisting a solemn mass in the Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco.\n\nIn the port of Portim\u00e3o local products, such as figs, olives, oil, wine and fish were regularly exported, while other products from the African and Brazilian colonies, such as slaves and sugar, were introduced into the Portuguese territory. But, by the 17th and 18th century, the rhythm of growth slowed considerably. As commerce decreased the inhabitants emigrated, a fact that accelerated after the 1755 earthquake, causing the destruction within the city. The main church was destroyed, while many of the small chapels were damaged. The city walls were severely damaged, not just by the earthquake but also the resulting tsunami. The [[Fort of Santa Catarina (Portim\u00e3o)|Fort of Santa Catarina]] also suffered damage, but was reconstructed in 1792 and 1794, by the Count of Val de Reys. Twenty years after the earthquake, the Marquess of Pombal, wanted to make Portim\u00e3o a bishopric, and in this evolution, he elevated the town to the status of city. Unfortunately, Queen Maria I of Portugal vetoed these intentions. The civil statute was only issued in 1924, by the Marquess' illustrious son Manuel Teixeira Gomes, as Republican president.\n\n[[File:Portimao skyline.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Portim\u00e3o, Algarve, Portugal]]\n\n===Republic===\nIn the 19th century, a fishing conserving industry reinvigorated the old city. Now renamed Portim\u00e3o, the city turned into one of the more important fishing and packing centres in the Algarve, until the 20th century, when the 1980s recession finally caused these businesses to fold. At the end of the 20th century, visitors to the region began travelling to the beaches of Praia da Rocha or Praia da Santa Catarina. On 1 August 1910, the Praia da Rocha Casino was opened, symptom of the growing influx of tourists to the region, many aristocrats from the southern part of the country and [[Andalusia]].\n\nThe place became populated by houses and chalets built for, or rented to, the numerous tourists. The first hotel constructed, the Hotel Viola, dated to the first part of the 20th century, and was expanded after 1932, when the space became too small to support the influx of travellers. In 1936, the Hotel Bela Vista was constructed as total tourists began to exceed a thousand people annually. It turned into a popular destination for sport fishing, and among popular nautical sports, jet skiing, sailing, windsurfing, diving and dolphin watching.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o 2.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The white sand beach and cliffs of the beach of Praia da Rocha]]\nThe municipality is located on the western coast of the Algarve, bordering the municipalities of [[Lagos Municipality|Lagos]], [[Lagoa Municipality (Algarve)|Lagoa]], [[Monchique Municipality]] and [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]].\n\nPortim\u00e3o is the most important urbanized city in the ''Barlavento Algarvio'' (the western Algarve), supporting a sizeable population with harbour and a small airfield ([[Portim\u00e3o Airport]]) of its own with schedules flights to some domestic destinations by [[Aero VIP (Portugal)|Aero VIP]] (the larger [[Faro Airport|Faro International Airport]] is in the nearby district capital of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]).\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 3 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 99|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=29 July 2014|author=''[[Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica]]''|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n* [[Alvor (Portim\u00e3o)|Alvor]] (6,154 inhabitants, 2011)\n* [[Mexilhoeira Grande]] (4,029 inhabitants, 2011)\n* [[Portim\u00e3o (parish)|Portim\u00e3o]] (45,431 inhabitants, 2011)\n\nThe municipality is primarily serviced by the A22 motorway (the ''Via do Infante''), and the E.N.125 roadway that links it directly to \nthe communities of [[Alvor (Portim\u00e3o)|Alvor]] (4 kilometres), [[Mexilhoeira Grande (Portim\u00e3o)|Mexilhoeira Grande]] (9 kilometres) and [[Praia da Rocha]] (3 kilometres).\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|\n{{stack|\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Population of the<br> municipality of Portim\u00e3o<br><small>(1981\u20132011)</small>\n| 1981 | 34464\n| 1991 | 38883\n| 2001 | 44818\n| 2004 | 47189\n| 2011 | 55614 \n}}\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Portim\u00e3o\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan high C = 15.9\n|Feb high C = 16.6\n|Mar high C = 17.8\n|Apr high C = 19.7\n|May high C = 22.2\n|Jun high C = 25.3\n|Jul high C = 28.4\n|Aug high C = 28.8\n|Sep high C = 26.3\n|Oct high C = 22.9\n|Nov high C = 19.0\n|Dec high C = 16.6\n|year high C = \n\n|Jan mean C = 12.0\n|Feb mean C = 12.6\n|Mar mean C = 13.8\n|Apr mean C = 15.4\n|May mean C = 17.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.4\n|Jul mean C = 22.9\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 21.6\n|Oct mean C = 18.8\n|Nov mean C = 15.1\n|Dec mean C = 12.7\n|year mean C = \n\n|Jan low C = 8.2\n|Feb low C = 8.6\n|Mar low C = 9.9\n|Apr low C = 11.1\n|May low C = 13.0\n|Jun low C = 15.6\n|Jul low C = 17.5\n|Aug low C = 18.0\n|Sep low C = 16.9\n|Oct low C = 14.7\n|Nov low C = 11.3\n|Dec low C = 8.8\n|year low C = \n\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 79\n|Feb rain mm = 64\n|Mar rain mm = 45\n|Apr rain mm = 36\n|May rain mm = 21\n|Jun rain mm = 12\n|Jul rain mm = 1\n|Aug rain mm = 2\n|Sep rain mm = 14\n|Oct rain mm = 53\n|Nov rain mm = 77\n|Dec rain mm = 77\n|year rain mm = \n\n|Jan sun = 175\n|Feb sun = 191\n|Mar sun = 219\n|Apr sun = 276\n|May sun = 322\n|Jun sun = 352\n|Jul sun = 387\n|Aug sun = 363\n|Sep sun = 281\n|Oct sun = 235\n|Nov sun = 181\n|Dec sun = 180\n|year sun = \n\n|source 1 = Climate-data.org<ref name=Climate-data.org>{{cite web\n|url =https://en.climate-data.org/europe/portugal/portimao/portimao-999359/ |title =Portim\u00e3o Climate|publisher=climate-data.org|year=2020}}\nRetrieved on April 12, 2020.\n</ref>|source 2 = weather-and-climate.com<ref name=weather-and-climate>{{cite web\n|url = https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,praia-da-rocha,Portugal|title =Average Monthly Hours Of Sunshine In Praia Da Rocha (Algarve), Portugal|publisher=weather-and-climate|year=2020}}\nRetrieved on April 11, 2020.\n</ref>|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Aqua Shopping centre, Portim\u00e3o (2).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Aqua Shopping centre in Portim\u00e3o]] \n[[File:Praia da Rocha beach, Portim\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Praia da Rocha attracts numerous tourists]]\n\nThe community, which was founded on the right margin of the Arade River, and oriented towards the sea, is inserted in a region whose geography and physical characteristics justify a seafaring economy. Its maritime economy allowed the development of industries oriented towards salination of fish, the open-water fishing industry, conservation and canning, the construction of ships and transport. Further, the Arade basin permitted rural commerce associated with cultivation of [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]], fig, almonds and the saw-milling/forestry industry (including cork), among others.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, tourism became an accentuated economic factor in the regions growth, with the development of activities oriented towards the sea and development of seasonal infrastructures that permitted an influx of new money. By the beginning of the 21st century, 74% of the roughly 2000 annual overnight stays originated from the United Kingdom, Portugal and Ireland. Seasonal concentration (44%) usually occurred around the high-summer months (July, August and September).\n\nThe Algarve in general is a major draw for tourists. In 2018, the region's income from tourism was over a billion euros; the number of visitors totaled 4.2 million. The region's tourism contributed \u20ac1.08 billion to the economy in that year.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://algarvedailynews.com/news/16144-algarve-tourism-figures-now-in-for-2018 |title=Algarve tourism figures now in for 2018 |date=14 February 2019 |publisher=Algarve Daily News|access-date=25 November 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Prehistoric===\n* [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar]] ({{lang-pt|Monumentos de Alcalar/Conjunto Pr\u00e9-hist\u00f3rico de Alcalar}})\n\n===Civic===\n* [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada]] ({{lang-pt|Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Romana da Quinta da Abicada}})\n\n== Sports ==\nPortim\u00e3o is known for its sporting events, mostly [[water sports]], including [[surfing]] and [[kitesurfing]]; [[motorsport]]; [[beach soccer]]; and the professional football team [[Portimonense S.C.
