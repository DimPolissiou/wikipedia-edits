The average altitude above [[sea level]] is {{convert|220|m}}. The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice ages]]. The [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svislach River]], which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the ''[[urstromtal]]'', an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the [[Black Sea]] basin.\n\nMinsk is in the area of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]] typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the [[Chelyuskinites Park]]) as the city grew.\n\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}Minsk has a warm summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#Warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates|K\u00f6ppen ''Dfb'']]) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the dry air of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is {{convert|\u22124.5|\u00b0C}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|18.5|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at {{convert|\u221240|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at {{convert|35.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of {{convert|690|mm|in}}, of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{Clear}}{{Weather box|location=

After the 1569 [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]], the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews ([[Ashkenazim]], who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], many Minsk residents became [[Polonization|polonised]], adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAfter the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russians]] dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Russian Empire Census|1897 census]] under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents.<ref>Joshua D.

The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of [[Lipka Tatars]] had been living in Minsk for centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nBetween the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a [[Belarusian diaspora]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[File:Minsk memorial.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Jewish [[Holocaust]] memorial]]\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in [[the Holocaust]]. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to [[Israel]] and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic [[Belarusians]] increased markedly. Numerous skilled [[Russians]] and other migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]] migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 2004\">Zimmerman (2004), ''Poles, Jews, and Politics''</ref> In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and [[Tatars]] (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).<ref name=\"Zimmerman 2004\"/>\n\nAccording to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39%&nbsp;\u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13%&nbsp;\u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAccording to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]] many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry - in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe [[Jewish population]] of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to [[Israel]], the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from [[Tatarstan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nSome more recent [[minority group|ethnic minority]] communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the [[Caucasus]] countries \u2013 [[Armenians]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] and [[Georgians]] each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the [[retailing|retail trade]] in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of [[Romani people|Romani]], numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (which later developed into modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]). However, after 1569 the [[official language]] was [[Dialects of Polish#Northern Kresy dialect|Polish.]]<ref>Mi\u0119dzy Wschodem i Zachodem: international conference, Lublin, 18\u201321 June 1991</ref> In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the [[intelligentsia]]. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nA short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use [[Trasianka|Trasyanka]] (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe most commonly used and understood [[foreign language]] in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.<ref>{{cite journal|last=\u00d6stlund |first=Anders |title=LANGUAGES |date=13 July 2013 |url=http://fryday.net/languages/ |accessdate=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103021111/http://fryday.net/languages/ |archivedate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinese sinage, Main Railway Station, Minsk, Belarus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chinese signage, Minsk railway station (2018)]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally.

Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of [[Research and development|R&D]]-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in [[urban planning|urban development]] in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon').{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nHowever, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under [[Alexander Lukashenko]]'s government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]]. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nMajor industrial employers include:\n*[[Minsk Tractor Works|Minsk Tractor Plant]]&nbsp;\u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors.

Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nPublic transport fares are controlled by ''city's executive committee'' (city council).

Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: [[Masko\u016dskaja Line|Masko\u016dskaja]] and [[A\u016dtazavodskaja Line|A\u016dtazavodskaja]], which are {{convert|18.1|and|17.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) {{convert|58.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{As of|2013}} Minsk metro had 28 stations and {{convert|35.5|km|0|abbr=off}} of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrl.ucsb.edu/~yopopov/rrt/maps/statistics.html |title=CIS Metro Statistics |publisher=Mrl.ucsb.edu |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metropoliten.by/o_metropolitene/metro_today |title=\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f |publisher=metropoliten.b|date=2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] (behind Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv]]). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nCurrently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n[[File:Belarus-Minsk-Central Bus Station.jpg|thumb|Minsk Central Bus Station]]\n[[File:Minsk-Central-Bus-Station.jpg|thumb|Minsk Central Bus Station Nowadays]]\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the [[Warsaw]]-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the [[Liep\u0101ja|Liepaja]]-[[Romny]] railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the [[Minsk Passazhirsky railway station|Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'']] railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as ''Vilenski vakzal''. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'' railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all [[Regional rail|suburban rail]] traffic from Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'' to the smaller stations, Minsk-\n''Uschodni'' (East), Minsk-''Pa\u016ddniovy'' (South) and Minsk-''Pa\u016dno\u010dny'' (North), by 2020.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Riga]], [[Kiev]] and [[Warsaw]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Airports ===\n\n[[Minsk National Airport]] is located {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current [[railway station]] opened in 1987. It is an [[international airport]] with flights to Europe and the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n'''[[Minsk-1 Airport|Minsk-1]]''' opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1&nbsp;million passengers a year.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFrom 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, [[Kiev]] and [[Kaliningrad]]. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as [[Minsk-City]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nMinsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is situated in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.world-airport-codes.com/belarus/borovaya-airfield-82793.html | title=Borovaya Airfield - Belarus}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://minsk.edu.by/|script-title=ru:\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430|trans-title=Committee of Education (Minsk City Executive Committee)|language=ru|accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> and 29 higher education institutions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.by/sistema-obrazovaniya/glavnoe-upravlenie-professionalnogo-obrazovaniya/vysshee-obrazovanie/|script-title=ru:\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|trans-title=the management of higher education|language=ru|accessdate=23 July 2018|publisher=Ministry of education of the Republic of Belarus}}</ref> including 12 major national universities. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\n\n*[[Academy of Public Administration (Belarus)|Academy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus]].

Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan]] [[resistance movement]] against the invasion, in what is known as the ''[[Eastern Front (World War II)|German-Soviet War]]''. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title ''[[Hero City]]'' in 1974.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{Main|Minsk Offensive}}\n[[File:Detail of War Memorial - Victory Square - Minsk - Belarus (27427130872).jpg|thumb|War memorial in [[Victory Square, Minsk|Victory Square]], Minsk.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-137-1010-37A, Minsk, deutsche Truppen vor modernen Geb\u00e4uden.jpg|left|thumb|German troops marching through Minsk.]]\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during [[Operation Bagration]]. The city was the centre of German resistance to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, [[power station]]s, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble.

As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an [[Financial crisis|economic crisis]] and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new ''[[Microdistrict|mikroraions]]'' of [[residential area|residential development]] have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the [[MKAD (Minsk)|Minsk BeltWay]]) has been improved.

The average altitude above [[sea level]] is {{convert|220|m}}. The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice ages]]. The [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svislach River]], which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the ''[[urstromtal]]'', an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the [[Black Sea]] basin.\n\nMinsk is in the area of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]] typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the [[Chelyuskinites Park]]) as the city grew.\n\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}Minsk has a warm summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#Warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates|K\u00f6ppen ''Dfb'']]) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the dry air of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is {{convert|\u22124.5|\u00b0C}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|18.5|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at {{convert|\u221240|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at {{convert|35.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of {{convert|690|mm|in}}, of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{Clear}}{{Weather box|location=

After the 1569 [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]], the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews ([[Ashkenazim]], who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], many Minsk residents became [[Polonization|polonised]], adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAfter the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russians]] dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Russian Empire Census|1897 census]] under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents.<ref>Joshua D. Zimmerman, ''Poles, Jews and the Politics of Nationality'', Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-299-19464-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&pg=PA16&dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=HS_3SZ2-NITyzQSUtaWtBQ Google Print, p.16]</ref> Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of [[Lipka Tatars]] had been living in Minsk for centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nBetween the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a [[Belarusian diaspora]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[File:Minsk memorial.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Jewish [[Holocaust]] memorial]]\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in [[the Holocaust]]. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to [[Israel]] and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic [[Belarusians]] increased markedly. Numerous skilled [[Russians]] and other migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]] migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 2004\">Zimmerman (2004), ''Poles, Jews, and Politics''</ref> In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and [[Tatars]] (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).<ref name=\"Zimmerman 2004\"/>\n\nAccording to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39%&nbsp;\u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13%&nbsp;\u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAccording to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]] many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry - in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe [[Jewish population]] of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to [[Israel]], the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from [[Tatarstan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nSome more recent [[minority group|ethnic minority]] communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the [[Caucasus]] countries \u2013 [[Armenians]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] and [[Georgians]] each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the [[retailing|retail trade]] in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of [[Romani people|Romani]], numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (which later developed into modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]). However, after 1569 the [[official language]] was [[Dialects of Polish#Northern Kresy dialect|Polish.]]<ref>Mi\u0119dzy Wschodem i Zachodem: international conference, Lublin, 18\u201321 June 1991</ref> In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the [[intelligentsia]]. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nA short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use [[Trasianka|Trasyanka]] (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe most commonly used and understood [[foreign language]] in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.<ref>{{cite journal|last=\u00d6stlund |first=Anders |title=LANGUAGES |date=13 July 2013 |url=http://fryday.net/languages/ |accessdate=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103021111/http://fryday.net/languages/ |archivedate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinese sinage, Main Railway Station, Minsk, Belarus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chinese signage, Minsk railway station (2018)]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church]], which is the exarchate of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Belarus. There is a significant minority of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAs of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various

Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of [[Research and development|R&D]]-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in [[urban planning|urban development]] in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon').{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nHowever, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under [[Alexander Lukashenko]]'s government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s.

Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: [[Masko\u016dskaja Line|Masko\u016dskaja]] and [[A\u016dtazavodskaja Line|A\u016dtazavodskaja]], which are {{convert|18.1|and|17.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) {{convert|58.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{As of|2013}} Minsk metro had 28 stations and {{convert|35.5|km|0|abbr=off}} of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrl.ucsb.edu/~yopopov/rrt/maps/statistics.html |title=CIS Metro Statistics |publisher=Mrl.ucsb.edu |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metropoliten.by/o_metropolitene/metro_today |title=\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f |publisher=metropoliten.b|date=2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] (behind Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv]]). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nCurrently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n[[File:Belarus-Minsk-Central Bus Station.jpg|thumb|Minsk Central Bus Station]]\n[[File:Minsk-Central-Bus-Station.jpg|thumb|Minsk Central Bus Station Nowadays]]\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the [[Warsaw]]-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the [[Liep\u0101ja|Liepaja]]-[[Romny]] railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the [[Minsk Passazhirsky railway station|Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'']] railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as ''Vilenski vakzal''. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'' railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all [[Regional rail|suburban rail]] traffic from Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'' to the smaller stations, Minsk-\n''Uschodni'' (East), Minsk-''Pa\u016ddniovy'' (South) and Minsk-''Pa\u016dno\u010dny'' (North), by 2020.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Riga]], [[Kiev]] and [[Warsaw]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Airports ===\n\n[[Minsk National Airport]] is located {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current [[railway station]] opened in 1987. It is an [[international airport]] with flights to Europe and the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n'''[[Minsk-1 Airport|Minsk-1]]''' opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1&nbsp;million passengers a year.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFrom 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, [[Kiev]] and [[Kaliningrad]]. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as [[Minsk-City]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nMinsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is situated in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.world-airport-codes.com/belarus/borovaya-airfield-82793.html | title=Borovaya Airfield - Belarus}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://minsk.edu.by/|script-title=ru:\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430|trans-title=Committee of Education (Minsk City Executive Committee)|language=ru|accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> and 29 higher education institutions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.by/sistema-obrazovaniya/glavnoe-upravlenie-professionalnogo-obrazovaniya/vysshee-obrazovanie/|script-title=ru:\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|trans-title=the management of higher education|language=ru|accessdate=23 July 2018|publisher=Ministry of education of the Republic of Belarus}}</ref> including 12 major national universities. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\n\n*[[Academy of Public Administration (Belarus)|Academy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus]].

Like other sturgeons, this species is an evolutionarily ancient bottom feeder with a partly [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] skeleton, an overall streamlined shape and skin bearing rows of bony plates on its sides and back, resembling an armored torpedo. The fish uses its elongated, spade-like snout to stir up the substrate and sediments on the beds of rivers and lakes while feeding. The lake sturgeon has four purely sensory organs that dangle near its mouth. These organs, called barbels, help the sturgeon to locate bottom-dwelling prey. Lake sturgeons can grow to a relatively large size, topping 7.25&nbsp;ft (2.2 m) long and weighing over 240&nbsp;lb (108&nbsp;kg).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lakescientist.com/record-lake-sturgeon-caught-in-wisconsin/ |title=Record lake sturgeon caught in Wisconsin |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423144142/http://www.lakescientist.com/record-lake-sturgeon-caught-in-wisconsin/ |archive-date=23 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe lake sturgeon has [[taste buds]] on and around its barbels near its rubbery, [[prehensile]] [[lip]]s. It extends its lips to vacuum up soft live food, which it swallows whole due to its lack of teeth. Its diet consists of insect larvae, worms (including leeches), and other small organisms (primarily [[metazoa]]n) it finds in the mud.

It occurs in the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Detroit River]], east down the [[St. Lawrence River]] to the limits of fresh water. In the west, it reaches [[Lake Winnipeg]] and the [[North Saskatchewan]] and [[South Saskatchewan]] Rivers. In the north, it is found in the [[Hudson Bay Lowland]].<ref>Scott, W.B. and E.J. Crossman. 1972. Freshwater Fisheries of Canada. Fisheries Research Board of Canada, Department of the Environment, Ottawa. p. 83-84.</ref> In the east, the species lives in [[Lake Champlain]] and in some Vermont rivers, including the Winooski, Lamoille and Missisquoi rivers, and Otter Creek. This distribution makes sense in that all these areas were linked by the large lakes that formed as the glaciers retreated from North America at the end of the last ice age (e.g., [[Lake Agassiz]], [[Glacial Lake Iroquois|Lake Iroquois]]).\n\nThese sturgeon often migrate in search of food or suitable spawning locations, or in response to seasonal environmental conditions. Juveniles typically inhabit pools greater than about 6 feet in depth, and adults typically live deep in large lakes. They are not often far from suitable spawning locations. The abundance of prey also plays a large factor in finding a suitable habitat.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Life Cycle==\nLake sturgeon have a very long lifespan.

When the eggs are mature, they become olive green, grey or black. The eggs typically hatch after 8 to 14 days. Observations suggest male lake sturgeon and other fish and invertebrates likely consume some fertilized eggs while on the spawning grounds.\n\nAt hatching, the larvae are barely discernible and are about 10&nbsp;mm long. The larvae soon become [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]], remaining far from the surface and bed, and [[Phototactic|negatively phototactic]], or attracted to darkness, while searching for rocky places to hide. About two weeks after hatching, they disperse downstream with the current for several miles until settling back down upon the river bottom.\n\nAs juveniles, all definitive adult structures, except for gonads, form. They are thought to feed on [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates like adults. It is thought that during late summer, yearlings gather in large schools in shallow river mouths and bays. The juveniles can be found in the same habitats as adults after a year.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nMale lake sturgeon typically reach sexual maturity at 8 to 12 years, but may take up to 22 years. Females reach sexual maturity at 14 to 33 years, most often from 24 to 26 years of age. These sturgeon spawn on clean, gravel shoals and stream rapids, usually from April to June. They prefer to spawn in temperatures between 55 and 64 degrees Fahrenheit.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lake sturgeon reproduce by swimming around each other in circles and shaking violently; the male stops circling when he has released his fertilizer and the female then lays her eggs.<ref>Scott, W.B. and E.J.

When their meat and eggs became prized, commercial fishermen targeted them. Between 1879 and 1900, the Great Lakes commercial sturgeon fishery brought in an average of 4 million pounds (1800 metric tons) per year. Such unsustainable catch rates were coupled with environmental challenges such as pollution and the construction of dams and other flood control measures. Sturgeon, which return each spring to spawn in the streams and rivers in which they were born, found tributaries blocked and spawning shoals destroyed by silt from agriculture and lumbering. In the 20th century, drastic drops in sturgeon catches, increased regulations, and the closure of viable fisheries occurred. Currently, 19 of the 20 states within the fish's original U.S. range list it as either threatened or endangered.\n\nThis sturgeon is a valuable gourmet food fish, as well as a source of specialty products including [[caviar]] and [[isinglass]]. \"In 1860, this species, taken on incidental catches of other fishes, was killed and dumped back in the lake, piled up on shore to dry and be burned, fed to pigs, or dug into the earth as fertilizer.\"<ref name=\"Scott, W.B 1972. p. 88\">Scott, W.B. and E.J. Crossman. 1972. Freshwater Fisheries of Canada. Fisheries Research Board of Canada, Department of the Environment, Ottawa. p. 88.</ref> It was even stacked like cordwood and used to fuel [[steamboat]]s. Once its value was realized, \"They were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trap nets, pound nets and gillnets.\"<ref name=\"Scott, W.B 1972. p. 88\"/> Over 5 million lb were taken from Lake Erie in a single year. The fishery collapsed, largely by 1900. They have never recovered. Like most sturgeons, the lake sturgeon is rare now and is protected in many areas.\n\nIn addition to overharvesting, it has also been negatively affected by pollution and loss of migratory waterways. It is vulnerable to population declines through [[overfishing]] due to its extremely slow reproductive cycle; most individuals caught before 20 years of age have never bred and females spawn only once every four or five years. The specific harvesting of breeding females for their [[roe]] is also damaging to population size. Few individuals ever reach the extreme old age or large size that those of previous generations often did.\n\n===Restoration===\nIn 2001, transmitters placed into ten sturgeon and egg mats placed in the Detroit River documented spawning of sturgeon for the first time in many decades.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Spawning by lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in the Detroit River |author=Caswell, N.M. |author2=D.L.

In 2002 they successfully documented natural reproduction of lake sturgeon by capturing larvae (newly hatched fish) from the Big Manistee River. The Streamside Rearing Facility for lake sturgeon on the Big Manistee River became operational in the spring of 2004 and marked the first time this technique had ever been used for this species. Since that time there have been five SRFs operated within the Lake Michigan Basin built on the same LRBOI design. Many agencies now collaborate on this effort including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, States of Michigan and Wisconsin, and many other partners. The LRBOI Nm\u00e9 Stewardship Plan, created by biologists and Tribal members, was published in 2005 as a guiding document for the LRBOI sturgeon program and sturgeon restoration. New York State has also had a successful recovery program, using eggs and sperm collected from a spawning area on the [[St. Lawrence River]]. In early June 2017, aquatic biologists conducted the annual assisted propagation effort, through which 130,000 fertilized eggs were sent to hatcheries.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ferre-Sadurni|first1=Luis|title=How New York is Saving a Fish that Swam with Dinosaurs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/nyregion/how-new-york-is-saving-a-fish-that-swam-with-dinosaurs.html?&moduleDetail=section-news&action=click&contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&version=WhatsNext&contentID=WhatsNext&pgtype=article|accessdate=2017-06-13|work=New York Times|date=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nSeveral populations of lake sturgeon have experienced levels of restoration with help of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. There are fisheries located from North Carolina all the way to the Great Lakes that not only support restoration of lake sturgeon populations. However, many lake sturgeon populations still remain imperiled. The USFWS is going through measures to restore the species of lake sturgeon by recording abundance, distribution, age, growth and health of the species. Lake sturgeon are tagged and released by the USFWS to capture a better understanding of their life cycle. While strict regulations have been put in place to monitor harvests, hatcheries have been heavily used in restoration efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/fisheries/lake-sturgeon.html|title=Lake Sturgeon|website=USFWS|publisher=USFWS|accessdate=21 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820025913/https://www.fws.gov/midwest/fisheries/lake-sturgeon.html|archive-date=20 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Recreational fishing==\nToday, limited sturgeon fishing seasons are permitted in only a few areas, including some locations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Fishing for sturgeon is allowed on [[Black Lake (Michigan)|Black Lake]] in Michigan, for example, but the fishery is limited to five total fish taken each year, each over {{convert|36|in|mm|abbr=on}} and taken through the ice with spears.\n\nAnglers in Minnesota have the opportunity to harvest one lake sturgeon per calendar year between 45 and 50&nbsp;in on the [[Rainy River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Rainy River]], and [[Lake of the Woods]] on the Canada\u2013US border. The early season runs from April 24 to May 7 each year with the late season running from July 1 to September 30. Anglers must have a valid Minnesota fishing license and purchase a sturgeon tag to harvest a lake sturgeon.\n\nAn annual sturgeon spearing season is open on [[Lake Winnebago]] in Wisconsin. It has changed from a 16-day season in the past to a season with a marked quota, but the season can still run for the full 16 days. If 90\u201399% of the quota is reached on any day, the season is over at 1:00 pm the following day.

It is also a game fish with a harvest limit of one per day. <!-- It is probably the only place where it is fairly common to catch one. -->\n\nWolf Lake State Fish Hatchery in Kalamazoo, MI, raises and releases lake sturgeon. The lake sturgeon are produced mainly for inland waters, although a few are stocked in Great Lakes waters.\n\nThere is also a streamside rearing facility near [[Onaway, Michigan]] on the [[Black River (Cheboygan County)|Black River]], a tributary of the [[Cheboygan River]], then Lake Huron. The facility is run and managed by the [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]], [[Michigan State University]], and Tower Kliber. Each year hundreds to thousands of sturgeon are raised and released into [[Black Lake (Michigan)|Black Lake]], and other surrounding areas. Adult sturgeon are caught in the river, their eggs and sperm are extracted and then taken back to the hatchery for fertilization, and left to incubate. Hatched larvae are also caught in the river with drift nets. The hatchery is open to the public, and people can also watch the hatchery workers catch the fish.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Lake sturgeon (Batchawana B) 2.JPG|Lake sturgeon, Batchawana Bay, Lake Superior (live released)\nFile:Lakesturgeon public U.S.Fish&Wildlife.jpg|Lake sturgeon\nFile:Juvenile lake sturgeon (Goulais B) 2.JPG|Juvenile lake sturgeon<br />Goulais Bay, Lake Superior\nFile:Juvenile lake sturgeon (Goulais B) 3.JPG|Juvenile lake sturgeon<br />Goulais Bay, Lake Superior\nFile:Oh hey there baby lake sturgeon!

Juveniles typically inhabit pools greater than about 6 feet in depth, and adults typically live deep in large lakes. They are not often far from suitable spawning locations. The abundance of prey also plays a large factor in finding a suitable habitat.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Life Cycle==\nLake sturgeon have a very long lifespan.

When the eggs are mature, they become olive green, grey or black. The eggs typically hatch after 8 to 14 days. Observations suggest male lake sturgeon and other fish and invertebrates likely consume some fertilized eggs while on the spawning grounds.\n\nAt hatching, the larvae are barely discernible and are about 10&nbsp;mm long. The larvae soon become [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]], remaining far from the surface and bed, and [[Phototactic|negatively phototactic]], or attracted to darkness, while searching for rocky places to hide. About two weeks after hatching, they disperse downstream with the current for several miles until settling back down upon the river bottom.\n\nAs juveniles, all definitive adult structures, except for gonads, form. They are thought to feed on [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates like adults. It is thought that during late summer, yearlings gather in large schools in shallow river mouths and bays. The juveniles can be found in the same habitats as adults after a year.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nMale lake sturgeon typically reach sexual maturity at 8 to 12 years, but may take up to 22 years. Females reach sexual maturity at 14 to 33 years, most often from 24 to 26 years of age. These sturgeon spawn on clean, gravel shoals and stream rapids, usually from April to June. They prefer to spawn in temperatures between 55 and 64 degrees Fahrenheit.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lake sturgeon reproduce by swimming around each other in circles and shaking violently; the male stops circling when he has released his fertilizer and the female then lays her eggs.<ref>Scott, W.B. and E.J.

When their meat and eggs became prized, commercial fishermen targeted them. Between 1879 and 1900, the Great Lakes commercial sturgeon fishery brought in an average of 4 million pounds (1800 metric tons) per year. Such unsustainable catch rates were coupled with environmental challenges such as pollution and the construction of dams and other flood control measures. Sturgeon, which return each spring to spawn in the streams and rivers in which they were born, found tributaries blocked and spawning shoals destroyed by silt from agriculture and lumbering. In the 20th century, drastic drops in sturgeon catches, increased regulations, and the closure of viable fisheries occurred. Currently, 19 of the 20 states within the fish's original U.S. range list it as either threatened or endangered.\n\nThis sturgeon is a valuable gourmet food fish, as well as a source of specialty products including [[caviar]] and [[isinglass]]. \"In 1860, this species, taken on incidental catches of other fishes, was killed and dumped back in the lake, piled up on shore to dry and be burned, fed to pigs, or dug into the earth as fertilizer.\"<ref name=\"Scott, W.B 1972. p. 88\">Scott, W.B. and E.J. Crossman. 1972. Freshwater Fisheries of Canada. Fisheries Research Board of Canada, Department of the Environment, Ottawa. p. 88.</ref> It was even stacked like cordwood and used to fuel [[steamboat]]s. Once its value was realized, \"They were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trap nets, pound nets and gillnets.\"<ref name=\"Scott, W.B 1972. p. 88\"/> Over 5 million lb were taken from Lake Erie in a single year. The fishery collapsed, largely by 1900. They have never recovered. Like most sturgeons, the lake sturgeon is rare now and is protected in many areas.\n\nIn addition to overharvesting, it has also been negatively affected by pollution and loss of migratory waterways. It is vulnerable to population declines through [[overfishing]] due to its extremely slow reproductive cycle; most individuals caught before 20 years of age have never bred and females spawn only once every four or five years. The specific harvesting of breeding females for their [[roe]] is also damaging to population size. Few individuals ever reach the extreme old age or large size that those of previous generations often did.\n\n===Restoration===\nIn 2001, transmitters placed into ten sturgeon and egg mats placed in the Detroit River documented spawning of sturgeon for the first time in many decades.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Spawning by lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in the Detroit River |author=Caswell, N.M. |author2=D.L.

In 2002 they successfully documented natural reproduction of lake sturgeon by capturing larvae (newly hatched fish) from the Big Manistee River. The Streamside Rearing Facility for lake sturgeon on the Big Manistee River became operational in the spring of 2004 and marked the first time this technique had ever been used for this species. Since that time there have been five SRFs operated within the Lake Michigan Basin built on the same LRBOI design. Many agencies now collaborate on this effort including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, States of Michigan and Wisconsin, and many other partners. The LRBOI Nm\u00e9 Stewardship Plan, created by biologists and Tribal members, was published in 2005 as a guiding document for the LRBOI sturgeon program and sturgeon restoration. \nNew York State has also had a successful recovery program, using eggs and sperm collected from a spawning area on the [[St. Lawrence River]].  In early June 2017, aquatic biologists conducted the annual assisted propagation effort, through which 130,000 fertilized eggs were sent to hatcheries.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ferre-Sadurni|first1=Luis|title=How New York is Saving a Fish that Swam with Dinosaurs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/nyregion/how-new-york-is-saving-a-fish-that-swam-with-dinosaurs.html?&moduleDetail=section-news&action=click&contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&version=WhatsNext&contentID=WhatsNext&pgtype=article|accessdate=2017-06-13|work=New York Times|date=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nSeveral populations of lake sturgeon have experienced levels of restoration with help of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. There are fisheries located from North Carolina all the way to the Great Lakes that not only support restoration of lake sturgeon populations. However, many lake sturgeon populations still remain imperiled. The USFWS is going through measures to restore the species of lake sturgeon by recording abundance, distribution, age, growth and health of the species. Lake sturgeon are tagged and released by the USFWS to capture a better understanding of their life cycle. While strict regulations have been put in place to monitor harvests, hatcheries have been heavily used in restoration efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/fisheries/lake-sturgeon.html|title=Lake Sturgeon|website=USFWS|publisher=USFWS|accessdate=21 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820025913/https://www.fws.gov/midwest/fisheries/lake-sturgeon.html|archive-date=20 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Recreational fishing==\nToday, limited sturgeon fishing seasons are permitted in only a few areas, including some locations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Fishing for sturgeon is allowed on [[Black Lake (Michigan)|Black Lake]] in Michigan, for example, but the fishery is limited to five total fish taken each year, each over {{convert|36|in|mm|abbr=on}} and taken through the ice with spears.\n\nAnglers in Minnesota have the opportunity to harvest one lake sturgeon per calendar year between 45 and 50&nbsp;in on the [[Rainy River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Rainy River]], and [[Lake of the Woods]] on the Canada\u2013US border. The early season runs from April 24 to May 7 each year with the late season running from July 1 to September 30. Anglers must have a valid Minnesota fishing license and purchase a sturgeon tag to harvest a lake sturgeon.\n\nAn annual sturgeon spearing season is open on [[Lake Winnebago]] in Wisconsin. It has changed from a 16-day season in the past to a season with a marked quota, but the season can still run for the full 16 days. If 90\u201399% of the quota is reached on any day, the season is over at 1:00 pm the following day. If 100% (or more) of the quota is reached, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources can enable an emergency stoppage rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.wi.gov/fish/regulations/2007/sturgeonspearing.html |title=Fishing Wisconsin: Lake Winnebago Sturgeon Spearing Regulations for 2007 |date=8 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422224714/http://dnr.wi.gov/fish/regulations/2007/sturgeonspearing.html |archivedate=22 April 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2016 }}</ref> In 2012, the largest sturgeon ever caught on Lake Winnebago (a female) was 125 years old, weighed 240&nbsp;lb., and measured 87.5 in. in length.

It is also a game fish with a harvest limit of one per day. <!-- It is probably the only place where it is fairly common to catch one. -->\n\nWolf Lake State Fish Hatchery in Kalamazoo, MI, raises and releases lake sturgeon. The lake sturgeon are produced mainly for inland waters, although a few are stocked in Great Lakes waters.\n\nThere is also a streamside rearing facility near [[Onaway, Michigan]] on the [[Black River (Cheboygan County)|Black River]], a tributary of the [[Cheboygan River]], then Lake Huron. The facility is run and managed by the [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]], [[Michigan State University]], and Tower Kliber. Each year hundreds to thousands of sturgeon are raised and released into [[Black Lake (Michigan)|Black Lake]], and other surrounding areas. Adult sturgeon are caught in the river, their eggs and sperm are extracted and then taken back to the hatchery for fertilization, and left to incubate. Hatched larvae are also caught in the river with drift nets. The hatchery is open to the public, and people can also watch the hatchery workers catch the fish.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Lake sturgeon (Batchawana B) 2.JPG|Lake sturgeon, Batchawana Bay, Lake Superior (live released)\nFile:Lakesturgeon public U.S.Fish&Wildlife.jpg|Lake sturgeon\nFile:Juvenile lake sturgeon (Goulais B) 2.JPG|Juvenile lake sturgeon<br />Goulais Bay, Lake Superior\nFile:Juvenile lake sturgeon (Goulais B) 3.JPG|Juvenile lake sturgeon<br />Goulais Bay, Lake Superior\nFile:Oh hey there baby lake sturgeon!
