The stadium was opened on 12 August 2000 and stands on the site of the club's old pitch. The club name is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"The County\". They are nicknamed ''Superboeren'' (\"Super Farmers\").\n\nWhile not a large club by European club football standards, the club has remained a semi-permanent fixture in the [[Eredivisie]] (top league); although to date it has never won any silverware of importance. It also has a large stadium and a large fan base when compared to many other Dutch teams, particularly those in the [[Eerste Divisie]]. They had a fierce rivalry with [[Vitesse Arnhem]], but during the years due several circumstances [[Go Ahead Eagles]] began to be a rival as well.\n\nThe club's colors are blue and white hooped shirts with white shorts and blue socks. The club's major sponsors are [[Pincvision]] and {{ill|ATAG (company)|lt=ATAG|nl|ATAG}}.\n\nDe Graafschap's home base, De Vijverberg has been voted as the most atmospheric stadium in the [[Eredivisie]] for the [[2018-19 Eredivisie|2018-19]] campaign\n\n==History==\nDe Graafschap had their longest streak in the Dutch top tier from 1995 until 2003.

After this season results went down and in 2003 the club was relegated after finishing in last place (18th).\n\nSince 2003, De Graafschap was relegated four times and gained promotion five times.

is a professional [[association football|football]] club from [[Doetinchem]], Netherlands, playing in the [[Eerste divisie]], the second professional tier of football in the Netherlands.\n\nIt was formed on 1 February 1954 and they play their home games at the De Vijverberg stadium. The stadium was opened on 12 August 2000 and stands on the site of the club's old pitch. The club name is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"The County\". They are nicknamed ''Superboeren'' (\"Super Farmers\").\n\nWhile not a large club by European club football standards, the club has remained a semi-permanent fixture in the [[Eredivisie]] (top league); although to date it has never won any silverware of importance. It also has a large stadium and a large fan base when compared to many other Dutch teams, particularly those in the [[Eerste Divisie]]. They had a fierce rivalry with [[Vitesse Arnhem]], but during the years due several circumstances [[Go Ahead Eagles]] began to be a rival as well.\n\nThe club's colors are blue and white hooped shirts with white shorts and blue socks. The club's major sponsors are [[Pincvision]] and {{ill|ATAG (company)|lt=ATAG|nl|ATAG}}.\n\nDe Graafschap's home base, De Vijverberg has been voted as the most atmospheric stadium in the [[Eredivisie]] for the [[2018-19 Eredivisie|2018-19]] campaign\n\n==History==\nDe Graafschap had their longest streak in the Dutch top tier from 1995 until 2003. In the 1995-96 season De Graafschap finished in 8th place, an all time high. After this season results went down and in 2003 the club was relegated after finishing in last place (18th).\n\nSince 2003, De Graafschap was relegated four times and gained promotion five times. They were crowned champions of the Eerste Divisie in 2007 and 2010, and won the promotion playoffs in 2004 and 2015.<ref>[http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/nationaal/24101401/__De_Graafschap_terug_in_eredivisie__.html De Graafschap terug in eredivisie]&nbsp;\u2013 Telegraaf {{in lang|nl}}</ref> De Graafschap never finished last in the Eredivisie since 2003 but lost relegation playoffs after finishing in 17th place in 2005, 2009 and 2012.<ref>[http://nos.nl/artikel/372611-de-graafschap-gedegradeerd.html De Graafschap gedegradeerd]&nbsp;\u2013 NOS {{in lang|nl}}</ref> In the 2015-16 Eredivisie season De Graafschap were once again relegated through playoffs after finishing 17th but not before drawing 1-1 against [[AFC Ajax]] on the final day of the season, denying Ajax the championship. In 2018, the club gained promotion again by winning the promotion playoffs, beating [[Almere City FC]] in the playoffs finals.

The CPC (ML) has been registered with [[Elections Canada]] as the '''Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada''' since 1974 as the party is prohibited from using the Communist Party name in [[Canadian elections]] to avoid confusion among voters. The party developed separately and independently from the [[Communist Party of Canada]] (CPC) with its origins among students and intellectuals in Canada during the 1960s. After a period of alignment with [[Maoism]] and [[China]], the CPC (ML) pursued a pro-[[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]]n line until the early 1990s when it adopted a pro-[[Cuba]] position.\n\nFor most of its history the CPC (ML) was led by its founder, Hardial Bains. After his death his widow Sandra L. Smith became [[Secretary (title)|First Secretary]]. Elections Canada lists Anna DiCarlo as head of the electorally registered organization. None of the party's candidates has been elected. Since the 1970s, it has had a larger electoral campaign presence than the CPC. It ran its largest number of candidates in [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]] when it nominated 177 candidates, contesting 63 percent of the electoral districts.\n\nIt publishes an online news site and usually runs about 70 candidates in federal elections.

It was created primarily as a result of the efforts of Indo-Canadian Marxist student activist [[Hardial Bains]], who was the founder and national leader of the CPC (ML) until his death in 1997. The CPC (ML) was not created from a split from the [[Communist Party of Canada]] (CPC). The party emerged during a period of growing student and youth activism. At this time the CPC was still struggling to break out of isolation it faced during the [[Cold War]], and from a major rupture in the international communist movement between the People's Republic of [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] which the CPC had traditionally supported.\n\n=== Hardial Bains and the Sino-Soviet split ===\nBains came from [[Mahilpur]] in [[Hoshiarpur district]] of [[Punjab state]], [[India]]. His family were members or supporters of the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI)<ref name=\"First Anniversary\">http://www.leninism.org/stream/98/hardial-1st-anniv.htm; Ben Seattle, \"On the 1st anniversary of the death of a charlatan\"</ref> and he joined its youth wing.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The CPI that Bains knew as a teenager was a mass and militant party. Operating underground for part of the 1950s, the CPI won back its legality in time for the general elections of 1957, where it emerged as the largest opposition party in the country and held state government in [[Kerala]]. By this time, however, a young Bains had apparently quit the CPI in protest of its acceptance of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s criticisms of [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"Short History\">http://www.irishleftreview.org/2010/05/18/internationalists-communist-party-ireland-marxistleninist-part-19651970/; Connor McCabe, \"Short history of the Irish Internationalists,\" Irish Left Review, May 2010.</ref> Bains, according to the CPC (ML)'s official biography, immigrated to Canada from India two years later in 1959 at age nineteen.

Developing from 1960 on, sharp polemics over revolutionary strategy were exchanged between the two countries. Then, in 1962 the [[Sino-Indian War]] broke out and the CPI was again repressed by the Indian government. Over differences in attitude to the war, the CPI fractured and Hardial's parents joined the pro-China [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]].<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/>\n\nIn Canada, the Sino-Soviet split was less sharply divisive than demoralizing for the communists. In the ensuing fifteen years, the [[Communist Party of Canada]] (CPC) had lost all of its limited gains in parliament under the pressure of the [[Cold War]], and Communist MP [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]] was jailed for sedition. Anti-communism in the labour movement resulted in the expulsion of all communist-led unions from the house of labour, and communists in general were treated as traitors. Following the 1956 revelations by Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (\"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]\") about the crimes of [[Joseph Stalin]], the CPC suffered many resignations, and its youth organization, the [[Young Communist League of Canada|National Federation of Labour Youth]], fell apart briefly. By the time it was reorganized as the Socialist Youth League in the late 1950s, the CPC had lost much of its prior visibility on university campuses\u2014including the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC).\n\n=== The Internationalists ===\nBains arrived at UBC in this vacuum of visible, public revolutionary politics on campus and just as a new generation of student activism was radicalizing.

Within a few years Bain's group had succeeded in recruiting several hundred members across Canada, including Quebec, without the help of prominent former CPC leaders who had left the CPC and sided with China, such as former MP [[Dorise Nielsen]] or labour activist [[Jack Scott (activist)|Jack Scott]].<ref name=Encyclopedia>\"The Second Wave of Anti-Revisionism, 1971-1981,\" Encyclopedia of Revisionism On Line</ref> Meanwhile, and throughout the 1960s, the CPC was struggling to make its presence felt and grasp what its General Secretary [[Leslie Morris]] called \"the Challenge of the 60s\". The CPC's youth organization experimented with a more decentralized model until the late 1960s when it reorganized (one of the few instances of CPC members quitting for the CPC (ML) was that of a CPC youth activist from UBC who was accused of stealing a magazine subscription list and funds, and then joining the CPC (ML)).<ref>Ben Issit, Militant Minority: British Columbia Workers and the Rise of a New Left, U of T Press, 2011</ref> In many places, in size and particularly youthfulness, the CPC (ML) was beginning to rival the CPC.\n\n== Maoism ==\nIn 1968 the Internationalists renamed themselves the \"Canadian Student Movement\" and then the \"Canadian Communist Movement (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\". On March 31, 1970, they declared themselves a formal political party, adopting the name \"Communist Party of Canada (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\". After a legal challenge from the CPC because of confusion at the ballot, Elections Canada ruled that the party's preferred name was too close to that of the CPC, and since that time the party has been known electorally as the Marxist\u2013Leninist Party. The party ran candidates for the [[House of Commons of Canada]] during the [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974 federal election]] under the name of the \"Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada\". Because of the upsurge of left nationalism in Quebec, two separate parties were maintained until 1974 when the PCQ (ML) was folded into the CPC (ML). The Quebec party defined a twin struggle against \"Anglo-Canadian colonialism\" and U.S. imperialism.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>\n\nHistorians of [[anti-revisionism]] in Canada have described the CPC (ML) as standing out among the Canadian left because of its dedication to China and Mao Zedong \u2013 with slogans such as \"China's path is our path\" and \"China's chairman is our chairman.\" The CPC (ML) made a point of presenting its leader almost as a brand.

By the mid-1970s there were at least five anti-revisionist, pro-China parties in Canada which debated forcefully with each other and\u2014in particular\u2014strongly condemned the CPC.<ref>For example: https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.firstwave/learnfromtheteachers/learnfrom.htm</ref> This included Quebec-based [[:fr:En lutte !|En lutte!]] and the [[Workers' Communist Party of Canada]] which also drew primarily from students (and not always from working-class backgrounds, such as [[Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau]]). For a few years until this pro-Maoist wave of youthful political action fell apart in the early 1980s, the combined membership of pro-China communist parties also outnumbered the CPC.<ref>[https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.firstwave/index.htm \"The First Wave of Anti-Revisionism, 1964\u20131970\"], Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line</ref>\n\nWhile the CPC (ML) was unsuccessful uniting these tendencies together, Bains was very active forming similar anti-revisionist ML groupings around the world which were influenced by his writings and theory. Pro-Chinese ML groups came together in Ireland, Britain, Trinidad and Tobago, India and the USA. In 1967, Bains' \"Necessity for Change\" conference in London saw most of the Irish delegation reportedly walk out. Those who stayed went on to form the [[Communist Party of Ireland (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]] and the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist\u2013Leninist)|Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]]. Bains was a friend of well-known ''avant garde'' British composer [[Cornelius Cardew]], who was linked to the British party, and the CPC (ML) hosted Cardew on tour in Canada with a youth concert and variety show. (Bains also contributed the lyrics to Cardew's signature song from his later period, \"We Sing for the Future\".)\n\nIn the United States the CPC (ML) likewise sought out fraternal allies. Bains helped found and work with a succession of variously named groups which evolved into the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party, USA]]. Reflecting the divided political landscape characterizing many of the [[New Left]] groups, Bain's group did not work with similarly named [[Communist Party USA (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]] of [[Michael Laski]] or [[Michael Klonsky]]'s [[Communist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) (United States)]].\n\nBut the CPC (ML)'s efforts were perhaps most successful in India. Bains and the CPC (ML) maintained close links with Indian politics through the growing Indian immigrant community in Canada. In 1970, the party helped found the Hindustani Ghadar Party \u2013 Organisation of Indian Marxist\u2013Leninists Abroad group. Initially pro-[[Naxalite]], the group later developed into an Indian-based political party over the course of the decade. Bains also founded a business enterprise in New Delhi.<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/>\n\n== Turn to Albania ==\nBy 1976, CPC (ML) began to support the criticisms of Chinese foreign policy and the \"Theory of Three Worlds\" made by the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] (PLA).

This approach, and contrarian attitude to the position of most anti-war forces at the time, left the CPC (ML) disconnected from the peace and labour movements<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> as the party set up various rival committees.

The party also made gains in the Indo-Canadian community especially through the East Indian Defense Committee (EIDC). Also in 1980, the Canadian-based Hindustani Ghadar Party became the [[Communist Ghadar Party of India]].\n\nThe CPC (ML) continued to participate in most federal elections, following their entrance on the federal scene with 104 candidates in 1974. In the 31st General Election May 1979, the party fielded 144 candidates. In the February 1980 32nd General Election, there were 170 Marxist\u2013Leninist candidates. In the 33rd General Election September 1984, the Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada participated in the elections without fielding any candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2006/D36153.htm#1|title=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|work=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|accessdate=April 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229175919/http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2006/D36153.htm#1#1|archive-date=February 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Crisis of the Anti-revisionist parties ===\nBy the early 1980s many of the anti-revisionist parties of the 1960s and 1970s in Canada and internationally began to fade.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> Partly, the rigorous discipline demanded of members of these groups including [[tithes]] for membership dues, frequent long meetings, confrontation with the police and harassment, all took its toll and as young students became the parents of young families. As neo-conservatism rose, the revolutionary optimism which seemed justified a few years ago started to appear less realistic. Many of the smaller anti-revisionist groups simply folded. In 1983, Roger Rashi's Workers' Communist Party imploded over the question of [[Cambodia]] and [[Pol Pot]] as well as alleged internal party sexism within the leadership. In Struggle! (En Lutte!) had already suffered a similar fate in 1982.\n\nThe CPC (ML), however, generally lasted through these ideological, political and organization crises. One guiding light was the party's relationship with the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] (PLA), the only party in North America to have an official relationship with the PLA as the Albanian government somewhat distanced itself from U.S. pro-Albanian groups fearing of \"CIA infiltration\".<ref>https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-5/;U.S {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425090424/http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-5/ |date=April 25, 2014 }}.

These organizations worked implement the slogans \"an injury to one is an injury to all\" and \"an attack on one is an attack on all\" and \"all for one and one for all\" and \"self-defence is the only way\". Active, popular and with a large following, these front groups were well known for their opposition to racism by the end of the 1970s.<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s community centers for the EIDC had been established in Winnipeg, Toronto and Vancouver under the name \"Desh Bhagat Temple\" (DBT).<ref name=\"Agent-Provocateurs\"/> Housed in relatively large buildings which were purchased with money contributed by ordinary people, mainly from the East Indian community, they were managed by the EIDC and owned by a trust set up by the EIDC. The centres were regularly used for CPC (ML) meetings, and rented at cost for other social occasions.<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/>\n\n== Shift to \"democratic renewal\" and support of Cuba ==\nSerious problems in the socialist movement, however, developed in the late 1980s with the crisis in and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. \"Many [communist] parties, especially in the West, have gone over from 'because it is socialism it can have no problems' position to 'because so many problems emerged, it is socialism which does not work'!\" Bains wrote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reflections-shivanand.blogspot.ca/2007/07/book-review-communism-1989-1991-by.html;|title=Shivanand Kanavim The Weekend Observer, February 1992.|author=|date=|website=reflections-shivanand.blogspot.ca}}</ref> But soon it became clear that these developments were not only threatening the future of the [[Soviet Union]]. Almost immediately following [[Enver Hoxha]]'s death in 1985, reform movements sprung up in Albania which became was the last country in the [[Eastern Bloc]] in which [[Fall of communism in Albania|socialism was overturned]] in 1992.\n\nThe overturn of socialism in Albania and the Soviet Union had negative impacts for the CPC (ML). In the 34th General Election November 1988, it fielded 58 candidates whose names appeared on the ballot as non-affiliated due the party's failure to meet the time-line registration provisions of the Canada Elections Act at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2006/D36153.htm|title=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|work=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|accessdate=April 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229175919/http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2006/D36153.htm#|archive-date=February 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> During this time the party began to liquidate the EIDC centres generating about $2 million in profit from the sales of the properties.<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/> There had already been considerable speculation about the CPC (ML)'s high levels of funding for some time by other left groups.

Bains visited [[Cuba]] several times in the 1990s which led him (and the CPC (ML)) to reconsider his earlier views of Cuba as [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]].\n\nThe CPC (ML) was closely aligned with the [[Canadian Party for Renewal]] in 1993. On January 1, 1995, the party put forward a broad program of work, which it named the ''Historic Initiative''. This was further elaborated during its Seventh Congress.\n\nDuring the 1990s the party called for a popular referendum on the budget cuts initiated by the federal Liberal government of [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]. The language of the CPC (ML) has increasingly centred on its concept of \"democratic renewal\" oriented on electoral reform and \"empowerment of the people\", dropping its earlier sharp polemics against labour, social movements, and the Communist Party of Canada.\n\n=== Bains' death and legacy ===\nIn 1997, Bains died and his widow, Sandra L. Smith, replaced him as the leader of the CPC (ML). Bains' funeral was a significant occasion for the party who have held several memorials in his honor and, although he was cremated, purchased a grave plot in [[Beechwood Cemetery|The National Cemetery of Canada]] in Ottawa, Canada's national cemetery (which is also the national cemetery for the Canadian Forces and RCMP). The party eulogy said:\n\n:\"Comrade Bains, the twinkle in your eyes, your mischievous smile, your beautiful artistic hands, your fine mind, your tender love for all of us they all combined to work a magic. Who could resist your purity, your sincerity, your drive to bring out the best in everyone you met, in everyone you worked with, no matter what their age, what their standing in life, what their ideas or opinions?

The monument is emblazoned with a hammer and sickle and star of CPC (ML) and inscribed with the slogan \"Workers of All Countries Unite!\" and, on the other side, the party's motto and a prominent plaque to Bains.

The CPC (ML) has been registered with [[Elections Canada]] as the '''Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada''' since 1974 as the party is prohibited from using the Communist Party name in [[Canadian elections]] to avoid confusion among voters. The party developed separately and independently from the [[Communist Party of Canada]] (CPC) with its origins among students and intellectuals in Canada during the 1960s. After a period of alignment with [[Maoism]] and [[China]], the CPC (ML) pursued a pro-[[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]]n line until the early 1990s when it adopted a pro-[[Cuba]] position.\n\nFor most of its history the CPC (ML) was led by its founder, Hardial Bains. After his death his widow Sandra L. Smith became [[Secretary (title)|First Secretary]]. Elections Canada lists Anna DiCarlo as head of the electorally registered organization. None of the party's candidates has been elected. Since the 1970s, it has had a larger electoral campaign presence than the CPC. It ran its largest number of candidates in [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]] when it nominated 177 candidates, contesting 63 percent of the electoral districts.\n\nIt publishes an online news site and usually runs about 70 candidates in federal elections.

It was created primarily as a result of the efforts of Indo-Canadian Marxist student activist [[Hardial Bains]], who was the founder and national leader of the CPC (ML) until his death in 1997. The CPC (ML) was not created from a split from the [[Communist Party of Canada]] (CPC). The party emerged during a period of growing student and youth activism. At this time the CPC was still struggling to break out of isolation it faced during the [[Cold War]], and from a major rupture in the international communist movement between the People's Republic of [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] which the CPC had traditionally supported.\n\n=== Hardial Bains and the Sino-Soviet split ===\nBains came from [[Mahilpur]] in [[Hoshiarpur district]] of [[Punjab state]], [[India]]. His family were members or supporters of the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI)<ref name=\"First Anniversary\">http://www.leninism.org/stream/98/hardial-1st-anniv.htm; Ben Seattle, \"On the 1st anniversary of the death of a charlatan\"</ref> and he joined its youth wing.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The CPI that Bains knew as a teenager was a mass and militant party. Operating underground for part of the 1950s, the CPI won back its legality in time for the general elections of 1957, where it emerged as the largest opposition party in the country and held state government in [[Kerala]]. By this time, however, a young Bains had apparently quit the CPI in protest of its acceptance of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s criticisms of [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"Short History\">http://www.irishleftreview.org/2010/05/18/internationalists-communist-party-ireland-marxistleninist-part-19651970/; Connor McCabe, \"Short history of the Irish Internationalists,\" Irish Left Review, May 2010.</ref> Bains, according to the CPC (ML)'s official biography, immigrated to Canada from India two years later in 1959 at age nineteen.

Developing from 1960 on, sharp polemics over revolutionary strategy were exchanged between the two countries. Then, in 1962 the [[Sino-Indian War]] broke out and the CPI was again repressed by the Indian government. Over differences in attitude to the war, the CPI fractured and Hardial's parents joined the pro-China [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]].<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/>\n\nIn Canada, the Sino-Soviet split was less sharply divisive than demoralizing for the communists. In the ensuing fifteen years, the [[Communist Party of Canada]] (CPC) had lost all of its limited gains in parliament under the pressure of the [[Cold War]], and Communist MP [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]] was jailed for sedition. Anti-communism in the labour movement resulted in the expulsion of all communist-led unions from the house of labour, and communists in general were treated as traitors. Following the 1956 revelations by Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (\"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]\") about the crimes of [[Joseph Stalin]], the CPC suffered many resignations, and its youth organization, the [[Young Communist League of Canada|National Federation of Labour Youth]], fell apart briefly. By the time it was reorganized as the Socialist Youth League in the late 1950s, the CPC had lost much of its prior visibility on university campuses\u2014including the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC).\n\n=== The Internationalists ===\nBains arrived at UBC in this vacuum of visible, public revolutionary politics on campus and just as a new generation of student activism was radicalizing.

Within a few years Bain's group had succeeded in recruiting several hundred members across Canada, including Quebec, without the help of prominent former CPC leaders who had left the CPC and sided with China, such as former MP [[Dorise Nielsen]] or labour activist [[Jack Scott (activist)|Jack Scott]].<ref name=Encyclopedia>\"The Second Wave of Anti-Revisionism, 1971-1981,\" Encyclopedia of Revisionism On Line</ref> Meanwhile, and throughout the 1960s, the CPC was struggling to make its presence felt and grasp what its General Secretary [[Leslie Morris]] called \"the Challenge of the 60s\". The CPC's youth organization experimented with a more decentralized model until the late 1960s when it reorganized (one of the few instances of CPC members quitting for the CPC (ML) was that of a CPC youth activist from UBC who was accused of stealing a magazine subscription list and funds, and then joining the CPC (ML)).<ref>Ben Issit, Militant Minority: British Columbia Workers and the Rise of a New Left, U of T Press, 2011</ref> In many places, in size and particularly youthfulness, the CPC (ML) was beginning to rival the CPC.\n\n== Maoism ==\nIn 1968 the Internationalists renamed themselves the \"Canadian Student Movement\" and then the \"Canadian Communist Movement (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\". On March 31, 1970, they declared themselves a formal political party, adopting the name \"Communist Party of Canada (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\". After a legal challenge from the CPC because of confusion at the ballot, Elections Canada ruled that the party's preferred name was too close to that of the CPC, and since that time the party has been known electorally as the Marxist\u2013Leninist Party. The party ran candidates for the [[House of Commons of Canada]] during the [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974 federal election]] under the name of the \"Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada\". Because of the upsurge of left nationalism in Quebec, two separate parties were maintained until 1974 when the PCQ (ML) was folded into the CPC (ML). The Quebec party defined a twin struggle against \"Anglo-Canadian colonialism\" and U.S. imperialism.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>\n\nHistorians of [[anti-revisionism]] in Canada have described the CPC (ML) as standing out among the Canadian left because of its dedication to China and Mao Zedong \u2013 with slogans such as \"China's path is our path\" and \"China's chairman is our chairman.\" The CPC (ML) made a point of presenting its leader almost as a brand. Chairman Bains was the public face and spokesperson of their party, and consistently described with accolades of praise in the party press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpcml.ca/PartyMonument/song.html;Song|title=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|work=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|accessdate=April 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095217/http://www.cpcml.ca/PartyMonument/song.html|archive-date=March 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The CPC (ML)'s publications were seen by many to copy of the writing style of ''Peking Review''.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> At this time, China [[Chile\u2013China relations|diplomatically supported]] the junta of [[Augusto Pinochet]] due to the latter's continued endorsement of the One China Policy and so the CPC (ML) was silent on the overthrow of Pinochet.

By the mid-1970s there were at least five anti-revisionist, pro-China parties in Canada which debated forcefully with each other and\u2014in particular\u2014strongly condemned the CPC.<ref>For example: https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.firstwave/learnfromtheteachers/learnfrom.htm</ref> This included Quebec-based [[:fr:En lutte !|En lutte!]] and the [[Workers' Communist Party of Canada]] which also drew primarily from students (and not always from working-class backgrounds, such as [[Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau]]). For a few years until this pro-Maoist wave of youthful political action fell apart in the early 1980s, the combined membership of pro-China communist parties also outnumbered the CPC.<ref>[https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.firstwave/index.htm \"The First Wave of Anti-Revisionism, 1964\u20131970\"], Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line</ref>\n\nWhile the CPC (ML) was unsuccessful uniting these tendencies together, Bains was very active forming similar anti-revisionist ML groupings around the world which were influenced by his writings and theory. Pro-Chinese ML groups came together in Ireland, Britain, Trinidad and Tobago, India and the USA. In 1967, Bains' \"Necessity for Change\" conference in London saw most of the Irish delegation reportedly walk out. Those who stayed went on to form the [[Communist Party of Ireland (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]] and the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist\u2013Leninist)|Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]]. Bains was a friend of well-known ''avant garde'' British composer [[Cornelius Cardew]], who was linked to the British party, and the CPC (ML) hosted Cardew on tour in Canada with a youth concert and variety show. (Bains also contributed the lyrics to Cardew's signature song from his later period, \"We Sing for the Future\".)\n\nIn the United States the CPC (ML) likewise sought out fraternal allies. Bains helped found and work with a succession of variously named groups which evolved into the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party, USA]]. Reflecting the divided political landscape characterizing many of the [[New Left]] groups, Bain's group did not work with similarly named [[Communist Party USA (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]] of [[Michael Laski]] or [[Michael Klonsky]]'s [[Communist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) (United States)]].\n\nBut the CPC (ML)'s efforts were perhaps most successful in India. Bains and the CPC (ML) maintained close links with Indian politics through the growing Indian immigrant community in Canada. In 1970, the party helped found the Hindustani Ghadar Party \u2013 Organisation of Indian Marxist\u2013Leninists Abroad group. Initially pro-[[Naxalite]], the group later developed into an Indian-based political party over the course of the decade. Bains also founded a business enterprise in New Delhi.<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/>\n\n== Turn to Albania ==\nBy 1976, CPC (ML) began to support the criticisms of Chinese foreign policy and the \"Theory of Three Worlds\" made by the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] (PLA).

This approach, and contrarian attitude to the position of most anti-war forces at the time, left the CPC (ML) disconnected from the peace and labour movements<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> as the party set up various rival committees.

The party also made gains in the Indo-Canadian community especially through the East Indian Defense Committee (EIDC). Also in 1980, the Canadian-based Hindustani Ghadar Party became the [[Communist Ghadar Party of India]].\n\nThe CPC (ML) continued to participate in most federal elections, following their entrance on the federal scene with 104 candidates in 1974. In the 31st General Election May 1979, the party fielded 144 candidates. In the February 1980 32nd General Election, there were 170 Marxist\u2013Leninist candidates. In the 33rd General Election September 1984, the Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada participated in the elections without fielding any candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2006/D36153.htm#1|title=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|work=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|accessdate=April 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229175919/http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2006/D36153.htm#1#1|archive-date=February 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Crisis of the Anti-revisionist parties ===\nBy the early 1980s many of the anti-revisionist parties of the 1960s and 1970s in Canada and internationally began to fade.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> Partly, the rigorous discipline demanded of members of these groups including [[tithes]] for membership dues, frequent long meetings, confrontation with the police and harassment, all took its toll and as young students became the parents of young families. As neo-conservatism rose, the revolutionary optimism which seemed justified a few years ago started to appear less realistic. Many of the smaller anti-revisionist groups simply folded. In 1983, Roger Rashi's Workers' Communist Party imploded over the question of [[Cambodia]] and [[Pol Pot]] as well as alleged internal party sexism within the leadership. In Struggle! (En Lutte!) had already suffered a similar fate in 1982.\n\nThe CPC (ML), however, generally lasted through these ideological, political and organization crises. One guiding light was the party's relationship with the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] (PLA), the only party in North America to have an official relationship with the PLA as the Albanian government somewhat distanced itself from U.S. pro-Albanian groups fearing of \"CIA infiltration\".<ref>https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-5/;U.S {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425090424/http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-5/ |date=April 25, 2014 }}. Anti-Revisionism, The New Communist Movement: Crises, Splits and More New Parties, 1977-1980</ref> Another base was the parties work in the Indo-Canadian community and its anti-racist work.\n\n=== East Indian Defense Committee ===\nIn addition to the East Indian Defence Committee (EIDC), founded to oppose \"state-organized racist attacks\", the CPC (ML) also launched a West Indian Peoples' Organization (WIPO), Canadian Peoples' Defence Committee, and Peoples Front (PF) against racist and fascist violence. These organizations worked implement the slogans \"an injury to one is an injury to all\" and \"an attack on one is an attack on all\" and \"all for one and one for all\" and \"self-defence is the only way\". Active, popular and with a large following, these front groups were well known for their opposition to racism by the end of the 1970s.<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s community centers for the EIDC had been established in Winnipeg, Toronto and Vancouver under the name \"Desh Bhagat Temple\" (DBT).<ref name=\"Agent-Provocateurs\"/> Housed in relatively large buildings which were purchased with money contributed by ordinary people, mainly from the East Indian community, they were managed by the EIDC and owned by a trust set up by the EIDC. The centres were regularly used for CPC (ML) meetings, and rented at cost for other social occasions.<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/>\n\n== Shift to \"democratic renewal\" and support of Cuba ==\nSerious problems in the socialist movement, however, developed in the late 1980s with the crisis in and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. \"Many [communist] parties, especially in the West, have gone over from 'because it is socialism it can have no problems' position to 'because so many problems emerged, it is socialism which does not work'!\" Bains wrote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reflections-shivanand.blogspot.ca/2007/07/book-review-communism-1989-1991-by.html;|title=Shivanand Kanavim The Weekend Observer, February 1992.|author=|date=|website=reflections-shivanand.blogspot.ca}}</ref> But soon it became clear that these developments were not only threatening the future of the [[Soviet Union]]. Almost immediately following [[Enver Hoxha]]'s death in 1985, reform movements sprung up in Albania which became was the last country in the [[Eastern Bloc]] in which [[Fall of communism in Albania|socialism was overturned]] in 1992.\n\nThe overturn of socialism in Albania and the Soviet Union had negative impacts for the CPC (ML). In the 34th General Election November 1988, it fielded 58 candidates whose names appeared on the ballot as non-affiliated due the party's failure to meet the time-line registration provisions of the Canada Elections Act at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2006/D36153.htm|title=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|work=Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)|accessdate=April 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229175919/http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2006/D36153.htm#|archive-date=February 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> During this time the party began to liquidate the EIDC centres generating about $2 million in profit from the sales of the properties.<ref name=\"First Anniversary\"/> There had already been considerable speculation about the CPC (ML)'s high levels of funding for some time by other left groups.

Bains visited [[Cuba]] several times in the 1990s which led him (and the CPC (ML)) to reconsider his earlier views of Cuba as [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]].\n\nThe CPC (ML) was closely aligned with the [[Canadian Party for Renewal]] in 1993. On January 1, 1995, the party put forward a broad program of work, which it named the ''Historic Initiative''. This was further elaborated during its Seventh Congress.\n\nDuring the 1990s the party called for a popular referendum on the budget cuts initiated by the federal Liberal government of [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]. The language of the CPC (ML) has increasingly centred on its concept of \"democratic renewal\" oriented on electoral reform and \"empowerment of the people\", dropping its earlier sharp polemics against labour, social movements, and the Communist Party of Canada.\n\n=== Bains' death and legacy ===\nIn 1997, Bains died and his widow, Sandra L. Smith, replaced him as the leader of the CPC (ML). Bains' funeral was a significant occasion for the party who have held several memorials in his honor and, although he was cremated, purchased a grave plot in [[Beechwood Cemetery|The National Cemetery of Canada]] in Ottawa, Canada's national cemetery (which is also the national cemetery for the Canadian Forces and RCMP). The party eulogy said:\n\n:\"Comrade Bains, the twinkle in your eyes, your mischievous smile, your beautiful artistic hands, your fine mind, your tender love for all of us they all combined to work a magic. Who could resist your purity, your sincerity, your drive to bring out the best in everyone you met, in everyone you worked with, no matter what their age, what their standing in life, what their ideas or opinions? Meeting you was like falling in love at first sight, over and over and over again, just as you too fell in love with the best in everyone, bringing out whatever they had to offer to make this world, 'where tears are hung on every tree', a better place&nbsp;...\"<ref>[https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.firstwave/bains-eulogy.pdf \"Oh Comrade, Dear Comrade, Beloved Comrade\"], ''TML Weekly'' September 14\u201320, 1997.</ref>''\n\nAccording to the CPC (ML) website, the 8 by 5-1/2 foot memorial is made of granite quarried in [[Jhansi]], [[India]]. The monument is emblazoned with a hammer and sickle and star of CPC (ML) and inscribed with the slogan \"Workers of All Countries Unite!\" and, on the other side, the party's motto and a prominent plaque to Bains. Also carved on the monument are the lines \"Vous \u00eates le rouge de notre drapeau \u2013 Lal Salaam\" (You are the red of our flag \u2013 Red Salute) and the names of other past veteran members.<ref name=\"cpcml.ca\"/>\n\nBains was survived by his second wife Sandra L. Smith who, has never run as a candidate in a general election despite taking over his position as leader. Following his death, the CPC (ML) established the Hardial Bains Party School on Journalism. The party continues to reproduce his works on its website and honor his memory, and he is also remembered somewhat in India.\n\nSome commentaries have described Bains' speeches as \"cultic brain-washing sessions\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scientificsocialist.org/Theory/Neo-fascism%20and%20the%20Fifth%20Column%20new.htm|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref> a claim supported by personal accounts like those of Subir Roy. Born in India, Roy immigrated to Canada where he met the CPC (ML). Roy looked to Bains like \"a demi-god. He was a walking encyclopedia with infallible reasoning&nbsp;... like a religious leader who mesmerised his flock.\"<ref name=\"Subir_Roy\">http://subirroysubir.blogspot.ca/;Fahim{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Khan, \"Subir Roy the Revolutionary\", December 2007</ref> At Bains' request, Roy apparently dropped out of university to be a party activist. Bains then asked him to move to Nova Scotia and beg money from his well-heeled father to return to school and organize on the campus.
