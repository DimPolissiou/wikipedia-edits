Despite the Japanese having an almost complete air superiority over Java, he nevertheless chose to take off from Andir airfield. He asked all available pilots who wanted to volunteer. All pilots volunteered and van Helsdingen picked four pilots who then jumped in the four last remaining Buffalos. Just before take-off, van Helsdingen was informed by another pilot that one of the chosen pilots was married. Despite being married himself van Helsdingen took the place of the married pilot, and the four Buffalos took off.<ref name=Klemen-Helsdingen/> The three other pilots were: [[1st Lieutenant]] [[August Deibel]], [[Sergeant]] [[Gerard Bruggink]] and [[Officer Cadet]] [[Jan Scheffer]]. After only travelling 200 kilometers they ran into three Mitsubishi A6Ms. Deibel's plane was hit in the oil tank and he had to break off from combat. His wingman, Scheffer, escorted him back to Andir airfield, where Deibel crash landed his aircraft without injury. The other two remained above Lembang, but were now [[dogfight]]ing six Mitsubishi A6Ms. Van Helsdingen was soon shot down, but Bruggink managed to escape into the clouds before returning to Andir airfield. The Dutch forces in Lembang surrendered the next day. Bruggink and Deibel were awarded the [[Military William Order]], the highest award available from the [[Netherlands]], while van Helsdingen and Scheffer (who died a [[prisoner of war]]) were [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the honour on 14 July 1948.\n\n== Decorations ==\nEven though the squadron was short-lived, it has been one of the most highly decorated squadrons of the Dutch East Indies.\n\n1 x [[Military Order of William|Knight 3rd Class of the Military Order of William]]\n:Capt.

Because of several crashes and losses the squadron had to be reorganized. A couple of pilots from other squadrons were transferred to 2-VLG-V, and all the Buffalos were re-arranged. So did Deibel, who was shot down above Singapore with B-3100, and crashed with B-398 received the former aircraft of squadron leader Van Helsdingen. While Van Helsdingen received a new aircraft.

One pilot (Rothkrans) was shot down and killed during this action. The Buffalos were all fitted with bomb-racks and two 110&nbsp;lbs bombs. The Buffalos from 2-VLG-V were given 8 positive hits on several ships. One ship, the {{MS|Nana Maru||2}} was sunk.<ref>{{cite web|first=Klemen |last=L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/japan_losses.html |title=The Japanese Shipping Losses in the Pacific and Southeast Asia |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942| accessdate= 14 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\nOn Sunday, March 1, at 5:30 nine Brewster Buffalos set out for Eretanwetan, one flight of four aircraft of 2-VLG-V led by Captain van Helsdingen, the other flight - from 1-VLG-V - led by Captain van Rest. Three Glenn Martin Bombers of 3-VLG-III also took part in this action. One Japanese transport was claimed sunk, but the Glenn Martins also lost one of their number; Lieutenant B.

Despite the Japanese having an almost complete air superiority over Java, he nevertheless chose to take off from Andir airfield. He asked all available pilots who wanted to volunteer. All pilots volunteered and van Helsdingen picked four pilots who then jumped in the four last remaining Buffalos. Just before take-off, van Helsdingen was informed by another pilot that one of the chosen pilots was married. Despite being married himself van Helsdingen took the place of the married pilot, and the four Buffalos took off.<ref name=Klemen-Helsdingen/> The three other pilots were: [[1st Lieutenant]] [[August Deibel]], [[Sergeant]] [[Gerard Bruggink]] and [[Officer Cadet]] [[Jan Scheffer]]. After only travelling 200 kilometers they ran into three Mitsubishi A6Ms. Deibel's plane was hit in the oil tank and he had to break off from combat. His wingman, Scheffer, escorted him back to Andir airfield, where Deibel crash landed his aircraft without injury. The other two remained above Lembang, but were now [[dogfight]]ing six Mitsubishi A6Ms. Van Helsdingen was soon shot down, but Bruggink managed to escape into the clouds before returning to Andir airfield. The Dutch forces in Lembang surrendered the next day. Bruggink and Deibel were awarded the [[Military William Order]], the highest award available from the [[Netherlands]], while van Helsdingen and Scheffer (who died a [[prisoner of war]]) were [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the honour on 14 July 1948.\n\n== Decorations ==\nEven though the squadron was short-lived, it has been one of the most highly decorated squadrons of the Dutch East Indies.\n\n1 x [[Military Order of William|Knight 3rd Class of the Military Order of William]]\n:Capt.

Several Brahmin dynasties Mikrakula, [[Karkota Empire|Karkota]], [[Utpala dynasty|Utpala]] and Lohara ruled Kashmir until 12th centuary.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Amin|first=Tahir|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QUVuAAAAMAAJ&dq=lohara+brahman+dynasty&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=brahmin+|title=Mass Resistance in Kashmir: Origins, Evolution, Options|date=1995|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies|language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe kingdom underwent a few dynasty changes but all through it remained under the control of [[Brahmin|Brahmans]] till the 14th centuary.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mehta|first=Jaswant Lal|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iUk5k5AN54sC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=brahman+shahi+afghanistan&source=bl&ots=KegrVUk93P&sig=ACfU3U19WJtCPyxkQqWJh674V9Y9wVOL4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwio1o3W1svoAhUz4zgGHRIRBbc4ChDoATADegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=brahman&f=false|title=Advanced Study in the History of Medieval India|date=1979|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd|isbn=978-81-207-0617-0|language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe early history of the dynasty was described in the ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' (''Chronicle of Kings''), a work written by [[Kalhana]] in the mid-12th century and upon which many and perhaps all studies of the first 150 years of the dynasty depend. Subsequent accounts, which provide information up to and beyond the end of the dynasty come from [[Jonaraja|Jonar\u0101ja]] and [[Srivara|\u015ar\u012bvara]]. The later rulers of the dynasty were weak: internecine fighting and corruption was endemic during this period, with only brief years of respite, and this gave rise to the growth of Islamic onslaughts in the region.<ref name=\"Hasan1959pp29-32\">Hasan (1959), pp. 29-32.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to 12th century text ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' translated by Sir [[Marc Aurel Stein]], the family of the chiefs of Lohara were from [[Khas Brahmin]].{{sfn|Stein|1900|p=433}}{{sfn|Thakur|1990|p=287}} The seat of the Lohara dynasty was a hill-fortress called Loharakotta, the precise location of which has been the subject of academic debate over a prolonged period. Stein, a translator of Kalhana, has discussed some of these theories and concludes that it lay in the [[Pir Panjal]] range of mountains, on a trade route between western [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and Kashmir. As such, it was not itself in Kashmir but in the kingdom of Lohara, centred around a group of large villages collectively known as Lohrin, which itself was a name shared by the valley in which they were situated and a river that ran through it. The Lohara kingdom probably extended into neighbouring valleys.<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, pp. 293-294.</ref>\n\n[[Didda]], a daughter of the king of Lohara called Simhar\u0101ja, had married the king of Kashmir, Ksemgupta, thus uniting the two areas. Compared to other societies of the period, women in Kashmir were held in high regard<ref>Kaw, p. 91.</ref> and when Ksemgupta died in 958, Didda assumed power as [[Regent]] for her young son, Abhimanyu II. Upon the death of Abhimanyu in 972 she performed the same office for his sons, Nandigupta, Tribhuvanagupta, and Bhimagupta, respectively. She killed each of these grandchildren in turn. As Regent she effectively had sole power over the kingdom, and with the killing by torture of Bhimagupta in 980 she became ruler in her own right.<ref name=Stein1900p294/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 104-105.</ref>\n\nDidda subsequently adopted a nephew, Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja, to be her heir in Kashmir but left the rule of Lohara to Vigrahar\u0101ja, who was either another nephew or perhaps one of her brothers. From this decision arose the Lohara dynasty of Kashmir, although Vigrahar\u0101ja even during her lifetime made attempts to assert his right to that area as well as Lohara.<ref name=Stein1900p294>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, p. 294.</ref> What was to follow was around three centuries of \"endless rebellions and other internal troubles\".<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, p. 370.</ref>\n\n==First Lohara dynasty==\n===Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja===\nSamgr\u0101mar\u0101ja is considered as the founder of the Lohara dynasty.<ref name=\"IEH\"/>\n\nSamgr\u0101mar\u0101ja was able to repulse several attacks of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] against Kashmir, and he also supported ruler [[Trilochanapala]] against Muslim attacks.<ref name=\"IEH\"/>\n\nThe reign of Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja between 1003 and June or July 1028 was largely characterised by the actions of those in his court, who preyed on his subjects to satisfy their own greed, and by the role of the prime minister, Tunga. The latter was a former herdsman who had become the lover of Didda and was her prime minister. He had wielded much power in working with Didda to assert her dominance over the kingdom and he continued to use that power after her death. Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja was afraid of him and for many years allowed him to have his way. Indeed, it was Tunga who appointed many of the corrupt officials who proceeded to extract significant amounts of wealth from the kingdom's subjects. These appointees, and their actions, made Tunga unpopular, and his age may well have contributed to his increasing inability to deal with challenges from opponents within and without the court. Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja quietly supported the plots to remove the minister, and eventually Tunga was murdered; however, this did little to improve matters either in the court or the country as his death caused an influx of royal favourites who were no less corrupt than those who had been appointed by him.<ref name=Hasan1959p32/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 106-108</ref>\n\n===Harir\u0101ja and Ananta===\nSamgr\u0101mar\u0101ja's son, Harir\u0101ja, succeeded him but reigned for only 22 days before dying and being succeeded in turn by another son, [[Ananta (Lohara dynasty)|Ananta]]. It is possible that Harir\u0101ja was killed by his mother, Shrilakh\u0101, who may have been desirous of holding power herself but was ultimately thwarted in that scheme by those protecting her children.<ref name=Hasan1959p32>Hasan (1959), p. 32.</ref><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 108.</ref> It was around this time that Vigrahar\u0101ja attempted once more to take control of Kashmir, taking an army to do battle near to the capital at [[Srinagar]] and being killed in defeat.<ref name=Stein1900p294/>\n\nThe period of rule by Ananta was characterised by royal profligacy; he accumulated debts so large that it necessitated the pawning of the royal [[diadem]], although when his queen, S\u016bryamat\u012b, intervened the situation was improved. She was able to settle the debts incurred by her husband by use of her own resources and she also oversaw the appointment of ministers with ability in order to stabilise the government.<ref name=Hasan1959p32>Hasan (1959), p. 32.</ref> In 1063, she forced Ananta to [[abdicate]] in favour of their son, Kala\u015ba. This was probably in order to preserve the dynasty but the strategy proved not to be successful because of Kala\u015ba's own unsuitability. It was then arranged that Ananta was effective king even though his son held the title.<ref name=Steinv1p110>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 110.</ref>\n\n===Kala\u015ba, Utkarsa and Harsa===\nKala\u015ba was king until 1089. Another weak-willed man, who involved himself in an incestuous relationship with his daughter, Kala\u015ba was dominated by those surrounding him at court and spent little time on matters of government until his later years. He freed himself from the effective rule of his father in 1076, causing Ananta to leave the capital along with many loyal courtiers and then laying siege to them in their new abode at [[Vijayesvara]]. On the verge of being pushed into exile, and faced with a wife who even at this stage doted on her son, Ananta committed suicide in 1081. It was after this that Kala\u015ba reformed his licentious ways and began to govern responsibly, as well as operating a foreign policy that improved the influence which the dynasty held over surrounding hill tribes.<ref name=Hasan1959p32/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 110-111.</ref>\n\nKala\u015ba experienced difficulties with his oldest son, Harsa, who felt that the allowance granted by his father was insufficient for his extravagant tastes.

He and his younger brother, Sussala, had been spotted by Harsa as pretenders to his crown during the unrest and in 1100 had been forced to flee. The move did them no harm as it increased their status among the d\u0101maras: if Harsa wanted the brothers dead then that was all the more reason to rally around them. It was as a consequence of this that Uccala was able to mount armed attacks on Harsa, as in 1101, which although initially unsuccessful did eventually achieve their aim as those closest to Harsa deserted him.<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 114-115.</ref>\n\nThe two kingdoms of Kashmir and Lohara were again split at the time of Uccala's accession, with Uccala ceding rule over Lohara to Sussala in an attempt to head off any potential challenge from  his ambitious brother.<ref name=Stein1900p295>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, p. 295.</ref><ref name=Stein1900v1p117>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 117.</ref> The rule of Uccala was largely a victim of inherited circumstances, and in particular the fact that the power of the d\u0101maras which had caused the downfall of Harsa was also a strength that could now be turned on him. He was unable to stabilise the penurious kingdom, either economically or in terms of authority, although it was not due to any lack of capability on his part and he did succeed in forming an alliance with the most powerful d\u0101mara, Gargacandra. He was, in the opinion of Hasan, an able and conscientious ruler.<ref name=Hasan1959p33/><ref name=Stein1900v1p15/> Stein has explained the method adopted to counter the d\u0101maras:\n{{quote|By fomenting among them jealousy and mutual suspicion, he secured the murder or exile of their most influential leaders, without himself incurring the odium. Then, reassured in his own position, he openly turned upon the D\u0101maras and forced them into disarmament and submission.<ref name=Stein1900v1p117/>}}\n\n===Radda, Salhana and Sussala===\nThe downfall of Uccala came in December 1111 as a result a conspiracy, and after a prior attempt by Sussala to overthrow him. Sussala was not in the vicinity at the time that Uccala was murdered but within days had attempted a hazardous winter crossing over the mountains to Srinagar. Foiled by the winter weather on this occasion, he was able a few months later to venture once more and he proceeded to take control of Kashmir from a half-brother, Salhana.<ref name=Stein1900p295/> Salhana had himself taken the throne after the briefest of reigns by Radda, one of the leaders of the conspiracy against Uccala, whose rule lasted a single day. It was Gargacandra who organised the defeat of the conspirators and it was he who installed Salhana, using him as a puppet for the violent four months until the arrival of Sussala, a period which Kalhana described as a \"long evil dream\".<ref name=Stein1900v1p15/>\n\nGargacandra had again been kingmaker in allying with Sussala, whom Stein believes to have been \"personally brave, but rash, cruel and inconsiderate\" and whose rule was, \"practically one long and disastrous struggle with the irrepressible D\u0101maras and with dangerous pretenders.\"<ref name=Stein1900v1p16>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 16.</ref> As part of their alliance, Gargacandra arranged the marriage of two of his daughters, one to Sussala and one to Sussala's son, Jayasimha.<ref name=Stein1900v1p119>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 119.</ref> Having turned on Gargacandra and defeated him,{{#tag:ref|Gargacandra and his sons, together with some others, were eventually strangled to death on Sussala's order in 1118,<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 120.</ref> |group=nb}} Sussala was faced by other d\u0101maras who in the absence of the once-dominant kingmaker saw an opportunity to challenge the king. They found a potential candidate for the throne in Bhik\u015f\u0101cara, a grandson of Harsa. and managed to install him briefly in 1120 when their numbers had swollen sufficiently in opposition to the brutally oppressive measures adopted by Sussala. The restoration of Harsa's dynastic line did not last for long: a fightback by Sussala, who had decamped in defeat from Srinagar to Lohar, resulted in the pretender being deposed around six months later, in early 1121. Thereafter, Sussala resumed his oppression and treated the wealth of his people as being his own. He also imprisoned troublesome members of his own family but, like others before him, he was unable to control the lawlessness among the feudatory chiefs. While squabbling among the d\u0101maras had assisted him in regaining the throne, he found himself frequently under siege upon his return as they sought to maintain a state of near anarchy in which they could profit for themselves.<ref name=Hasan1959p33/><ref name=Stein1900p295/><ref name=Stein1900v1p16/>\n\nIn 1123, during a period of intense pressure from besieging d\u0101maras and while mourning the death of one of his wives, Sussala abdicated in favour of his son, Jayasimha, He soon changed his mind and although Jayasimha was formally crowned as king it was Sussala who continued to govern.<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 122.</ref>\n\n===Jayasimha===\nJayasimha succeeded his father in 1128 during a period when there was open rebellion. A plot intended to assert authority had backfired on Sussala and caused his death. Jayasimha was not a forceful character but he did nonetheless manage to bring about both peace and a degree of economic well-being during his reign, which lasted until 1155. Bhik\u015f\u0101cara mounted further attempts to regain the throne during the first two years and no sooner had he been killed than another challenger, Lothana, a brother of Salhana, succeeded in taking control of Lohara. That territory was subsequently recaptured but challenges continued from Lothana and two others who sought the throne, Mall\u0101juna and Bhoja, the latter being a son of Salhana. Throughout this period there was also further troublesome behaviour generally from the d\u0101maras, as so often in the past, and also as in the past it was the fact that those chiefs also fought among themselves which enabled Jayasimha to survive. Peace came after 1145 and Jayasimha was able to employ his methods of kingship, which relied on diplomacy and Machiavellian plotting, for the greater good of his kingdom. In particular, Kalhana refers to the piety of Jayasimha, who rebuilt or constructed many temples which had been destroyed during the long years of war. His success has led Hasan to describe him as \"the last great Hindu ruler of Kashmir.\"<ref name=Hasan1959p33/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 16-17.</ref><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 126-127.</ref>\n\nAn example of Jayasimha's vision can be found in his decision to enthrone his oldest son, Gulhana, as king of Lohara even though Gulhana was a child and Jayasimha was still alive. The reason for this appears to have been better to ensure the succession would not suffer any disturbance.<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 129.</ref>\n\n===Successors to Jayasimha===\nFrom the end of the rule of Jayasimha in 1155 and until the accession of Jagadeva in 1198, his successors reverted to type. Hasan describes that they \"...&nbsp;were weak and incompetent. They neglected their duty of protecting their subjects and instead robbed them with the help of their favourites. Their misrule was taken advantage of by the nobles who became strong and defied the royal authority.\"<ref name=Hasan1959p34>Hasan, p. 34.</ref> Jayasimha was followed by his son Paramanuka, and then his grandson Vantideva (ruled 1165-72), who his often described as the last king of the Lohara dynasty.<ref name=\"IEH\">India - Early History, Publications Division Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=m_YADgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63 p.63]</ref>\n\n====Dynasty of the Vuppadevas====\n[[File:King Jagadeva of the Vuppadevas in Kashmir 1199-1213.jpg|thumb|Coin of king Jagadeva of the Vuppadevas in Kashmir 1199-1213]]\nWith the end of the Loharas, Vantideva was replaced by a new ruler named Vuppadeva, who was apparently elected by the people, and who started the eponymous dynasty of the Vuppadevas.<ref name=\"IEH\"/> Vuppadeva was succeeded in 1181 CE by his brother Jassaka, who then was succeeded by his son Jagadeva, in 1199 CE.<ref>The History and Culture of the Indian People: The struggle for empire.-2d ed, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1966, p.101</ref> Jagadeva attempted to emulate Jayasimha but had a turbulent time, being at one stage forced out of his own kingdom by his officials. His death came by poison in 1212 or 1213 and his successors met with no more success; his son, R\u0101jadeva, survived until 1235 but any power that he may have had was shackled by the nobility; his grandson, Samgr\u0101madeva, who ruled from 1235 to 1252, was forced out of the kingdom just as Jagadeva had been and then killed soon after his return.<ref name=Hasan1959p34/>\n\nAnother son of R\u0101jadeva became king in 1252. This was R\u0101madeva, who had no children and appointed Laksmandadeva, the son of a [[Brahmin]], to be his heir. Although the period of R\u0101madeva's reign was calm, that of Laksmandadeva saw deterioration in the situation once more. In this reign, which began in 1273, the troubles were caused not only by the fractious nobility but also by the territorial encroachment of [[Turkish people|Turks]]. As with his predecessors and successors, he thought little of spending money on border protection. By 1286, when Laksmandadeva'a son, Simhadeva, came to the throne, the kingdom was a much smaller place. Simhadeva survived until 1301, a largely ineffective ruler who was dominated by his advisers. He was killed by a man whom he had cuckolded.<ref name=Hasan1959p34/>\n\nThe last of the dynasty was S\u016bhadeva, the brother of Simhadeva. He was a strong ruler but also an unpopular one. He taxed heavily and exempted not even the Brahmins from his exactions. Although he managed to unite the kingdom under his control there is a sense in which the majority of it was united against him. Furthermore, \"Socially and morally the people of Kashmir had sunk to the lowest depths, for old and young alike had taken to falsehood, intrigue, dishonesty and discord\", says Hasan.<ref name=Hasan1959p34/>\n\nThe widow of S\u016bhadeva, queen Kot\u0101 took his place but was usurped by [[Shah Mir]], a Muslim who had moved into the area from the south. The kingdom had been subjected to Muslim influence even prior to his arrival{{#tag:ref|At least as far back as the 7th century, in the time when the K\u0101rkota dynasty ruled Kashmir, Kashmiris were \"feeling extraordinarily pinched by the Arab aggression in the Indus valley\", according to Ronald Davidson,<ref>Davidson, p. 44.</ref>|group=nb}} and some people had already converted to the religion from Hinduism. By the end of the 14th century the vast majority of the kashmir had become Muslim, although the Brahmins still maintained their traditional roles as the learned administrators until the accession of [[Sikandar Butshikan]].<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 130.</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nMohibbul Hasan describes the collapse of order as: {{quote|The [[Damara (feudal landlord)|D\u00e3maras]] or feudal chiefs grew powerful, defied royal authority, and by their constant revolts plunged the country into confusion.

The early history of the dynasty was described in the ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' (''Chronicle of Kings''), a work written by [[Kalhana]] in the mid-12th century and upon which many and perhaps all studies of the first 150 years of the dynasty depend. Subsequent accounts, which provide information up to and beyond the end of the dynasty come from [[Jonaraja|Jonar\u0101ja]] and [[Srivara|\u015ar\u012bvara]]. The later rulers of the dynasty were weak: internecine fighting and corruption was endemic during this period, with only brief years of respite, and this gave rise to the growth of Islamic onslaughts in the region.<ref name=Hasan1959pp29-32>Hasan (1959), pp. 29-32.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to 12th century text ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' translated by Sir [[Marc Aurel Stein]], the family of the chiefs of Lohara were from [[Khasas|Khasa tribe]].{{sfn|Stein|1900|p=433}}{{sfn|Thakur|1990|p=287}} The seat of the Lohara dynasty was a hill-fortress called Loharakotta, the precise location of which has been the subject of academic debate over a prolonged period. Stein, a translator of Kalhana, has discussed some of these theories and concludes that it lay in the [[Pir Panjal]] range of mountains, on a trade route between western [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and Kashmir. As such, it was not itself in Kashmir but in the kingdom of Lohara, centred around a group of large villages collectively known as Lohrin, which itself was a name shared by the valley in which they were situated and a river that ran through it. The Lohara kingdom probably extended into neighbouring valleys.<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, pp. 293-294.</ref>\n\n[[Didda]], a daughter of the king of Lohara called Simhar\u0101ja, had married the king of Kashmir, Ksemgupta, thus uniting the two areas. Compared to other societies of the period, women in Kashmir were held in high regard<ref>Kaw, p. 91.</ref> and when Ksemgupta died in 958, Didda assumed power as [[Regent]] for her young son, Abhimanyu II. Upon the death of Abhimanyu in 972 she performed the same office for his sons, Nandigupta, Tribhuvanagupta, and Bhimagupta, respectively. She killed each of these grandchildren in turn. As Regent she effectively had sole power over the kingdom, and with the killing by torture of Bhimagupta in 980 she became ruler in her own right.<ref name=Stein1900p294/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 104-105.</ref>\n\nDidda subsequently adopted a nephew, Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja, to be her heir in Kashmir but left the rule of Lohara to Vigrahar\u0101ja, who was either another nephew or perhaps one of her brothers. From this decision arose the Lohara dynasty of Kashmir, although Vigrahar\u0101ja even during her lifetime made attempts to assert his right to that area as well as Lohara.<ref name=Stein1900p294>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, p. 294.</ref> What was to follow was around three centuries of \"endless rebellions and other internal troubles\".<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, p. 370.</ref>\n\n==First Lohara dynasty==\n===Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja===\nSamgr\u0101mar\u0101ja is considered as the founder of the Lohara dynasty.<ref name=\"IEH\"/>\n\nSamgr\u0101mar\u0101ja was able to repulse several attacks of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] against Kashmir, and he also supported ruler [[Trilochanapala]] against Muslim attacks.<ref name=\"IEH\"/>\n\nThe reign of Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja between 1003 and June or July 1028 was largely characterised by the actions of those in his court, who preyed on his subjects to satisfy their own greed, and by the role of the prime minister, Tunga. The latter was a former herdsman who had become the lover of Didda and was her prime minister. He had wielded much power in working with Didda to assert her dominance over the kingdom and he continued to use that power after her death. Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja was afraid of him and for many years allowed him to have his way. Indeed, it was Tunga who appointed many of the corrupt officials who proceeded to extract significant amounts of wealth from the kingdom's subjects. These appointees, and their actions, made Tunga unpopular, and his age may well have contributed to his increasing inability to deal with challenges from opponents within and without the court. Samgr\u0101mar\u0101ja quietly supported the plots to remove the minister, and eventually Tunga was murdered; however, this did little to improve matters either in the court or the country as his death caused an influx of royal favourites who were no less corrupt than those who had been appointed by him.<ref name=Hasan1959p32/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 106-108</ref>\n\n===Harir\u0101ja and Ananta===\nSamgr\u0101mar\u0101ja's son, Harir\u0101ja, succeeded him but reigned for only 22 days before dying and being succeeded in turn by another son, [[Ananta (Lohara dynasty)|Ananta]]. It is possible that Harir\u0101ja was killed by his mother, Shrilakh\u0101, who may have been desirous of holding power herself but was ultimately thwarted in that scheme by those protecting her children.<ref name=Hasan1959p32>Hasan (1959), p. 32.</ref><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 108.</ref> It was around this time that Vigrahar\u0101ja attempted once more to take control of Kashmir, taking an army to do battle near to the capital at [[Srinagar]] and being killed in defeat.<ref name=Stein1900p294/>\n\nThe period of rule by Ananta was characterised by royal profligacy; he accumulated debts so large that it necessitated the pawning of the royal [[diadem]], although when his queen, S\u016bryamat\u012b, intervened the situation was improved. She was able to settle the debts incurred by her husband by use of her own resources and she also oversaw the appointment of ministers with ability in order to stabilise the government.<ref name=Hasan1959p32>Hasan (1959), p. 32.</ref> In 1063, she forced Ananta to [[abdicate]] in favour of their son, Kala\u015ba. This was probably in order to preserve the dynasty but the strategy proved not to be successful because of Kala\u015ba's own unsuitability. It was then arranged that Ananta was effective king even though his son held the title.<ref name=Steinv1p110>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 110.</ref>\n\n===Kala\u015ba, Utkarsa and Harsa===\nKala\u015ba was king until 1089. Another weak-willed man, who involved himself in an incestuous relationship with his daughter, Kala\u015ba was dominated by those surrounding him at court and spent little time on matters of government until his later years. He freed himself from the effective rule of his father in 1076, causing Ananta to leave the capital along with many loyal courtiers and then laying siege to them in their new abode at [[Vijayesvara]]. On the verge of being pushed into exile, and faced with a wife who even at this stage doted on her son, Ananta committed suicide in 1081. It was after this that Kala\u015ba reformed his licentious ways and began to govern responsibly, as well as operating a foreign policy that improved the influence which the dynasty held over surrounding hill tribes.<ref name=Hasan1959p32/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 110-111.</ref>\n\nKala\u015ba experienced difficulties with his oldest son, Harsa, who felt that the allowance granted by his father was insufficient for his extravagant tastes. Harsa plotted to kill Kala\u015ba, was found out and eventually imprisoned. His position as heir to the throne was given instead to his younger brother, Utkarsa, who was already ruler of Lohara.{{#tag:ref|Ksitir\u0101ja, who was the son and heir of Vigrahar\u0101ja, had abdicated his rights in favour of Utkarsa, ignoring the claim of his son due to disagreements with him.|group=nb}} The strain of dealing with Harsa caused Kala\u015ba to revert to his previous dissolute lifestyle and Stein believes that this contributed to his death in 1089. Despite being removed as heir, Hasan believes Harsa did immediately succeed his father<ref name=Hasan1959p33>Hasan (1959), p. 33.</ref> but Stein says that Utkarsa succeeded and that Harsa remained in prison. With the accession of Utkarsa to the throne of Kashmir came the reunification of that kingdom with Lohara, as they had been during the reign of Didda. It is at this point that the fortress became the dynastic seat.<ref name=Stein1900p294/><ref name=Steinv1p110/><ref name=Stein1900v1p111>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 111.</ref>\n\nHasan and Stein agree that Harsa became king in 1089. Utkarsa was disliked and soon deposed, with a half-brother called Vijayamalla{{#tag:ref|Kala\u015ba had at least one concubine.<ref name=Stein1900v1p113>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 113.</ref>|group=nb}} supporting Harsa and being at the forefront of the rebellion against the king.<ref name=Stein1900v1p111/> Utkarsa was in his turn imprisoned and he committed suicide.<ref name=Stein1900v1p112>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 112.</ref>\n\nHarsa had been a cultured man with much to offer his people but became as prone to the influence of certain favourites and as corrupt, cruel and profligate as his predecessors. He, too, indulged in incest and Stein has said that he was {{quote|undoubtedly the most striking figure among the later Hindu rulers of Kashmir. His many and varied attainments and the strange contrasts in his character must have greatly exercised the mind of his contemporaries&nbsp;...&nbsp;Cruelty and kindheartedness, liberality and greed, violent selfwilledness and reckless supineness, cunning and want of thought \u2013 these and other apparently irreconcilable features in turn display themselves in Harsa\u2019s chequered life.\"<ref name=Stein1900v1p112/>}} After an initial period during which the economic fortunes of the kingdom appear to have improved, as evidenced by the issue of gold and silver coinage, the situation deteriorated and even [[night soil]] was taxed, while temples were looted to further raise money to fund his failed military ventures and his indulgent lifestyle. All but two of the statues of Buddha in his kingdom were destroyed during his rule. It is possible that his iconoclasm was influenced by the ingress of the Muslim faith in areas surrounding Kashmir, although certainly he garnered much needed wealth from his destruction.<ref name=Hasan1959p33/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 7, 15, 113.</ref>{{better source|date=December 2017}}{{clarify|date=December 2017}} Even in 1099, when his kingdom was ravaged by plague, flood and famine, as well as by lawlessness on a large scale, Harsa continued to plunder the wealth of his subjects.<ref name=Stein1900v1p114>Stein, (1900), Vol. 1, p. 114</ref>{{better source|date=December 2017}}{{clarify|date=December 2017}}\n\nHarsa faced numerous challenges to his reign and he executed many of his relatives, some but not all of whom had been among the challengers.<ref name=Stein1900v1p113/> He conducted campaigns in the east of the valley to wrest control of land back from feudatory landlords, who were known as [[damara (feudal landlord)|d\u0101maras]], and in 1101 they murdered him.<ref name=Hasan1959p33/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, pp. 305-306.</ref> Stein describes that while Harsa's rule seemed at first to have \"secured a period of consolidation and of prosperous peace&nbsp;... [it] had subsequently fallen a victim to his own [[Nero]]-like propensities\".<ref name=Stein1900v1p15>Stein, (1900), Vol. 1, p. 15</ref>\n\n==Second Lohara dynasty==\n===Uccala===\n[[Uchchala]], who was from a side-branch of the Lohara royal line, succeeded to the throne and reigned for a decade. He and his younger brother, Sussala, had been spotted by Harsa as pretenders to his crown during the unrest and in 1100 had been forced to flee. The move did them no harm as it increased their status among the d\u0101maras: if Harsa wanted the brothers dead then that was all the more reason to rally around them. It was as a consequence of this that Uccala was able to mount armed attacks on Harsa, as in 1101, which although initially unsuccessful did eventually achieve their aim as those closest to Harsa deserted him.<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 114-115.</ref>\n\nThe two kingdoms of Kashmir and Lohara were again split at the time of Uccala's accession, with Uccala ceding rule over Lohara to Sussala in an attempt to head off any potential challenge from  his ambitious brother.<ref name=Stein1900p295>Stein (1900), Vol. 2, p. 295.</ref><ref name=Stein1900v1p117>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 117.</ref> The rule of Uccala was largely a victim of inherited circumstances, and in particular the fact that the power of the d\u0101maras which had caused the downfall of Harsa was also a strength that could now be turned on him. He was unable to stabilise the penurious kingdom, either economically or in terms of authority, although it was not due to any lack of capability on his part and he did succeed in forming an alliance with the most powerful d\u0101mara, Gargacandra. He was, in the opinion of Hasan, an able and conscientious ruler.<ref name=Hasan1959p33/><ref name=Stein1900v1p15/> Stein has explained the method adopted to counter the d\u0101maras:\n{{quote|By fomenting among them jealousy and mutual suspicion, he secured the murder or exile of their most influential leaders, without himself incurring the odium. Then, reassured in his own position, he openly turned upon the D\u0101maras and forced them into disarmament and submission.<ref name=Stein1900v1p117/>}}\n\n===Radda, Salhana and Sussala===\nThe downfall of Uccala came in December 1111 as a result a conspiracy, and after a prior attempt by Sussala to overthrow him. Sussala was not in the vicinity at the time that Uccala was murdered but within days had attempted a hazardous winter crossing over the mountains to Srinagar. Foiled by the winter weather on this occasion, he was able a few months later to venture once more and he proceeded to take control of Kashmir from a half-brother, Salhana.<ref name=Stein1900p295/> Salhana had himself taken the throne after the briefest of reigns by Radda, one of the leaders of the conspiracy against Uccala, whose rule lasted a single day. It was Gargacandra who organised the defeat of the conspirators and it was he who installed Salhana, using him as a puppet for the violent four months until the arrival of Sussala, a period which Kalhana described as a \"long evil dream\".<ref name=Stein1900v1p15/>\n\nGargacandra had again been kingmaker in allying with Sussala, whom Stein believes to have been \"personally brave, but rash, cruel and inconsiderate\" and whose rule was, \"practically one long and disastrous struggle with the irrepressible D\u0101maras and with dangerous pretenders.\"<ref name=Stein1900v1p16>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 16.</ref> As part of their alliance, Gargacandra arranged the marriage of two of his daughters, one to Sussala and one to Sussala's son, Jayasimha.<ref name=Stein1900v1p119>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 119.</ref> Having turned on Gargacandra and defeated him,{{#tag:ref|Gargacandra and his sons, together with some others, were eventually strangled to death on Sussala's order in 1118,<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 120.</ref> |group=nb}} Sussala was faced by other d\u0101maras who in the absence of the once-dominant kingmaker saw an opportunity to challenge the king. They found a potential candidate for the throne in Bhik\u015f\u0101cara, a grandson of Harsa. and managed to install him briefly in 1120 when their numbers had swollen sufficiently in opposition to the brutally oppressive measures adopted by Sussala. The restoration of Harsa's dynastic line did not last for long: a fightback by Sussala, who had decamped in defeat from Srinagar to Lohar, resulted in the pretender being deposed around six months later, in early 1121. Thereafter, Sussala resumed his oppression and treated the wealth of his people as being his own. He also imprisoned troublesome members of his own family but, like others before him, he was unable to control the lawlessness among the feudatory chiefs. While squabbling among the d\u0101maras had assisted him in regaining the throne, he found himself frequently under siege upon his return as they sought to maintain a state of near anarchy in which they could profit for themselves.<ref name=Hasan1959p33/><ref name=Stein1900p295/><ref name=Stein1900v1p16/>\n\nIn 1123, during a period of intense pressure from besieging d\u0101maras and while mourning the death of one of his wives, Sussala abdicated in favour of his son, Jayasimha, He soon changed his mind and although Jayasimha was formally crowned as king it was Sussala who continued to govern.<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 122.</ref>\n\n===Jayasimha===\nJayasimha succeeded his father in 1128 during a period when there was open rebellion. A plot intended to assert authority had backfired on Sussala and caused his death. Jayasimha was not a forceful character but he did nonetheless manage to bring about both peace and a degree of economic well-being during his reign, which lasted until 1155. Bhik\u015f\u0101cara mounted further attempts to regain the throne during the first two years and no sooner had he been killed than another challenger, Lothana, a brother of Salhana, succeeded in taking control of Lohara. That territory was subsequently recaptured but challenges continued from Lothana and two others who sought the throne, Mall\u0101juna and Bhoja, the latter being a son of Salhana. Throughout this period there was also further troublesome behaviour generally from the d\u0101maras, as so often in the past, and also as in the past it was the fact that those chiefs also fought among themselves which enabled Jayasimha to survive. Peace came after 1145 and Jayasimha was able to employ his methods of kingship, which relied on diplomacy and Machiavellian plotting, for the greater good of his kingdom. In particular, Kalhana refers to the piety of Jayasimha, who rebuilt or constructed many temples which had been destroyed during the long years of war. His success has led Hasan to describe him as \"the last great Hindu ruler of Kashmir.\"<ref name=Hasan1959p33/><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 16-17.</ref><ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, pp. 126-127.</ref>\n\nAn example of Jayasimha's vision can be found in his decision to enthrone his oldest son, Gulhana, as king of Lohara even though Gulhana was a child and Jayasimha was still alive. The reason for this appears to have been better to ensure the succession would not suffer any disturbance.<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 129.</ref>\n\n===Successors to Jayasimha===\nFrom the end of the rule of Jayasimha in 1155 and until the accession of Jagadeva in 1198, his successors reverted to type. Hasan describes that they \"...&nbsp;were weak and incompetent. They neglected their duty of protecting their subjects and instead robbed them with the help of their favourites. Their misrule was taken advantage of by the nobles who became strong and defied the royal authority.\"<ref name=Hasan1959p34>Hasan, p. 34.</ref> Jayasimha was followed by his son Paramanuka, and then his grandson Vantideva (ruled 1165-72), who his often described as the last king of the Lohara dynasty.<ref name=\"IEH\">India - Early History, Publications Division Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=m_YADgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63 p.63]</ref>\n\n====Dynasty of the Vuppadevas====\n[[File:King Jagadeva of the Vuppadevas in Kashmir 1199-1213.jpg|thumb|Coin of king Jagadeva of the Vuppadevas in Kashmir 1199-1213]]\nWith the end of the Loharas, Vantideva was replaced by a new ruler named Vuppadeva, who was apparently elected by the people, and who started the eponymous dynasty of the Vuppadevas.<ref name=\"IEH\"/> Vuppadeva was succeeded in 1181 CE by his brother Jassaka, who then was succeeded by his son Jagadeva, in 1199 CE.<ref>The History and Culture of the Indian People: The struggle for empire.-2d ed, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1966, p.101</ref> Jagadeva attempted to emulate Jayasimha but had a turbulent time, being at one stage forced out of his own kingdom by his officials. His death came by poison in 1212 or 1213 and his successors met with no more success; his son, R\u0101jadeva, survived until 1235 but any power that he may have had was shackled by the nobility; his grandson, Samgr\u0101madeva, who ruled from 1235 to 1252, was forced out of the kingdom just as Jagadeva had been and then killed soon after his return.<ref name=Hasan1959p34/>\n\nAnother son of R\u0101jadeva became king in 1252. This was R\u0101madeva, who had no children and appointed Laksmandadeva, the son of a [[Brahmin]], to be his heir. Although the period of R\u0101madeva's reign was calm, that of Laksmandadeva saw deterioration in the situation once more. In this reign, which began in 1273, the troubles were caused not only by the fractious nobility but also by the territorial encroachment of [[Turkish people|Turks]]. As with his predecessors and successors, he thought little of spending money on border protection. By 1286, when Laksmandadeva'a son, Simhadeva, came to the throne, the kingdom was a much smaller place. Simhadeva survived until 1301, a largely ineffective ruler who was dominated by his advisers. He was killed by a man whom he had cuckolded.<ref name=Hasan1959p34/>\n\nThe last of the dynasty was S\u016bhadeva, the brother of Simhadeva. He was a strong ruler but also an unpopular one. He taxed heavily and exempted not even the Brahmins from his exactions. Although he managed to unite the kingdom under his control there is a sense in which the majority of it was united against him. Furthermore, \"Socially and morally the people of Kashmir had sunk to the lowest depths, for old and young alike had taken to falsehood, intrigue, dishonesty and discord\", says Hasan.<ref name=Hasan1959p34/>\n\nThe widow of S\u016bhadeva, queen Kot\u0101 took his place but was usurped by [[Shah Mir]], a Muslim who had moved into the area from the south. The kingdom had been subjected to Muslim influence even prior to his arrival{{#tag:ref|At least as far back as the 7th century, in the time when the K\u0101rkota dynasty ruled Kashmir, Kashmiris were \"feeling extraordinarily pinched by the Arab aggression in the Indus valley\", according to Ronald Davidson,<ref>Davidson, p. 44.</ref>|group=nb}} and some people had already converted to the religion from Hinduism. By the end of the 14th century the vast majority of the kashmir had become Muslim, although the Brahmins still maintained their traditional roles as the learned administrators until the accession of [[Sikandar Butshikan]].<ref>Stein (1900), Vol. 1, p. 130.</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nMohibbul Hasan describes the collapse of order as: {{quote|The [[Damara (feudal landlord)|D\u00e3maras]] or feudal chiefs grew powerful, defied royal authority, and by their constant revolts plunged the country into confusion. Life and property were not safe, agriculture declined, and there were periods when trade came to a standstill.
