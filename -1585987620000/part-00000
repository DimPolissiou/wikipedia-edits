They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]], (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejovi\u0107|1988|p=}}\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Ni\u0161]]).\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Ba\u010dka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nThe chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Ni\u0161), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirkovi\u0107|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanovi\u0107|Mihajlovi\u0107|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. The Serbian rulers adopted Christianity in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459.

From 1521 to 1552, Ottomans conquered Belgrade and regions of Syrmia, Ba\u010dka, and Banat.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=115, 119}} Continuing wars and various rebellions constantly challenged Ottoman rule.

They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]], (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejovi\u0107|1988|p=}}\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Ni\u0161]]).\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Ba\u010dka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nThe chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Ni\u0161), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirkovi\u0107|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanovi\u0107|Mihajlovi\u0107|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. At the same time, its northwestern parts were included in the [[Western Roman Empire]].

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. The Serbian rulers adopted Christianity in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459.
