Each annual season of play is divided into two splits, spring and summer, both consisting of nine weeks of [[round-robin tournament]] play, which then conclude with play-off tournaments between the top six teams. At the end of the season, the winner of the summer split, the team with the most championship points, and the winner of the gauntlet tournament qualify for the annual [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]]. The LEC represents the highest level of ''League of Legends'' play in Europe.\n\nWith the exception of some touring events, all games of the LEC are played live at Riot Games' studio in [[Adlershof]], [[Berlin]], Germany.

The top three teams advanced to the [[Season 3 World Championships]].\n\nRiot Games changed naming conventions in 2014, calling the season the \"2014 Season\" instead of \"Season 4\".

Each season is divided into two splits. The regular season of each split consists of 9 weeks of play, in which each team plays each other twice, for a total of 18 games each. At the conclusion of each split, a playoff consisting of the top 6 teams from the regular season is played to determine the final standings. \n\nThe current playoff format introduced in 2019 consists of 4 rounds. In round 1, the third seed chooses to face either the fifth or sixth seed and the fourth seed faces the remaining team. The winners of these matches then play each other in round 2, and the winner of this match advances to the round 3. In round 3, the first and second seeds play against each other in a \"juggernaut\" match. The winner of this match advances directly to the final round; the loser faces the winner of round 2 in a \"decider\" match, and the winner of this decider match advances to the final.\n\nEach split's playoffs award cash prizes and Championship Points, which are used to determine qualification into the annual ''League of Legends'' World Championship. The winner of the summer split automatically qualifies as Europe's first seed, while the next four teams ranked by Championship Point total play the Regional Qualifier Tournament to determine the two additional seeds for the World Championship.\n\n===Overview===\n\n* 10 teams participate.\n* Each team plays 18 matches:\n** Using a Double Round Robin format.\n** Each match is a best of one.\n* The top 6 teams qualifies to the playoffs.\n* [https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.eu.lolesports.com/LEC+Rulebook+'19+(Updated_+18.01.2019).pdf Official 2019 Season LEC Rulebook]\n\n===Teams===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Teams\n!rowspan=\"2\"|First appearance in LCS\n!colspan=\"5\"|Starting Rosters\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Coach\n|-\n!Top\n!Jungle\n!Mid\n!Bot\n!Support\n|-\n|'''[[Fnatic]]'''\n|Spring 2013\n|{{flagicon|BEL}} Bwipo\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Selfmade<br/> {{flagicon|UK}} Dan\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Nemesis\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Rekkles]]\n|{{flagicon|BUL}} Hylissang\n|{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Mithy]]\n|-\n|-\n|'''[[SK Gaming]]'''\n|Spring 2013\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} Sacre\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Trick (League of Legends player)|Trick]]\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Jenax\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Crownshot\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} LIMIT\n|{{flagicon|BUL}} Unlimited\n|-\n|'''[[Origen (esports)|Origen]]'''\n|Summer 2015\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Alphari\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Xerxe\n|{{flagicon|NOR}} Nukeduck\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Upset\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} Destiny\n|{{flagicon|POR}} Guilhoto\n|-\n|'''[[G2 Esports]]'''\n|Spring 2016\n|{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Wunder (video game player)|Wunder]]\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Jankos\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} [[PerkZ|Perkz]]\n|{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Caps (video game player)|Caps]]\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Mikyx\n|{{flagicon|GER}} GrabbZ\n|-\n|'''[[Team Vitality]]'''\n|Spring 2016\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Cabochard]]\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Skeanz\n|{{flagicon|SER}} Milica\n|{{flagicon|GRE}} Comp\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Jactroll\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Duke\n|-\n|'''[[FC Schalke 04 (esports)|Schalke 04]]'''\n|Summer 2016\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Odoamne\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Gilius\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Abbedagge\n|{{Flagicon|Greece}} [[FORG1VEN]]<br/>{{flagicon|BUL}} Innaxe\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} Dreams\n|{{flagicon|CAN}} Dylan Falco\n|-\n|'''[[Misfits Gaming]]'''\n|Spring 2017\n|{{flagicon|NLD}} Dan Dan\n|{{flagicon|ESP}} Razork\n|{{flagicon|NLD}} [[Febiven]]\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} Bvoy\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} denyk \n|{{flagicon|ESP}} Jandro\n|-\n|'''[[Excel Esports]]'''\n|Spring 2019\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Expect (League of Legends player)|Expect]]\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Caedrel\n|{{flagicon|South Korea}} Mickey\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Patrik\n|{{flagicon|NOR}} Tore<br/>{{flagicon|UK}} [[KaSing]]\n|{{flagicon|NED}} YoungBuck\n|-\n|'''[[Rogue (esports)|Rogue]]'''\n|Spring 2019\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} Finn\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Inspired\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} Larssen\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Hans Sama<br />{{flagicon|POL}} Woolite\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Vander\n|{{flagicon|UK}} fredy122\n\n|-\n|'''[[Splyce|MAD Lions]]'''\n|Spring 2020\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Orome \n|{{flagicon|ITA}} Shad0w\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Humanoid\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Carzzy\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Gistick\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Mac\n|}\n\n<!-- ===Current Player of the Game standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Each season is divided into two splits. The regular season of each split consists of 9 weeks of play, in which each team plays each other twice, for a total of 18 games each. At the conclusion of each split, a playoff consisting of the top 6 teams from the regular season is played to determine the final standings. \n\nThe current playoff format introduced in 2019 consists of 4 rounds. In round 1, the third seed chooses to face either the fifth or sixth seed and the fourth seed faces the remaining team. The winners of these matches then play each other in round 2, and the winner of this match advances to the round 3. In round 3, the first and second seeds play against each other in a \"juggernaut\" match. The winner of this match advances directly to the final round; the loser faces the winner of round 2 in a \"decider\" match, and the winner of this decider match advances to the final.\n\nEach split's playoffs award cash prizes and Championship Points, which are used to determine qualification into the annual ''League of Legends'' World Championship.

It is boosted into space by a [[launch vehicle]], then re-enters Earth's atmosphere and lands as a [[spaceplane]]. The X-37 is operated by the [[United States Space Force]] for orbital [[Spaceflight#Earth-launched spaceflight|spaceflight]] missions intended to demonstrate [[reusable launch system|reusable space technologies]].<ref name=USAF_factsh/> It is a 120%-scaled derivative of the earlier [[Boeing X-40]]. The X-37 began as a [[NASA]] project in 1999, before being transferred to the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] in 2004. Its first flight was during a drop test in 2006. X-37s have completed five orbital missions.\n\nThe spaceplane's first mission, [[USA-212]], was launched in April 2010 and returned to Earth in December 2010. A second X-37 was launched on mission [[USA-226]] in March 2011 and returned in June 2012. The third mission was [[USA-240]], which launched in December 2012 and landed in October 2014. The fourth mission, USA-261, launched in May 2015 and landed in May 2017. The fifth and latest X-37 mission, USA-277, was launched on 7 September 2017, and was the longest X-37 mission to date,<ref name=\"GZM-20190827\">{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/secret-u-s-air-force-spaceplane-breaks-record-with-719-1837605822 |title=Secretive U.S. Air Force Spaceplane Breaks Record With 719 Straight Days in Orbit|work=[[Gizmodo]]|last=Novak|first=Matt|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref> landing on 27 October 2019 after {{time interval|7 September 2017 14:00|27 October 2019 07:51|show=d|duration=on}} in orbit.<ref name=\"sfnow20191027\"/><ref name=\"today20191027\"/>\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\n[[File:X-37 spacecraft, artist's rendition.jpeg|thumb|left|An artist's rendering of the X-37 spacecraft in 1999]]\n\nIn 1999, NASA selected [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security|Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]] to design and develop an orbital vehicle, built by the California branch of Boeing's [[Boeing Phantom Works|Phantom Works]].
