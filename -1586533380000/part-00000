During his entire career, he played for [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], whom he led to six national championships and one national cup. He is commonly regarded as the greatest Schalke player of all time alongside [[Fritz Szepan]]. A highly athletic, technical and prolific forward, Kuzorra is also commonly regarded as one of the greatest German forwards.\n\n==Life==\nErnst Kuzorra was born as the son of Karl Kuzorra from [[East Prussia]] and his wife Bertha in the industrial town of [[Gelsenkirchen]] where his father worked as a coal miner. Ernst joined the club in 1920 at the age of 14, allegedly playing his first match in his [[confirmation]] shoes after being asked to join the team while watching from the sidelines. Three years later, he advanced to the first team, where he soon became one of the starting players. During the years 1930\u201331, he and thirteen teammates were banned for a relatively minor infraction of the strict amateur statutes, having received ten instead of the allowed five [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] as compensation for playing in an away game.\n\nIn the following years, Kuzorra along with his brother-in-law [[Fritz Szepan]] led Schalke to become the dominant team in German soccer, winning six national championships from 1934 to 1942. He was one of the main axes of what became known as the ''Schalker Kreisel'', a system that used quick, short passes to confuse and overwhelm the opponent.\n\nEven though he may have been the best German player on his position at the time, he only had 12 appearances for the national team,<ref name=rsssf>{{Cite web | url = http://rsssf.com/miscellaneous/kuzorra-intl.html | title = Ernst Kuzorra - Goals in International Matches | first = Matthias | last = Arnhold | date = 22 September 2016 | accessdate = 26 September 2016 | publisher = [[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]}}</ref> a fact that is widely attributed to bad relations with national coach [[Otto Nerz]]. Nevertheless, because of his success and his athletic prowess, [[Nazism|national socialist]] propaganda soon took an interest in him. Great efforts were made to show that Kuzorra, despite his [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] sounding name and mixed origin, was in fact of purely [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] stock. The success of these efforts was limited, however, as Kuzorra remained politically uninterested and due to his taciturn character a poor instrument for public campaigns.\n\nAfter the war, Kuzorra remained playing for a few years, mainly for material reasons - at the time, soccer players were often reimbursed in otherwise scarce foodstuff. In 1950 he retired, and from then on earned his livelihood as proprietor of a tobacco and lottery store. Over time, he became a living legend, especially among the supporters of Schalke 04. In 1985, he finally received the honorary citizenship of his home town, Gelsenkirchen. Ernst Kuzorra died on New Year's Day in 1990 at the age of 84.\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\nRef.<ref>{{cite book|author=FC Schalke 04|title=K\u00f6nigsblau: Die Geschichte des FC Schalke

{"title_page": "Edward Dubois (wit)", "text_new": "'''Edward Dubois''' (4 January 1774 \u2013 1850) was an English wit and [[man of letters]].\n\n==Early life==\nDubois, son of William Dubois, a merchant in [[London]], whose father was a native of [[Neuch\u00e2tel|Neufch\u00e2tel]], was born at [[Love Lane]], in the city of London. Educated at home, he came to know the classics well as well as having some knowledge of French, Italian, and Spanish.\n\n==Man of letters==\nHe adopted [[literature]] as his profession, and although he was called to the bar at the [[Inner Temple]], on 5 May 1809, he did not meet with sufficient success to abandon his pen. He was a regular contributor to various periodicals, and especially to the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' under Perry. Art notices, dramatic criticisms, and verses on the topics of the day were his principal contributions; and to the last day of his life he retained his position of art critic on the staff of ''[[The Observer]]''. When the ''[[Monthly Mirror]]'' was the property of the eccentric [[Thomas Hill (book collector)|Thomas Hill]], it was edited by Dubois, and on Hill's death he gained financially as one of the two executors and residuary legatees.\n\n[[Theodore Hook]] was among his assistants on the ''Monthly Mirror'', and [[Richard Harris Barham]], when writing Hook's life, obtained \"many of the most interesting details\" of Hook's early history from Dubois. Dubois assisted [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]] in editing the first number of [[Henry Colburn]]'s ''[[New Monthly Magazine]]'', but before the second number could be issued differences broke out and they separated. For a few years he was the editor of the ''[[Lady's Magazine]]'', and for the same period he conducted the ''[[European Magazine]]''.\n\n==Relationship with Sir Philip Francis==\nHe is sometimes said to have been \"a connection\" of [[Sir Philip Francis]], at other times his private secretary, and they were certainly on intimate terms of friendship from 1807 until Francis's death in 1818. If Francis had gone out as governor of [[Buenos Aires]] in 1807, Dubois would have accompanied him as private secretary. He compiled Francis's biography in the ''Monthly Mirror'' for 1810, and wrote the life of Francis which appeared in the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' for 28 December 1818. When [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]] was composing his ''Memoir'' of [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Lord Loughborough]], Dubois obtained for him a long memorandum from Lady Francis on the authorship of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]''.\n\nThe first of these lives is said to have prompted the publication of [[John Taylor (English publisher)|John Taylor]]'s ''Junius Identified'', and it has more than once been insinuated that Dubois was the real author of that volume. Considerable correspondence and articles on the general subject of the ''Letters of Junius'' and on Taylor's work appeared in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' for 1850 (some of which will be found in [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]]'s ''Papers of a Critic'', vol. ii.), but the connection of Dubois with the authorship of ''Junius Identified'' was set at rest by the assurance of Taylor (''[[Notes and Queries]]'', 1850, pp.&nbsp;258\u20139) that he \u2018never received the slightest assistance from Mr. Dubois.\u2019a\n\n==Later life==\nFor many years, at least twenty years, Dubois was assistant to Serjeant Heath, judge of the court of requests, a \u2018strange and whimsical court,\u2019 as it has been designated.\n\nWhen county courts were established a [[judge]]ship was offered to Dubois, but he preferred to continue as Heath's deputy. In 1833 he was appointed by [[Lord Brougham]] to the office of treasurer and secretary of the Metropolitan Lunacy Commission, and on the abolition of that body in 1845 was employed under the new commission without any special duties.

The case came before [[Lord Ellenborough]] and a special jury, at [[Guildhall]], 1 August 1808, when the judge summed up in favour of the defendants, and the verdict was given for them.

Educated at home, he came to know the classics well as well as having some knowledge of French, Italian, and Spanish.\n\n==Man of letters==\nHe adopted [[literature]] as his profession, and although he was called to the bar at the [[Inner Temple]], on 5 May 1809, he did not meet with sufficient success to abandon his pen. He was a regular contributor to various periodicals, and especially to the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' under Perry. Art notices, dramatic criticisms, and verses on the topics of the day were his principal contributions; and to the last day of his life he retained his position of art critic on the staff of ''[[The Observer]]''. When the ''[[Monthly Mirror]]'' was the property of the eccentric [[Thomas Hill (book collector)|Thomas Hill]], it was edited by Dubois, and on Hill's death he gained financially as one of the two executors and residuary legatees.\n\n[[Theodore Hook]] was among his assistants on the ''Monthly Mirror'', and [[Richard Harris Barham]], when writing Hook's life, obtained \"many of the most interesting details\" of Hook's early history from Dubois. Dubois assisted [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]] in editing the first number of [[Henry Colburn]]'s ''[[New Monthly Magazine]]'', but before the second number could be issued differences broke out and they separated. For a few years he was the editor of the ''[[Lady's Magazine]]'', and for the same period he conducted the ''[[European Magazine]]''.\n\n==Relationship with Sir Philip Francis==\nHe is sometimes said to have been \"a connection\" of [[Sir Philip Francis]], at other times his private secretary, and they were certainly on intimate terms of friendship from 1807 until Francis's death in 1818. If Francis had gone out as governor of [[Buenos Aires]] in 1807, Dubois would have accompanied him as private secretary. He compiled Francis's biography in the ''Monthly Mirror'' for 1810, and wrote the life of Francis which appeared in the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' for 28 December 1818. When [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]] was composing his ''Memoir'' of [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Lord Loughborough]], Dubois obtained for him a long memorandum from Lady Francis on the authorship of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]''.\n\nThe first of these lives is said to have prompted the publication of [[John Taylor (English publisher)|John Taylor]]'s ''Junius Identified'', and it has more than once been insinuated that Dubois was the real author of that volume. Considerable correspondence and articles on the general subject of the ''Letters of Junius'' and on Taylor's work appeared in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' for 1850 (some of which will be found in [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]]'s ''Papers of a Critic'', vol. ii.), but the connection of Dubois with the authorship of ''Junius Identified'' was set at rest by the assurance of Taylor (''[[Notes and Queries]]'', 1850, pp.&nbsp;258\u20139) that he \u2018never received the slightest assistance from Mr. Dubois.\u2019a\n\n==Later life==\nFor many years, at least twenty years, Dubois was assistant to Serjeant Heath, judge of the court of requests, a \u2018strange and whimsical court,\u2019 as it has been designated.\n\nWhen county courts were established a [[judge]]ship was offered to Dubois, but he preferred to continue as Heath's deputy. In 1833 he was appointed by [[Lord Brougham]] to the office of treasurer and secretary of the Metropolitan Lunacy Commission, and on the abolition of that body in 1845 was employed under the new commission without any special duties. These appointments he retained until his death, and their duties were discharged by him with success; for although he loved a joke, even in court, he never allowed this propensity to get the mastery over his natural astuteness. His face was naturally droll, his wit was caustic, and he was \u2018capital at the dinner table.\u2019\n\nHe died at [[Sloane Street]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], on 10 January 1850, aged 76.
