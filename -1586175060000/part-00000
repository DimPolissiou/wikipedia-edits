After Dombo's death, his successor adopted the title Mambo. The term \"Rozvi\" refers to their legacy as a warrior nation known as the plunderers.\n\n==History==\nIn 1683, Portuguese militia tried to take control of the gold trade in the interior of Africa by invading the Rozvi empire. The Rozvi, armed with the traditional spears and shields, were able to successfully defeat these attacks and maintain their control of the gold mines until their empire collapsed. The Rozvi were led by [[Changamire Dombo]], and his son Kambgun Dombo<ref>Isichei, Elizabeth Allo, ''A History of African Societies to 1870'' Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0521455992}} page 435</ref> whose power was based in [[Kingdom of Butua|Butua]] in the southwest of Africa. The Rozvi were formed from several Shona states that dominated the plateau of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] at the time. They drove the Portuguese off the central plateau, and the Europeans retained only a nominal presence at one of the fair-towns in the eastern highlands.\n\nChangamire brought the whole of present-day Zimbabwe under his control, forming a polity that became known as the Rozvi Empire. This powerful kingdom of warriors was to be known as the Rozvi or baLozwi people.<ref name=\"brit1\">{{cite news |url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064305/Rozvi|title= Rozvi |work= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate= 2007-05-09}}</ref> They established their capital at [[Danamombe]], also known as [[Dhlo-Dhlo]] (the [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] name).\n\nMany sources see the Rozvi not as a recovering segment of the [[Mutapa]] people, but in fact a people in its own right emerging under the wing of the Mutapa (compare the rise of the [[Khumalo clan|Khumalo]] from under the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nation). The administrative power of the Mutapa began to fail in its control of the whole empire, and tributaries began to exert more independence.  {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nA leader of the people of Guruuswa, given the title Changamire and known as Dombo, became independent from the Mutapa. When the Portuguese tried to colonize them, Changamire Dombo led rebellions against their rule. The area of the Rozvi Empire fluctuated. Its influence extended over much of present-day Zimbabwe, westward into Botswana, and southward into northeastern South Africa. The Rozvi leader Changamire Dombo was originally a herdsmen in the Mutapa state, yet managed to drive away the Portuguese, earning himself support and followers, thereby enabling him to break away from the legendary Mutapa empire. Changamire Dombo, according to oral tradition, is believed to have possessed supernatural powers. He was said to be able to turn a white cow into a red one, and more. His magical ability made him feared by people and earned him respect and even more followers. The name Changamire became the honour name of all the kings who followed after him.\n\nThe Rozvi's political system was hierarchical. Kingship followed a male line and the king was the highest political, religious, military, economic, judicial and social authority, as well as the main distributor of land. The King was helped to rule by an advisory council made up of state officials appointed by him; this consisted of his most senior wives, the crown prince, the ''tumbare'' (regent), religious leaders, military commanders and also vassal chiefs. The Rozvi Empire eventually became the most powerful empire in present-day Zimbabwe.{{citation needed|date=March  2017}}\n\nMany tales identify Dombo ('Rock') as Chikura Wadyembeu. Modern scholars agree that this is confusion with another leader of a different people.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Rulers of Rozvi State included Chirisa Mhuru and Chikuyo Chisamarenga.\n\n==Technology and economy==\nThe Rozvi kings revived the tradition of building in stone and constructed impressive cities, now known as 'zimbabwes', throughout the southwest. Polychrome pottery was also emblematic of its culture. The Rozvi empire had many economic branches but agriculture was its backbone. They planted crops such as sorghum and millet and the state depended heavily on subsistence farming. Livestock was also another important agricultural branch. They kept animals such as sheep, goats, cattle and chickens; those with many livestock were considered rich and were accorded very high economic status within the society. Trade was another important economic activity and the Rozvi practiced both internal and external trade. From foreign traders they obtained imported goods such as guns, salt, beads and sea shells; in return they bartered ivory, copper and gold. Mining was another major branch and was done by males. The warriors were armed with spears, shields, bows and arrows when they raided others or defended their state.\n\nIts warriors were known to be violent; this earned them the name ''rozvi'', meaning plunders or destroyers. They became the most powerful fighting force in the whole of Zimbabwe.<ref name=\"brit1\"/>\n\nThe economic power of the Rozvi empire was based on cattle wealth and farming, with significant gold mining.

The family came from Skelton close to [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]], birthplace of [[Captain James Cook]], to whom the family claimed ancestry through Mrs Wild.{{sfn|Bickel 2001|p=27}}<ref name=\"visit\" /> Her father was Robert Cook, who claimed to be a grandson of the great explorer. By 1875 the Wild family had moved from Skelton to [[Stickford]] in Lincolnshire, and in late 1880 moved again to [[Wheldrake]] near [[York]].<ref name=\"visit\" />\n\nWild's family next moved to the village of [[Eversholt, Bedfordshire|Eversholt]] in Bedfordshire.<ref name=\"visit\" /> Here his father was appointed clerk of the Eversholt Parochial Charity at [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]].{{sfn|Nature Obit, 30 September 1939}} Frank Wild was educated at [[Bedford]]. He joined the [[Merchant Navy]] in 1889 at the age of 16, receiving his early training in sail in the clipper ship ''Sobraon''. In the Merchant Navy he rose to the rank of second officer. In 1900, aged 26, he joined the [[Royal Navy]]. The 1901 census shows that at that time he was serving as an [[Able seaman]] aged 27 on {{HMS|Edinburgh|1882|6}}, anchored in [[Sheerness]] Harbour.\n\n== Antarctic exploration ==\n[[File:TheSouthernParty.jpg|thumb|Frank Wild (left side) beside Shackleton]]\nFrank Wild took part in the following Antarctic expeditions:\n\n* In 1901 he was a member of [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s crew as an [[Able seaman]] on the ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'', along with [[Ernest Shackleton]] who was then a sub-lieutenant.\n* He was with Shackleton on the [[Nimrod Expedition|Nimrod Expedition 1908\u20131909]] and was a member of the team that crossed the Ross Barrier and [[Beardmore Glacier]] at a record latitude of 88\u00ba23'S.\n* In 1911 he joined [[Douglas Mawson]]'s ''[[SY Aurora|Aurora]]'' expedition and was in charge of the western base on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]].\n* He served as Shackleton's second-in-command on Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914\u20131916)]].\n* He was second-in-command of the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]] (1921\u201322).\n\nAs second-in-command of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Wild was left in charge of twenty-one men on desolate [[Elephant Island]] as Shackleton and a crew of five made their epic rescue mission to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] aboard a lifeboat. From 24 April to 30 August 1916 Wild and his crew waited on Elephant Island, surviving on a diet of seal, penguin and seaweed. They were finally rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship ''[[Yelcho (1906)|Yelcho]]''. [[Point Wild]] on Elephant Island is named after Frank Wild, with a monument dedicated to the Chilean captain [[Luis Pardo]] who rescued him and his men.\n\nOn returning to the United Kingdom in 1916, Wild volunteered for duty during [[World War I]] and was made a temporary lieutenant in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]]. After taking a [[Russian language]] course, Wild became the [[Royal Navy]]'s transport officer at [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], where he superintended the war materials which arrived during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention in Russia]]. After the war, Wild went to South Africa where he farmed in [[Nyasaland|British Nyasaland]] with [[Francis Howard Bickerton|Francis Bickerton]] and [[James McIlroy (surgeon)|James McIlroy]], two former Antarctic comrades.<ref name=\"stein\" />\n\nFrom 1921 to 1922 Wild was second-in-command of the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]], a poorly equipped expedition with no clear plan, and a small ship, the ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]''. [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] died of a heart attack on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] during the expedition, and Wild took over command and completed the journey, combating unfavourable weather to Elephant Island and along the Antarctic coast.<ref name=\"stein\" />\n\nFrank Wild's younger brother [[Ernest Wild]] also went on to become a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] seaman and [[Antarctic]] explorer, receiving a [[Polar Medal]].\n\n==Later years==\n{{more citations needed|section|date = December 2015}}\nOn 24 October 1922 Frank Wild married Vera Alexandra Altman (n\u00e9e Bogosoff), the widow of a tea planter of [[Borneo]], at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] Registry Office. They had first met in 1918 when Wild was serving in Russia, and he had assisted her to obtain a passage home to England. After the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]] Wild returned to South Africa with Vera where he continued to farm. He bought some land in the Mkuzi valley in [[Natal Province|Zululand]] where he tried to grow cotton.\n\nThe enterprise was a financial disaster and after five years of drought followed by flood, Wild gave up. Next he was involved in railway construction and for a time had some success with a contract to extend the South African railway to the border with [[Swaziland]]. However, the contract ended and he was forced to seek employment elsewhere.<ref name=\"visit\" />\n\nWild's marriage to Vera was in difficulty shortly after arriving in Zululand and she asked for a divorce, which became absolute on 27 December 1928. Next, Wild took a temporary job as a hotel barman at Gollel in [[Swaziland]] which was owned by a friend of his. Caught in the 1930 Depression, he was forced to move from job to job, including working as a battery manager at a diamond mine which went bankrupt, prospecting in [[Rhodesia]] and managing a quarry. He subsidised his meagre income by giving the occasional lecture on the ''[[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Endurance]]'' expedition.\n\nHe married for the second time on 18 March 1931. His new wife, Beatrice (Trixie) Lydia Rhys Rowbotham, was 47&nbsp;years old and ten years his junior. They settled in [[Germiston]] where in 1932 he worked supervising a stone-crushing machine at a [[Witwatersrand]] gold mine. Very happily married, the following four years saw relative peace and calm and Wild earned enough money not only to buy a car (a [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]]) but to take two well needed holidays in the hinterland and coast of South Africa.\n\nDue to ill health he was forced to leave the mining job and he was given a job by his brother-in-law Pat O'Brien Frost to oversee the building of Frost's house in Haenertsburg in the Eastern Transvaal. However, he had little respect for Frost; that and the demands of building the house in an extremely remote part of the country caused him to return to [[Johannesburg]]. By now he was in poor health but retained his characteristic kind, calm countenance. With the offer of a job as a store-keeper on the Babrosco Mine near [[Klerksdorp]] from his friend Jack Scott, the mining magnate, he and Trixie finally found the peace they were seeking. He had also been awarded the [[Civil List pension]] from Downing Street.\n\nFrank Wild died of [[pneumonia]] and [[diabetes]] in Klerksdorp on 19 August 1939, aged 66&nbsp;years. He was cremated on 23 August 1939 at the Braamfontein Cemetery in [[Johannesburg]].\n\n==Honours and memorials==\nWild was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|New Year Honours List]] of 1920 and in May 1923 he was made a [[Freeman of the City of London#Borough Freedom of the City of London|Freeman of the City of London]].<ref name=\"Ward coolantarctica\" /> He was also the recipient of a number of awards for his contributions to exploration and for advancing geography: He received the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Back Award]] in 1916 and the Society's [[Patron's Medal]] in 1924.\n\n[[Cape Wild]] and [[Point Wild]] on [[Elephant Island]] in the Antarctic are named after him, as is [[Mount Wild (Queen Alexandra Range)|Mount Wild]] in the Queen Alexandra Range and [[Mount Wild (Graham Land)|Mount Wild]] in Graham Land. His CBE and four-bar [[Polar Medal]] sold for \u00a3132,000 in September 2009, more than double the estimate.<ref name=\"Times 21 Sept 2009\" />\n\nOn 27 November 2011 the ashes of Frank Wild, Shackleton's \"right-hand man\", were interred on the right-hand side of Shackleton's grave site in [[Grytviken]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]; the ashes had previously been found in the vault of Braamfontein Cemetery, Johannesburg, by journalist and author Angie Butler while researching a book. The inscription on the rough-hewn granite block set to mark the spot reads \"Frank Wild 1873\u20131939, Shackleton's right-hand man.\"\n\nWild's relatives and Shackleton's granddaughter, the Hon.&nbsp;Alexandra Shackleton, attended a service conducted by the Rev Dr Richard Hines, rector of the [[Falkland Islands]]. Butler said, \"''His ashes will now be where they were always supposed to be. It just took them a long time getting there.''\"{{sfn|Telegraph, ''Forgotten hero'', 8 December 2011}} The journey to South Georgia, the service and the interment were the subject of a [[BBC Radio 4]] programme in the ''[[Crossing Continents]]'' series.\n\nOn 25 November 2011 the Government of [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands]] issued a set of commemorative postage stamps honouring Frank Wild along with other Antarctic pioneers. The set comprises eight stamps in four [[Se-tenant (philately)|se-tenant]] pairs with denominations of 60, 70 and 90&nbsp;pence, and \u00a31.15. They are available from the [[Falkland Islands]] Philatelic Bureau.\n\nIn April 2012 [[BBC2]] broadcast \"Frank Wild: Antarctica's Forgotten Hero\", presented by [[Paul Rose (TV presenter)|Paul Rose]], which placed Wild's achievements alongside those of Shackleton and the other explorers of the Heroic Age. The documentary film also featured commentary from polar historian Dr.&nbsp;[[Huw Lewis-Jones]], author [[Francis Spufford]] and explorer Sir&nbsp;[[Ranulph Fiennes]].<ref name=\"BBC News\" /> Of Wild, Paul Rose has said: \"''He was a true great. He stood shoulder to shoulder with Shackleton. They made the perfect team. With Shackleton\u2019s great leadership skills, and Frank\u2019s cool head and experience, they were able to handle almost anything that the Antarctic could throw at them.''\"<ref name=\"BBC\" />\n\nOn 29 September 2016, a statue of Wild was unveiled in his hometown of [[Skelton-in-Cleveland]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"stein\">{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctic-circle.org/medals.htm| title=Antarctic Medals \u2013 Frank Wild's Medals| author=Glenn M.

The 1901 census shows that at that time he was serving as an [[Able seaman]] aged 27 on {{HMS|Edinburgh|1882|6}}, anchored in [[Sheerness]] Harbour.\n\n== Antarctic exploration ==\n[[File:TheSouthernParty.jpg|thumb|Frank Wild (left side) beside Shackleton]]\nFrank Wild took part in the following Antarctic expeditions:\n\n* In 1901 he was a member of [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s crew as an [[Able seaman]] on the ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'', along with [[Ernest Shackleton]] who was then a sub-lieutenant.\n* He was with Shackleton on the [[Nimrod Expedition|Nimrod Expedition 1908\u20131909]] and was a member of the team that crossed the Ross Barrier and [[Beardmore Glacier]] at a record latitude of 88\u00ba23'S.\n* In 1911 he joined [[Douglas Mawson]]'s ''[[SY Aurora|Aurora]]'' expedition and was in charge of the western base on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]].\n* He served as Shackleton's second-in-command on Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914\u20131916)]].\n* He was second-in-command of the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]] (1921\u201322).\n\nAs second-in-command of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Wild was left in charge of twenty-one men on desolate [[Elephant Island]] as Shackleton and a crew of five made their epic rescue mission to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] aboard a lifeboat. From 24 April to 30 August 1916 Wild and his crew waited on Elephant Island, surviving on a diet of seal, penguin and seaweed. They were finally rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship ''[[Yelcho (1906)|Yelcho]]''. [[Point Wild]] on Elephant Island is named after Frank Wild, with a monument dedicated to the Chilean captain [[Luis Pardo]] who rescued him and his men.\n\nOn returning to the United Kingdom in 1916, Wild volunteered for duty during [[World War I]] and was made a temporary lieutenant in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]]. After taking a [[Russian language]] course, Wild became the [[Royal Navy]]'s transport officer at [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], where he superintended the war materials which arrived during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention in Russia]]. After the war, Wild went to South Africa where he farmed in [[Nyasaland|British Nyasaland]] with [[Francis Howard Bickerton|Francis Bickerton]] and [[James McIlroy (surgeon)|James McIlroy]], two former Antarctic comrades.<ref name=\"stein\" />\n\nFrom 1921 to 1922 Wild was second-in-command of the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]], a poorly equipped expedition with no clear plan, and a small ship, the ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]''. [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] died of a heart attack on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] during the expedition, and Wild took over command and completed the journey, combating unfavourable weather to Elephant Island and along the Antarctic coast.<ref name=\"stein\" />\n\nFrank Wild's younger brother [[Ernest Wild]] also went on to become a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] seaman and [[Antarctic]] explorer, receiving a [[Polar Medal]].\n\n==Later years==\n{{more citations needed|section|date = December 2015}}\nOn 24 October 1922 Frank Wild married Vera Alexandra Altman (n\u00e9e Bogosoff), the widow of a tea planter of [[Borneo]], at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] Registry Office. They had first met in 1918 when Wild was serving in Russia, and he had assisted her to obtain a passage home to England. After the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]] Wild returned to South Africa with Vera where he continued to farm. He bought some land in the Mkuzi valley in [[Natal Province|Zululand]] where he tried to grow cotton.\n\nThe enterprise was a financial disaster and after five years of drought followed by flood, Wild gave up. Next he was involved in railway construction and for a time had some success with a contract to extend the South African railway to the border with [[Swaziland]]. However, the contract ended and he was forced to seek employment elsewhere.<ref name=\"visit\" />\n\nWild's marriage to Vera was in difficulty shortly after arriving in Zululand and she asked for a divorce, which became absolute on 27 December 1928. Next, Wild took a temporary job as a hotel barman at Gollel in [[Swaziland]] which was owned by a friend of his. Caught in the 1930 Depression, he was forced to move from job to job, including working as a battery manager at a diamond mine which went bankrupt, prospecting in [[Rhodesia]] and managing a quarry. He subsidised his meagre income by giving the occasional lecture on the ''[[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Endurance]]'' expedition.\n\nHe married for the second time on 18 March 1931. His new wife, Beatrice (Trixie) Lydia Rhys Rowbotham, was 47&nbsp;years old and ten years his junior. They settled in [[Germiston]] where in 1932 he worked supervising a stone-crushing machine at a [[Witwatersrand]] gold mine. Very happily married, the following four years saw relative peace and calm and Wild earned enough money not only to buy a car (a [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]]) but to take two well needed holidays in the hinterland and coast of South Africa.\n\nDue to ill health he was forced to leave the mining job and he was given a job by his brother-in-law Pat O'Brien Frost to oversee the building of Frost's house in Haenertsburg in the Eastern Transvaal. However, he had little respect for Frost; that and the demands of building the house in an extremely remote part of the country caused him to return to [[Johannesburg]]. By now he was in poor health but retained his characteristic kind, calm countenance. With the offer of a job as a store-keeper on the Babrosco Mine near [[Klerksdorp]] from his friend Jack Scott, the mining magnate, he and Trixie finally found the peace they were seeking. He had also been awarded the [[Civil List pension]] from Downing Street.\n\nFrank Wild died of [[pneumonia]] and [[diabetes]] in Klerksdorp on 19 August 1939, aged 66&nbsp;years. He was cremated on 23 August 1939 at the Braamfontein Cemetery in [[Johannesburg]].\n\n==Honours and memorials==\nWild was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|New Year Honours List]] of 1920 and in May 1923 he was made a [[Freeman of the City of London#Borough Freedom of the City of London|Freeman of the City of London]].<ref name=\"Ward coolantarctica\" /> He was also the recipient of a number of awards for his contributions to exploration and for advancing geography: He received the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Back Award]] in 1916 and the Society's [[Patron's Medal]] in 1924.\n\n[[Cape Wild]] and [[Point Wild]] on [[Elephant Island]] in the Antarctic are named after him, as is [[Mount Wild (Queen Alexandra Range)|Mount Wild]] in the Queen Alexandra Range and [[Mount Wild (Graham Land)|Mount Wild]] in Graham Land. His CBE and four-bar [[Polar Medal]] sold for \u00a3132,000 in September 2009, more than double the estimate.<ref name=\"Times 21 Sept 2009\" />\n\nOn 27 November 2011 the ashes of Frank Wild, Shackleton's \"right-hand man\", were interred on the right-hand side of Shackleton's grave site in [[Grytviken]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]; the ashes had previously been found in the vault of Braamfontein Cemetery, Johannesburg, by journalist and author Angie Butler while researching a book. The inscription on the rough-hewn granite block set to mark the spot reads \"Frank Wild 1873\u20131939, Shackleton's right-hand man.\"\n\nWild's relatives and Shackleton's granddaughter, the Hon.&nbsp;Alexandra Shackleton, attended a service conducted by the Rev Dr Richard Hines, rector of the [[Falkland Islands]]. Butler said, \"''His ashes will now be where they were always supposed to be. It just took them a long time getting there.''\"{{sfn|Telegraph, ''Forgotten hero'', 8 December 2011}} The journey to South Georgia, the service and the interment were the subject of a [[BBC Radio 4]] programme in the ''[[Crossing Continents]]'' series.\n\nOn 25 November 2011 the Government of [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands]] issued a set of commemorative postage stamps honouring Frank Wild along with other Antarctic pioneers. The set comprises eight stamps in four [[Se-tenant (philately)|se-tenant]] pairs with denominations of 60, 70 and 90&nbsp;pence, and \u00a31.15. They are available from the [[Falkland Islands]] Philatelic Bureau.\n\nIn April 2012 [[BBC2]] broadcast \"Frank Wild: Antarctica's Forgotten Hero\", presented by [[Paul Rose (TV presenter)|Paul Rose]], which placed Wild's achievements alongside those of Shackleton and the other explorers of the Heroic Age. The documentary film also featured commentary from polar historian Dr.&nbsp;[[Huw Lewis-Jones]], author [[Francis Spufford]] and explorer Sir&nbsp;[[Ranulph Fiennes]].<ref name=\"BBC News\" /> Of Wild, Paul Rose has said: \"''He was a true great. He stood shoulder to shoulder with Shackleton. They made the perfect team. With Shackleton\u2019s great leadership skills, and Frank\u2019s cool head and experience, they were able to handle almost anything that the Antarctic could throw at them.''\"<ref name=\"BBC\" />\n\nOn 29 September 2016, a statue of Wild was unveiled in his hometown of [[Skelton-in-Cleveland]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"stein\">{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctic-circle.org/medals.htm| title=Antarctic Medals \u2013 Frank Wild's Medals| author=Glenn M.

The community is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] by religion, as opposed to the [[Croats]] who are [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nIn some regions of modern-day Croatia, mainly in southern [[Dalmatia]], [[ethnic Serbs]] have been present from the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} Serbs from modern-day Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina started actively migrating to Croatia in several migration waves after 1538 when the [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] granted them the right to settle on the territory of the [[Military Frontier]]. In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]].

The Venetian government welcomed immigrants, as they protected possessions against the Ottomans. The [[Morlachs]], former Ottoman subjects, helped Venice triple its size in Dalmatia. The bishop of Makarska described how many people migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Venetian territories. Major population movements into Venetian Dalmatia occurred during the 1670s and 1680s.

In 1918, it became part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which immediately joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe formation of the Serbian identity of Vlahs in Croatia began in the 18th century under the influence of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), and most of the local Orthodox priests of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] who were educated in monasteries outside Croatia under the guidance of SPC clergy who came to the southwestern region of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] during the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] (1690\u20131739).

The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. At first through the religious denomination, and by the time as a sign of national affiliation. There was also a brief occurrence when certain Catholic intellectuals, predominantly in [[Dubrovnik]], were won over by the Serbian thought.

According to the 1844 [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]]'s Na\u010dertanije, they intended to establish a Serbian Empire on the territory of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\". Geostrategic position of Belgrade in relation to Zagreb further contributed to favoring the Serbs whom Austrians did not perceive as a danger, unlike Croats who had own language, politicians, national consciousness, laws, military tradition and prepared army, as well as international [[Election in Cetin|treaties which have affirmed their rights]], so Austrians needed someone (Serbs) to discipline the Croats. The same was done by Hungary which became a strong political factor after 1848 and that wished to expand into the [[Southeast Europe]], which was particularly strong during the reign of [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] over Croatia.<ref name=\"matica.hr\"/>\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Matija Ban]], poet and dramatist, member of [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Josip Runjanin]], composer of [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]]\n| width1    = 130\n| image1    = MatijaBan.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| image2    = Josip Runjanin.png\n}}\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutionary 1848]] and the process of building a modern Croatian nation resulted in closer co-operation between Croats and Serbs and recognition of their equality in the sense of [[Illyrian Movement]] (also known as the Croatian National Revival) and [[Yugoslavia]]n ideas.

Following Croat enthusiasm with the successful 1878 [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during which many Croatian soldiers died, and them seeking unification of Dalmatia and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, the conflict between Croats and Serbs was inevitable.<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\">{{cite web|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000813/podlistak.htm|title=SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, NEDJELJA 13. kolovoza 2000. \u2013 podlistak: Preokret i odvajanje|website=arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr}}</ref> In 1879, Serbs from Bukovica voted for the Italian candidate instead of Croat [[Miho Klai\u0107]].<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\"/> This event was called by People's Party's supporters ''Bukovica betrail''.

The community is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] by religion, as opposed to the [[Croats]] who are [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nIn some regions of modern-day Croatia, mainly in southern [[Dalmatia]], [[ethnic Serbs]] have been present from the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} Serbs from modern-day Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina started actively migrating to Croatia in several migration waves after 1538 when the [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] granted them the right to settle on the territory of the [[Military Frontier]]. In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. After the Croatian Army's [[Operation Storm]], the RSK ceased to exist, its territory was reincorporated into Croatia, and approximately 200,000 Serbs fled the country.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 186,633 Serbs living in Croatia (4.4% of the population) which are recognized as a national minority by the Croatian Constitution and therefore have 3 permanent seats in the [[Croatian Parliament]].\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional elements of their identity are the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]], [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic script]] and military history, while modern elements are [[Serbian language|language]] and [[Serbian literature|literature]], civic, social and political values, concern for ethnic status and national organisation, and celebration of the [[Liberation of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:514233-Srbi-u-Hrvatskoj-zabrinuti-da-ce-nestati|title=Srbi u Hrvatskoj zabrinuti da \u0107e nestati}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2011 census there were 186,633 ethnic [[Serbs]] living in Croatia, 4.4% of the total population.

The Venetian government welcomed immigrants, as they protected possessions against the Ottomans. The [[Morlachs]], former Ottoman subjects, helped Venice triple its size in Dalmatia. The bishop of Makarska described how many people migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Venetian territories. Major population movements into Venetian Dalmatia occurred during the 1670s and 1680s. In the summer of 1685, Cosmi, the Archbishop of Split, wrote that Morlach leader [[Stojan Jankovi\u0107]] had brought 300 families with him to Dalmatia, and also that around Trogir and Split there were 5,000 refugees from Ottoman lands, without food; this was seen as a serious threat to the defense of Dalmatia.

In 1918, it became part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which immediately joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe formation of the Serbian identity of Vlahs in Croatia began in the 18th century under the influence of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), and most of the local Orthodox priests of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] who were educated in monasteries outside Croatia under the guidance of SPC clergy who came to the southwestern region of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] during the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] (1690\u20131739). In 1695, Serbian Patriarch [[Arsenije III \u010carnojevi\u0107]] organized the SPC's hierarchy in Croatia \u2013 the territory of the [[Military Frontier]] was 'subjugated' to the [[Eparchy of Gornji Karlovac]], and [[Vara\u017edin Generalate]] and the rest of Croatia to the [[Eparchy of Pakrac]] (since 1705). The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. At first through the religious denomination, and by the time as a sign of national affiliation. There was also a brief occurrence when certain Catholic intellectuals, predominantly in [[Dubrovnik]], were won over by the Serbian thought. They were known as \"Serb Catholics\".<ref>Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, predgovor u : Mihovio Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 10</ref> The reason for this was that Dalmatia and the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], at the time ruled by [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]], were extremely disadvantaged so intellectuals did not want to link themselves to them, while at the same time they found newly created Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] with their idea of unification of the South Slavs, appealing.

According to the 1844 [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]]'s Na\u010dertanije, they intended to establish a Serbian Empire on the territory of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\". Geostrategic position of Belgrade in relation to Zagreb further contributed to favoring the Serbs whom Austrians did not perceive as a danger, unlike Croats who had own language, politicians, national consciousness, laws, military tradition and prepared army, as well as international [[Election in Cetin|treaties which have affirmed their rights]], so Austrians needed someone (Serbs) to discipline the Croats. The same was done by Hungary which became a strong political factor after 1848 and that wished to expand into the [[Southeast Europe]], which was particularly strong during the reign of [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] over Croatia.<ref name=\"matica.hr\"/>\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Matija Ban]], poet and dramatist, member of [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Josip Runjanin]], composer of [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]]\n| width1    = 130\n| image1    = MatijaBan.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| image2    = Josip Runjanin.png\n}}\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutionary 1848]] and the process of building a modern Croatian nation resulted in closer co-operation between Croats and Serbs and recognition of their equality in the sense of [[Illyrian Movement]] (also known as the Croatian National Revival) and [[Yugoslavia]]n ideas.

Following Croat enthusiasm with the successful 1878 [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during which many Croatian soldiers died, and them seeking unification of Dalmatia and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, the conflict between Croats and Serbs was inevitable.<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\">{{cite web|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000813/podlistak.htm|title=SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, NEDJELJA 13. kolovoza 2000. \u2013 podlistak: Preokret i odvajanje|website=arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr}}</ref> In 1879, Serbs from Bukovica voted for the Italian candidate instead of Croat [[Miho Klai\u0107]].<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\"/> This event was called by People's Party's supporters ''Bukovica betrail''.

{"title_page": "Thomas Watson (poet)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{for|the poet and cleric of the same period|Thomas Watson (bishop)}}\n{{other people|Thomas Watson}}\n'''Thomas Watson''' (1555\u20131592) was an English poet and translator, and the pioneer of the English madrigal. His lyrics aside, he wrote largely in Latin, also being the first to translate Sophocles' ''Antigone'' from the Greek. His incorporation of Italianate forms into English lyric verse influenced a generation of English writers, including Shakespeare, who was referred to in 1595 by [[William Covell]] as \"Watson's heyre\" (heir). He wrote both English and Latin compositions, and was particularly admired for the Latin. His unusual 18-line sonnets were influential, although the form was not generally imitated.\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Watson was born in mid-1555, probably in the parish of St Olave, Hart Street, London, to a prosperous Shropshire couple, William Watson and Anne Lee.<ref>Ibrahim Alhiyari, \"Thomas Watson: New Birth Year and Privileged Ancestry\", ''Notes and Queries'' 53, no. 1 (2006), pp. 35\u201340.</ref> His father\u2019s death in November 1559 was followed by his mother's four months later, and Watson and his older brother went to live with their maternal uncle in Oxfordshire. From 1567, Watson attended [[Winchester College]] in Westminster, and later attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] without gaining a degree.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' 7th e., ed. Dinah Birch (Oxford: OUP, 2009), p. 1050.</ref> Sometime after his uncle's death in April 1572, Watson went to Europe, spending seven-and-a-half years in Italy and France, according to the preface of Antigone. When he returned he studied law in London. Though he often signed his works as \"student of law\", he never practised law, as his true passion was literature.<ref>\"Watson, Thomas\", ''British Authors before 1800: A Biographical Dictionary'', 1952.</ref> However, Roger Fisher has noted that \"Watson's early legal training and associations have been downplayed by biographers in favour of his later image as a literary wit and reckless rake,\" but that he associated \"with many well-known barristers in his day and frequented the Inns of Court.\"<ref>Roger S Fisher, \"The Use(S) of Memory in Thomas Watson's Compendium Memoriae Localis \" in ''The languages, literatures and cultures conference'' (University of Kentucky, Lexington: https://kflc.as.uky.edu/2014/node/1467, 2014).</ref>\n\nWatson's ''De remedio amoris'', perhaps his earliest important composition, is lost, as is his \"piece of work written in the commendation of women-kind\", which was also in Latin verse. His earliest surviving work is a 1581 Latin version of ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' dedicated to [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel]]. It also contains an appendix of Latin allegorical poems and experiments in classical metres.\n\n==English poetry==\nThe following year Watson appears for the first time as an English poet in verses prefixed to [[George Whetstone]]'s ''Heptameron'', and in a far more important work, as the author of the ''Hekatompathia or Passionate Centurie of Love'', dedicated to [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], who had read the poems in manuscript and encouraged Watson to publish them. Also entitled ''Watson's Passion'' the work, published in 1584, contains over 100 poems in French and Italian sonnet styles, including a number of translations. The technical peculiarity of these interesting poems is that, although they appear and profess to be [[sonnet]]s, they are written in triple sets of common six-line stanza, and therefore have eighteen lines each.\n\nWatson was recognised for his poetic \"Methods and motifs\", which occurred between 1580 and 1590. He was held in high regard by his contemporaries, even though his style was very similar to those of his late 15th and early 16th-century Italian predecessors [[Sannazaro]] and Strozzi. He openly drew from [[Petrarch]] and [[Ronsard]], with what [[Sidney Lee]] describes as \"drops of water from Petrarch and Ronsard's fountains,\" and [[Serafino dell'Aquila]] has been identified as the source for twelve later sonnets.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Watson,_Thomas_(1557%3F-1592)_(DNB00) ''Dictionary of National Biography'' 1900]</ref> Watson seriously desired to recommend his 18-line form to future sonneteers, but it attracted no imitators in that respect, although ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' notes that Watson's sonnets \"appear to have been studied by Shakespeare and other contemporaries.\"<ref>W. Ron Hess, ''The Dark Side of Shakespeare'', Writers Club Press 2002, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A_WQgG9AkE4C&lpg=PA88&ots=RI61CIks7L&dq=Watson's%20sonnets%20%22appear%20to%20have%20been%20studied%20by%20Shakespeare%20and%20other%20contemporaries.&pg=PA88#v=onepage&q=Watson's%20sonnets%20%22appear%20to%20have%20been%20studied%20by%20Shakespeare%20and%20other%20contemporaries.&f=false p.88]</ref>\n\nThe little we have of Watson's prose is highly [[euphuism|euphuistic]]. He was a friend of [[John Lyly]] at Oxford, and both continued their literary connection in London under the patronage of [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], himself an Oxford alumnus.<ref>John Dover Wilson, ''John Lyly'', Macmillan and Bowes, Cambridge, 1905.</ref>\n\n==Latin poetry==\nAs his reputation grew, Watson's name he became associated with such literary powers as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[George Peele]], [[Matthew Roydon]] and [[Thomas Achelley]]. He also gained a following of younger writers like [[Richard Barnfield|Barnfield]] and [[Thomas Nashe]], who regarded him as the best Latin poet in England. In 1585 he published his first Latin epic ''Amyntas'', eleven days of a shepherd's mourning for the death of his lover, Phyllis.<ref>Franklin M. Dickey and Walter F. Staton, eds., ''Amyntas & The Lamentations of Amyntas'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967.</ref> Watson's epic was afterwards translated into English by [[Abraham Fraunce]], without the permission of the author (1587) and uncredited.<ref>\"Watson, Thomas\". ''The Cambridge Guide to English Literature'', 1983.</ref> Fraunce's translation was highly criticised. \"His sins of translation result generally from an excess of zeal rather than a failure to understand his author's intention.\" Although a relationship to [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''Aminta'' is often supposed, in fact there is none. In the fourth reprint of his English version in 1591 Fraunce also printed his own translation of the Tasso work, and it is this that has given rise to the confusion. To forestall any further sub-standard English translations, Watson published his 1590 poem ''Melib\u0153us'', an elegy on the death of Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], in both Latin and English.\n\n==Plays==\nWatson was also a playwright, although none of his plays are extant. According to his employer, William Cornwallis, devising \"twenty fictions and knaveryes in a play\" was his \"daily practyse and his living\" (Hall, p. 256), and Francis Meres in 1598 lists him as among \"our best for Tragedie\".<ref>Hubert Hall, \"An Elizabethan Poet and His Relations.\" The Athenaeum 3278 (1890).</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the anonymous ''[[Arden of Faversham]]'' is largely the work of Watson, with contributions by Shakespeare.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/05/shakespeares-secret-co-writer-finally-takes-a-bow-430-years-late |date=5 April 2020 |title=Shakespeare's secret co-writer finally takes a bow... 430 years late |author=Dalya Alberge}}</ref>\n\n==Late and posthumous publications==\nRelated to music, he wrote a laudatory poem about John Case's book ''The Praise of Music'' (1586). \n\nIn 1589 Christopher Marlowe had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours and Watson in [[Norton Folgate]]; Marlowe was held in [[Newgate Prison]] for a fortnight.<ref>Frederick S. Boas, ''Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953, pp. 101 ff.</ref>] \n\nIn 1590 Watson authored ''The First Set of Italian Madrigals''. This was published by [[Thomas Este]] and mainly consisted of compositions by the influential [[madrigal]] composer [[Luca Marenzio]], whose work had become popular in England through ''[[Musica Transalpina]]'' of 1588 (also published by Thomas Este). Following the example of the earlier publication, Watson provided the madrigals with English lyrics. He was less literal in his approach to the Italian originals than ''Musica Transalpina'', writing as he put it, \"not to the sense of the originall dittie, but after the affection of the Noate\".<ref>[http://purl.org/rism/BI/1590/29 Thomas Watson: The first set of Italian madrigals Englished]. Retrieved December 2013</ref> Like the earlier collection, ''The First Set of Italian Madrigals'' contains music by [[William Byrd]], in this case two settings of an original English text, \"This sweet and merry month of May\", presumably by Watson.<ref>[[Jessie Ann Owens|Owens, Jessie Ann]]. [https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-756271331 Italian Madrigals Englished (1590)]. Notes. [[Music Library Association]], Inc. 2004. Accessed via [[Questia Online Library]] (subscription required) 18 December 2013.</ref>\n\nOf the remainder of Watson's career, nothing is known save that on 26 September 1592 he was buried in the church of [[St Bartholomew the Less]] and that a month later his second Latin epic \"Amintae Gaudia\" was seen through the press by his friend, \"CM,\" possibly Marlowe. This tells the story of Amyntas' love and eventual winning of Phyllis, and is therefore chronologically the first part of the earlier epic. In the following year, his last book, ''The Tears of Fancie, or Love Disdained'' (1593), was posthumously published under the initials T. W. This is a collection of 60 sonnets, regular in form, so far at least as to have 14 lines each. As in \"Hekatompathia\", Watson uses the first person throughout ''The Tears of Fancie''. The circumstances of its publication were extraordinary. Watson had ended up in prison for killing a man, apparently in defense of Marlowe in 1589, and so after Watson's death in September 1592, Marlowe repaid his debt by arranging for the publication of the sonnet sequence, shortly before his own death in May 1593.\u00a0[[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] is supposed to have alluded to Watson's untimely death in ''Colin Clouts Come Home Again'', when he says: \"Amyntas quite is gone and lies full low, Having his Amaryllis left to moan\".\n\n==Reputation==\nWatson is mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] along with Shakespeare, Peele and Marlowe among \"the best for tragedie\", but no dramatic work of his except the translations already mentioned is extant today. Watson certainly enjoyed a great reputation in his lifetime, and he was not without direct influence on the youth of Shakespeare. He was the first, after an original experiment by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Wyatt]] and [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|Surrey]], to introduce pure imitation of Petrarch into English poetry. As Meres puts it, \"He shows his inventiveness by his variety of treatment.... It is the number of different ways in which he can introduce these devices in this matter that measures his success as a poet.\" He was well read in Italian, French and Greek literature.\n\n==In modern literature==\nWatson plays a prominent part in the novel ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]], in which he is a close friend of Marlowe. In the book, Watson introduces Marlowe to [[Sir Francis Walsingham]] and contributes to several of Marlowe's plays. He is a key character in ''The Marlowe Papers'' by [[Ros Barber]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Watson, Thomas |volume=28}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=G25SAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Ekatompathia, Or Passionate Centurie of Love''] at Google Books\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Watson, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1550s births]]\n[[Category:1592 deaths]]\n[[Category:People of the Tudor period]]\n[[Category:16th-century English poets]]\n[[Category:University Wits]]\n[[Category:English male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:English male poets]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{for|the poet and cleric of the same period|Thomas Watson (bishop)}}\n{{other people|Thomas Watson}}\n'''Thomas Watson''' (1555\u20131592) was an English poet and translator, and the pioneer of the English madrigal.

His unusual 18-line sonnets were influential, although the form was not generally imitated.\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Watson was born in mid-1555, probably in the parish of St Olave, Hart Street, London, to a prosperous Shropshire couple, William Watson and Anne Lee.<ref>Ibrahim Alhiyari, \"Thomas Watson: New Birth Year and Privileged Ancestry\", ''Notes and Queries'' 53, no. 1 (2006), pp. 35\u201340.</ref> His father\u2019s death in November 1559 was followed by his mother's four months later, and Watson and his older brother went to live with their maternal uncle in Oxfordshire. From 1567, Watson attended [[Winchester College]] in Westminster, and later attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] without gaining a degree.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' 7th e., ed. Dinah Birch (Oxford: OUP, 2009), p. 1050.</ref> Sometime after his uncle's death in April 1572, Watson went to Europe, spending seven-and-a-half years in Italy and France, according to the preface of Antigone. When he returned he studied law in London. Though he often signed his works as \"student of law\", he never practised law, as his true passion was literature.<ref>\"Watson, Thomas\", ''British Authors before 1800: A Biographical Dictionary'', 1952.</ref> However, Roger Fisher has noted that \"Watson's early legal training and associations have been downplayed by biographers in favour of his later image as a literary wit and reckless rake,\" but that he associated \"with many well-known barristers in his day and frequented the Inns of Court.\"<ref>Roger S Fisher, \"The Use(S) of Memory in Thomas Watson's Compendium Memoriae Localis \" in ''The languages, literatures and cultures conference'' (University of Kentucky, Lexington: https://kflc.as.uky.edu/2014/node/1467, 2014).</ref>\n\nWatson's ''De remedio amoris'', perhaps his earliest important composition, is lost, as is his \"piece of work written in the commendation of women-kind\", which was also in Latin verse. His earliest surviving work is a 1581 Latin version of ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' dedicated to [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel]]. It also contains an appendix of Latin allegorical poems and experiments in classical metres.\n\n==English poetry==\nThe following year Watson appears for the first time as an English poet in verses prefixed to [[George Whetstone]]'s ''Heptameron'', and in a far more important work, as the author of the ''Hekatompathia or Passionate Centurie of Love'', dedicated to [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], who had read the poems in manuscript and encouraged Watson to publish them. Also entitled ''Watson's Passion'' the work, published in 1584, contains over 100 poems in French and Italian sonnet styles, including a number of translations. The technical peculiarity of these interesting poems is that, although they appear and profess to be [[sonnet]]s, they are written in triple sets of common six-line stanza, and therefore have eighteen lines each.\n\nWatson was recognised for his poetic \"Methods and motifs\", which occurred between 1580 and 1590. He was held in high regard by his contemporaries, even though his style was very similar to those of his late 15th and early 16th-century Italian predecessors [[Sannazaro]] and Strozzi. He openly drew from [[Petrarch]] and [[Ronsard]], with what [[Sidney Lee]] describes as \"drops of water from Petrarch and Ronsard's fountains,\" and [[Serafino dell'Aquila]] has been identified as the source for twelve later sonnets.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Watson,_Thomas_(1557%3F-1592)_(DNB00) ''Dictionary of National Biography'' 1900]</ref> Watson seriously desired to recommend his 18-line form to future sonneteers, but it attracted no imitators in that respect, although ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' notes that Watson's sonnets \"appear to have been studied by Shakespeare and other contemporaries.\"<ref>W. Ron Hess, ''The Dark Side of Shakespeare'', Writers Club Press 2002, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A_WQgG9AkE4C&lpg=PA88&ots=RI61CIks7L&dq=Watson's%20sonnets%20%22appear%20to%20have%20been%20studied%20by%20Shakespeare%20and%20other%20contemporaries.&pg=PA88#v=onepage&q=Watson's%20sonnets%20%22appear%20to%20have%20been%20studied%20by%20Shakespeare%20and%20other%20contemporaries.&f=false p.88]</ref>\n\nThe little we have of Watson's prose is highly [[euphuism|euphuistic]]. He was a friend of [[John Lyly]] at Oxford, and both continued their literary connection in London under the patronage of [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], himself an Oxford alumnus.<ref>John Dover Wilson, ''John Lyly'', Macmillan and Bowes, Cambridge, 1905.</ref>\n\n==Latin poetry==\nAs his reputation grew, Watson's name he became associated with such literary powers as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[George Peele]], [[Matthew Roydon]] and [[Thomas Achelley]]. He also gained a following of younger writers like [[Richard Barnfield|Barnfield]] and [[Thomas Nashe]], who regarded him as the best Latin poet in England. In 1585 he published his first Latin epic ''Amyntas'', eleven days of a shepherd's mourning for the death of his lover, Phyllis.<ref>Franklin M. Dickey and Walter F. Staton, eds., ''Amyntas & The Lamentations of Amyntas'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967.</ref> Watson's epic was afterwards translated into English by [[Abraham Fraunce]], without the permission of the author (1587) and uncredited.<ref>\"Watson, Thomas\". ''The Cambridge Guide to English Literature'', 1983.</ref> Fraunce's translation was highly criticised. \"His sins of translation result generally from an excess of zeal rather than a failure to understand his author's intention.\" Although a relationship to [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''Aminta'' is often supposed, in fact there is none. In the fourth reprint of his English version in 1591 Fraunce also printed his own translation of the Tasso work, and it is this that has given rise to the confusion. To forestall any further sub-standard English translations, Watson published his 1590 poem ''Melib\u0153us'', an elegy on the death of Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], in both Latin and English.\n\n==Plays==\nWatson was also a playwright, although none of his plays are extant. According to his employer, William Cornwallis, devising \"twenty fictions and knaveryes in a play\" was his \"daily practyse and his living\" (Hall, p. 256), and Francis Meres in 1598 lists him as among \"our best for Tragedie\".<ref>Hubert Hall, \"An Elizabethan Poet and His Relations.\" The Athenaeum 3278 (1890).</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the anonymous ''[[Arden of Faversham]]'' is largely the work of Watson, with contributions by Shakespeare.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/05/shakespeares-secret-co-writer-finally-takes-a-bow-430-years-late |date=5 April 2020 |title=Shakespeare's secret co-writer finally takes a bow... 430 years late |author=Dalya Alberge}}</ref>\n\n==Late and posthumous publications==\nRelated to music, he wrote a laudatory poem about John Case's book ''The Praise of Music'' (1586). \n\nIn 1589 Christopher Marlowe had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours and Watson in [[Norton Folgate]]; Marlowe was held in [[Newgate Prison]] for a fortnight.<ref>Frederick S. Boas, ''Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953, pp. 101 ff.</ref>] \n\nIn 1590 Watson authored ''The First Set of Italian Madrigals''. This was published by [[Thomas Este]] and mainly consisted of compositions by the influential [[madrigal]] composer [[Luca Marenzio]], whose work had become popular in England through ''[[Musica Transalpina]]'' of 1588 (also published by Thomas Este). Following the example of the earlier publication, Watson provided the madrigals with English lyrics. He was less literal in his approach to the Italian originals than ''Musica Transalpina'', writing as he put it, \"not to the sense of the originall dittie, but after the affection of the Noate\".<ref>[http://purl.org/rism/BI/1590/29 Thomas Watson: The first set of Italian madrigals Englished]. Retrieved December 2013</ref> Like the earlier collection, ''The First Set of Italian Madrigals'' contains music by [[William Byrd]], in this case two settings of an original English text, \"This sweet and merry month of May\", presumably by Watson.<ref>[[Jessie Ann Owens|Owens, Jessie Ann]]. [https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-756271331 Italian Madrigals Englished (1590)]. Notes. [[Music Library Association]], Inc. 2004. Accessed via [[Questia Online Library]] (subscription required) 18 December 2013.</ref>\n\nOf the remainder of Watson's career, nothing is known save that on 26 September 1592 he was buried in the church of [[St Bartholomew the Less]] and that a month later his second Latin epic \"Amintae Gaudia\" was seen through the press by his friend, \"CM,\" possibly Marlowe. This tells the story of Amyntas' love and eventual winning of Phyllis, and is therefore chronologically the first part of the earlier epic. In the following year, his last book, ''The Tears of Fancie, or Love Disdained'' (1593), was posthumously published under the initials T. W. This is a collection of 60 sonnets, regular in form, so far at least as to have 14 lines each. As in \"Hekatompathia\", Watson uses the first person throughout ''The Tears of Fancie''. The circumstances of its publication were extraordinary. Watson had ended up in prison for killing a man, apparently in defense of Marlowe in 1589, and so after Watson's death in September 1592, Marlowe repaid his debt by arranging for the publication of the sonnet sequence, shortly before his own death in May 1593.\u00a0[[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] is supposed to have alluded to Watson's untimely death in ''Colin Clouts Come Home Again'', when he says: \"Amyntas quite is gone and lies full low, Having his Amaryllis left to moan\".\n\n==Reputation==\nWatson is mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] along with Shakespeare, Peele and Marlowe among \"the best for tragedie\", but no dramatic work of his except the translations already mentioned is extant today. Watson certainly enjoyed a great reputation in his lifetime, and he was not without direct influence on the youth of Shakespeare. He was the first, after an original experiment by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Wyatt]] and [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|Surrey]], to introduce pure imitation of Petrarch into English poetry. As Meres puts it, \"He shows his inventiveness by his variety of treatment.... It is the number of different ways in which he can introduce these devices in this matter that measures his success as a poet.\" He was well read in Italian, French and Greek literature.\n\n==In modern literature==\nWatson plays a prominent part in the novel ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]], in which he is a close friend of Marlowe. In the book, Watson introduces Marlowe to [[Sir Francis Walsingham]] and contributes to several of Marlowe's plays. He is a key character in ''The Marlowe Papers'' by [[Ros Barber]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Watson, Thomas |volume=28}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=G25SAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Ekatompathia, Or Passionate Centurie of Love''] at Google Books\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Watson, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1550s births]]\n[[Category:1592 deaths]]\n[[Category:People of the Tudor period]]\n[[Category:16th-century English poets]]\n[[Category:University Wits]]\n[[Category:English male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:English male poets]]\n", "name_user": "Bmcln1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Watson_(poet)"}

In control complexity, it can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms.\n\nIn the simplest type of an automatic [[control loop]], a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value, and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of [[control theory]] was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th.\n\nAutomation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]], [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]], electrical, electronic devices and [[computer]]s, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, [[airplane]]s and [[ship]]s typically use all these combined techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, savings in [[Electricity|electricity costs]], savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s [[World Development Report]] 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nJob losses and downward mobility blamed on Automation has been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of [[New nationalism (21st century)|nationalist]] and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/348219/how-robots-caused-brexit-and-the-rise-of-donald-trump|title=How Robots Caused Brexit and the Rise of Donald Trump|last=Dashevsky|first=Evan|date=8 November 2017|website=PC Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108041038/https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/348219/how-robots-caused-brexit-and-the-rise-of-donald-trump|archive-date=8 November 2017|access-date=11 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/robots-trump-automation-swing-us-election/reputation-matters/article/1440399|title=Robots for Trump: Did automation swing the US election?|last=Torrance|first=Jack|date=25 July 2017|work=Management Today|access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/29/trump-brexit-society-complex-people-populists|title=The lesson of Trump and Brexit: a society too complex for its people risks everything {{!}} John Harris|last=Harris|first=John|date=29 December 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=11 January 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/|title=Will robots and AI take your job?

A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. (The control action is the switching the boiler off and on. The process output is the building temperature).\n\nIn closed-loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on the process output. In the case of the boiler analogy, this would include a temperature sensor to monitor the building temperature, and thereby feed a signal back to the controller to ensure it maintains the building at the temperature set on the thermostat. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to give a process output equal to the \"Reference input\" or \"set point\". For this reason, closed-loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.<ref>\"Feedback and control systems\" \u2013 JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams.

An increase in speed would make the counterweights move outward, sliding a linkage that tended to close the valve supplying steam, and so slowing the engine. ]]\n\n==Control actions==\n{{Main|Control system}}\n\n=== Discrete control (on/off) ===\nOne of the simplest types of control is ''on-off'' control. An example is a thermostat used on household appliances which either opens or closes an electrical contact. (Thermostats were originally developed as true feedback-control mechanisms rather than the on-off common household appliance thermostat.)\n\nSequence control, in which a programmed sequence of ''discrete'' operations is performed, often based on system logic that involves system states. An elevator control system is an example of sequence control.\n\n===PID controller===\n[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or \"set point\", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]\n{{main |PID Controller}}\nA '''proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative controller''' ('''PID controller''') is a [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] ([[controller (control theory)|controller]]) widely used in [[industrial control system]]s.\n\nIn a [[PID loop]], the controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' <math>e(t)</math> as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms, respectively (sometimes denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'') which give their name to the controller type.\n\nThe theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analog control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.\n\n===Sequential control and logical sequence or system state control===\n{{main| Programmable logic controller}}\nSequential control may be either to a fixed sequence or to a logical one that will perform different actions depending on various system states. An example of an adjustable but otherwise fixed sequence is a timer on a lawn sprinkler.\n\nStates refer to the various conditions that can occur in a use or sequence scenario of the system. An example is an elevator, which uses logic based on the system state to perform certain actions in response to its state and operator input. For example, if the operator presses the floor n button, the system will respond depending on whether the elevator is stopped or moving, going up or down, or if the door is open or closed, and other conditions.<ref>The elevator example is commonly used in programming texts, such as [[Unified modeling language]]</ref>\n\nEarly development of sequential control was [[relay logic]], by which [[Electrical relay|electrical relays]] engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt power to a device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing [[Solenoid valve|solenoid valves]]. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence [[Cam timer|cam timers]]. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.\n\nThe total number of relays and cam timers can number into the hundreds or even thousands in some factories. Early [[computer programming|programming]] techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, one of the first being [[ladder logic]], where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder. Special computers called [[programmable logic controllers]] were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit. \n  \nIn a typical hard wired motor start and stop circuit (called a ''control circuit'') a motor is started by pushing a \"Start\" or \"Run\" button that activates a pair of electrical relays. The \"lock-in\" relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push-button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three-phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The \"lock-in\" contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a \"stop\" or \"off\" button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exman.com/mshoass.html|title=MOTOR STARTERS START STOPS HAND OFF AUTO|website=Exman.com|access-date=14 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413062641/http://www.exman.com/mshoass.html|archive-date=13 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[Image:Finite state machine example with comments.svg|thumb|This state diagram shows how [[Unified modeling language|UML]] can be used for designing a door system that can only be opened and closed|alt=]]\nCommonly [[interlock (engineering)|interlock]]s are added to a control circuit. Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication. In this case, an interlock could be added to ensure that the oil pump is running before the motor starts. Timers, limit switches, and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits.\n\n[[Solenoid valve]]s are widely used on compressed air or hydraulic fluid for powering [[actuator]]s on mechanical components. While motors are used to supply continuous rotary motion, actuators are typically a better choice for intermittently creating a limited range of movement for a mechanical component, such as moving various mechanical arms, opening or closing valves, raising heavy press rolls, applying pressure to presses.\n\n===Computer control===\nComputers can perform both sequential control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both in an industrial application. [[Programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in [[relay logic]] type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand-alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments, and controllers in order to implement typical (such as [[PID controller|PID]]) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control [[algorithm]]s using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real-time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers, and management.\n\nControl of an [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) is an example of an interactive process in which a computer will perform a logic derived response to a user selection based on information retrieved from a networked database. The ATM process has similarities with other online transaction processes. The different logical responses are called ''scenarios''. Such processes are typically designed with the aid of [[use case]]s and [[flowchart]]s, which guide the writing of the software code. The earliest feedback control mechanism was the water clock invented by Greek engineer Ctesibius (285\u2013222 BC)\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[Image:Clepsydra-Diagram-Fancy.jpeg|thumb|180px|Ctesibius's clepsydra (3rd century BC).]]\nIt was a preoccupation of the Greeks and Arabs (in the period between about 300 BC and about 1200 AD) to keep accurate track of time.

Another control mechanism was used to tent the sails of windmills. It was patented by Edmund Lee in 1745.<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\"/> Also in 1745, [[Jacques de Vaucanson]] invented the first automated loom. The design of feedback control systems up through the Industrial Revolution was by trial-and-error, together with a great deal of engineering intuition. Thus, it was more of an art than a science. In the mid-19th century mathematics was first used to analyze the stability of feedback control systems. Since mathematics is the formal language of automatic control theory, we could call the period before this time the prehistory of control theory.\n\nIn 1771 [[Richard Arkwright]] invented the first fully automated spinning mill driven by water power, known at the time as the [[water frame]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Tessie P.|last=Liu|title=The Weaver's Knot: The Contradictions of Class Struggle and Family Solidarity in Western France, 1750\u20131914|url=https://archive.org/details/weaversknotcontr00liut|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8019-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/weaversknotcontr00liut/page/91 91]}}</ref> An automatic flour mill was developed by [[Oliver Evans]] in 1785, making it the first completely automated industrial process.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Howard B.|title=Automation and Society|url=https://archive.org/details/automationsociet00jaco|year=1959|publisher=Philosophical Library|location=New York, NY|page=[https://archive.org/details/automationsociet00jaco/page/8 8]|author2=Joseph S.

The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\"/>\n\nSeveral improvements to the governor, plus improvements to valve cut-off timing on the steam engine, made the engine suitable for most industrial uses before the end of the 19th century. Advances in the steam engine stayed well ahead of science, both thermodynamics and [[control theory]].<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\"/>\n\nThe governor received relatively little scientific attention until [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published a paper that established the beginning of a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long distance telephony, required a higher signal to noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the [[Second World War]] to [[fire control system]]s and aircraft [[navigation system]]s.<ref name=\"Bennett 1993\">{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Relay logic]] was introduced with factory [[electrification]], which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 through the 1920s. Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and operation of new high-pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls. Central control rooms became common in the 1920s, but as late as the early 1930s, most process control was on-off. Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments. To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off. Control rooms also used color-coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=31}}</ref>\n\nControllers, which were able to make calculated changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than on-off control, began being introduced the 1930s.

Some of the larger processes include electrical power generation, oil refining, chemicals, steel mills, plastics, cement plants, fertilizer plants, pulp and paper mills, automobile and truck assembly, aircraft production, glass manufacturing, natural gas separation plants, food and beverage processing, canning and bottling and manufacture of various kinds of parts. Robots are especially useful in hazardous applications like automobile spray painting. Robots are also used to assemble electronic circuit boards. Automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines.\n\n===Space/computer age===\n\nWith the advent of the space age in 1957, controls design, particularly in the United States, turned away from the frequency-domain techniques of classical control theory and backed into the differential equation techniques of the late 19th century, which were couched in the time domain. During the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which became widely used in [[bang-bang control|hysteresis control systems]] such as [[navigation system]]s, [[fire-control system]]s, and [[electronics]]. Through Flugge-Lotz and others, the modern era saw time-domain design for [[nonlinear systems]] (1961), [[navigation]] (1960), [[optimal control]] and [[estimation theory]] (1962), [[nonlinear control theory]] (1969), [[digital control]] and [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtering theory]] (1974), and the [[personal computer]] (1983).\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\nPerhaps the most cited advantage of automation in industry is that it is associated with faster production and cheaper labor costs. Another benefit could be that it replaces hard, physical, or monotonous work.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Industrial Automation: Hands on|last = Lamb|first = Frank|year = 2013|pages = 1\u20134}}</ref> Additionally, tasks that take place in hazardous environments or that are otherwise beyond human capabilities can be done by machines, as machines can operate even under extreme temperatures or in atmospheres that are radioactive or toxic. They can also be maintained with simple quality checks. However, at the time being, not all tasks can be automated, and some tasks are more expensive to automate than others. Initial costs of installing the machinery in factory settings are high, and failure to maintain a system could result in the loss of the product itself. Moreover, some studies seem to indicate that industrial automation could impose ill effects beyond operational concerns, including worker displacement due to systemic loss of employment and compounded environmental damage; however, these findings are both convoluted and controversial in nature, and could potentially be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite_news|title=The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS|last=Arnzt|first=Melanie|date=14 May 2016|id = {{ProQuest|1790436902}}}}</ref>\n\nThe main advantages of automation are:\n*Increased throughput or productivity.\n*Improved quality or increased predictability of quality.\n*Improved robustness (consistency), of processes or product.\n*Increased consistency of output.\n*Reduced direct human labor costs and expenses.\n*Installation in operations reduces cycle time. \n*Can complete tasks where a high degree of accuracy is required.\n*Replaces human operators in tasks that involve hard physical or monotonous work (e.g., using one forklift with a single driver instead of a team of multiple workers to lift a heavy object)<ref>[http://www.bma-automation.com/Prozessautomatisierung.2102.0.html?id=2102&L=1 Process automation, retrieved on 20.02.2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517174600/http://www.bma-automation.com/Prozessautomatisierung.2102.0.html?id=2102&L=1 |date=17 May 2013 }}</ref>\n*Reduces some occupational injuries (e.g., fewer strained backs from lifting heavy objects)\n*Replaces humans in tasks done in dangerous environments (i.e. fire, space, volcanoes, nuclear facilities, underwater, etc.)\n*Performs tasks that are beyond human capabilities of size, weight, speed, endurance, etc.\n*Reduces operation time and work handling time significantly.\n*Frees up workers to take on other roles.\n*Provides higher level jobs in the development, deployment, maintenance and running of the automated processes.\n\nThe main disadvantages of automation are:\n\n*Possible security threats/vulnerability due to increased relative susceptibility for committing errors.\n*Unpredictable or excessive development costs.\n*High initial cost.\n*Displaces workers due to job replacement.\n\n==Societal impact==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2018}}\n\nIncreased automation often cause workers to feel anxious about losing their jobs as technology renders their skills or experience unnecessary.

For example, while a study by the [[Pew Research Center]] indicated that 72% of Americans are worried about increasing automation in the workplace, 80% of Swedes see automation and [[artificial intelligence]] as a good thing, due to the country's still-powerful unions and a more robust national safety net.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html|title=The Robots are Coming, and Sweden is Fine|last=Goodman|first=Peter S.|work=The New York Times|date=27 December 2017|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, 47% of all current jobs have the potential to be fully automated by 2033, according to the research of experts [[Carl Frey|Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne.

However, the factory never reached full \"lights out\" status.<ref name=\"RCR Wireless News\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rcrwireless.com/20160810/internet-of-things/lights-out-manufacturing-tag31-tag99|title=Lights out manufacturing and its impact on society|date=10 August 2016|work=RCR Wireless News}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of lights out manufacturing requires:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cnc-machine-tools.com/checklist-for-lights-out-manufacturing/|title=Checklist for Lights-Out Manufacturing|date=4 September 2017|work=CNC machine tools}}</ref>\n* Reliability of equipment\n* Long-term mechanic capabilities\n* Planned preventive maintenance\n* Commitment from the staff\n\n==Health and environment==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe costs of automation to the environment are different depending on the technology, product or engine automated. There are automated engines that consume more energy resources from the Earth in comparison with previous engines and vice versa.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Hazardous operations, such as [[oil refining]], the manufacturing of [[Chemical industry|industrial chemicals]], and all forms of [[metal working]], were always early contenders for automation.{{dubious|date=October 2013}}{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe automation of vehicles could prove to have a substantial impact on the environment, although the nature of this impact could be beneficial or harmful depending on several factors. Because [[automated vehicle]]s are much less likely to get into accidents compared to human-driven vehicles, some precautions built into current models (such as [[anti-lock brake]]s or [[laminated glass]]) would not be required for self-driving versions. Removing these safety features would also significantly reduce the weight of the vehicle, thus increasing [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and reducing emissions per mile. Self-driving vehicles are also more precise with regard to acceleration and breaking, and this could contribute to reduced emissions. Self-driving cars could also potentially utilize fuel-efficient features such as route mapping that is able to calculate and take the most efficient routes. Despite this potential to reduce emissions, some researchers theorize that an increase of production of self-driving cars could lead to a boom of vehicle ownership and use. This boom could potentially negate any environmental benefits of self-driving cars if a large enough number of people begin driving personal vehicles more frequently.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4476614/self-driving-cars-environment/ |title=Self-Driving Cars Could Help Save the Environment\u2014Or Ruin It. It Depends on Us|website=Time.com}}</ref>\n\nAutomation of homes and home appliances is also thought to impact the environment, but the benefits of these features are also questioned. A study of energy consumption of automated homes in Finland showed that [[smart home]]s could reduce energy consumption by monitoring levels of consumption in different areas of the home and adjusting consumption to reduce energy leaks (such as automatically reducing consumption during the nighttime when activity is low). This study, along with others, indicated that the smart home's ability to monitor and adjust consumption levels would reduce unnecessary energy usage. However, new research suggests that smart homes might not be as efficient as non-automated homes. A more recent study has indicated that, while monitoring and adjusting consumption levels does decrease unnecessary energy use, this process requires monitoring systems that also consume a significant amount of energy. This study suggested that the energy required to run these systems is so much so that it negates any benefits of the systems themselves, resulting in little to no ecological benefit.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Environmental Impacts and Benefits of Smart Home Automation: Life Cycle Assessment of Home Energy Management System|journal=IFAC-Papers on Line|volume=48|page=880|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.05.158|year=2015|last1=Louis|first1=Jean-Nicolas|last2=Calo|first2=Antonio|last3=Leivisk\u00e4|first3=Kauko|last4=Pongr\u00e1cz|first4=Eva|url=http://jultika.oulu.fi/files/nbnfi-fe201703082017.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Convertibility and [[turnaround time]]==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nAnother major shift in automation is the increased demand for flexibility and convertibility in manufacturing processes. Manufacturers are increasingly demanding the ability to easily switch from manufacturing Product A to manufacturing Product B without having to completely rebuild the [[production line]]s. Flexibility and distributed processes have led to the introduction of [[Automated Guided Vehicle]]s with Natural Features Navigation.\n\nDigital electronics helped too. Former analog-based instrumentation was replaced by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization, and operation. This was accompanied by the [[fieldbus]] revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a single cable) means of communicating between control systems and field level instrumentation, eliminating hard-wiring.\n\n[[Discrete manufacturing]] plants adopted these technologies fast. The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analog-based measurement and control still dominates. The growing use of [[Industrial Ethernet]] on the factory floor is pushing these trends still further, enabling manufacturing plants to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for [[Reconfigurable Manufacturing System]]s.\n\n==Automation tools==\nEngineers can now have [[numerical control]] over automated devices. The result has been a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities. [[Computer-aided technologies]] (or CAx) now serve as the basis for mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems. Notable examples of CAx include [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD software) and [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Engineers' CAx education\u2014it's not only CAD |journal=Computer-Aided Design |volume=36 |issue=14 |page=1439 |doi=10.1016/j.cad.2004.02.011|year=2004 |last1=Werner Dankwort |first1=C |last2=Weidlich |first2=Roland |last3=Guenther |first3=Birgit |last4=Blaurock |first4=Joerg E }}</ref>\n\n[[Information technology]], together with [[industry|industrial]] [[machinery]] and [[industrial process|process]]es, can assist in the design, implementation, and monitoring of control systems.

Therefore, some personnel are needed to ensure that the entire system functions properly and that safety and product quality are maintained.\n* As a process becomes increasingly automated, there is less and less labor to be saved or quality improvement to be gained. This is an example of both [[diminishing returns]] and the [[logistic function]].\n* As more and more processes become automated, there are fewer remaining non-automated processes. This is an example of the exhaustion of opportunities. New technological paradigms may, however, set new limits that surpass the previous limits.\n\n===Current limitations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}Many roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation. Human-level [[pattern recognition]], [[language comprehension]], and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems (but see [[Watson (computer)]]). Tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data, such as scents and sounds, as well as high-level tasks such as strategic planning, currently require human expertise. In many cases, the use of humans is more cost-effective than mechanical approaches even where the automation of industrial tasks is possible. Overcoming these obstacles is a theorized path to [[post-scarcity]] economics.\n\n==== Paradox of automation ====\nThe [[paradox]] of automation says that the more efficient the automated system, the more crucial the human contribution of the operators. Humans are less involved, but their involvement becomes more critical. [[Lisanne Bainbridge]], a cognitive psychologist, identified these issues notably in her widely cited paper \"Ironies of Automation.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bainbridge|first=Lisanne|date=November 1983|title=Ironies of automation|journal=Automatica|volume=19|issue=6|pages=775\u2013779|doi=10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8}}</ref>\n\nIf an automated system has an error, it will multiply that error until it is fixed or shut down.

Currently, there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully automated [[Space Tracking and Surveillance System|tracking surveillance]] system. Automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensor, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.<ref>Javed, O, & Shah, M.

Seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways, the [[United States Congress]] authorized more than $650 million over six years for [[intelligent transport system]]s (ITS) and demonstration projects in the 1991 [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA). Congress legislated in ISTEA that \"the [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] shall develop an automated highway and vehicle prototype from which future fully automated intelligent vehicle-highway systems can be developed. Such development shall include research in human factors to ensure the success of the man-machine relationship. The goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or an automated test track in operation by 1997. This system shall accommodate installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehicles.\" [ISTEA 1991, part B, Section 6054(b)].\n\nFull automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.<ref>Menzies, Thomas.

Originating from Germany, Industry 4.0 encompasses numerous devices, concepts, and machines.<ref name=\"doi.org\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.11113/jt.v78.9285|title = Industry 4.0: A Review on Industrial Automation and Robotic| journal=Jurnal Teknologi| volume=78| issue=6\u201313|year = 2016|last1 = Kamarul Bahrin|first1 = Mohd Aiman| last2=Othman| first2=Mohd Fauzi| last3=Nor Azli| first3=Nor Hayati| last4=Talib| first4=Muhamad Farihin}}</ref> It, along with the advancement of the [[Industrial Internet of Things]] (formally known as the IoT or IIoT) which is \"Internet of Things is a seamless integration of diverse physical objects in the Internet through a virtual representation\".<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.1109/IMIS.2012.134|chapter = Integrating Building Automation Systems and IPv6 in the Internet of Things|title = 2012 Sixth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing| pages=683\u2013688|year = 2012|last1 = Jung|first1 = Markus| last2=Reinisch| first2=Christian| last3=Kastner| first3=Wolfgang| isbn=978-1-4673-1328-5}}</ref> These new revolutionary advancements have drawn attention to the world of automation in an entirely new light and shown ways for it to grow to increase productivity and efficiency in machinery and manufacturing facilities. Industry 4.0 works with the IIoT and software/hardware to connect in a way that (through communication technologies) add enhancements and improve manufacturing processes. Being able to create smarter, safer, and more advanced manufacturing is now possible with these new technologies. It opens up a manufacturing platform that is more reliable, consistent, and efficient than before. Implementation of systems such as [[SCADA]] is an example of software that takes place in Industrial Automation today. SCADA is a supervisory data collection software, just one of the many used in Industrial Automation.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.18845/tm.v28i4.2438|title = Los sistemas SCADA en la automatizaci\u00f3n industrial| journal=Revista Tecnolog\u00eda en Marcha| volume=28| issue=4| page=3|year = 2015|last1 = P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez|first1 = Esteban}}</ref> Industry 4.0 vastly covers many areas in manufacturing and will continue to do so as time goes on.<ref name=\"doi.org\" />\n\n{{See also|Work 4.0}}\n\n====Industrial robotics====\n[[File:Workmaster.jpg|alt=Large automated milling machines inside a big warehouse-style lab room|thumb|Automated milling machines]]\n[[Industrial robotics]] is a sub-branch in the industrial automation that aids in various manufacturing processes.

Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic-based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control task and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bolten|first1=William|title=Programmable Logic Controllers (5th Edition)|date=2009|page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Siemens Simatic S7-416-3.jpg|thumb|Siemens Simatic S7-400 system in a rack, left-to-right: power supply unit (PSU), CPU, interface module (IM) and communication processor (CP).]]\nPLCs can range from small \"building brick\" devices with tens of I/O in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and [[SCADA]] systems.\n\nThey can be designed for multiple arrangements of digital and analog inputs and outputs (I/O), extended temperature ranges, immunity to [[noise (electronics)|electrical noise]], and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nIt was from the automotive industry in the USA that the PLC was born. Before the PLC, control, sequencing, and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of [[relay]]s, [[cam timer]]s, [[drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencer]]s, and dedicated closed-loop controllers. Since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands, the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model [[changeover|change-over]] was very time-consuming and expensive, as [[electrician]]s needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics.\n\nWhen digital computers became available, being general-purpose programmable devices, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes. However, these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature, cleanliness, and power quality. To meet these challenges this the PLC was developed with several key attributes. It would tolerate the shop-floor environment, it would support discrete (bit-form) input and output in an easily extensible manner, it would not require years of training to use, and it would permit its operation to be monitored. Since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times, modern (fast, small, reliable) electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers, and performance could be traded off for reliability.<ref name=Parr00>E.

Parr, ''Industrial Control Handbook'', Industrial Press Inc., 1999 {{ISBN|0-8311-3085-7}}</ref>\n\n====Agent-assisted automation====\n{{main|Agent-assisted automation}}\nAgent-assisted automation refers to automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries. There are two basic types: desktop automation and automated voice solutions. Desktop automation refers to software programming that makes it easier for the call center agent to work across multiple desktop tools. The automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it did not have to be entered more than once, for example. Automated voice solutions allow the agents to remain on the line while disclosures and other important information is provided to customers in the form of pre-recorded audio files. Specialized applications of these automated voice solutions enable the agents to process credit cards without ever seeing or hearing the credit card numbers or CVV codes<ref name=\"adsit\">{{cite news | last=Adsit | first=Dennis| url= http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=1854&Itemid=1&Itemid=1| title= Error-proofing strategies for managing call center fraud | work= isixsigma.com |date= 21 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe key benefit of agent-assisted automation is compliance and error-proofing. Agents are sometimes not fully trained or they forget or ignore key steps in the process. The use of automation ensures that what is supposed to happen on the call actually does, every time.\n\n==Relationship to unemployment==\n{{main|Technological unemployment}}\nResearch by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne of the [[Oxford Martin School]] argued that employees engaged in \"tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms\" are at risk of displacement, and 47 percent of jobs in the US were at risk.

When one robot is added per one thousand workers, the employment to population ratio decreases between 0.18\u20130.34 percentages and wages are reduced by 0.25\u20130.5 percentage points. During the time period studied, the US did not have many robots in the economy which restricts the impact of automation. However, automation is expected to triple (conservative estimate) or quadruple (a generous estimate) leading these numbers to become substantially higher.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Restrepo|first2=Pascual|title=Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/12763|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403004714/https://economics.mit.edu/files/12763|archive-date=3 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBased on a formula by [[Gilles Saint-Paul]], an economist at Toulouse 1 University, the demand for unskilled human capital declines at a slower rate than the demand for skilled human capital increases.<ref>{{cite book|isbn= 9780691128306|title= Innovation and Inequality: How Does Technical Progress Affect Workers?|last1= Saint-Paul|first1= Gilles|date= 21 July 2008}}</ref> In the long run and for society as a whole it has led to cheaper products, [[Working time#Gradual decrease in working hours|lower average work hours]], and new industries forming (i.e., robotics industries, computer industries, design industries). These new industries provide many high salary skill-based jobs to the economy. By 2030, between 3 and 14 percent of the global workforce will be forced to switch job categories due to automation eliminating jobs in an entire sector. While the number of jobs lost to automation is often offset by jobs gained from technological advances, the same type of job loss is not the same one replaced and that leading to increasing unemployment in the lower-middle class. This occurs largely in the US and developed countries where technological advances contribute to higher demand for highly skilled labor but demand for middle-wage labor continues to fall. Economists call this trend \"income polarization\" where unskilled labor wages are driven down and skilled labor is driven up and it is predicted to continue in developed economies.<ref>{{cite book|author=McKinsey Global Institute|title=Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transitions in a Time of Automation|date=December 2017|publisher=Mckinsey & Company|pages=1\u201320|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI-Jobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Report-December-6-2017.ashx|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnemployment is becoming a problem in the United States due to the exponential growth rate of automation and technology. According to Kim, Kim, and Lee (2017), \"A seminal study by Frey and Osborne in 2013 predicted that 47% of the 702 examined occupations in the United States faced a high risk of decreased employment rate within the next 10\u201325 years as a result of computerization\". (p.&nbsp;1). As many jobs are becoming obsolete, which is causing job displacement, one possible solution would be for the government to assist with a universal basic income (UBI) program. UBI would be a guaranteed, non-taxed income of around $1000 dollars per month, paid to all U.S. citizens over the age of 21. UBI would help those who are displaced, take on jobs that pay less money and still afford to get by. It would also give those that are employed with jobs that are likely to be replaced by automation and technology, extra money to spend on education and training on new demanding employment skills. UBI however, should be seen as a short-term solution because it doesn't fully address the issue of income inequality which will be exacerbated by job displacement.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Automated storage and retrieval system]]\n* [[Automation technician]]\n* [[Cognitive computing]]\n* [[Control engineering]]\n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Data-driven control system]]\n* [[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning]]\n* [[Feedforward control]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* [[Industrial Revolution]]\n* [[Ludditism]]\n* [[Machine to machine]]\n* [[Mobile manipulator]]\n* [[Multi-agent system]]\n* [[Post-work society]]\n* [[Process control]]\n* [[Productivity improving technologies]]\n* [[Robot tax]]\n* [[Robotic process automation]]\n* [[Semi-automation]]\n* [[Industry 4.0]]\n* [[Technological unemployment]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist\n|refs=\n<ref name=\"MBLE_1962_Norbit\">{{cite journal |title=les relais statiques Norbit |language=French |date=September 1962<!-- or 1961? --> |journal=[[Revue MBLE]] |url=http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto17.jpg |access-date=18 June 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618235651/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto17.jpg |archive-date=18 June 2018}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20180619105935/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto10.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619105944/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto11.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110132/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto12.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110140/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto13.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110249/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto14.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110302/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto15.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110254/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto16.jpg]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Walker_2012\">{{cite book |title=The Programmable Logic Controller: its prehistory, emergence and application |author-first=Mark John |author-last=Walker |date=8 September 2012 |type=PhD thesis |location=Department of Communication and Systems Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology |publisher=[[The Open University]] |pages=223, 269, 308 |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |access-date=20 June 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620115412/http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |archive-date=20 June 2018}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Wireless-World_1960\">{{cite journal |title=INTERKAMA 1960 \u2013 Dusseldorf Exhibition of Automation and Instruments |date=December 1960 |volume=66 |number=12 |journal=[[Wireless World]] |pages=588\u2013589 |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Wireless-World/60s/Wireless-World-1960-12.pdf |access-date=18 June 2018 |quote=[\u2026] Another point noticed was the widespread use of small-package [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[digital logic|logic]] (such as \"[[Logical AND|and]],\" \"[[Logical OR|or]],\" \"[[Logical NOT|not]]\") and [[instrumentation]] (timers, amplifiers, etc.) units.

In control complexity, it can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms.\n\nIn the simplest type of an automatic [[control loop]], a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value, and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system.

A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. (The control action is the switching the boiler off and on. The process output is the building temperature).\n\nIn closed-loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on the process output. In the case of the boiler analogy, this would include a temperature sensor to monitor the building temperature, and thereby feed a signal back to the controller to ensure it maintains the building at the temperature set on the thermostat. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to give a process output equal to the \"Reference input\" or \"set point\". For this reason, closed-loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.<ref>\"Feedback and control systems\" \u2013 JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967</ref>\n\nThe definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is 'a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.'<ref name = mayr>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|url=https://archive.org/details/TheOriginsOfFeedbackControlOttoMayr }}</ref>\n\nLikewise, a ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control.<ref name = mayr/>\nThe advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications, and other industries, is feedback control, which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range.<ref name=\"Bennett 1993\"/><ref>Bennett, Stuart (1992).

An increase in speed would make the counterweights move outward, sliding a linkage that tended to close the valve supplying steam, and so slowing the engine. ]]\n\n==Control actions==\n{{Main|Control system}}\n\n=== Discrete control (on/off) ===\nOne of the simplest types of control is ''on-off'' control. An example is a thermostat used on household appliances which either opens or closes an electrical contact. (Thermostats were originally developed as true feedback-control mechanisms rather than the on-off common household appliance thermostat.)\n\nSequence control, in which a programmed sequence of ''discrete'' operations is performed, often based on system logic that involves system states. An elevator control system is an example of sequence control.\n\n===PID controller===\n[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or \"set point\", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]\n{{main |PID Controller}}\nA '''proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative controller''' ('''PID controller''') is a [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] ([[controller (control theory)|controller]]) widely used in [[industrial control system]]s.\n\nIn a [[PID loop]], the controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' <math>e(t)</math> as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms, respectively (sometimes denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'') which give their name to the controller type.\n\nThe theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analog control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.\n\n===Sequential control and logical sequence or system state control===\n{{main| Programmable logic controller}}\nSequential control may be either to a fixed sequence or to a logical one that will perform different actions depending on various system states. An example of an adjustable but otherwise fixed sequence is a timer on a lawn sprinkler.\n\nStates refer to the various conditions that can occur in a use or sequence scenario of the system. An example is an elevator, which uses logic based on the system state to perform certain actions in response to its state and operator input. For example, if the operator presses the floor n button, the system will respond depending on whether the elevator is stopped or moving, going up or down, or if the door is open or closed, and other conditions.<ref>The elevator example is commonly used in programming texts, such as [[Unified modeling language]]</ref>\n\nEarly development of sequential control was [[relay logic]], by which [[Electrical relay|electrical relays]] engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt power to a device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing [[Solenoid valve|solenoid valves]]. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence [[Cam timer|cam timers]]. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.\n\nThe total number of relays and cam timers can number into the hundreds or even thousands in some factories. Early [[computer programming|programming]] techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, one of the first being [[ladder logic]], where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder. Special computers called [[programmable logic controllers]] were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit. \n  \nIn a typical hard wired motor start and stop circuit (called a ''control circuit'') a motor is started by pushing a \"Start\" or \"Run\" button that activates a pair of electrical relays. The \"lock-in\" relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push-button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three-phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The \"lock-in\" contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a \"stop\" or \"off\" button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exman.com/mshoass.html|title=MOTOR STARTERS START STOPS HAND OFF AUTO|website=Exman.com|access-date=14 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413062641/http://www.exman.com/mshoass.html|archive-date=13 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[Image:Finite state machine example with comments.svg|thumb|This state diagram shows how [[Unified modeling language|UML]] can be used for designing a door system that can only be opened and closed|alt=]]\nCommonly [[interlock (engineering)|interlock]]s are added to a control circuit. Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication. In this case, an interlock could be added to ensure that the oil pump is running before the motor starts. Timers, limit switches, and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits.\n\n[[Solenoid valve]]s are widely used on compressed air or hydraulic fluid for powering [[actuator]]s on mechanical components. While motors are used to supply continuous rotary motion, actuators are typically a better choice for intermittently creating a limited range of movement for a mechanical component, such as moving various mechanical arms, opening or closing valves, raising heavy press rolls, applying pressure to presses.\n\n===Computer control===\nComputers can perform both sequential control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both in an industrial application. [[Programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in [[relay logic]] type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand-alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments, and controllers in order to implement typical (such as [[PID controller|PID]]) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control [[algorithm]]s using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real-time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers, and management.\n\nControl of an [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) is an example of an interactive process in which a computer will perform a logic derived response to a user selection based on information retrieved from a networked database. The ATM process has similarities with other online transaction processes. The different logical responses are called ''scenarios''. Such processes are typically designed with the aid of [[use case]]s and [[flowchart]]s, which guide the writing of the software code. The earliest feedback control mechanism was the water clock invented by Greek engineer Ctesibius (285\u2013222 BC)\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[Image:Clepsydra-Diagram-Fancy.jpeg|thumb|180px|Ctesibius's clepsydra (3rd century BC).]]\nIt was a preoccupation of the Greeks and Arabs (in the period between about 300 BC and about 1200 AD) to keep accurate track of time.

Another control mechanism was used to tent the sails of windmills. It was patented by Edmund Lee in 1745.<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\"/> Also in 1745, [[Jacques de Vaucanson]] invented the first automated loom. The design of feedback control systems up through the Industrial Revolution was by trial-and-error, together with a great deal of engineering intuition. Thus, it was more of an art than a science. In the mid-19th century mathematics was first used to analyze the stability of feedback control systems. Since mathematics is the formal language of automatic control theory, we could call the period before this time the prehistory of control theory.\n\nIn 1771 [[Richard Arkwright]] invented the first fully automated spinning mill driven by water power, known at the time as the [[water frame]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Tessie P.|last=Liu|title=The Weaver's Knot: The Contradictions of Class Struggle and Family Solidarity in Western France, 1750\u20131914|url=https://archive.org/details/weaversknotcontr00liut|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8019-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/weaversknotcontr00liut/page/91 91]}}</ref> An automatic flour mill was developed by [[Oliver Evans]] in 1785, making it the first completely automated industrial process.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Howard B.|title=Automation and Society|url=https://archive.org/details/automationsociet00jaco|year=1959|publisher=Philosophical Library|location=New York, NY|page=[https://archive.org/details/automationsociet00jaco/page/8 8]|author2=Joseph S.

The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\"/>\n\nSeveral improvements to the governor, plus improvements to valve cut-off timing on the steam engine, made the engine suitable for most industrial uses before the end of the 19th century. Advances in the steam engine stayed well ahead of science, both thermodynamics and [[control theory]].<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\"/>\n\nThe governor received relatively little scientific attention until [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published a paper that established the beginning of a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long distance telephony, required a higher signal to noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the [[Second World War]] to [[fire control system]]s and aircraft [[navigation system]]s.<ref name=\"Bennett 1993\">{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Relay logic]] was introduced with factory [[electrification]], which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 through the 1920s. Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and operation of new high-pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls. Central control rooms became common in the 1920s, but as late as the early 1930s, most process control was on-off. Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments. To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off. Control rooms also used color-coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=31}}</ref>\n\nControllers, which were able to make calculated changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than on-off control, began being introduced the 1930s.

Automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines.\n\n===Space/computer age===\n\nWith the advent of the space age in 1957, controls design, particularly in the United States, turned away from the frequency-domain techniques of classical control theory and backed into the differential equation techniques of the late 19th century, which were couched in the time domain. During the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which became widely used in [[bang-bang control|hysteresis control systems]] such as [[navigation system]]s, [[fire-control system]]s, and [[electronics]]. Through Flugge-Lotz and others, the modern era saw time-domain design for [[nonlinear systems]] (1961), [[navigation]] (1960), [[optimal control]] and [[estimation theory]] (1962), [[nonlinear control theory]] (1969), [[digital control]] and [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtering theory]] (1974), and the [[personal computer]] (1983).\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\nPerhaps the most cited advantage of automation in industry is that it is associated with faster production and cheaper labor costs. Another benefit could be that it replaces hard, physical, or monotonous work.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Industrial Automation: Hands on|last = Lamb|first = Frank|year = 2013|pages = 1\u20134}}</ref> Additionally, tasks that take place in hazardous environments or that are otherwise beyond human capabilities can be done by machines, as machines can operate even under extreme temperatures or in atmospheres that are radioactive or toxic. They can also be maintained with simple quality checks. However, at the time being, not all tasks can be automated, and some tasks are more expensive to automate than others. Initial costs of installing the machinery in factory settings are high, and failure to maintain a system could result in the loss of the product itself. Moreover, some studies seem to indicate that industrial automation could impose ill effects beyond operational concerns, including worker displacement due to systemic loss of employment and compounded environmental damage; however, these findings are both convoluted and controversial in nature, and could potentially be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite_news|title=The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS|last=Arnzt|first=Melanie|date=14 May 2016|id = {{ProQuest|1790436902}}}}</ref>\n\nThe main advantages of automation are:\n*Increased throughput or productivity.\n*Improved quality or increased predictability of quality.\n*Improved robustness (consistency), of processes or product.\n*Increased consistency of output.\n*Reduced direct human labor costs and expenses.\n*Installation in operations reduces cycle time. \n*Can complete tasks where a high degree of accuracy is required.\n*Replaces human operators in tasks that involve hard physical or monotonous work (e.g., using one forklift with a single driver instead of a team of multiple workers to lift a heavy object)<ref>[http://www.bma-automation.com/Prozessautomatisierung.2102.0.html?id=2102&L=1 Process automation, retrieved on 20.02.2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517174600/http://www.bma-automation.com/Prozessautomatisierung.2102.0.html?id=2102&L=1 |date=17 May 2013 }}</ref>\n*Reduces some occupational injuries (e.g., fewer strained backs from lifting heavy objects)\n*Replaces humans in tasks done in dangerous environments (i.e. fire, space, volcanoes, nuclear facilities, underwater, etc.)\n*Performs tasks that are beyond human capabilities of size, weight, speed, endurance, etc.\n*Reduces operation time and work handling time significantly.\n*Frees up workers to take on other roles.\n*Provides higher level jobs in the development, deployment, maintenance and running of the automated processes.\n\nThe main disadvantages of automation are:\n\n*Possible security threats/vulnerability due to increased relative susceptibility for committing errors.\n*Unpredictable or excessive development costs.\n*High initial cost.\n*Displaces workers due to job replacement.\n\n==Societal impact==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2018}}\n\nIncreased automation often cause workers to feel anxious about losing their jobs as technology renders their skills or experience unnecessary. Early in the [[Industrial Revolution]], when inventions like the [[steam engine]] were making some job categories expendable, workers forcefully resisted these changes. [[Luddites]], for instance, were English textile workers who protested the introduction of weaving machines by destroying them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Luddite|title=Luddite|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> More recently, some residents of Chandler, Arizona, have slashed tires and pelted rocks at driver-less cars, in protest over the cars' perceived threat to human safety and job prospects.<ref>{{cite news |last= Romero|first= Simon|date= 31 December 2018|title= Wielding Rocks and Knives, Arizonans Attack Self-Driving Cars|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/waymo-self-driving-cars-arizona-attacks.html|work= The New York Times|access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe relative anxiety about automation reflected in opinion polls seems to correlate closely with the strength of organized labor in that region or nation. For example, while a study by the [[Pew Research Center]] indicated that 72% of Americans are worried about increasing automation in the workplace, 80% of Swedes see automation and [[artificial intelligence]] as a good thing, due to the country's still-powerful unions and a more robust national safety net.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html|title=The Robots are Coming, and Sweden is Fine|last=Goodman|first=Peter S.|work=The New York Times|date=27 December 2017|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, 47% of all current jobs have the potential to be fully automated by 2033, according to the research of experts [[Carl Frey|Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne.

However, the factory never reached full \"lights out\" status.<ref name=\"RCR Wireless News\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rcrwireless.com/20160810/internet-of-things/lights-out-manufacturing-tag31-tag99|title=Lights out manufacturing and its impact on society|date=10 August 2016|work=RCR Wireless News}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of lights out manufacturing requires:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cnc-machine-tools.com/checklist-for-lights-out-manufacturing/|title=Checklist for Lights-Out Manufacturing|date=4 September 2017|work=CNC machine tools}}</ref>\n* Reliability of equipment\n* Long-term mechanic capabilities\n* Planned preventive maintenance\n* Commitment from the staff\n\n==Health and environment==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe costs of automation to the environment are different depending on the technology, product or engine automated. There are automated engines that consume more energy resources from the Earth in comparison with previous engines and vice versa.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Hazardous operations, such as [[oil refining]], the manufacturing of [[Chemical industry|industrial chemicals]], and all forms of [[metal working]], were always early contenders for automation.{{dubious|date=October 2013}}{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe automation of vehicles could prove to have a substantial impact on the environment, although the nature of this impact could be beneficial or harmful depending on several factors. Because [[automated vehicle]]s are much less likely to get into accidents compared to human-driven vehicles, some precautions built into current models (such as [[anti-lock brake]]s or [[laminated glass]]) would not be required for self-driving versions. Removing these safety features would also significantly reduce the weight of the vehicle, thus increasing [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and reducing emissions per mile. Self-driving vehicles are also more precise with regard to acceleration and breaking, and this could contribute to reduced emissions. Self-driving cars could also potentially utilize fuel-efficient features such as route mapping that is able to calculate and take the most efficient routes. Despite this potential to reduce emissions, some researchers theorize that an increase of production of self-driving cars could lead to a boom of vehicle ownership and use. This boom could potentially negate any environmental benefits of self-driving cars if a large enough number of people begin driving personal vehicles more frequently.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4476614/self-driving-cars-environment/ |title=Self-Driving Cars Could Help Save the Environment\u2014Or Ruin It. It Depends on Us|website=Time.com}}</ref>\n\nAutomation of homes and home appliances is also thought to impact the environment, but the benefits of these features are also questioned. A study of energy consumption of automated homes in Finland showed that [[smart home]]s could reduce energy consumption by monitoring levels of consumption in different areas of the home and adjusting consumption to reduce energy leaks (such as automatically reducing consumption during the nighttime when activity is low). This study, along with others, indicated that the smart home's ability to monitor and adjust consumption levels would reduce unnecessary energy usage. However, new research suggests that smart homes might not be as efficient as non-automated homes. A more recent study has indicated that, while monitoring and adjusting consumption levels does decrease unnecessary energy use, this process requires monitoring systems that also consume a significant amount of energy. This study suggested that the energy required to run these systems is so much so that it negates any benefits of the systems themselves, resulting in little to no ecological benefit.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Environmental Impacts and Benefits of Smart Home Automation: Life Cycle Assessment of Home Energy Management System|journal=IFAC-Papers on Line|volume=48|page=880|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.05.158|year=2015|last1=Louis|first1=Jean-Nicolas|last2=Calo|first2=Antonio|last3=Leivisk\u00e4|first3=Kauko|last4=Pongr\u00e1cz|first4=Eva|url=http://jultika.oulu.fi/files/nbnfi-fe201703082017.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Convertibility and [[turnaround time]]==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nAnother major shift in automation is the increased demand for flexibility and convertibility in manufacturing processes. Manufacturers are increasingly demanding the ability to easily switch from manufacturing Product A to manufacturing Product B without having to completely rebuild the [[production line]]s. Flexibility and distributed processes have led to the introduction of [[Automated Guided Vehicle]]s with Natural Features Navigation.\n\nDigital electronics helped too. Former analog-based instrumentation was replaced by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization, and operation. This was accompanied by the [[fieldbus]] revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a single cable) means of communicating between control systems and field level instrumentation, eliminating hard-wiring.\n\n[[Discrete manufacturing]] plants adopted these technologies fast. The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analog-based measurement and control still dominates. The growing use of [[Industrial Ethernet]] on the factory floor is pushing these trends still further, enabling manufacturing plants to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for [[Reconfigurable Manufacturing System]]s.\n\n==Automation tools==\nEngineers can now have [[numerical control]] over automated devices. The result has been a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities. [[Computer-aided technologies]] (or CAx) now serve as the basis for mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems. Notable examples of CAx include [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD software) and [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Engineers' CAx education\u2014it's not only CAD |journal=Computer-Aided Design |volume=36 |issue=14 |page=1439 |doi=10.1016/j.cad.2004.02.011|year=2004 |last1=Werner Dankwort |first1=C |last2=Weidlich |first2=Roland |last3=Guenther |first3=Birgit |last4=Blaurock |first4=Joerg E }}</ref>\n\n[[Information technology]], together with [[industry|industrial]] [[machinery]] and [[industrial process|process]]es, can assist in the design, implementation, and monitoring of control systems.

Therefore, some personnel are needed to ensure that the entire system functions properly and that safety and product quality are maintained.\n* As a process becomes increasingly automated, there is less and less labor to be saved or quality improvement to be gained. This is an example of both [[diminishing returns]] and the [[logistic function]].\n* As more and more processes become automated, there are fewer remaining non-automated processes. This is an example of the exhaustion of opportunities. New technological paradigms may, however, set new limits that surpass the previous limits.\n\n===Current limitations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}Many roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation. Human-level [[pattern recognition]], [[language comprehension]], and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems (but see [[Watson (computer)]]). Tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data, such as scents and sounds, as well as high-level tasks such as strategic planning, currently require human expertise. In many cases, the use of humans is more cost-effective than mechanical approaches even where the automation of industrial tasks is possible. Overcoming these obstacles is a theorized path to [[post-scarcity]] economics.\n\n==== Paradox of automation ====\nThe [[paradox]] of automation says that the more efficient the automated system, the more crucial the human contribution of the operators. Humans are less involved, but their involvement becomes more critical. [[Lisanne Bainbridge]], a cognitive psychologist, identified these issues notably in her widely cited paper \"Ironies of Automation.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bainbridge|first=Lisanne|date=November 1983|title=Ironies of automation|journal=Automatica|volume=19|issue=6|pages=775\u2013779|doi=10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8}}</ref>\n\nIf an automated system has an error, it will multiply that error until it is fixed or shut down.

Currently, it can still require a large amount of [[human capital]], particularly in the [[third world]] where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation.\n\n===Automated video surveillance===\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) started the research and development of automated visual [[surveillance]] and monitoring (VSAM) program, between 1997 and 1999, and airborne video surveillance (AVS) programs, from 1998 to 2002. Currently, there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully automated [[Space Tracking and Surveillance System|tracking surveillance]] system. Automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensor, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.<ref>Javed, O, & Shah, M.

City of Publication: Springer-Verlag New York Inc.</ref>\n\n===Automated highway systems===\n{{main|Automated highway systems}}\n\nAs demands for safety and mobility have grown and technological possibilities have multiplied, interest in automation has grown. Seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways, the [[United States Congress]] authorized more than $650 million over six years for [[intelligent transport system]]s (ITS) and demonstration projects in the 1991 [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA). Congress legislated in ISTEA that \"the [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] shall develop an automated highway and vehicle prototype from which future fully automated intelligent vehicle-highway systems can be developed. Such development shall include research in human factors to ensure the success of the man-machine relationship. The goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or an automated test track in operation by 1997. This system shall accommodate installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehicles.\" [ISTEA 1991, part B, Section 6054(b)].\n\nFull automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.<ref>Menzies, Thomas.

General purpose controllers for industrial processes include Programmable logic controllers, stand-alone I/O modules, and computers. Industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands. One trend is increased use of [[Machine vision]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.controleng.com/articles/what-is-machine-vision-and-how-can-it-help/|title=What is machine vision, and how can it help?|date=6 December 2018|website=Control Engineering}}</ref> to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions, another is a continuing increase in the use of robots. Industrial automation is simply required in industries.\n\nEnergy efficiency in industrial processes has become a higher priority. Semiconductor companies like Infineon Technologies are offering 8-bit micro-controller applications for example found in motor controls, general purpose pumps, fans, and ebikes to reduce energy consumption and thus increase efficiency.\n\n{{see also|Building automation|Laboratory automation}}\n\n====Industrial Automation and Industry 4.0====\nThe rise of industrial automation is directly tied to the \u201c[[Fourth Industrial Revolution]]\u201d, which is better known now as Industry 4.0.

Being able to create smarter, safer, and more advanced manufacturing is now possible with these new technologies. It opens up a manufacturing platform that is more reliable, consistent, and efficient than before. Implementation of systems such as [[SCADA]] is an example of software that takes place in Industrial Automation today.

Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic-based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control task and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bolten|first1=William|title=Programmable Logic Controllers (5th Edition)|date=2009|page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Siemens Simatic S7-416-3.jpg|thumb|Siemens Simatic S7-400 system in a rack, left-to-right: power supply unit (PSU), CPU, interface module (IM) and communication processor (CP).]]\nPLCs can range from small \"building brick\" devices with tens of I/O in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and [[SCADA]] systems.\n\nThey can be designed for multiple arrangements of digital and analog inputs and outputs (I/O), extended temperature ranges, immunity to [[noise (electronics)|electrical noise]], and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nIt was from the automotive industry in the USA that the PLC was born. Before the PLC, control, sequencing, and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of [[relay]]s, [[cam timer]]s, [[drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencer]]s, and dedicated closed-loop controllers. Since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands, the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model [[changeover|change-over]] was very time-consuming and expensive, as [[electrician]]s needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics.\n\nWhen digital computers became available, being general-purpose programmable devices, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes. However, these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature, cleanliness, and power quality. To meet these challenges this the PLC was developed with several key attributes. It would tolerate the shop-floor environment, it would support discrete (bit-form) input and output in an easily extensible manner, it would not require years of training to use, and it would permit its operation to be monitored. Since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times, modern (fast, small, reliable) electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers, and performance could be traded off for reliability.<ref name=Parr00>E.

There are two basic types: desktop automation and automated voice solutions. Desktop automation refers to software programming that makes it easier for the call center agent to work across multiple desktop tools. The automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it did not have to be entered more than once, for example. Automated voice solutions allow the agents to remain on the line while disclosures and other important information is provided to customers in the form of pre-recorded audio files. Specialized applications of these automated voice solutions enable the agents to process credit cards without ever seeing or hearing the credit card numbers or CVV codes<ref name=\"adsit\">{{cite news | last=Adsit | first=Dennis| url= http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=1854&Itemid=1&Itemid=1| title= Error-proofing strategies for managing call center fraud | work= isixsigma.com |date= 21 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe key benefit of agent-assisted automation is compliance and error-proofing. Agents are sometimes not fully trained or they forget or ignore key steps in the process. The use of automation ensures that what is supposed to happen on the call actually does, every time.\n\n==Relationship to unemployment==\n{{main|Technological unemployment}}\nResearch by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne of the [[Oxford Martin School]] argued that employees engaged in \"tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms\" are at risk of displacement, and 47 percent of jobs in the US were at risk.

During the time period studied, the US did not have many robots in the economy which restricts the impact of automation. However, automation is expected to triple (conservative estimate) or quadruple (a generous estimate) leading these numbers to become substantially higher.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Restrepo|first2=Pascual|title=Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/12763|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403004714/https://economics.mit.edu/files/12763|archive-date=3 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBased on a formula by [[Gilles Saint-Paul]], an economist at Toulouse 1 University, the demand for unskilled human capital declines at a slower rate than the demand for skilled human capital increases.<ref>{{cite book|isbn= 9780691128306|title= Innovation and Inequality: How Does Technical Progress Affect Workers?|last1= Saint-Paul|first1= Gilles|date= 21 July 2008}}</ref> In the long run and for society as a whole it has led to cheaper products, [[Working time#Gradual decrease in working hours|lower average work hours]], and new industries forming (i.e., robotics industries, computer industries, design industries). These new industries provide many high salary skill-based jobs to the economy. By 2030, between 3 and 14 percent of the global workforce will be forced to switch job categories due to automation eliminating jobs in an entire sector. While the number of jobs lost to automation is often offset by jobs gained from technological advances, the same type of job loss is not the same one replaced and that leading to increasing unemployment in the lower-middle class. This occurs largely in the US and developed countries where technological advances contribute to higher demand for highly skilled labor but demand for middle-wage labor continues to fall. Economists call this trend \"income polarization\" where unskilled labor wages are driven down and skilled labor is driven up and it is predicted to continue in developed economies.<ref>{{cite book|author=McKinsey Global Institute|title=Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transitions in a Time of Automation|date=December 2017|publisher=Mckinsey & Company|pages=1\u201320|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI-Jobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Report-December-6-2017.ashx|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnemployment is becoming a problem in the United States due to the exponential growth rate of automation and technology. According to Kim, Kim, and Lee (2017), \"A seminal study by Frey and Osborne in 2013 predicted that 47% of the 702 examined occupations in the United States faced a high risk of decreased employment rate within the next 10\u201325 years as a result of computerization\". (p.&nbsp;1). As many jobs are becoming obsolete, which is causing job displacement, one possible solution would be for the government to assist with a universal basic income (UBI) program. UBI would be a guaranteed, non-taxed income of around $1000 dollars per month, paid to all U.S. citizens over the age of 21. UBI would help those who are displaced, take on jobs that pay less money and still afford to get by. It would also give those that are employed with jobs that are likely to be replaced by automation and technology, extra money to spend on education and training on new demanding employment skills. UBI however, should be seen as a short-term solution because it doesn't fully address the issue of income inequality which will be exacerbated by job displacement.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Automated storage and retrieval system]]\n* [[Automation technician]]\n* [[Cognitive computing]]\n* [[Control engineering]]\n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Data-driven control system]]\n* [[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning]]\n* [[Feedforward control]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* [[Industrial Revolution]]\n* [[Ludditism]]\n* [[Machine to machine]]\n* [[Mobile manipulator]]\n* [[Multi-agent system]]\n* [[Post-work society]]\n* [[Process control]]\n* [[Productivity improving technologies]]\n* [[Robot tax]]\n* [[Robotic process automation]]\n* [[Semi-automation]]\n* [[Industry 4.0]]\n* [[Technological unemployment]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist\n|refs=\n<ref name=\"MBLE_1962_Norbit\">{{cite journal |title=les relais statiques Norbit |language=French |date=September 1962<!-- or 1961? --> |journal=[[Revue MBLE]] |url=http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto17.jpg |access-date=18 June 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618235651/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto17.jpg |archive-date=18 June 2018}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20180619105935/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto10.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619105944/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto11.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110132/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto12.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110140/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto13.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110249/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto14.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110302/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto15.jpg]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180619110254/http://www.radiocollection.be/images/mble_img/mble_auto16.jpg]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Walker_2012\">{{cite book |title=The Programmable Logic Controller: its prehistory, emergence and application |author-first=Mark John |author-last=Walker |date=8 September 2012 |type=PhD thesis |location=Department of Communication and Systems Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology |publisher=[[The Open University]] |pages=223, 269, 308 |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |access-date=20 June 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620115412/http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |archive-date=20 June 2018}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Wireless-World_1960\">{{cite journal |title=INTERKAMA 1960 \u2013 Dusseldorf Exhibition of Automation and Instruments |date=December 1960 |volume=66 |number=12 |journal=[[Wireless World]] |pages=588\u2013589 |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Wireless-World/60s/Wireless-World-1960-12.pdf |access-date=18 June 2018 |quote=[\u2026] Another point noticed was the widespread use of small-package [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[digital logic|logic]] (such as \"[[Logical AND|and]],\" \"[[Logical OR|or]],\" \"[[Logical NOT|not]]\") and [[instrumentation]] (timers, amplifiers, etc.) units.
