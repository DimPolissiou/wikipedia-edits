The Aayis controlled the land from present-day [[Kollam district]] in the north, through [[Thiruvananthapuram district]], all in Kerala, to the [[Kanyakumari district]]. There were two capitals, the major one at [[Kollam]] (''[[Venad|Venad Swaroopam]]'' or ''[[Desinganadu]]'') and a subsidiary one at Thrippapur (''Thrippapur Swaroopam'' or ''[[Nanjinad]]''). The kingdom was thus also called [[Venad]]. Kings of [[Venad]] had, at various times, travelled from [[Kollam]] and built residential palaces in [[Thiruvithamcode]] and [[Kalkulam]]. Thiruvithamcode became the capital of the Thrippapur Swaroopam, and the country was referred to as ''Thiruvithamcode'' by Europeans even after the capital had been moved in 1601 to [[Padmanabhapuram]], near Kalkulam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mal.sarva.gov.in/index.php?title=%E0%B4%A4%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%81%E0%B4%B5%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%A4%E0%B4%BE%E0%B4%82%E0%B4%95%E0%B5%82%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%8D%E2%80%8D|archivedate=4 April 2014|accessdate=2014-04-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140404133809/http://mal.sarva.gov.in/index.php?title=\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d02\u0d15\u0d42\u0d30\u0d4d\u200d|date=2008-07-04|publisher=[[The State Institute of Encyclopaedic Publications]]|title=\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d02\u0d15\u0d42\u0d30\u0d4d\u200d|language=Malayalam|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Chera empire had dissolved by around 1100 and thereafter the territory comprised numerous small kingdoms until the time of [[Marthanda Varma]] who, as king of Venad from 1729, employed brutal methods to unify them.<ref>{{cite book |first=Barbara N. |last=Ramusack |title=The Indian Princes and their States |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-13944-908-3 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kz1-mtazYqEC&pg=PA33}}</ref> During his reign, Thiruvithamcode or Travancore became the official name.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Geography==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nTravancore 1871.JPG|Map of Travancore in 1871.\nA Canal Scene, Travancore.jpg|A Canal scene in Travancore.\n</gallery>\nThe Kingdom of Travancore was located at the extreme southern tip of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Dharma Raja]]'s period is considered as a Golden Age in the history of Travancore. He not only retained the territorial gains of his predecessor Marthanda Varma, but also improved and encouraged social development. He was greatly assisted by a very efficient administrator, [[Raja Kesavadas]], who was the Diwan of Travancore. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nTravancore often allied with the [[English East India Company]] in military conflicts.<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\"/> During [[Dharma Raja]]'s reign, [[Tipu Sultan]], the de facto ruler of [[Mysore]] and the son of [[Hyder Ali]], attacked Travancore in 1789 as a part of the [[Mysore invasion of Kerala]]. Dharma Raja had earlier refused to hand over the [[Hindu]] political refugees from the [[Mysore invasion of Kerala|Mysore occupation of Malabar]], who had been given asylum in Travancore. The Mysore army entered the [[Cochin kingdom]] from [[Coimbatore]] in November 1789 and reached [[Trichur]] in December. On 28 December 1789 Tipu Sultan attacked the Nedunkotta (Northern Lines) from the north, causing the [[Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789)]], resulting in the defeat of Mysore army. In the battle, the bravery of 20 Travancore soldiers is very much appreciable. Tipu lost many soldiers and also one of his commanders in the battle. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Velu Thampi Dalawa's rebellion===\n{{Main|Travancore Rebellion}}\nOn [[Dharma Raja]]'s death in 1798, [[Balarama Varma]] (1798\u20131810), the weakest ruler of the dynasty,  took over crown at the age of sixteen. A treaty brought Travancore under East India Company protection in 1795.<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\"/>\n\nThe Prime Ministers ([[Dewan|Dalawas]] or [[Dewan]]s) started taking control of the kingdom beginning with [[Velu Thampi Dalawa]] (Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi) (1799\u20131809) who was appointed as the ''divan'' following the dismissal of [[Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri]] (1798\u20131799). Initially, Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi and the [[English East India Company]] got along very well. When a section of the Travancore army mutinied in 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, he sought refuge with the British Resident and later used [[English East India Company]] troops to crush the mutiny. Velu Thampi also played a key role in renegotiating a new treaty between Travancore and the English East India Company. However, the demands by the East India Company for the payment of compensation for their involvement in the Travancore-Mysore War (1791) on behalf of Travancore, led to tension between the Diwan and the East India Company Resident. Velu Thampi and the [[Diwan (title)|diwan]] of [[Cochin kingdom]], [[Paliath Achan]] Govindan Menon, who was unhappy with the Resident for granting asylum to his enemy Kunhi Krishna Menon, declared \"war\" on the East India Company. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Adoption Durbar, Trivandrum.jpg|left|thumb|Adoption Durbar, Trivandrum]]\nThe East India Company army defeated Paliath Achan's army in Cochin on 27 February 1809. Paliath Achan surrendered to the East India Company and was exiled to [[Madras]] and later to [[Benaras]]. The Company defeated forces under Velu Thampi Dalawa at battles near Nagercoil and [[Kollam]] and inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels, following which many of his supporters deserted and went back to their homes. The Maharajah of Travancore, who hitherto had not taken any part in the rebellion openly, now allied with the British and appointed one of Thampi's enemies as his Prime Minister. The allied East India Company army and the Travancore soldiers camped in Pappanamcode, just outside [[Trivandrum]]. Velu Thampi Dalawa now organised a guerrilla struggle against the Company, but committed suicide to avoid capture by the Travancore army. After the mutiny of 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, most of the Nair army battalions of Travancore had been disbanded, and after Velu Thampi Dalawa's uprising, almost all of the remaining Travancore forces were also disbanded, with the East India Company undertaking to serve the king in cases of external and internal aggression. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Cessation of mah\u0101danams===\nThe kings of Travancore had been conditionally promoted to Kshatryahood with periodic performance of 16 mah\u0101d\u0101nams (great gifts in charity) such as Hiranya-garbh\u0101, Hiranya-K\u0101mdhenu, and Hirany\u0101swarat\u0101 in which each of which thousands of [[Brahmins]] had been given costly gifts apart from each getting a minimum of 1 ''kazhanch'' (78.65&nbsp;gm) of gold.<ref name=\"ASo00\">''A Social History of India''&nbsp;\u2013 (Ashish Publishing House: {{ISBN|81-7648-170-X}} / {{ISBN|81-7648-170-X}}, Jan 2000).</ref> In 1848 the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]], then [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General of British India]], was apprised that the depressed condition of the finances in Travancore was due to the mah\u0101danams by the rulers.<ref name=\"Adm88\">Sadasivan, S.N., 1988, ''Administration and social development in Kerala: A study in administrative sociology'', New Delhi, Indian Institute of Public Administration</ref> Lord Dalhousie instructed [[George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris|Lord Harris]], Governor of the [[Madras Presidency]], to warn the then King of Travancore, Martanda Varma (Uttram Tirunal 1847\u201360), that if he did not put a stop to this practice, the Madras Presidency would take over his Kingdom's administration.

This was in sharp contrast with some of the northern Indian kings. Since they spent most of the state's revenue for the benefit of the public, they were naturally much loved by their subjects.<ref>\"Sree Chithira Thirunal, was a noble model of humility, simplicity, piety and total dedication to the welfare of the people.

This tolerance of different religions was equally applicable when it came to social and ideological matters. Many political ideologies (such as [[communism]]) and social reforms were welcomed in Travancore. Although the Travancore royal family were devout Hindus, they were tolerant rulers who donated land and material for the construction of Christian churches and Muslim mosques. This patronage was appreciated by local Christians who actively supported the devout Hindu Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] during the Travancore-Dutch battles, against a Christian power.\n\nUnlike in the rest of India, in Travancore (and Kochi), the social status and freedom of women were high. In most communities, the daughters inherited the property (until 1925), were educated, and had the right to divorce and remarry.<ref>{{cite news|last=Santhanam|first=Kausalya|title=Royal vignettes: Travancore - Simplicity graces this House |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2003/03/30/stories/2003033000700700.htm|accessdate=14 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]] (magazine section)|date=March 30, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Travancore Royal Family]]\n* [[Thachudaya Kaimal]] Family\n* [[Travancore\u2013Dutch War]]\n* [[Travancore War]]\n* [[Travancore rupee]]\n* [[Nedumkotta]]\n* [[Cochin - Travancore Alliance (1761)]]\n* [[Cochin Travancore War (1755\u20131756)]]\n* [[Mysore invasion of Kerala]]\n* [[Upper cloth revolt]]\n* [[Vaikom Satyagraha]]\n* [[Temple Entry Proclamation]]\n* ''[[Marthandavarma (novel)|Marthandavarma]]'' (novel)\n* [[The Years of Rice and Salt]], an acclaimed novel that features an alternate history Travancore\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{Cite book|first1=V.

It was ruled by the [[Travancore Royal Family]] from [[Padmanabhapuram]], and later [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. At its zenith, the kingdom covered most of modern-day central and southern [[Kerala]] with the [[Thachudaya Kaimal]]'s enclave of [[Irinjalakuda]] [[Koodalmanikyam temple]] in the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Cochin]],<ref>British Archives http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/d3e53001-d49e-4d4d-bcb2-9f8daaffe2e0</ref> as well as the district of [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]], now in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. The official flag of the state was red with a dextrally-coiled silver [[shankha|conch shell]] (''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'') at its center. \n\nKing [[Marthanda Varma]] inherited the small feudal state of [[Venad]] in 1723 and built it into Travancore, one of the most powerful kingdoms in southern [[India]]. [[Marthanda Varma]] led the Travancore forces during the [[Travancore-Dutch War]] of 1739\u201346, which culminated in the [[Battle of Colachel]].

There were two capitals, the major one at [[Kollam]] (''[[Venad|Venad Swaroopam]]'' or ''[[Desinganadu]]'') and a subsidiary one at Thrippapur (''Thrippapur Swaroopam'' or ''[[Nanjinad]]''). The kingdom was thus also called [[Venad]]. Kings of [[Venad]] had, at various times, travelled from [[Kollam]] and built residential palaces in [[Thiruvithamcode]] and [[Kalkulam]]. Thiruvithamcode became the capital of the Thrippapur Swaroopam, and the country was referred to as ''Thiruvithamcode'' by Europeans even after the capital had been moved in 1601 to [[Padmanabhapuram]], near Kalkulam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mal.sarva.gov.in/index.php?title=%E0%B4%A4%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%81%E0%B4%B5%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%A4%E0%B4%BE%E0%B4%82%E0%B4%95%E0%B5%82%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%8D%E2%80%8D|archivedate=4 April 2014|accessdate=2014-04-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140404133809/http://mal.sarva.gov.in/index.php?title=\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d02\u0d15\u0d42\u0d30\u0d4d\u200d|date=2008-07-04|publisher=[[The State Institute of Encyclopaedic Publications]]|title=\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d02\u0d15\u0d42\u0d30\u0d4d\u200d|language=Malayalam|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Chera empire had dissolved by around 1100 and thereafter the territory comprised numerous small kingdoms until the time of [[Marthanda Varma]] who, as king of Venad from 1729, employed brutal methods to unify them.<ref>{{cite book |first=Barbara N. |last=Ramusack |title=The Indian Princes and their States |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-13944-908-3 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kz1-mtazYqEC&pg=PA33}}</ref> During his reign, Thiruvithamcode or Travancore became the official name.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Geography==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nTravancore 1871.JPG|Map of Travancore in 1871.\nA Canal Scene, Travancore.jpg|A Canal scene in Travancore.\n</gallery>\nThe Kingdom of Travancore was located at the extreme southern tip of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Dharma Raja]]'s period is considered as a Golden Age in the history of Travancore. He not only retained the territorial gains of his predecessor Marthanda Varma, but also improved and encouraged social development. He was greatly assisted by a very efficient administrator, [[Raja Kesavadas]], who was the Diwan of Travancore. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nTravancore often allied with the [[English East India Company]] in military conflicts.<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\"/> During [[Dharma Raja]]'s reign, [[Tipu Sultan]], the de facto ruler of [[Mysore]] and the son of [[Hyder Ali]], attacked Travancore in 1789 as a part of the [[Mysore invasion of Kerala]]. Dharma Raja had earlier refused to hand over the [[Hindu]] political refugees from the [[Mysore invasion of Kerala|Mysore occupation of Malabar]], who had been given asylum in Travancore. The Mysore army entered the [[Cochin kingdom]] from [[Coimbatore]] in November 1789 and reached [[Trichur]] in December. On 28 December 1789 Tipu Sultan attacked the Nedunkotta (Northern Lines) from the north, causing the [[Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789)]], resulting in the defeat of Mysore army. In the battle, the bravery of 20 Travancore soldiers is very much appreciable.

A treaty brought Travancore under East India Company protection in 1795.<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\"/>\n\nThe Prime Ministers ([[Dewan|Dalawas]] or [[Dewan]]s) started taking control of the kingdom beginning with [[Velu Thampi Dalawa]] (Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi) (1799\u20131809) who was appointed as the ''divan'' following the dismissal of [[Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri]] (1798\u20131799). Initially, Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi and the [[English East India Company]] got along very well. When a section of the Travancore army mutinied in 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, he sought refuge with the British Resident and later used [[English East India Company]] troops to crush the mutiny. Velu Thampi also played a key role in renegotiating a new treaty between Travancore and the English East India Company. However, the demands by the East India Company for the payment of compensation for their involvement in the Travancore-Mysore War (1791) on behalf of Travancore, led to tension between the Diwan and the East India Company Resident. Velu Thampi and the [[Diwan (title)|diwan]] of [[Cochin kingdom]], [[Paliath Achan]] Govindan Menon, who was unhappy with the Resident for granting asylum to his enemy Kunhi Krishna Menon, declared \"war\" on the East India Company. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Adoption Durbar, Trivandrum.jpg|left|thumb|Adoption Durbar, Trivandrum]]\nThe East India Company army defeated Paliath Achan's army in Cochin on 27 February 1809. Paliath Achan surrendered to the East India Company and was exiled to [[Madras]] and later to [[Benaras]]. The Company defeated forces under Velu Thampi Dalawa at battles near Nagercoil and [[Kollam]] and inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels, following which many of his supporters deserted and went back to their homes. The Maharajah of Travancore, who hitherto had not taken any part in the rebellion openly, now allied with the British and appointed one of Thampi's enemies as his Prime Minister. The allied East India Company army and the Travancore soldiers camped in Pappanamcode, just outside [[Trivandrum]]. Velu Thampi Dalawa now organised a guerrilla struggle against the Company, but committed suicide to avoid capture by the Travancore army. After the mutiny of 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, most of the Nair army battalions of Travancore had been disbanded, and after Velu Thampi Dalawa's uprising, almost all of the remaining Travancore forces were also disbanded, with the East India Company undertaking to serve the king in cases of external and internal aggression. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Cessation of mah\u0101danams===\nThe kings of Travancore had been conditionally promoted to Kshatryahood with periodic performance of 16 mah\u0101d\u0101nams (great gifts in charity) such as Hiranya-garbh\u0101, Hiranya-K\u0101mdhenu, and Hirany\u0101swarat\u0101 in which each of which thousands of [[Brahmins]] had been given costly gifts apart from each getting a minimum of 1 ''kazhanch'' (78.65&nbsp;gm) of gold.<ref name=\"ASo00\">''A Social History of India''&nbsp;\u2013 (Ashish Publishing House: {{ISBN|81-7648-170-X}} / {{ISBN|81-7648-170-X}}, Jan 2000).</ref> In 1848 the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]], then [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General of British India]], was apprised that the depressed condition of the finances in Travancore was due to the mah\u0101danams by the rulers.<ref name=\"Adm88\">Sadasivan, S.N., 1988, ''Administration and social development in Kerala: A study in administrative sociology'', New Delhi, Indian Institute of Public Administration</ref> Lord Dalhousie instructed [[George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris|Lord Harris]], Governor of the [[Madras Presidency]], to warn the then King of Travancore, Martanda Varma (Uttram Tirunal 1847\u201360), that if he did not put a stop to this practice, the Madras Presidency would take over his Kingdom's administration.

Sree Chithira Thirunal appointed, for the first time, an ''Art Advisor'' to the Government, Dr. G. H. Cousins. He also established a new form of University Training Corps, viz. ''Labour Corps'', preceding the N.C.C, in the educational institutions. The expenses of the University were to be met fully by the Government. Sree Chithira Thirunal also built a beautiful palace named ''Kowdiar Palace'', finished in 1934, which was previously an old ''Naluektu'', given by Sree Moolam Thirunal to his mother Sethu Parvathi Bayi in 1915.<ref>{{cite web|last=Supreme Court|first=Of India|title=GOOD GOVERNANCE: JUDICIARY AND THE RULE OF LAW|url=http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/speeches/speeches_2007/ctm.pdf|publisher=Sree Chithira Thirunal Memorial Lecture, 29 December 2007|accessdate=1 February 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017164448/http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/speeches/speeches_2007/ctm.pdf|archivedate=17 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Aswathy Thirunal Gauri Lakshmi Bai\">{{cite book|last=Gauri Lakshmi Bai|first=Aswathy Thirunal|title=Sree Padmanabhaswamy Kshetram|year=1998|publisher=The State Institute Of Languages, Kerala|location=Thiruvananthapuram|isbn=978-81-7638-028-7|pages=242\u2013243}}</ref><ref name=\"A.

In one such [[Punnapra-Vayalar uprising|riot in Punnapra-Vayalar]] in 1946, the Communist rioters established their own government in the area. This was put down by the Travancore Army and Navy. The Prime Minister issued a statement in June 1947 that Travancore would remain as an independent country instead of joining the Indian Union; subsequently, an attempt was made on the life of Sir C.P. Ramaswamy Iyer, following which he resigned and left for Madras, to be succeeded by Sri [[P.G.N. Unnithan]]. According to witnesses such as K.[[Aiyappan Pillai]], constitutional adviser to the Maharaja and historians like [[A.

This was in sharp contrast with some of the northern Indian kings.

This tolerance of different religions was equally applicable when it came to social and ideological matters. Many political ideologies (such as [[communism]]) and social reforms were welcomed in Travancore. Although the Travancore royal family were devout Hindus, they were tolerant rulers who donated land and material for the construction of Christian churches and Muslim mosques. This patronage was appreciated by local Christians who actively supported the devout Hindu Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] during the Travancore-Dutch battles, against a Christian power.\n\nUnlike in the rest of India, in Travancore (and Kochi), the social status and freedom of women were high.

Played by professional musicians called ''klezmorim'' in ensembles known as ''kapelye'', the genre originally consisted largely of dance tunes and instrumental display pieces for weddings and other celebrations. In the United States the genre evolved considerably as [[Yiddish]]-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, who arrived between 1880 and 1924,<ref>Hankus Netsky, \"American Klezmer: A Brief History\" from ''American Klezmer: Its Roots and Offshoots'' Ed. Mark Slobin, p.13</ref> came into contact with American jazz. During the initial years after the klezmer revival of the 1970s, the American sub-variety was what most people knew as klezmer, although in the 21st century musicians began paying more attention to the original pre-jazz traditions as revivalists including Josh Horowitz, [[Yale Strom]] and Bob Cohen have spent years doing field research in Eastern/Central Europe. Additionally, later immigrants from the [[Soviet Union]], such as German Goldenshtayn, took their surviving repertoires to the United States and Israel in the 1980s.\n\nCompared with most other European folk-music styles, little is known about the history of klezmer music, and much of what is said about it remains uncertain. There is, however, a heavy influence of Romani music, since many Jews and Roma lived side by side in Europe.<ref>Mark Slobin, ''Fiddler on the Move''. p.93.</ref>\n\n\nPopular musician [[Leonard Cohen]], composed many songs which had quite a following where the Klezmer style was evident.   Songs such as \u201cDance me to the end of love \u201c rely heavily on a violin but also have chord structures that feel Eastern European, Romanian, Greek or \u201cGypsy\u201d in flavor or sound.   Some aspects of these Klezmer-feeling Cohen compositions, as rendered, were surely modern in some of the instruments used, but the distinctive Jewish Klezmer feel shines through, and arguably, these numbers by Cohen are the most widely-heard examples of Klezmer music in the modern era due to Cohens prolific multi-generational appeal and status as a popular poet-songwriter-singer who was very popular on several continents in the Western World from the 1960s until his death in 2016.     \n\n==Etymology==\n{{disputed section|date=January 2019}}\nThe term klezmer comes from a combination of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words: ''kli'', meaning \"tool, utensil or instrument\" and ''zemer'', \"melody\"; leading to ''k'li zemer'' {{Hebrew|\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05b6\u05de\u05b6\u05e8}}, literally \"vessels (instruments) of music\" or \"[[musical instrument]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nOriginally, ''klezmer'' referred to musical instruments, and was later extended to refer, as a pejorative, to musicians themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klezmershack.com/articles/aboutklez.html|title=About the Klezmer Revival |publisher=klezmershack.com |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> From the 16th to 18th centuries, it replaced older terms such as ''leyts'' (clown).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Music/Traditional_and_Instrumental_Music |title=YIVO &#124; Music: Traditional and Instrumental Music |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}</ref> It was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre. Early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as \"Yiddish\" music, although it is also sometimes called ''Freilech music'' (Yiddish, literally \"Happy music\"). The first recordings to use the term \"klezmer\" to refer to the music were [[The Klezmorim]]'s ''East Side Wedding'' and ''Streets of Gold'' in 1977/78, followed by Andy Statman and Zev Feldman's ''Jewish Klezmer Music'' in 1979.\n\n==Style==\nKlezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies, reminiscent of the human voice, complete with laughing and weeping. This is not a coincidence; the style is meant to imitate [[khazone]] and [[paraliturgical]] singing. A number of ''[[dreydlekh]]'' (a Yiddish word for [[Ornament (music)|musical ornaments]]), such as [[krekhts]] (\"sobs\") are used to produce this style.\n\nVarious musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music. Perhaps the strongest and most enduring is [[Romanian people|Romanian]] music. Klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional Romanian music, which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire (e.g., [[Hora (dance)|Horas]], [[Doina]]s, [[Sirba]]s, and [[Bulgar (music)|Bulgars]])\n\n==History==\n[[File:KLEZPO.png|thumb|right|Klezmer musicians at a wedding, Ukraine, ca. 1925]]\nThe [[Bible]] has several descriptions of orchestras and [[Levites]] making music, but after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 [[Common Era|CE]], many [[Rabbi]]s discouraged musical instruments. However, the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished, and musicians came forth to fill that niche, klezmorim. The first klezmer known by name was Yakobius ben Yakobius, a player of the [[aulos]] in [[Samaria]] in the 2nd century CE. The earliest written record of the klezmorim is in the 15th century. It is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century [[Bessarabia]], where the bulk of today's traditional repertoire was written.\n\nKlezmorim based much of their [[secular]] instrumental music upon the [[Devotional song|devotional]] vocal music of the [[synagogue]], in particular [[Hazzan|cantorial]] music. Even so, klezmorim\u2014along with other entertainers\u2014were typically looked down on by Rabbis because of their secular traveling lifestyle. Klezmorim often travelled and played with [[Romani people|Romani]] musicians (\"l\u0103utari\"), because they occupied similar social strata. They had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically (the extensive klezmer argot in Yiddish includes some Romani borrowings).\n\n[[File:Mjg crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Josef Gusikov]]]]\n\nKlezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire, but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer. They sometimes played for Christian churches and local aristocracy, and taught some Italian classical violin virtuosos.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nLike other professional musicians, klezmorim were often limited by authorities. In Ukraine they were banned from playing loud instruments, until the 19th century. Hence musicians took up the [[violin]], [[tsimbl]] (or [[cymbalom]]), and other stringed instruments. The first musician to play klezmer in European concerts, [[Josef Gusikov]], played a type of [[xylophone]] which he invented and called a \"wood and straw instrument\". It was laid out like a cymbalom, and attracted comments from [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (highly favourable) and [[Liszt]] (condemnatory). Later, around 1855 under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia]], Ukraine permitted loud instruments. The [[clarinet]] started to replace the violin as the instrument of choice. Also, a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands.\n\nAs Jews left Eastern Europe and the [[shtetl]]s (see a related article about the artist [[Chaim Goldberg]], who depicted klezmer performers of the [[shtetl]] in his paintings), klezmer spread throughout the globe, to the United States as well as to Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. Initially, the klezmer tradition was not maintained much by U.S. Jews. In the 1920s, clarinetists [[Dave Tarras]] and [[Naftule Brandwein]] caused a brief, influential revival, but [[Hankus Netsky]] has noted that \"few of the performers of this era actually referred to themselves as klezmorim, and the term is found nowhere in any Jewish instrumental recording of the time.\"<ref>American Klezmer p.16-17</ref> (The soprano [[Isa Kremer]] was a popular exponent of Yiddish song internationally during the first half of the 20th century; notably making several recordings with [[Columbia Records]] and appearing often at [[Carnegie Hall]] and other major venues in the U.S. from 1922-1950.)<ref name=\"JWA\">{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/kremer-isa|title=Isa Kremer|author=Lois Barr|work=[[Jewish Women's Archive]]}}</ref> As U.S. Jews began to adopt mainstream culture, the popularity of klezmer waned, and Jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-Jewish music.\n\nWhile traditional performances may have been on the decline, many Jewish composers who had mainstream success, such as [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Aaron Copland]], continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth (as [[Gustav Mahler]] had been). [[George Gershwin]] was familiar with klezmer music, and the opening clarinet glissando of [[Rhapsody in Blue]] suggests this influence, although the composer did not compose klezmer directly.<ref name=\"Rogovoy 2000 p. 71\">{{cite book | last=Rogovoy | first=S. | title=The Essential Klezmer | publisher=Algonquin Books | year=2000 | isbn=978-1-56512-863-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT86oo5_99kC&pg=PA71 | accessdate=May 1, 2017 | page=71}}</ref> Some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Artie Shaw]] can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer, as can the \"freilach swing\" playing of other Jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter [[Ziggy Elman]].\n\nAt the same time, non-Jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material. [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in particular admired klezmer music for embracing both the ecstasy and the despair of human life, and quoted several melodies in his [[chamber music|chamber]] masterpieces, the [[Piano Quintet (Shostakovich)|Piano Quintet in G minor, op. 57]] (1940), the [[Piano Trio No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Piano Trio No. 2 in E minor, op. 67]] (1944), and the [[String Quartet No. 8 (Shostakovich)|String Quartet No. 8 in C minor, op. 110]] (1960).\n\n[[File:KlezmaticsBigPhoto1 72dpi.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Klezmatics]], an American klezmer band]]\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the United States and Europe, led by [[Giora Feidman]], [[The Klezmorim]], [[Zev Feldman]], [[Andy Statman]], and the [[Klezmer Conservatory Band]]. They drew their repertoire from recordings and surviving musicians of U.S. klezmer. In 1985, [[Henry Sapoznik]] and Adrienne Cooper founded [[KlezKamp]] to teach klezmer and other Yiddish music.\n\nThe 1980s saw a second wave of revival, as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments, largely with non-Jews of the United States and Germany. Musicians began to track down older European klezmer, by listening to recordings, finding transcriptions, and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in Eastern Europe. Key performers in this style are [[Joel Rubin]], [[Budowitz]], Khevrisa, Di Naye Kapelye, Yale Strom, The Chicago Klezmer Ensemble, The Maxwell Street Klezmer Band, the violinists [[Alicia Svigals]], [[Steven Greenman]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevengreenman.com|title=Steven Greenman|work=stevengreenman.com|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> [[Cookie Segelstein]] and [[Elie Rosenblatt]], flutist [[Adrianne Greenbaum]], and [[tsimbl]] player [[Pete Rushefsky]]. Other artists like Yale Strom used their first-hand field research and recordings from as early as 1981 in Central and Eastern Europe as a foundation for more of a fusion between traditional repertoire and original compositions, as well as incorporating the Rom (Roma) music element into the Jewish style. Bands like Brave Old World, Hot Pstromi and The Klezmatics also emerged during this period.\n\n[[File:Klezmer musicians in Jerusalem 2013-11-20 01-12.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Klezmer musicians in [[Jerusalem]]]]\nIn the 1990s, musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory. Clarinetist Ben Goldberg and drummer Kenny Wollesen, after playing in Bay Area-based [[The Klezmorim]], formed the critically acclaimed New Klezmer Trio\u2014kicking open the door for radical experiments with Ashkenazi music and paving the way for [[John Zorn]]'s Masada, Naftule's Dream, Don Byron's Mickey Katz project and violinist [[Daniel Hoffman (violinist)|Daniel Hoffman's]] klezmer/jazz/Middle-Eastern fusion band Davka. The New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars [http://www.klezmers.com] also formed in 1991 with a mixture of New Orleans funk, jazz, and klezmer styles.\n\nInterest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known [[avant-garde]] [[jazz]] musicians as John Zorn and [[Don Byron]], who sometimes blend klezmer with [[jazz]]. Klezmer melodies have recently been incorporated into songs by third-wave [[Ska]] band [[Streetlight Manifesto]]. Singer/songwriter [[Tomas Kalnoky]] frequently slips in horn licks with Russian and Jewish origins.\n\n[[File:\u05e0\u05d2\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4. \u05e6\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd- Loulou d'Aki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Jerusalem Klezmer Association with Ultra Orthodox Jewish musicians are playing Klezmer music]]\n[[Mames Babegenush]] was formed in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, in 2004 out of strong Scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer, influenced on the klezmer side by masters like [[Naftule Brandwein]], [[Abe Schwartz]] and [[Dave Tarras]].

They wanted to explore klezmer and [[L\u0103utari|lautari]] roots, and fuse the music of the two \"other European\" groups. The resulting band now performs internationally.  As with this ensemble, groups like Di Naye Kapelye and Yale Strom & [[Hot Pstromi]] have incorporated [[Romani people|Rom]] musicians and elements since their inceptions.\n\nA separate klezmer tradition had developed in Israel in the 20th century. Clarinetists Moshe Berlin and Avrum Leib Burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in Israel. In order to preserve and promote klezmer music in Israel, Burstein founded the [[Jerusalem Klezmer Association]], which has become a center for learning and performance of Klezmer music in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalemklezmer.org|title=The Jerusalem Klezmer Association|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Repertoire==\nAccording to [[Walter Zev Feldman]], the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of [[Pale of Settlement|Jewish settlement]] in the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>\"Bulgareasca/Bulgarish/Bulgar: The Transformation of a Klezmer Dance Genre\" by Walter Zev Feldman in ''American Klezmer'' p.84</ref> Much of the traditional klezmer repertoire was created by professional klezmer musicians in the style of their region or tradition, and much co-territorial music such as non-Jewish folksongs, especially [[Romanian music]] (mainly from [[Moldavia]]), as well as [[Ukrainian music]] and [[Ottoman music]], and the musics of other minorities living in the same areas as Jews in Southeastern Europe such as [[Crimean Tatars]].\n\nHistorically, young klezmorim learned tunes from their family and their elders in bands. However, there were several times in history where this transmission broke down, including mass emigration, but especially the [[Holocaust]], which destroyed most of Jewish life and culture in Europe. Few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in Europe, one notable exception being Leopold Kozlowski of Poland.\n\nUndoubtedly, much has been lost of the repertoires played in various locations and social contexts\u2014especially wedding repertoire, since although [[Jewish wedding]]s could last several days, early recording technology could only capture a few minutes at a time.  Also, recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region. A few older klezmorim\u2014such as [[Leon Schwartz]], [[Dave Tarras]], and [[German Goldenshtayn]]\u2014survived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire. Also, some transcriptions survive from the 19th century. Some ethnomusicological work from Jewish Eastern Europe is still available in print, notably the work of [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jewish]] field researcher [[Moshe Beregovski]].\n\nIn the 21st century, klezmer is typically learned from \"[[fake book]]s\" and [[transcription (music)|transcriptions]] of old recordings, although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear.\n\n==Song types==\nMost klezmer pieces are for dancing to, from fast to slow tempo:\n* [[Freylekhs]] (also Bulgar, bulgarish&nbsp;\u2013 literally \"Bulgarian\", [[volekhl]]/[[vulekhl]]&nbsp;\u2013 literally \"Wallachian\", or \"Romanian\") is an {{music|time|8|8}} (divided [[Time signature|{{music|time|3+3+2|8}}]]) circle dance, usually in the [[Phrygian dominant scale|Ahava Rabboh]] melodic mode. Typically piano, accordion, or bass plays a duple oompah beat. These are by far the most popular klezmer dances. The name \"Bulgar\" (Yiddish \"bulgarish\") comes from the Romanian traditional song and dance ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''bulgareasc\u0103''). \"Freylekh\" is the Yiddish word for \"festive.\"\n* [[Sher (dance)|Sher]] is a [[set dance]] in {{music|time|2|4}}. It is one of the most common klezmer dances. Its name comes from the straight-legged, quick movements of the legs, reminiscent of the shears (Yiddish: ''sher'') of tailors.\n* [[Khosidl]], or [[khusidl]], named after the [[Hasidic]] Jews who danced it, is a more dignified embellished dance in {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}. The dance steps can be performed in a circle or in a line.\n* [[Hora (dance)|Hora]] or [[zhok]] is a [[Romanians|Romanian]]-style dance in a hobbling {{music|time|3|8}} time with beats on 1 and 3, and is even more embellished. The [[Culture of Israel|Israeli]] hora derives its roots from the Romanian hora. The Yiddish name ''zhok'' comes from the Romanian term ''joc'' (literally \"dance\")\n* [[kolomyjka|Kolomeike]] is a fast and catchy dance in {{music|time|2|4}} time, which originated in Ukraine, and is prominent in the folk music of that country.\n* ''Terkish'' is a {{music|time|4|4}} dance like the [[Habanera (music)|habanera]]. ''Terk in America'' is one famous arrangement by [[Naftule Brandwein]], who used this form extensively. As its name indicates, it recalls Turkish styles.\n* ''Skotshne'' (\"hopping\") could be an instrumental display piece, but also a dance piece, like a more elaborate freylekhs.\n* [[Nigun]] means \"[[melody]]\" in both [[Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a mid-paced song in {{music|time|2|4}}.\n* [[Waltz]]es were very popular, whether classical, Russian, or Polish. A ''padespan'' was a sort of Russian/Spanish waltz known to klezmers.\n* [[Mazurka]] and [[polka]], Polish and Czech dances, respectively, were often played for both Jews and Gentiles.\n* [[Sirba]]&nbsp;\u2013 a Romanian dance in {{music|time|2|2}} or {{music|time|2|4}} (Romanian ''[[s\u00e2rb\u0103]]''). It features hopping steps and short bursts of running, accompanied by triplets in the [[melody]].\n* [[Humoresque]] \"Halaka\" dance, a traditional Israeli dance from [[Safed]] in [[Galilee]]; it has an ancient melody handed down from generation to generation.\n* [[Tango (dance)|Tango]]&nbsp;\u2013 well-known dance that originated in Argentina. These were extremely popular around the world in the 1930s, and many Eastern European tangos were originally written by Jews.\n\nTypes not designed for dance are:\n* [[Doina]] is an improvisational lament usually performed solo, and is extremely important in weddings. Its basis is the Romanian shepherd's lament, so it has an expressive vocal quality, like the singing of the [[khazn]]. Although it has no form, it is not just random sounds in a Jewish [[Musical mode|mode]]\u2014the musician works with very particular references to Jewish prayer and East European laments. Often these references might occur in the form of harmonic movements or modal maneuvers that quote or otherwise invoke traditional Jewish cantorial practices. Typically it is performed on violin, cymbalom or clarinet, though it has been done on [[banjo]], [[xylophone]], [[flute]], [[cornet]], [[saxophone]], [[tuba]], and many other instruments. Often the doina is the first of a three-part set, followed by a [[Hora (dance)|hora]], then either a [[freylekhs]] or [[khusidl]]. One can even hear recordings of contemporary vocalists singing the doina, including Michael Alpert and Elizabeth Schwartz.\n* [[Taqsim|Taksim]] is a freeform prelude that introduces the motifs of the following piece, which is usually a freylekhs; it was largely supplanted by the doina.\n* [[Fantazi]] or fantasy is a freeform song, traditionally played at Jewish weddings to the guests as they dined. It resembles the [[fantasia (music)|fantasia]] of \"light\" classical music.\n\n==Song structure==\nMost klezmer tunes are in several sections, sometimes with each in a different [[key (music)|key]]. Many songs have alternating sections with [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] keys. Klezmer music often uses \"folk [[Scale (music)|scales]],\" or scales commonly found in folk music, such as the [[Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor]] and [[Phrygian dominant scale|phrygian dominant]]. Instrumental tunes often follow the types of [[chord progression]]s found in Middle Eastern and Greek music, whereas vocal [[Yiddish]] songs are often much simpler, and follow a style and chord progressions similar to Russian folk songs.\n\nFreylekhs are often in the form ABCB, which is rare in music.  Having a third distinct section is a relatively unique aspect of klezmer music.\n\nA common ending for songs is an upwards [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] run or [[glissando]], followed by a slow [[staccato]] 8-5-1.  They may also end with a Coda, a new melodic line that is accompanied by a change in the percussion rhythm and an increase in tempo.\n\n==Orchestration==\n[[File:Jewish musicians of Rohatyn (west Ukraine).jpg|thumb|right|Klezmorim in [[Rohatyn]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 1912]]\n\nKlezmer is generally instrumental, although at weddings klezmorim traditionally accompanied the vocal stylings of the ''badkhn'' (wedding entertainer). A typical 19th-century European orchestra included a first [[violin]], a contra-violin (or modified 3-stringed [[viola]] also called Groyse Fidl [Yid. Big Fiddle], Sekund, Kontra or Zsid\u00f3 Bratsch [Hun.]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budowitz.com/ |title=Budowitz Homepage |website=Budowitz.com |accessdate=2016-01-19}}</ref> a [[tsimbl]] ([[cimbalom]] or [[hammered dulcimer]]), a [[double bass|bass]] or [[cello]], and sometimes a [[flute]]. Other instruments such as a [[piano]] or an [[accordion]] are used too. The melody is generally assigned to the lead violin, while the other instrumentalists provide harmony, rhythm, and some counterpoint (the latter usually coming from the second violin or viola). The inclusion of Jews in tsarist army bands during the 19th century led to the introduction of typical military band instruments into klezmer.  The [[clarinet]] now often played the melody. Brass instruments\u2014such as the French valved [[cornet]] and keyed German [[trumpet]]\u2014eventually inherited a counter-voice role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://borzykowski.users.ch/EnglMCKlezmer.htm|title=KLEZMER MUSIC|publisher=users.ch|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Modern klezmer instrumentation is more commonly influenced by the instruments of the 19th century military bands than the earlier orchestras. The orchestration used by [[Joel Rubin]]\u2014one of the most experienced and knowledgeable contemporary klezmer musicians\u2014represents a historically justified link with that of contemporary ethnic music ensembles of Romania and Hungary.<ref>Tobias Shklover, A talk with the master-musician [[Joel Rubin]] (in [[Yiddish]]). ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward|Forverts]]'', No. 31 (387) of the 5th of April, 2002</ref>\n\nPercussion in early 20th-century klezmer recordings was generally minimal\u2014no more than a [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]] or [[snare drum]]. The snare drum is the more \"authentic\" of the two. Wood blocks were introduced by modern klezmorim to imitate recordings from the early 20th century that replaced snare drums\u2014which tended to overwhelm the recording equipment of the time\u2014with quieter instruments. In Eastern Europe, percussion was often provided by a drummer who played a [[frame drum]], or ''poyk'', sometimes called [[baraban (drum)|baraban]]. A poyk is similar to a [[bass drum]] and often has a cymbal or piece of metal mounted on top, which is struck by a beater or a small cymbal strapped to the hand. In Bulgaria, Serbia, and Macedonia, sometimes the ''paykler'' (drummer) also played in the ''tapan'' style, i.e., with a switch in one hand on a thin tight head, and a mallet in the other, on a thicker, looser head.\n\n[[File:Amsterdam Klezmer Band Koeln 2008-2 crop.jpg|thumb|left|The Amsterdam Klezmer Band performing in [[Cologne, Germany]]]]\n\nSome klezmer revival bands look to loud-instrument klezmer, [[jazz]], and [[Dixieland]] for inspiration. Their bands are similar to a typical jazz band, with some differences. They use a [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], or [[trumpet]] for the melody, and make great use of the [[trombone]] for slides and other flourishes. When a cymbalom sound is called for, a [[piano]] may be played. There is usually a [[brass instrument]] ensemble, and sometimes a tuba substitutes for [[double bass|bass]]. Performers in this style include The Klezmorim, The Klezmatics, The [[Klezmer Conservatory Band]], and The [[Maxwell Street Klezmer Band]]. Other bands look back to different eras or regions in an effort to recreate specific styles of klezmer\u2014for example, [[Budowitz]], the Chicago Klezmer Band, Veretski Pass, Di Naye Kapelye, and the Hungarian band [[Muzsikas]] with its album ''Maramoros: the Lost Jewish Music of Transylvania''.\n\n[[File:KDV93KlezmerAllStars.jpg|thumb|\"New Orleans Klezmer All Stars\" band in the [[Krewe du Vieux]] parade]]\n\nKlezmer instrument choices were traditionally based, by necessity, on an instrument's portability. Music being required for several parts of the wedding ceremony, taking place in different rooms or courtyards, the band had to relocate quickly from space to space. Further, klezmorim were usually itinerant musicians, who moved from town to town for work. Therefore, instruments held in the hands (clarinet, violin, trumpet, flute) or supported by a neck or shoulder strap (accordion, cimbalom, drum) were favored over those that rested on the ground (cello, bass violin), or needed several people to move (piano).\n\nIn America, this trend has continued into the present day, with hand-held or strap-held instruments like guitars, saxophones, and even harmonicas integrated into klezmer ensembles. For example, the typical American klezmer wedding band uses a portable electronic synthesizer, not a piano.\n\nThe compositions of Israeli-born composer [[Ofer Ben-Amots]] incorporate aspects of klezmer music, most notably his 2006 composition ''Klezmer Concerto''. The piece is for klezmer clarinet (written for Jewish clarinetist [[David Krakauer]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernsarts.com/dkorchestra/dkorchestra-ben-amots.html|title=Ofer Ben-Amots: The Klezmer Concerto|author=<!--Staff writer; no by-line.-->|date=2006|publisher=Bernstein Artists, Inc.|accessdate=6 June 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606222154/http://www.bernsarts.com/dkorchestra/dkorchestra-ben-amots.html|archivedate=6 June 2014}}</ref> string orchestra, harp and percussion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ben-Amots|first=Ofer|date=2006|title=Klezmer Concerto|location=Colorado Springs|publisher=The Composer's Own Press |isbn=978-1-939382-07-8}}</ref>\n\n==Time==\nIn its historic form, klezmer was live music designed to facilitate dancing. Hence, musicians adjusted the tempo as dancers tired or better dancers joined in. Tunes could drag to a near-halt during a particularly sad part, picking up slowly, and eventually bursting into happy song again. (This is also a feature of many [[Romani people|Rom]] and Russian folk songs.)\n\nLike other musicians of their time, and many modern                                                                                                               [[jazz]] performers, early klezmorim did not rigidly follow the beat. Often they slightly led or trailed it, giving a lilting sound.\n\n==Melodic modes==\n{{Further information|Jewish Prayer Modes}}\nKlezmer is usually played in [[shteygerim]], prayer modes of the [[synagogue]]. They are closely related to Greek, Turkish, and other \"co-territorial\" modes of Southeastern and Central Europe. The following are the names of these modes; the names are taken from the names of familiar prayers that use that mode (imagine an American composer referring to a piece as \"a Grand Old Flag\" instead of as \"a march\").\n\n===Ahava Rabboh/Freygish===\n[[Ahavo Rabboh]] means \"Abounding Love\" in Hebrew, and refers to a prayer from the [[Jewish services|daily morning prayer]] service (''shacharis''). It is built on the 5th degree of the harmonic minor scale, with a [[descending tetrachord]] to the tonic being the most characteristic final cadence. It is also called the \"[[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish]]\", a [[Yiddish]] term derived from the German \"Phrygisch\", or [[Phrygian mode]] (specifically, the [[Phrygian dominant scale]]). It is considered the mode of supplication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klezmershack.com/articles/horowitz/horowitz.klezmodes.html|title=The Main Klezmer Modes|date=24 July 1999|work=klezmershack.com|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Conversely, it can be thought of as a natural minor scale with lowered 2nd, and augmented 3rd degrees. It is similar to the Arabic [[Hijaz]] [[Arabic maqam|maqam]]. Much of klezmer music uses the Ahavah Rabboh scale (such as Nigun Rikud, Tish Nigun and numerous freylekhs), although Mi Sheberach is prevalent as well.\n\n===Mi Shebeirach===\n[[Mi Shebeirach]] means \"He who blessed\" in Hebrew, from the ''Mi Shebeirach'' prayer, recited after the honor of being called to the Torah reading. It is also called the ''Ukrainian'', ''Altered Ukrainian'', ''Doina'', or ''Altered [[Dorian mode|Dorian]]''. It is similar to the natural minor scale, but has raised fourth and sixth scale degrees, and is used often for the [[doina]] or dance pieces, like the ''Odessa Bulgar''. When used in combination with the Ahavoh Rabboh scale in the same piece (as in Mayn Shtetl Yas), the Mi Shebeirach section is usually a whole tone below the Ahavoh Rabboh scale (for example, D Ahavoh Rabboh changes to C Mi Shebeirach or vice versa).\n\n===Adoyn-y Moloch===\n[[Adoyn-y Moloch]] means \"my Lord reigns\" in Hebrew. It is common in traditional [[synagogue]] services (they are the beginning words of many of the [[Psalms]]). It is similar to the Western [[Mixolydian]] mode and can be thought of as a major scale with a lowered 7th, which is sometimes raised at cadences, but is generally avoided altogether.\n\n===Mogen Ovoys===\n[[Mogen Ovoys]] means \"our forebears' shield\" in Hebrew. It is an older mode from the [[synagogue]], derived from the [[Shabbos|Friday night prayers]]. It is similar to the Western melodic [[minor scale]].\n\n===Yishtabach===\n[[Yishtabach]] means \"it shall become superb\" in Hebrew (from the daily morning services). It has a frequent lowering of the 2nd and 5th. It is related to ''Mogein Ovoys'', above.\n\n==Published CD-ROMs==\n* ''yiddish songs (traditionals 1911 bis 1950)'', 4 CDs, Membran Music Ltd., Vertrieb: Grosser und Stein, Pforzheim 2004, {{ISBN|978-3-937730-94-3}}.\n\n==Film==\n* ''[[Yidl Mitn Fidl]]'' (1936), directed by [[Joseph Green (actor)|Joseph Green]]\n* ''[[Oliver!]]'' (1968), [[Fagin]]'s songs \"[[You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two]]\" and \"I'm Reviewing the Situation\" are in the Klezmer style, to present him as a Jewish character without creating offence\n* ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1971), directed by [[Norman Jewison]]\n* ''[[The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob|Les Aventures de Rabbi Jacob]]'' (1973), directed by [[G\u00e9rard Oury]]\n* ''Jewish Soul Music: The Art of Giora Feidman'' (1980), directed by [[Uri Barbash]]\n* [[Yentl (film)|''Yentl'']] (1983), directed by [[Barbra Streisand]]\n* ''A Jumpin' Night in the Garden of Eden'' (1988), directed by Michal Goldman\n* ''Fiddlers on the Hoof'' (1989), directed by Simon Broughton\n* ''The Last Klezmer: Leopold Kozlowski: His Life and Music'' (1994), directed by [[Yale Strom]]\n* [[Beyond Silence (1996 film)|''Beyond Silence'']] (1996), about a Klzemer playing clarinettist, directed by [[Charlotte Link]]\n* ''A Tickle in the Heart'' (1996), directed by Stefan Schwietert<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rubin-ottens.com/p7.html |title=A Tickle in the Heart |first=Joel |last=Rubin |first2=Rita |last2=Ottens |date=15 May 2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404114534/http://www.rubin-ottens.com/p7.html |archive-date=2009-04-04}}</ref>\n* ''Itzhak Perlman: In the Fiddler's House'' (1996), aired 29 June 1996 on Great Performances (PBS/WNET television series)\n* [[Man Is a Woman|''L'homme est une femme comme les autres'']] (1998, directed by Jean-Jacques Zilbermann)\n* [[Dummy (2002 film)|''Dummy'']] (2002), directed by [[Greg Pritikin]]\n* ''Klezmer on Fish Street'' (2003), directed by Yale Strom\n* ''Le Tango des Rashevski'' (2003) directed by [[Sam Garbarski]]\n* ''Klezmer in Germany'' (2007), directed by [[Kryzstof Zanussi]] and C.

Played by professional musicians called ''klezmorim'' in ensembles known as ''kapelye'', the genre originally consisted largely of dance tunes and instrumental display pieces for weddings and other celebrations. In the United States the genre evolved considerably as [[Yiddish]]-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, who arrived between 1880 and 1924,<ref>Hankus Netsky, \"American Klezmer: A Brief History\" from ''American Klezmer: Its Roots and Offshoots'' Ed. Mark Slobin, p.13</ref> came into contact with American jazz. During the initial years after the klezmer revival of the 1970s, the American sub-variety was what most people knew as klezmer, although in the 21st century musicians began paying more attention to the original pre-jazz traditions as revivalists including Josh Horowitz, [[Yale Strom]] and Bob Cohen have spent years doing field research in Eastern/Central Europe. Additionally, later immigrants from the [[Soviet Union]], such as German Goldenshtayn, took their surviving repertoires to the United States and Israel in the 1980s.\n\nCompared with most other European folk-music styles, little is known about the history of klezmer music, and much of what is said about it remains uncertain. There is, however, a heavy influence of Romani music, since many Jews and Roma lived side by side in Europe.<ref>Mark Slobin, ''Fiddler on the Move''. p.93.</ref>\n\n\nPopular musician Leonard Cohen, composed many songs which had quite a following where the Klezmer style was evident.   Songs such as \u201cDance me to the end of love \u201c rely heavily on a violin but also have chord structures that feel Eastern European, Romanian, Greek or \u201cGypsy\u201d in flavor or sound.   Some aspects of these Klezmer-feeling Cohen compositions, as rendered, were surely modern in some of the instruments used, but the distinctive Jewish Klezmer feel shines through, and arguably, these numbers by Cohen are the most widely-heard examples of Klezmer music in the modern era due to Cohens prolific multi-generational appeal and status as a popular poet-songwriter-singer who was very popular on several continents in the Western World sine the 1960s until his death a few years back.     \n\n==Etymology==\n{{disputed section|date=January 2019}}\nThe term klezmer comes from a combination of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words: ''kli'', meaning \"tool, utensil or instrument\" and ''zemer'', \"melody\"; leading to ''k'li zemer'' {{Hebrew|\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05b6\u05de\u05b6\u05e8}}, literally \"vessels (instruments) of music\" or \"[[musical instrument]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nOriginally, ''klezmer'' referred to musical instruments, and was later extended to refer, as a pejorative, to musicians themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klezmershack.com/articles/aboutklez.html|title=About the Klezmer Revival |publisher=klezmershack.com |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> From the 16th to 18th centuries, it replaced older terms such as ''leyts'' (clown).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Music/Traditional_and_Instrumental_Music |title=YIVO &#124; Music: Traditional and Instrumental Music |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}</ref> It was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre. Early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as \"Yiddish\" music, although it is also sometimes called ''Freilech music'' (Yiddish, literally \"Happy music\"). The first recordings to use the term \"klezmer\" to refer to the music were [[The Klezmorim]]'s ''East Side Wedding'' and ''Streets of Gold'' in 1977/78, followed by Andy Statman and Zev Feldman's ''Jewish Klezmer Music'' in 1979.\n\n==Style==\nKlezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies, reminiscent of the human voice, complete with laughing and weeping. This is not a coincidence; the style is meant to imitate [[khazone]] and [[paraliturgical]] singing. A number of ''[[dreydlekh]]'' (a Yiddish word for [[Ornament (music)|musical ornaments]]), such as [[krekhts]] (\"sobs\") are used to produce this style.\n\nVarious musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music. Perhaps the strongest and most enduring is [[Romanian people|Romanian]] music. Klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional Romanian music, which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire (e.g., [[Hora (dance)|Horas]], [[Doina]]s, [[Sirba]]s, and [[Bulgar (music)|Bulgars]])\n\n==History==\n[[File:KLEZPO.png|thumb|right|Klezmer musicians at a wedding, Ukraine, ca. 1925]]\nThe [[Bible]] has several descriptions of orchestras and [[Levites]] making music, but after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 [[Common Era|CE]], many [[Rabbi]]s discouraged musical instruments. However, the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished, and musicians came forth to fill that niche, klezmorim. The first klezmer known by name was Yakobius ben Yakobius, a player of the [[aulos]] in [[Samaria]] in the 2nd century CE. The earliest written record of the klezmorim is in the 15th century. It is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century [[Bessarabia]], where the bulk of today's traditional repertoire was written.\n\nKlezmorim based much of their [[secular]] instrumental music upon the [[Devotional song|devotional]] vocal music of the [[synagogue]], in particular [[Hazzan|cantorial]] music. Even so, klezmorim\u2014along with other entertainers\u2014were typically looked down on by Rabbis because of their secular traveling lifestyle. Klezmorim often travelled and played with [[Romani people|Romani]] musicians (\"l\u0103utari\"), because they occupied similar social strata. They had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically (the extensive klezmer argot in Yiddish includes some Romani borrowings).\n\n[[File:Mjg crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Josef Gusikov]]]]\n\nKlezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire, but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer. They sometimes played for Christian churches and local aristocracy, and taught some Italian classical violin virtuosos.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nLike other professional musicians, klezmorim were often limited by authorities. In Ukraine they were banned from playing loud instruments, until the 19th century. Hence musicians took up the [[violin]], [[tsimbl]] (or [[cymbalom]]), and other stringed instruments. The first musician to play klezmer in European concerts, [[Josef Gusikov]], played a type of [[xylophone]] which he invented and called a \"wood and straw instrument\". It was laid out like a cymbalom, and attracted comments from [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (highly favourable) and [[Liszt]] (condemnatory). Later, around 1855 under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia]], Ukraine permitted loud instruments. The [[clarinet]] started to replace the violin as the instrument of choice. Also, a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands.\n\nAs Jews left Eastern Europe and the [[shtetl]]s (see a related article about the artist [[Chaim Goldberg]], who depicted klezmer performers of the [[shtetl]] in his paintings), klezmer spread throughout the globe, to the United States as well as to Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. Initially, the klezmer tradition was not maintained much by U.S. Jews. In the 1920s, clarinetists [[Dave Tarras]] and [[Naftule Brandwein]] caused a brief, influential revival, but [[Hankus Netsky]] has noted that \"few of the performers of this era actually referred to themselves as klezmorim, and the term is found nowhere in any Jewish instrumental recording of the time.\"<ref>American Klezmer p.16-17</ref> (The soprano [[Isa Kremer]] was a popular exponent of Yiddish song internationally during the first half of the 20th century; notably making several recordings with [[Columbia Records]] and appearing often at [[Carnegie Hall]] and other major venues in the U.S. from 1922-1950.)<ref name=\"JWA\">{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/kremer-isa|title=Isa Kremer|author=Lois Barr|work=[[Jewish Women's Archive]]}}</ref> As U.S. Jews began to adopt mainstream culture, the popularity of klezmer waned, and Jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-Jewish music.\n\nWhile traditional performances may have been on the decline, many Jewish composers who had mainstream success, such as [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Aaron Copland]], continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth (as [[Gustav Mahler]] had been). [[George Gershwin]] was familiar with klezmer music, and the opening clarinet glissando of [[Rhapsody in Blue]] suggests this influence, although the composer did not compose klezmer directly.<ref name=\"Rogovoy 2000 p. 71\">{{cite book | last=Rogovoy | first=S. | title=The Essential Klezmer | publisher=Algonquin Books | year=2000 | isbn=978-1-56512-863-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT86oo5_99kC&pg=PA71 | accessdate=May 1, 2017 | page=71}}</ref> Some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Artie Shaw]] can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer, as can the \"freilach swing\" playing of other Jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter [[Ziggy Elman]].\n\nAt the same time, non-Jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material. [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in particular admired klezmer music for embracing both the ecstasy and the despair of human life, and quoted several melodies in his [[chamber music|chamber]] masterpieces, the [[Piano Quintet (Shostakovich)|Piano Quintet in G minor, op. 57]] (1940), the [[Piano Trio No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Piano Trio No. 2 in E minor, op. 67]] (1944), and the [[String Quartet No. 8 (Shostakovich)|String Quartet No. 8 in C minor, op. 110]] (1960).\n\n[[File:KlezmaticsBigPhoto1 72dpi.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Klezmatics]], an American klezmer band]]\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the United States and Europe, led by [[Giora Feidman]], [[The Klezmorim]], [[Zev Feldman]], [[Andy Statman]], and the [[Klezmer Conservatory Band]]. They drew their repertoire from recordings and surviving musicians of U.S. klezmer. In 1985, [[Henry Sapoznik]] and Adrienne Cooper founded [[KlezKamp]] to teach klezmer and other Yiddish music.\n\nThe 1980s saw a second wave of revival, as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments, largely with non-Jews of the United States and Germany. Musicians began to track down older European klezmer, by listening to recordings, finding transcriptions, and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in Eastern Europe. Key performers in this style are [[Joel Rubin]], [[Budowitz]], Khevrisa, Di Naye Kapelye, Yale Strom, The Chicago Klezmer Ensemble, The Maxwell Street Klezmer Band, the violinists [[Alicia Svigals]], [[Steven Greenman]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevengreenman.com|title=Steven Greenman|work=stevengreenman.com|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> [[Cookie Segelstein]] and [[Elie Rosenblatt]], flutist [[Adrianne Greenbaum]], and [[tsimbl]] player [[Pete Rushefsky]]. Other artists like Yale Strom used their first-hand field research and recordings from as early as 1981 in Central and Eastern Europe as a foundation for more of a fusion between traditional repertoire and original compositions, as well as incorporating the Rom (Roma) music element into the Jewish style. Bands like Brave Old World, Hot Pstromi and The Klezmatics also emerged during this period.\n\n[[File:Klezmer musicians in Jerusalem 2013-11-20 01-12.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Klezmer musicians in [[Jerusalem]]]]\nIn the 1990s, musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory. Clarinetist Ben Goldberg and drummer Kenny Wollesen, after playing in Bay Area-based [[The Klezmorim]], formed the critically acclaimed New Klezmer Trio\u2014kicking open the door for radical experiments with Ashkenazi music and paving the way for [[John Zorn]]'s Masada, Naftule's Dream, Don Byron's Mickey Katz project and violinist [[Daniel Hoffman (violinist)|Daniel Hoffman's]] klezmer/jazz/Middle-Eastern fusion band Davka. The New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars [http://www.klezmers.com] also formed in 1991 with a mixture of New Orleans funk, jazz, and klezmer styles.\n\nInterest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known [[avant-garde]] [[jazz]] musicians as John Zorn and [[Don Byron]], who sometimes blend klezmer with [[jazz]]. Klezmer melodies have recently been incorporated into songs by third-wave [[Ska]] band [[Streetlight Manifesto]]. Singer/songwriter [[Tomas Kalnoky]] frequently slips in horn licks with Russian and Jewish origins.\n\n[[File:\u05e0\u05d2\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4. \u05e6\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd- Loulou d'Aki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Jerusalem Klezmer Association with Ultra Orthodox Jewish musicians are playing Klezmer music]]\n[[Mames Babegenush]] was formed in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, in 2004 out of strong Scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer, influenced on the klezmer side by masters like [[Naftule Brandwein]], [[Abe Schwartz]] and [[Dave Tarras]].

They wanted to explore klezmer and [[L\u0103utari|lautari]] roots, and fuse the music of the two \"other European\" groups. The resulting band now performs internationally.  As with this ensemble, groups like Di Naye Kapelye and Yale Strom & [[Hot Pstromi]] have incorporated [[Romani people|Rom]] musicians and elements since their inceptions.\n\nA separate klezmer tradition had developed in Israel in the 20th century. Clarinetists Moshe Berlin and Avrum Leib Burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in Israel. In order to preserve and promote klezmer music in Israel, Burstein founded the [[Jerusalem Klezmer Association]], which has become a center for learning and performance of Klezmer music in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalemklezmer.org|title=The Jerusalem Klezmer Association|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Repertoire==\nAccording to [[Walter Zev Feldman]], the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of [[Pale of Settlement|Jewish settlement]] in the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>\"Bulgareasca/Bulgarish/Bulgar: The Transformation of a Klezmer Dance Genre\" by Walter Zev Feldman in ''American Klezmer'' p.84</ref> Much of the traditional klezmer repertoire was created by professional klezmer musicians in the style of their region or tradition, and much co-territorial music such as non-Jewish folksongs, especially [[Romanian music]] (mainly from [[Moldavia]]), as well as [[Ukrainian music]] and [[Ottoman music]], and the musics of other minorities living in the same areas as Jews in Southeastern Europe such as [[Crimean Tatars]].\n\nHistorically, young klezmorim learned tunes from their family and their elders in bands. However, there were several times in history where this transmission broke down, including mass emigration, but especially the [[Holocaust]], which destroyed most of Jewish life and culture in Europe. Few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in Europe, one notable exception being Leopold Kozlowski of Poland.\n\nUndoubtedly, much has been lost of the repertoires played in various locations and social contexts\u2014especially wedding repertoire, since although [[Jewish wedding]]s could last several days, early recording technology could only capture a few minutes at a time.  Also, recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region. A few older klezmorim\u2014such as [[Leon Schwartz]], [[Dave Tarras]], and [[German Goldenshtayn]]\u2014survived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire. Also, some transcriptions survive from the 19th century. Some ethnomusicological work from Jewish Eastern Europe is still available in print, notably the work of [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jewish]] field researcher [[Moshe Beregovski]].\n\nIn the 21st century, klezmer is typically learned from \"[[fake book]]s\" and [[transcription (music)|transcriptions]] of old recordings, although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear.\n\n==Song types==\nMost klezmer pieces are for dancing to, from fast to slow tempo:\n* [[Freylekhs]] (also Bulgar, bulgarish&nbsp;\u2013 literally \"Bulgarian\", [[volekhl]]/[[vulekhl]]&nbsp;\u2013 literally \"Wallachian\", or \"Romanian\") is an {{music|time|8|8}} (divided [[Time signature|{{music|time|3+3+2|8}}]]) circle dance, usually in the [[Phrygian dominant scale|Ahava Rabboh]] melodic mode. Typically piano, accordion, or bass plays a duple oompah beat. These are by far the most popular klezmer dances. The name \"Bulgar\" (Yiddish \"bulgarish\") comes from the Romanian traditional song and dance ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''bulgareasc\u0103''). \"Freylekh\" is the Yiddish word for \"festive.\"\n* [[Sher (dance)|Sher]] is a [[set dance]] in {{music|time|2|4}}. It is one of the most common klezmer dances. Its name comes from the straight-legged, quick movements of the legs, reminiscent of the shears (Yiddish: ''sher'') of tailors.\n* [[Khosidl]], or [[khusidl]], named after the [[Hasidic]] Jews who danced it, is a more dignified embellished dance in {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}. The dance steps can be performed in a circle or in a line.\n* [[Hora (dance)|Hora]] or [[zhok]] is a [[Romanians|Romanian]]-style dance in a hobbling {{music|time|3|8}} time with beats on 1 and 3, and is even more embellished. The [[Culture of Israel|Israeli]] hora derives its roots from the Romanian hora. The Yiddish name ''zhok'' comes from the Romanian term ''joc'' (literally \"dance\")\n* [[kolomyjka|Kolomeike]] is a fast and catchy dance in {{music|time|2|4}} time, which originated in Ukraine, and is prominent in the folk music of that country.\n* ''Terkish'' is a {{music|time|4|4}} dance like the [[Habanera (music)|habanera]]. ''Terk in America'' is one famous arrangement by [[Naftule Brandwein]], who used this form extensively. As its name indicates, it recalls Turkish styles.\n* ''Skotshne'' (\"hopping\") could be an instrumental display piece, but also a dance piece, like a more elaborate freylekhs.\n* [[Nigun]] means \"[[melody]]\" in both [[Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a mid-paced song in {{music|time|2|4}}.\n* [[Waltz]]es were very popular, whether classical, Russian, or Polish. A ''padespan'' was a sort of Russian/Spanish waltz known to klezmers.\n* [[Mazurka]] and [[polka]], Polish and Czech dances, respectively, were often played for both Jews and Gentiles.\n* [[Sirba]]&nbsp;\u2013 a Romanian dance in {{music|time|2|2}} or {{music|time|2|4}} (Romanian ''[[s\u00e2rb\u0103]]''). It features hopping steps and short bursts of running, accompanied by triplets in the [[melody]].\n* [[Humoresque]] \"Halaka\" dance, a traditional Israeli dance from [[Safed]] in [[Galilee]]; it has an ancient melody handed down from generation to generation.\n* [[Tango (dance)|Tango]]&nbsp;\u2013 well-known dance that originated in Argentina. These were extremely popular around the world in the 1930s, and many Eastern European tangos were originally written by Jews.\n\nTypes not designed for dance are:\n* [[Doina]] is an improvisational lament usually performed solo, and is extremely important in weddings. Its basis is the Romanian shepherd's lament, so it has an expressive vocal quality, like the singing of the [[khazn]]. Although it has no form, it is not just random sounds in a Jewish [[Musical mode|mode]]\u2014the musician works with very particular references to Jewish prayer and East European laments. Often these references might occur in the form of harmonic movements or modal maneuvers that quote or otherwise invoke traditional Jewish cantorial practices. Typically it is performed on violin, cymbalom or clarinet, though it has been done on [[banjo]], [[xylophone]], [[flute]], [[cornet]], [[saxophone]], [[tuba]], and many other instruments. Often the doina is the first of a three-part set, followed by a [[Hora (dance)|hora]], then either a [[freylekhs]] or [[khusidl]]. One can even hear recordings of contemporary vocalists singing the doina, including Michael Alpert and Elizabeth Schwartz.\n* [[Taqsim|Taksim]] is a freeform prelude that introduces the motifs of the following piece, which is usually a freylekhs; it was largely supplanted by the doina.\n* [[Fantazi]] or fantasy is a freeform song, traditionally played at Jewish weddings to the guests as they dined. It resembles the [[fantasia (music)|fantasia]] of \"light\" classical music.\n\n==Song structure==\nMost klezmer tunes are in several sections, sometimes with each in a different [[key (music)|key]]. Many songs have alternating sections with [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] keys. Klezmer music often uses \"folk [[Scale (music)|scales]],\" or scales commonly found in folk music, such as the [[Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor]] and [[Phrygian dominant scale|phrygian dominant]]. Instrumental tunes often follow the types of [[chord progression]]s found in Middle Eastern and Greek music, whereas vocal [[Yiddish]] songs are often much simpler, and follow a style and chord progressions similar to Russian folk songs.\n\nFreylekhs are often in the form ABCB, which is rare in music.  Having a third distinct section is a relatively unique aspect of klezmer music.\n\nA common ending for songs is an upwards [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] run or [[glissando]], followed by a slow [[staccato]] 8-5-1.  They may also end with a Coda, a new melodic line that is accompanied by a change in the percussion rhythm and an increase in tempo.\n\n==Orchestration==\n[[File:Jewish musicians of Rohatyn (west Ukraine).jpg|thumb|right|Klezmorim in [[Rohatyn]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 1912]]\n\nKlezmer is generally instrumental, although at weddings klezmorim traditionally accompanied the vocal stylings of the ''badkhn'' (wedding entertainer). A typical 19th-century European orchestra included a first [[violin]], a contra-violin (or modified 3-stringed [[viola]] also called Groyse Fidl [Yid. Big Fiddle], Sekund, Kontra or Zsid\u00f3 Bratsch [Hun.]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budowitz.com/ |title=Budowitz Homepage |website=Budowitz.com |accessdate=2016-01-19}}</ref> a [[tsimbl]] ([[cimbalom]] or [[hammered dulcimer]]), a [[double bass|bass]] or [[cello]], and sometimes a [[flute]]. Other instruments such as a [[piano]] or an [[accordion]] are used too. The melody is generally assigned to the lead violin, while the other instrumentalists provide harmony, rhythm, and some counterpoint (the latter usually coming from the second violin or viola). The inclusion of Jews in tsarist army bands during the 19th century led to the introduction of typical military band instruments into klezmer.  The [[clarinet]] now often played the melody. Brass instruments\u2014such as the French valved [[cornet]] and keyed German [[trumpet]]\u2014eventually inherited a counter-voice role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://borzykowski.users.ch/EnglMCKlezmer.htm|title=KLEZMER MUSIC|publisher=users.ch|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Modern klezmer instrumentation is more commonly influenced by the instruments of the 19th century military bands than the earlier orchestras. The orchestration used by [[Joel Rubin]]\u2014one of the most experienced and knowledgeable contemporary klezmer musicians\u2014represents a historically justified link with that of contemporary ethnic music ensembles of Romania and Hungary.<ref>Tobias Shklover, A talk with the master-musician [[Joel Rubin]] (in [[Yiddish]]). ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward|Forverts]]'', No. 31 (387) of the 5th of April, 2002</ref>\n\nPercussion in early 20th-century klezmer recordings was generally minimal\u2014no more than a [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]] or [[snare drum]]. The snare drum is the more \"authentic\" of the two. Wood blocks were introduced by modern klezmorim to imitate recordings from the early 20th century that replaced snare drums\u2014which tended to overwhelm the recording equipment of the time\u2014with quieter instruments. In Eastern Europe, percussion was often provided by a drummer who played a [[frame drum]], or ''poyk'', sometimes called [[baraban (drum)|baraban]]. A poyk is similar to a [[bass drum]] and often has a cymbal or piece of metal mounted on top, which is struck by a beater or a small cymbal strapped to the hand. In Bulgaria, Serbia, and Macedonia, sometimes the ''paykler'' (drummer) also played in the ''tapan'' style, i.e., with a switch in one hand on a thin tight head, and a mallet in the other, on a thicker, looser head.\n\n[[File:Amsterdam Klezmer Band Koeln 2008-2 crop.jpg|thumb|left|The Amsterdam Klezmer Band performing in [[Cologne, Germany]]]]\n\nSome klezmer revival bands look to loud-instrument klezmer, [[jazz]], and [[Dixieland]] for inspiration. Their bands are similar to a typical jazz band, with some differences. They use a [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], or [[trumpet]] for the melody, and make great use of the [[trombone]] for slides and other flourishes. When a cymbalom sound is called for, a [[piano]] may be played. There is usually a [[brass instrument]] ensemble, and sometimes a tuba substitutes for [[double bass|bass]]. Performers in this style include The Klezmorim, The Klezmatics, The [[Klezmer Conservatory Band]], and The [[Maxwell Street Klezmer Band]]. Other bands look back to different eras or regions in an effort to recreate specific styles of klezmer\u2014for example, [[Budowitz]], the Chicago Klezmer Band, Veretski Pass, Di Naye Kapelye, and the Hungarian band [[Muzsikas]] with its album ''Maramoros: the Lost Jewish Music of Transylvania''.\n\n[[File:KDV93KlezmerAllStars.jpg|thumb|\"New Orleans Klezmer All Stars\" band in the [[Krewe du Vieux]] parade]]\n\nKlezmer instrument choices were traditionally based, by necessity, on an instrument's portability. Music being required for several parts of the wedding ceremony, taking place in different rooms or courtyards, the band had to relocate quickly from space to space. Further, klezmorim were usually itinerant musicians, who moved from town to town for work. Therefore, instruments held in the hands (clarinet, violin, trumpet, flute) or supported by a neck or shoulder strap (accordion, cimbalom, drum) were favored over those that rested on the ground (cello, bass violin), or needed several people to move (piano).\n\nIn America, this trend has continued into the present day, with hand-held or strap-held instruments like guitars, saxophones, and even harmonicas integrated into klezmer ensembles. For example, the typical American klezmer wedding band uses a portable electronic synthesizer, not a piano.\n\nThe compositions of Israeli-born composer [[Ofer Ben-Amots]] incorporate aspects of klezmer music, most notably his 2006 composition ''Klezmer Concerto''. The piece is for klezmer clarinet (written for Jewish clarinetist [[David Krakauer]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernsarts.com/dkorchestra/dkorchestra-ben-amots.html|title=Ofer Ben-Amots: The Klezmer Concerto|author=<!--Staff writer; no by-line.-->|date=2006|publisher=Bernstein Artists, Inc.|accessdate=6 June 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606222154/http://www.bernsarts.com/dkorchestra/dkorchestra-ben-amots.html|archivedate=6 June 2014}}</ref> string orchestra, harp and percussion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ben-Amots|first=Ofer|date=2006|title=Klezmer Concerto|location=Colorado Springs|publisher=The Composer's Own Press |isbn=978-1-939382-07-8}}</ref>\n\n==Time==\nIn its historic form, klezmer was live music designed to facilitate dancing. Hence, musicians adjusted the tempo as dancers tired or better dancers joined in. Tunes could drag to a near-halt during a particularly sad part, picking up slowly, and eventually bursting into happy song again. (This is also a feature of many [[Romani people|Rom]] and Russian folk songs.)\n\nLike other musicians of their time, and many modern                                                                                                               [[jazz]] performers, early klezmorim did not rigidly follow the beat. Often they slightly led or trailed it, giving a lilting sound.\n\n==Melodic modes==\n{{Further information|Jewish Prayer Modes}}\nKlezmer is usually played in [[shteygerim]], prayer modes of the [[synagogue]]. They are closely related to Greek, Turkish, and other \"co-territorial\" modes of Southeastern and Central Europe. The following are the names of these modes; the names are taken from the names of familiar prayers that use that mode (imagine an American composer referring to a piece as \"a Grand Old Flag\" instead of as \"a march\").\n\n===Ahava Rabboh/Freygish===\n[[Ahavo Rabboh]] means \"Abounding Love\" in Hebrew, and refers to a prayer from the [[Jewish services|daily morning prayer]] service (''shacharis''). It is built on the 5th degree of the harmonic minor scale, with a [[descending tetrachord]] to the tonic being the most characteristic final cadence. It is also called the \"[[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish]]\", a [[Yiddish]] term derived from the German \"Phrygisch\", or [[Phrygian mode]] (specifically, the [[Phrygian dominant scale]]). It is considered the mode of supplication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klezmershack.com/articles/horowitz/horowitz.klezmodes.html|title=The Main Klezmer Modes|date=24 July 1999|work=klezmershack.com|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Conversely, it can be thought of as a natural minor scale with lowered 2nd, and augmented 3rd degrees. It is similar to the Arabic [[Hijaz]] [[Arabic maqam|maqam]]. Much of klezmer music uses the Ahavah Rabboh scale (such as Nigun Rikud, Tish Nigun and numerous freylekhs), although Mi Sheberach is prevalent as well.\n\n===Mi Shebeirach===\n[[Mi Shebeirach]] means \"He who blessed\" in Hebrew, from the ''Mi Shebeirach'' prayer, recited after the honor of being called to the Torah reading. It is also called the ''Ukrainian'', ''Altered Ukrainian'', ''Doina'', or ''Altered [[Dorian mode|Dorian]]''. It is similar to the natural minor scale, but has raised fourth and sixth scale degrees, and is used often for the [[doina]] or dance pieces, like the ''Odessa Bulgar''. When used in combination with the Ahavoh Rabboh scale in the same piece (as in Mayn Shtetl Yas), the Mi Shebeirach section is usually a whole tone below the Ahavoh Rabboh scale (for example, D Ahavoh Rabboh changes to C Mi Shebeirach or vice versa).\n\n===Adoyn-y Moloch===\n[[Adoyn-y Moloch]] means \"my Lord reigns\" in Hebrew. It is common in traditional [[synagogue]] services (they are the beginning words of many of the [[Psalms]]). It is similar to the Western [[Mixolydian]] mode and can be thought of as a major scale with a lowered 7th, which is sometimes raised at cadences, but is generally avoided altogether.\n\n===Mogen Ovoys===\n[[Mogen Ovoys]] means \"our forebears' shield\" in Hebrew. It is an older mode from the [[synagogue]], derived from the [[Shabbos|Friday night prayers]]. It is similar to the Western melodic [[minor scale]].\n\n===Yishtabach===\n[[Yishtabach]] means \"it shall become superb\" in Hebrew (from the daily morning services). It has a frequent lowering of the 2nd and 5th. It is related to ''Mogein Ovoys'', above.\n\n==Published CD-ROMs==\n* ''yiddish songs (traditionals 1911 bis 1950)'', 4 CDs, Membran Music Ltd., Vertrieb: Grosser und Stein, Pforzheim 2004, {{ISBN|978-3-937730-94-3}}.\n\n==Film==\n* ''[[Yidl Mitn Fidl]]'' (1936), directed by [[Joseph Green (actor)|Joseph Green]]\n* ''[[Oliver!]]'' (1968), [[Fagin]]'s songs \"[[You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two]]\" and \"I'm Reviewing the Situation\" are in the Klezmer style, to present him as a Jewish character without creating offence\n* ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1971), directed by [[Norman Jewison]]\n* ''[[The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob|Les Aventures de Rabbi Jacob]]'' (1973), directed by [[G\u00e9rard Oury]]\n* ''Jewish Soul Music: The Art of Giora Feidman'' (1980), directed by [[Uri Barbash]]\n* [[Yentl (film)|''Yentl'']] (1983), directed by [[Barbra Streisand]]\n* ''A Jumpin' Night in the Garden of Eden'' (1988), directed by Michal Goldman\n* ''Fiddlers on the Hoof'' (1989), directed by Simon Broughton\n* ''The Last Klezmer: Leopold Kozlowski: His Life and Music'' (1994), directed by [[Yale Strom]]\n* [[Beyond Silence (1996 film)|''Beyond Silence'']] (1996), about a Klzemer playing clarinettist, directed by [[Charlotte Link]]\n* ''A Tickle in the Heart'' (1996), directed by Stefan Schwietert<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rubin-ottens.com/p7.html |title=A Tickle in the Heart |first=Joel |last=Rubin |first2=Rita |last2=Ottens |date=15 May 2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404114534/http://www.rubin-ottens.com/p7.html |archive-date=2009-04-04}}</ref>\n* ''Itzhak Perlman: In the Fiddler's House'' (1996), aired 29 June 1996 on Great Performances (PBS/WNET television series)\n* [[Man Is a Woman|''L'homme est une femme comme les autres'']] (1998, directed by Jean-Jacques Zilbermann)\n* [[Dummy (2002 film)|''Dummy'']] (2002), directed by [[Greg Pritikin]]\n* ''Klezmer on Fish Street'' (2003), directed by Yale Strom\n* ''Le Tango des Rashevski'' (2003) directed by [[Sam Garbarski]]\n* ''Klezmer in Germany'' (2007), directed by [[Kryzstof Zanussi]] and C.

It required that [[Charles II of England]] would convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] at some future date and that he would assist [[Louis XIV]] with 60 warships and 4,000 soldiers to help in France's war of conquest against the [[Dutch Republic]]. In exchange, Charles would secretly receive a yearly pension of \u00a3230,000, as well as an extra sum of money when Charles informed the English people of his conversion, and France would send 6,000 French troops if there was ever a rebellion against Charles in England.   The secret treaty was signed by Arlington, Arundell, Clifford and Bellings for England and Colbert de Croissy for France.

Louis was first cousin to Charles (through their grandfather [[Henry IV of France]]). Henrietta was also Louis's sister-in-law through her marriage to his only brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Phillippe, ''duc d'Orl\u00e9ans'']].<ref>David Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' (2nd ed. 1936) vol 1 p 342-44.</ref>\n\nCharles' motives for entering into secret negotiations with France while England was part of the Triple Alliance that was opposed to France have been the subject of considerable discussion. His suggested motives include a desire to have Europe's strongest state as an ally, to make himself politically and financially independent of the English parliament, to ensure that England received a share of the [[Spanish Empire]] if and when it broke up, to use Catholics, and possibly also Protestant dissenters, as a dependable group of supporters to strengthen his monarchy or, finally, to revenge himself on the Dutch and particularly its republican government. However, as Charles initially attempted to form an alliance with France in 1668 without abandoning the Triple Alliance, he was not as consistent in opposing the Dutch republican government as Louis was.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 297, 299.</ref> Ever since the signing of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], whose provisions included the marriage of Louis to [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], the eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]], and despite Maria Theresa renouncing her inheritance rights, Louis consistently manoeuvred to acquire Spanish territory adjacent to France and to promote his wife's claim to the Spanish throne.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 28, 34.</ref> Accordingly, Louis refused Charles' offer in 1668 as it did not included an agreement to join a French attack on Spain, which Charles was unwilling to concede.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 299.</ref>\n\nIn the early part of 1669, Louis attempted to gain Dutch agreement to his acquiring all or most of the Spanish Netherlands, but the Dutch themselves were anxious to prevent a French army being stationed on or near their frontiers. During the same period, Charles attempted to preserve the Triple Alliance by settling outstanding overseas trade issues with the Dutch, with little success. Charles simultaneously attempted to restart negotiations for a French alliance, but Louis repeated the condition that Britain must join him in attacking the Netherlands. Charles remained unenthusiastic, but his failure to gain the security he sought by other diplomatic means forced him to accept this precondition, subject to substantial French financial assistance. The parties entered into more detailed discussions by December 1669.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 300-302.</ref> During the five months in which detailed terms were being agreed, both parties attempted to reach understandings with Spain: their realisation that Spain might cede the Spanish Netherlands to France in a territorial exchange or act in concert with the Triple Alliance was a strong incentive for Charles and Louis respectively to reach a final agreement.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 303-304.</ref>\n\nBy the secret treaty Charles was to abandon the Triple Alliance with Sweden and the [[Dutch Republic]] in favour of assisting Louis in conquering the Dutch Republic. Provided that the conquest was successfully completed, England was promised several very profitable ports along one of the major rivers that run through the Dutch Republic.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 344-46.</ref>  The main components of the treaty can be paraphrased:\n\n{{quote |The King of England will make a public profession of the Catholic faith, and will receive the sum of two millions of crowns, to aid him in this project, from the Most Christian King, in the course of the next six months. The date of this declaration is left absolutely to his own pleasure.  The King of France will faithfully observe the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], as regards Spain, and the King of England will maintain the Treaty of the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] in a similar manner.  If new rights to the Spanish monarchy revert to the King of France, the King of England will aid him in maintaining these rights.  The two Kings will declare war against the United Provinces.  The King of France will attack them by land, and will receive the help of 6000 men from England.  The King of England will send 50 men-of-war to sea, and the King of France 30; the combined fleets will be under the [[James II of England|Duke of York]]'s command.  His Britannic Majesty will be content to receive [[Walcheren]], the mouth of the [[Scheldt]], and the isle of [[Cadzand]], as his share of the conquered provinces.

P. Kenyon, ''The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition'' (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68.</ref> Had it been published in Charles II's lifetime, the results might have been drastic; considering the enormous effect of [[Titus Oates]]' highly unreliable assertions of a [[Popish Plot]], an even greater backlash might have followed had the English public learned that the King actually obliged himself to turn Catholic and that he was willing to rely on French troops to impose that conversion on his own subjects.\n\n==The \"cover\" treaty==\nThe [[secret treaty]] was signed and sealed in June 1670.  The [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France. He was amazed by how smoothly it went.  This treaty closely followed the secret treaty just concluded, but the clause by which King Charles was to declare himself a Roman Catholic as soon as the affairs of his kingdom permitted did not appear; neither, therefore, did the stipulation that the attack on the Netherlands would follow his declaration.  This treaty was signed by all five members of the [[Cabal Ministry]] on 21 December 1670 and was made known to the public. However King Charles and the French knew it was a meaningless fake.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Royal Charles: Charles II and the Restoration'' (1979), pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 346-48.</ref><ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his kingdoms, 1660-1685'' (2006) p 71.</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nMilitary preparations took some time; Louis declared war on the Dutch on 6 April 1672, and Charles followed suit the next day. On 14 April 1672 under the Treaty of Stockholm, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising Sweden military support if it were threatened by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. This Franco-Swedish alliance completed in Louis\u2019 diplomatic encirclement of the Republic and ended the Triple Alliance.<ref>Roger Frost, ''The Northern Wars 1558\u20131721 p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] started badly for the Dutch. The French strategy was to invade the Dutch Republic along the line of the River [[Rhine]] where Dutch defences were weakest, outflanking the main defences on the Dutch border with the Spanish Netherlands. Despite warnings about French intentions, the Dutch leader [[Johan de Witt]] mistakenly thought that the war against France and England would be decided at sea, and he prioritised equipping the Dutch fleet while neglecting the eastern frontier fortresses.<ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 179-181, 185</ref> This led to significant early French successes and a near-collapse of the Dutch army, which was forced to retreat behind the inundations of [[The Dutch Water Line]] and offer peace terms that were very favourable to France. The year 1672 is known to the Dutch as the ''[[Rampjaar]]'' or 'Year of disaster': the  [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangists]] blamed de Witt who they forced to resign, and they later brutally killed  him and his brother.<ref>C. R. Boxer, ''Some Second Thoughts on the Third Anglo-Dutch War'', p 81.</ref><ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 193, 197-198, 220</ref>\n\nThe breathing space afforded by its retreat behind the inundations, followed by military reforms, recruitment of new troops and unofficial Spanish assistance, enabled the Dutch army led by William III of Orange as its Captain-General, to hold the Dutch Water Line for the rest of 1672 and 1673. Louis was now involved in a war of attrition and faced growing opposition from other European powers. Charles was short of money, as the costs of deploying the English fleet were much greater than expected despite French subsidies, and he faced increasing domestic opposition to the war.<ref>C. R. Boxer, ''Some Second Thoughts on the Third Anglo-Dutch War'', p 72.</ref> Part of this opposition related to English perceptions that the French fleet had stood by while the English fleet bore the brunt of the fighting the Dutch.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', pp 50-1 52.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Solebay]] in 1672, [[Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es|d'Estr\u00e9es]], commanding the French squadron, avoided the main battle and only engaged a much smaller Dutch force at long-range, earning the condemnation of English, and some of French, officers.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', pp 50-51.</ref> The conduct of the French fleet in the two 1673 Battles of the Schooneveld was undistinguished and, in the final 1673 conflict, the [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]], D'Estr\u00e9es, either through  poor seamanship, or because he had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet should England make peace with the Dutch, failed to engage the Dutch closely.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', p 52.</ref> In addition, Dutch privateers had been much more successful at capturing English merchant ships than English privateers attacking Dutch vessels in this war.<ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 30, 192</ref>\n\nDesperate for funds, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session for the first time in over two years. He had hoped to keep it [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in order to wage the war without its oversight. In 1674, largely because of the pressure put upon Charles by Parliament, England signed the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]: this largely restored the pre-war status quo and ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War.<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', p 275</ref> The French would continue to fight for four more years. A peace conference was convened at [[Nijmegen]]in 1676, but this made little progress as the French insisted in retaining the Dutch fortress of [[Maastricht]]. However, the conclusion of an Anglo-Dutch defensive treaty in March 1678 convinced Louis to offer peace without the cession any Dutch territory, leading to the signing the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]].<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', p 219</ref> Although not unfavourable to the Dutch, and less favourable to France than the terms offered by the Dutch in 1672, France gained [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and several towns in the Spanish Netherlands by this treaty, although relinquishing other conquests. More importantly, Louis achieved a diplomatic victory by breaking the European alliance against him.<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', pp 296-297</ref>\n\nIn 1672, Charles issued a [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] which suspended the penal laws against [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming]] Protestants and also relaxed (but did not suspend) the penal laws applying to Roman Catholics.  When Parliament reconvened that year, they denounced the Declaration and announced that the English monarch did not possess the power to issue proclamations that suspended penal laws passed by the Parliament. Furthermore, they refused to fund the ongoing [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] until the declaration was withdrawn. Charles was forced to comply with Parliament's demands, thereby ending the chance offered by the treaty of reconciling England with the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 354-55, 365-68.</ref>\n\nThe treaty's reference to the possibility of \"new rights to the Spanish monarchy reverting to the King of France\" envisaged the possibility of [[Charles II of Spain]] dying childless, and of Louis then claiming the Spanish throne for the House of Bourbon through his wife. At the time of the treaty, the Spanish monarch was only nine years old, but his infirmity was already evident and well-known, casting doubt on his ever being able to beget children. However, Charles' promise to Louis was purely personal, and as the Spanish King outlived him, his promise had no effect.<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', pp 309-310</ref> When, shortly after the conclusion of the [[Nine Years' War]], the death of Charles II of Spain seemed imminent, the exhausted participants agreed by the  [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)|First Partition Treaty of 1698]], brokered by William III, that [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria]] would succeed to the Spanish throne, and that France and Austria would divide Spain's European possessions outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. After Joseph Ferdinand's death in 1699, the  [[Treaty of London (1700)|Second Partition Treaty]] of 1700, also sponsored by William III awarded Spain and its overseas possessions to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]] and most of Spain's European possessions to France. However, when the Spanish king died dying childless in 1700, William III's foreign policy initiative was nullified when Louis claimed the whole Spanish inheritance for his grandson, and French ambitions caused the [[War of Spanish Succession]].<ref>C. W. Ingrao, ''The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618-1815'', pp 105-107</ref>\n\nOverall, Charles made a serious error of judgement in signing the Treaty of Dover. Firstly, he underestimated the political skill of Louis, who involved him a war of little advantage to England but one that was greatly desired by Louis to further his objectives. Secondly, he also underestimated Dutch resilience and overestimated his influence on William, who gained power in the Netherlands without Charles' assistance.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 318.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of treaties]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation | last = Ady | first = Julia | title = Madame, a Life of Henrietta, Daughter of Charles I and Duchess of Orleans |  publisher = Seeley & Co | place = London | year = 1894 | pages = 332\u201333 | url = https://archive.org/stream/madamealifehenr02adygoog#page/n354/mode/2up}}.\n* Black, Jeremy. \"British Foreign Policy and International Affairs during Sir William Trumbull's Career.\" ''The British Library Journal'' 19.2 (1993): 199-217.\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

It required that [[Charles II of England]] would convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] at some future date and that he would assist [[Louis XIV]] with 60 warships and 4,000 soldiers to help in France's war of conquest against the [[Dutch Republic]]. In exchange, Charles would secretly receive a yearly pension of \u00a3230,000, as well as an extra sum of money when Charles informed the English people of his conversion, and France would send 6,000 French troops if there was ever a rebellion against Charles in England.   The secret treaty was signed by Arlington, Arundell, Clifford and Bellings for England and Colbert de Croissy for France.  Both kings exchanged letters of ratification and kept secret the existence of the treaty.<ref>G.M.D. Howat, ''Stuart and Cromwellian Foreign Policy'' (1974) pp 126\u201332.</ref>  A public treaty of Dover was also negotiated, but it was a screen designed for propaganda purposes and to hide the religious dimension of the secret treaty.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 308.</ref> The [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] was a direct consequence of this treaty.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 302-303.</ref> The actual treaty was published by historians a century later.\n\n\n==Negotiation and provisions==\n[[File:Mignard, possibly after - Henrietta of England - National Portrait Gallery.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Henrietta, Charles II's youngest sister, assisted in the negotiations that led to the Secret Treaty of Dover (26 May 1670).<ref>{{citation | first = Stephen | last = Coote | title = Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II | year = 2000 | ISBN = 0-312-22687-X | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/royalsurvivorlif00coot }}.</ref>]]\nExactly who first proposed the alliance between the two kingdoms is unknown, as is the date when this possibility was first discussed. Although the two nations had secretly discussed forming a closer relationship after [[The Restoration]], and Charles had suggested an Anglo-French treaty,<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 29-30.</ref> Charles' assumption that Louis would prefer such a treaty to one with the Dutch was mistaken, as an English treaty was not necessary for Louis' objectives in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], but one with the Dutch Republic was if war was to be avoided.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'' (2004) pp 65,109.</ref> After the signature of a Franco-Dutch defensive treaty in 1662, relations between England and France continued to deteriorate until a French declaration of war against England in January 1666.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', p 151.</ref>    \n \nDuring the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], mutual suspicion grew between the Dutch and Louis, and following its end and the start of the [[War of Devolution]], both in 1667, a [[Triple Alliance (1668)]] was former between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden 1668 to counter French aggression in the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp 299-300.</ref> During 1669, friction between the members of the Triple Alliance convinced Louis that he could detach either England or the Dutch Republic from it and, following an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate with the Dutch, he was approached by Charles, who used his sister as point of contact, with the offer of an alliance.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp 300-301.</ref> To begin with, the only participants in the talks  were [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of France, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of England, and Charles's sister [[Princess Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], ''[[duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans]]''. Louis was first cousin to Charles (through their grandfather [[Henry IV of France]]). Henrietta was also Louis's sister-in-law through her marriage to his only brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Phillippe, ''duc d'Orl\u00e9ans'']].<ref>David Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' (2nd ed. 1936) vol 1 p 342-44.</ref>\n\nCharles' motives for entering into secret negotiations with France while England was part of the Triple Alliance that was opposed to France have been the subject of considerable discussion. His suggested motives include a desire to have Europe's strongest state as an ally, to make himself politically and financially independent of the English parliament, to ensure that England received a share of the [[Spanish Empire]] if and when it broke up, to use Catholics, and possibly also Protestant dissenters, as a dependable group of supporters to strengthen his monarchy or, finally, to revenge himself on the Dutch and particularly its republican government. However, as Charles initially attempted to form an alliance with France in 1668 without abandoning the Triple Alliance, he was not as consistent in opposing the Dutch republican government as Louis was.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 297, 299.</ref> Ever since the signing of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], whose provisions included the marriage of Louis to [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], the eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]], and despite Maria Theresa renouncing her inheritance rights, Louis consistently manoeuvred to acquire Spanish territory adjacent to France and to promote his wife's claim to the Spanish throne.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 28, 34.</ref> Accordingly, Louis refused Charles' offer in 1668 as it did not included an agreement to join a French attack on Spain, which Charles was unwilling to concede.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 299.</ref> \n\nIn the early part of 1669, Louis attempted to gain Dutch agreement to his acquiring all or most of the Spanish Netherlands, but the Dutch themselves were anxious to prevent a French army being stationed on or near their frontiers. During the same period, Charles attempted to preserve the Triple Alliance by settling outstanding overseas trade issues with the Dutch, with little success. Charles simultaneously attempted to restart negotiations for a French alliance, but Louis repeated the condition that Britain must join him in attacking the Netherlands. Charles remained unenthusiastic, but his failure to gain the security he sought by other diplomatic means forced him to accept this precondition, subject to substantial French financial assistance. The parties entered into more detailed discussions by December 1669.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 300-302.</ref> During the five months in which detailed terms were being agreed, both parties attempted to reach understandings with Spain: their realisation that Spain might cede the Spanish Netherlands to France in a territorial exchange or act in concert with the Triple Alliance was a strong incentive for Charles and Louis respectively to reach a final agreement.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 303-304.</ref> \n \nBy the secret treaty Charles was to abandon the Triple Alliance with Sweden and the [[Dutch Republic]] in favour of assisting Louis in conquering the Dutch Republic. Provided that the conquest was successfully completed, England was promised several very profitable ports along one of the major rivers that run through the Dutch Republic.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 344-46.</ref>  The main components of the treaty can be paraphrased:\n\n{{quote |The King of England will make a public profession of the Catholic faith, and will receive the sum of two millions of crowns, to aid him in this project, from the Most Christian King, in the course of the next six months. The date of this declaration is left absolutely to his own pleasure.  The King of France will faithfully observe the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], as regards Spain, and the King of England will maintain the Treaty of the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] in a similar manner.  If new rights to the Spanish monarchy revert to the King of France, the King of England will aid him in maintaining these rights.  The two Kings will declare war against the United Provinces.  The King of France will attack them by land, and will receive the help of 6000 men from England.  The King of England will send 50 men-of-war to sea, and the King of France 30; the combined fleets will be under the [[James II of England|Duke of York]]'s command.  His Britannic Majesty will be content to receive [[Walcheren]], the mouth of the [[Scheldt]], and the isle of [[Cadzand]], as his share of the conquered provinces.

The [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France. He was amazed by how smoothly it went.

Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', pp 296-297</ref> \n\nIn 1672, Charles issued a [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] which suspended the penal laws against [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming]] Protestants and also relaxed (but did not suspend) the penal laws applying to Roman Catholics.  When Parliament reconvened that year, they denounced the Declaration and announced that the English monarch did not possess the power to issue proclamations that suspended penal laws passed by the Parliament. Furthermore, they refused to fund the ongoing [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] until the declaration was withdrawn. Charles was forced to comply with Parliament's demands, thereby ending the chance offered by the treaty of reconciling England with the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 354-55, 365-68.</ref>\n\nThe treaty's reference to the possibility of \"new rights to the Spanish monarchy reverting to the King of France\" envisaged the possibility of [[Charles II of Spain]] dying childless, and of Louis then claiming the Spanish throne for the House of Bourbon through his wife. At the time of the treaty, the Spanish monarch was only nine years old, but his infirmity was already evident and well-known, casting doubt on his ever being able to beget children. However, Charles' promise to Louis was purely personal, and as the Spanish King outlived him, his promise had no effect.<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', pp 309-310</ref> When, shortly after the conclusion of the [[Nine Years' War]], the death of Charles II of Spain seemed imminent, the exhausted participants agreed by the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)| First Partition Treaty of 1698]], brokered by William III, that [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria]] would succeed to the Spanish throne, and that France and Austria would divide Spain's European possessions outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. After Joseph Ferdinand's death in 1699, the [[Treaty of London (1700)| Second Partition Treaty]] of 1700, also sponsored by William III awarded Spain and its overseas possessions to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]] and most of Spain's European possessions to France. However, when the Spanish king died dying childless in 1700, William III's foreign policy initiative was nullified when Louis claimed the whole Spanish inheritance for his grandson, and French ambitions caused the [[War of Spanish Succession]].<ref>C. W. Ingrao, ''The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618-1815'', pp 105-107</ref>\n\nOverall, Charles made a serious error of judgement in signing the Treaty of Dover. Firstly, he underestimated the political skill of Louis, who involved him a war of little advantage to England but one that was greatly desired by Louis to further his objectives. Secondly, he also underestimated Dutch resilience and overestimated his influence on William, who gained power in the Netherlands without Charles' assistance.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 318.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of treaties]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation | last = Ady | first = Julia | title = Madame, a Life of Henrietta, Daughter of Charles I and Duchess of Orleans |  publisher = Seeley & Co | place = London | year = 1894 | pages = 332\u201333 | url = https://archive.org/stream/madamealifehenr02adygoog#page/n354/mode/2up}}.\n* Black, Jeremy. \"British Foreign Policy and International Affairs during Sir William Trumbull's Career.\" ''The British Library Journal'' 19.2 (1993): 199-217.\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

It became a hit in 1992, reaching number 3 in the United States. A 1993 re-release of the song in the [[United Kingdom]], where the initial release had been a minor hit, peaked at number 8. \"Jump Around\" was featured at position 580 on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''1001 Best Songs Ever'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref> number 24 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'',<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ | title = 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> number 66 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', number 325 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s ''500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'' and number 47 on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''100 Best Songs Of The 1990s''. The song is popular among [[dancehall]] [[disc jockey|DJ]]s and is widely regarded in the United Kingdom as a club classic.\n\n==Development==\nDJ Muggs has stated that he originally produced the beat for Cypress Hill, but rapper B-Real did not want to record at that time.

The song also samples \"Popeye the Hitchhiker\" by [[Chubby Checker]], but it is best known for a high-pitched squealing sound that appears at the beginning of almost every bar\u201466 times in the course of the recording.\n\nThe origin of the squeal has been the subject of debate. The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, Americans blogger [[Anil Dash]] and musician [[Questlove]] of hip-hop band [[The Roots]] have insisted on [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' reader performed a [[spectrogram]] where the sample more closely matches \"Shoot Your Shot\", and House of Pain member [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] himself told Questlove that it is a horn making the squeal and not Prince.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.  The Rally Monkey then holds up a \"Rally Time\" sign and the chorus of \"Jump Around\" is played to fire up the fans to cheer for the Angels to rally and catch up in the game while the Rally Monkey is shown jumping up and down.\n\n====Melbourne City FC====\nThe song is played by Australian football club [[Melbourne City FC]] after they score goals during home games at [[AAMI Park]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe song was played during the 2015 post-season in [[Gillette Stadium]] when the [[New England Patriots]] scored the final touchdown against the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year.

Duffin is usually given as meaning 'belonging to the Duffin family' but the earliest spelling is Dufferagh which probably means Dubh Rath meaning 'The Black Fort' (referring to the ringfort still in the townland)) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nToberlyan is bounded on the north by [[Corran, County Cavan|Corran]] townland and [[Bellaheady]] townland in Kildallan parish, on the west by [[Toberlyan]] townland, on the south by [[Coologe]] townland and on the east by [[Killarah]] townland in Kildallan parish. Its chief geographical features are the [[Shannon-Erne Waterway]], a small stream and a plantation. Toberlyan is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 160 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 29 April 1611, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, ''one poll of Dufferagh to Cormacke McGawran'',<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XD5JAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA211&dq=boely+Killmuriertagh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBzuSOzbjfAhWjQxUIHZeBAogQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=boely%20Killmuriertagh&f=false]</ref> but it is probable that the lands had been in the possession of the McGovern clan for several hundred years before this and it was just a [[Surrender and regrant]] confirming the existing title to the McGoverns. The said Cormacke McGawran was the son of a previous chief of the clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]] who was elected in 1584.\n\nThe McGovern lands in Toberlyan Duffin were confiscated in the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] and were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the name as ''Duffer'' and the proprietor as ''Shane McLaghlyne'' and the tenant as ''N.

His Estate was large and he named eight beneficiaries, including Martha (Faris) Hinds, Ralph Hinds, Walter Hinds, John Hinds, William Hinds, Thomas Hinds, Anne Hinds and Mary (Hinds) Clarke.

Its chief geographical features are the [[Shannon-Erne Waterway]], a small stream and a plantation. Toberlyan is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 160 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 29 April 1611, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, ''one poll of Dufferagh to Cormacke McGawran'',<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XD5JAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA211&dq=boely+Killmuriertagh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBzuSOzbjfAhWjQxUIHZeBAogQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=boely%20Killmuriertagh&f=false]</ref> but it is probable that the lands had been in the possession of the McGovern clan for several hundred years before this and it was just a [[Surrender and regrant]] confirming the existing title to the McGoverns. The said Cormacke McGawran was the son of a previous chief of the clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]] who was elected in 1584.\n\nThe McGovern lands in Toberlyan Duffin were confiscated in the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] and were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the name as ''Duffer'' and the proprietor as ''Shane McLaghlyne'' and the tenant as ''N.

Walter Hinds (1703-1777) of Corrakane left a will dated 5 Aug 1777 and proved on 18 July 1778. His Estate was large and he named eight beneficiaries, including Martha (Faris) Hinds, Ralph Hinds, Walter Hinds, John Hinds, William Hinds, Thomas Hinds, Anne Hinds and Mary (Hinds) Clarke.
