They had several [[hit record|hit]]s throughout their career, including \"[[Tell Me Something Good]]\", \"[[Sweet Thing (Chaka Khan song)|Sweet Thing]]\", \"[[Do You Love What You Feel]]\" and \"[[Ain't Nobody]]\". Rufus and Chaka Khan were one of the most popular and influential funk bands of the 1970s, with four consecutive number one R&B albums, ten Top 40 Pop Hits and five number one R&B singles, among other accolades.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Origins===\nIn 1968, [[The American Breed]] ([[Gary Loizzo]], guitar/vocals, Al Ciner, guitar, Charles \"Chuck\" Colbert, bass and Lee Graziano, drums) had a top ten hit with the classic rock single, \"[[Bend Me, Shape Me]]\". After much success, Colbert and Graziano (without Loizzo who pursued a successful production career) created a new group, adding later day \"Breed\" members [[Kevin Murphy (musician)|Kevin Murphy]] on (keyboards) and Paulette McWilliams (vocals), plus James Stella (vocals) and Vern Pilder (guitar) from the bar band \"Circus\". They re-emerged in 1969 under the name \"Smoke\". In 1970, after switching their management to Bob Monaco and Bill Traut, the group's name changed again to \"Ask Rufus\", the name is taken from the title of the advice column in ''[[Mechanics Illustrated]]''. At this point, Ciner came back to replace Pilder and [[Willie Weeks]] was added on bass after Colbert left.\n\nIn 1971, the band signed a contract with [[Epic Records]] recording an album that wasn't released after which Epic dropped their contract in early 1972. [[Willie Weeks]] was in turn replaced by Dennis Belfield, James Stella by keyboardist/vocalist Ron Stockert and Lee Graziano by Andre Fischer (former drummer with [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Jerry Butler]]). Paulette McWilliams and [[Chaka Khan]] had met and became the best of friends through their spouses Howard Towles and Hassan Khan. Chaka attended most Ask Rufus gigs when they performed in Chicago. When Paulette decided she was leaving Ask Rufus, she told them she had the perfect singer to replace her; she had also asked Chaka if she was interested. After the band hesitantly submitted, Paulette remained for a few weeks to teach Chaka the material. Paulette also got Chaka a gig with the group Lyfe, formed by Chicago's [[Cash McCall (musician)|Cash McCall]]. Chaka had been performing at the Pumpkin Room on the south side of Chicago, with a local group, Lock and Chain, led by drummer Scotty Harris.\n\n===Early career===\nBob Monaco was part of a booking company known as Ashley Famous with Jim Golden. They booked Ask Rufus, with Paulette McWilliams and also The [[Rotary Connection]] with [[Minnie Riperton]]. Monaco was also responsible for helping get Ask Rufus their deal on ABC Dunhill. Monaco returned to Los Angeles, convinced the label to give him a demo budget and then quickly returned to Chicago where the group recorded eleven songs in two days at Marty Feldman's Paragon Studios. After taking the demo tapes back to ABC Dunhill the group was immediately asked to sign a long-term recording contract. Khan, who at eighteen was still a minor, had to have her mother sign along with her, even though as a married woman (newly wed to Hassan Khan, a bassist of one of her former bands), she could have done the deed herself. \n\nA few weeks before Monaco saw Rufus perform, the group had already caught the attention of musician [[Ike Turner]] who flew them out to Los Angeles to record at his studio [[Bolic Sound]] in [[Inglewood, California]]. Turner wanted Khan to become an [[The Ikettes|Ikette]]; she declined stating she was \"really happy with Rufus. But Ike's attention was certainly a boost.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chakathroughfire00chak/page/63|title=Chaka!

While the songs \"Whoever's Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)\" and \"Feel Good\" (both featuring Khan) brought the group some attention from R&B radio stations, the album itself had minimal sales, and the Stockert-led \"Slip & Slide\" failed to catch major attention from pop radio.\n\nThe group quickly re-entered the same studio to record their follow-up album ''[[Rags to Rufus]]''. Ciner and Belfield would leave the group shortly thereafter along with Stockert, who was replaced by Los Angeles-based keyboardist Nate Morgan. Additionally, Tony Maiden and bassist Bobby Watson, also from Los Angeles, were recruited by drummer Andre Fischer. Maiden's, Watson's and Morgan's addition to Rufus added a unique sound to the group, bringing a stronger funk and jazz influence to complement Khan's now emerging powerful lead vocals.\n\n===Success, stardom and tension===\n''Rags to Rufus'' was released in 1974 and two of its singles \u2014 the [[Stevie Wonder]]-penned \"[[Tell Me Something Good]]\" and the Parker-Khan composition, \"[[You Got the Love (Rufus song)|You Got the Love]]\" \u2014 became smash hits leading to ''Rags to Rufus'' going [[Recording Industry Association of America|platinum]] and also landed them opening spots for the tours of several top stars including Stevie Wonder, Cheech and Chong and the Hues Corporation. \"Tell Me Something Good\" also brought Rufus their first [[Grammy Award]]. In addition, it sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on August 9, 1974.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/350 350]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/350\n}}</ref> Due to Khan's increasing popularity Rufus and ABC started calling the group '''Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan'''. With this new billing, the band recorded and quickly released their next album, ''[[Rufusized]]'' in 1974. Another platinum success, the group entered the top ten again with the funk singles, \"[[Once You Get Started]]\", (penned by [[Gavin Christopher]]), \"Stop on By\", \"I'm a Woman\", and \"Pack'd My Bags\" (later sampled for [[Jody Watley]]'s \"Lovin' You So\") and \"Please Pardon Me (You Remind Me of a Friend)\", penned by their friend [[Brenda Russell]].\n\nHeading into 1975, the group headlined their first major tour, with Khan attracting attention in concert reviews for her powerhouse vocals and [[sex symbol|sexy attire]] \u2014 so much so that Khan was often featured on magazine covers such as ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'', which featured Khan throughout her long career. Also due to her off-stage antics that added to her on-stage persona, the media billed Khan as \"the wild child\". She was often compared to [[Tina Turner]], with some rock and soul press labeling her a \"pint-sized Tina\"; as well as [[Aretha Franklin]] (her friends called her \"little Aretha\"). Attention to Khan began to make waves for some of the group's members, as they felt her presence overshadowed the band itself. The group's fourth release, and the third major release with Khan as singer, ''[[Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan (album)|Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan]]'', was released in 1975. The major hit off the album was a composition by Khan and Tony Maiden titled \"[[Sweet Thing (Chaka Khan song)|Sweet Thing]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rufus-featuring-chaka-khan-mw0000309051 |title=Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan  |first=Jason |last=Elias |website=AllMusic}}</ref> which reached the top five of the charts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/sweet-thing-mt0002686353 |title=Sweet Thing |first=Ed |last=Hogan |website=AllMusic}}</ref> and became their fourth record to reach [[music recording sales certifications|gold]].\n\nDespite the album's success as well as a second successful major tour that followed, it still didn't stop growing tensions within the group, particularly between Khan and longtime Rufus drummer Andre Fischer. During recording sessions of ''[[Ask Rufus]]'', Khan had married Richard Holland (she had divorced her first husband Hassan Khan in 1974 prior to the birth of their child Milini), and the presence of Holland only made things worse between Khan and Fischer. During one session of ''Ask Rufus'', Fischer engaged in a fight with Holland, who received help from a counter-attacking Khan. ''Ask Rufus'' would be released in 1977 and include the hits \"[[At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)]]\", \"Hollywood\" and \"Everlasting Love\". Following a tour to promote ''Ask Rufus'', Fischer finally left the group. He was followed by Nate Morgan. They were replaced by Richard \"Moon\" Calhoun and [[Hawk Wolinski|David \"Hawk\" Wolinski]], respectively. The new lineup recorded the album, ''[[Street Player]]'', which featured the Khan-composed song \"Stay\". After first putting it off as a rumor, Khan confirmed to media reports that she was going solo, signing a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The decision strained relations between Khan and the other Rufus members. Khan released her [[Chaka (1978 album)|self-titled debut]] later in 1978. The album sold more than ''Street Player'', going platinum, thanks to the international [[Ashford & Simpson]]-composed single, \"[[I'm Every Woman]]\". Khan continued to promote the album in 1979. In early 1979, Calhoun would be replaced by John \"J.R.\" Robinson as the group's drummer.\n\n===Decline and final years===\nFollowing Calhoun's replacement, another change came when ABC Records was absorbed by [[MCA Records|MCA]], bringing the group to MCA. While Khan promoted ''Chaka'', Rufus put out a less favorably received Khan-less album, ''[[Numbers (Rufus album)|Numbers]]''. Khan returned to record with the band for the [[Quincy Jones]]-produced ''[[Masterjam]]''. By now, Rufus and Khan were split in two, both acts being treated separately. Khan's stardom helped ''Masterjam'' go gold thanks to the funk-laden disco recording, \"[[Do You Love What You Feel]]\".\n\nThough Khan would later say that she was ready to leave Rufus at the time she released ''Chaka'' in 1978, she discovered that she had two more albums left in her ABC/MCA contract with the band and agreed to fulfill her obligations. Following ''Masterjam'', one of the contractual albums, and another Khan-less album, ''[[Party 'Til You're Broke]]'', which did not sell well, the factions of Rufus and Khan reunited for their last MCA album, ''[[Camouflage (Rufus album)|Camouflage]]'' in 1981. Feelings of tension were felt during the album sessions. This resulted in situations where Khan would either record her vocals alone to a [[click track]] prior to the band's instrumentation being added later or vice versa.\n\nUnfortunately, the album failed to garner attention, mainly due to Khan's solo obligations, which now included two more gold-certified studio albums, ''[[Naughty (Chaka Khan album)|Naughty]]'' and ''[[What Cha' Gonna Do for Me]]''. With the release of ''Camouflage'', Khan was free to leave the group, and following her exit in early 1982, the remaining members of Rufus released what became their final studio album, ''[[Seal in Red]]'' in 1983 which, like their previous albums, went unnoticed.\n\nRufus band members sensed that their tenure was over and agreed to split, and release one last live album to commemorate the occasion. The band asked Khan to contribute to their final concert performance which would be filmed by Warner Bros., and she obliged, reuniting with the group for what was to be later released as a [[documentary film]] titled ''Stompin' At the Savoy''. Warner Bros. declined to release the film at that time and released only the [[Stompin' at the Savoy - Live|live album]]. The filmed concert has since been released to home-video.\n\nThe album included four Khan-led studio songs, including the Dave Wolinski composition \"[[Ain't Nobody]]\", which got attention when a producer for the film, ''[[Breakin']]'' heard it while screening songs for the movie's soundtrack. Warner eventually released the song (with the billing '''Rufus and Chaka Khan''') and the song became a top 30 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit, reaching number-one on the R&B chart and hitting number eight on the UK singles chart. The success of the track led to the band receiving its second [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].\n\nFollowing this success, Rufus went their separate ways for good with Khan continuing her solo career, with the release of the single \"[[I Feel for You]]\" cementing her success.\n\n===Post-break up===\nIn 2001, Rufus (Kevin Murphy, Tony Maiden, Bobby Watson, Dave Wolinski, and [[John Robinson (drummer)|J.R. Robinson]]) and Chaka Khan reunited for a brief tour, which Khan described in her 2003 autobiography, ''Chaka! Through the Fire'' (co-written with Tonya Bolden). Khan and Maiden reunited on the modernized Rufus medley, \"Pack'd My Bags\"/ \"You Got the Love\", on Khan's double Grammy Award-winning 2007 album, ''[[Funk This]]''. When discussing another potential reunion with Rufus during a 2008 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Khan said the band's classic lineup (which includes Andre Fischer and Nate Morgan) had no plans on reuniting, with Khan stating that touring with Tony Maiden, one of the few Rufus band mates Khan kept a close friendship with, was the closest to another Rufus reunion. A lineup of Rufus including Bobby Watson and J.R. Robinson started a short tour in 2008. Neither founding member Kevin Murphy, mainstay Tony Maiden nor Dave Wolinski participated in this tour. In September 2011, the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] committee announced that the band and Khan were jointly nominated for induction to the 27th annual class. They had been eligible since 1999 (with the committee counting the band's first album as ''Rags to Rufus'' rather than 1973's ''Rufus''). It was their first year of nomination.

Rufus and Chaka Khan were one of the most popular and influential funk bands of the 1970s, with four consecutive number one R&B albums, ten Top 40 Pop Hits and five number one R&B singles, among other accolades.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Origins===\nIn 1968, [[The American Breed]] ([[Gary Loizzo]], guitar/vocals, Al Ciner, guitar, Charles \"Chuck\" Colbert, bass and Lee Graziano, drums) had a top ten hit with the classic rock single, \"[[Bend Me, Shape Me]]\". After much success, Colbert and Graziano (without Loizzo who pursued a successful production career) created a new group, adding later day \"Breed\" members [[Kevin Murphy (musician)|Kevin Murphy]] on (keyboards) and Paulette McWilliams (vocals), plus James Stella (vocals) and Vern Pilder (guitar) from the bar band \"Circus\". They re-emerged in 1969 under the name \"Smoke\". In 1970, after switching their management to Bob Monaco and Bill Traut, the group's name changed again to \"Ask Rufus\", the name is taken from the title of the advice column in ''[[Mechanics Illustrated]]''. At this point, Ciner came back to replace Pilder and [[Willie Weeks]] was added on bass after Colbert left.\n\nIn 1971, the band signed a contract with [[Epic Records]] recording an album that wasn't released after which Epic dropped their contract in early 1972. [[Willie Weeks]] was in turn replaced by Dennis Belfield, James Stella by keyboardist/vocalist Ron Stockert and Lee Graziano by Andre Fischer (former drummer with [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Jerry Butler]]). Paulette McWilliams and [[Chaka Khan]] had met and became the best of friends through their spouses Howard Towles and Hassan Khan. Chaka attended most Ask Rufus gigs when they performed in Chicago. When Paulette decided she was leaving Ask Rufus, she told them she had the perfect singer to replace her; she had also asked Chaka if she was interested. After the band hesitantly submitted, Paulette remained for a few weeks to teach Chaka the material. Paulette also got Chaka a gig with the group Lyfe, formed by Chicago's [[Cash McCall (musician)|Cash McCall]]. Chaka had been performing at the Pumpkin Room on the south side of Chicago, with a local group, Lock and Chain, led by drummer Scotty Harris.\n\n===Early career===\nBob Monaco was part of a booking company known as Ashley Famous with Jim Golden. They booked Ask Rufus, with Paulette McWilliams and also The [[Rotary Connection]] with [[Minnie Riperton]]. Monaco was also responsible for helping get Ask Rufus their deal on ABC Dunhill. Monaco returned to Los Angeles, convinced the label to give him a demo budget and then quickly returned to Chicago where the group recorded eleven songs in two days at Marty Feldman's Paragon Studios. After taking the demo tapes back to ABC Dunhill the group was immediately asked to sign a long-term recording contract. Khan, who at eighteen was still a minor, had to have her mother sign along with her, even though as a married woman (newly wed to Hassan Khan, a bassist of one of her former bands), she could have done the deed herself. \n\nA few weeks before Monaco saw Rufus perform, the group had already caught the attention of musician [[Ike Turner]] who flew them out to Los Angeles to record at his studio [[Bolic Sound]] in [[Inglewood, California]]. Turner wanted Khan to become an [[The Ikettes|Ikette]]; she declined stating she was \"really happy with Rufus. But Ike's attention was certainly a boost.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chakathroughfire00chak/page/63|title=Chaka!

While the songs \"Whoever's Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)\" and \"Feel Good\" (both featuring Khan) brought the group some attention from R&B radio stations, the album itself had minimal sales, and the Stockert-led \"Slip & Slide\" failed to catch major attention from pop radio.\n\nThe group quickly re-entered the same studio to record their follow-up album ''[[Rags to Rufus]]''. Ciner and Belfield would leave the group shortly thereafter along with Stockert, who was replaced by Los Angeles-based keyboardist Nate Morgan. Additionally, Tony Maiden and bassist Bobby Watson, also from Los Angeles, were recruited by drummer Andre Fischer. Maiden's, Watson's and Morgan's addition to Rufus added a unique sound to the group, bringing a stronger funk and jazz influence to complement Khan's now emerging powerful lead vocals.\n\n===Success, stardom and tension===\n''Rags to Rufus'' was released in 1974 and two of its singles \u2014 the [[Stevie Wonder]]-penned \"[[Tell Me Something Good]]\" and the Parker-Khan composition, \"[[You Got the Love (Rufus song)|You Got the Love]]\" \u2014 became smash hits leading to ''Rags to Rufus'' going [[Recording Industry Association of America|platinum]] and also landed them opening spots for the tours of several top stars including Stevie Wonder, Cheech and Chong and the Hues Corporation. \"Tell Me Something Good\" also brought Rufus their first [[Grammy Award]]. In addition, it sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on August 9, 1974.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/350 350]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/350\n}}</ref> Due to Khan's increasing popularity Rufus and ABC started calling the group '''Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan'''. With this new billing, the band recorded and quickly released their next album, ''[[Rufusized]]'' in 1974. Another platinum success, the group entered the top ten again with the funk singles, \"[[Once You Get Started]]\", (penned by [[Gavin Christopher]]), \"Stop on By\", \"I'm a Woman\", and \"Pack'd My Bags\" (later sampled for [[Jody Watley]]'s \"Lovin' You So\") and \"Please Pardon Me (You Remind Me of a Friend)\", penned by their friend [[Brenda Russell]].\n\nHeading into 1975, the group headlined their first major tour, with Khan attracting attention in concert reviews for her powerhouse vocals and [[sex symbol|sexy attire]] \u2014 so much so that Khan was often featured on magazine covers such as ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'', which featured Khan throughout her long career. Also due to her off-stage antics that added to her on-stage persona, the media billed Khan as \"the wild child\". She was often compared to [[Tina Turner]], with some rock and soul press labeling her a \"pint-sized Tina\"; as well as [[Aretha Franklin]] (her friends called her \"little Aretha\"). Attention to Khan began to make waves for some of the group's members, as they felt her presence overshadowed the band itself. The group's fourth release, and the third major release with Khan as singer, ''[[Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan (album)|Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan]]'', was released in 1975. The major hit off the album was a composition by Khan and Tony Maiden titled \"[[Sweet Thing (Chaka Khan song)|Sweet Thing]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rufus-featuring-chaka-khan-mw0000309051 |title=Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan  |first=Jason |last=Elias |website=AllMusic}}</ref> which reached the top five of the charts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/sweet-thing-mt0002686353 |title=Sweet Thing |first=Ed |last=Hogan |website=AllMusic}}</ref> and became their fourth record to reach [[music recording sales certifications|gold]].\n\nDespite the album's success as well as a second successful major tour that followed, it still didn't stop growing tensions within the group, particularly between Khan and longtime Rufus drummer Andre Fischer. During recording sessions of ''[[Ask Rufus]]'', Khan had married Richard Holland (she had divorced her first husband Hassan Khan in 1974 prior to the birth of their child Milini), and the presence of Holland only made things worse between Khan and Fischer. During one session of ''Ask Rufus'', Fischer engaged in a fight with Holland, who received help from a counter-attacking Khan. ''Ask Rufus'' would be released in 1977 and include the hits \"[[At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)]]\", \"Hollywood\" and \"Everlasting Love\". Following a tour to promote ''Ask Rufus'', Fischer finally left the group. He was followed by Nate Morgan. They were replaced by Richard \"Moon\" Calhoun and [[Hawk Wolinski|David \"Hawk\" Wolinski]], respectively. The new lineup recorded the album, ''[[Street Player]]'', which featured the Khan-composed song \"Stay\". After first putting it off as a rumor, Khan confirmed to media reports that she was going solo, signing a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The decision strained relations between Khan and the other Rufus members. Khan released her [[Chaka (1978 album)|self-titled debut]] later in 1978. The album sold more than ''Street Player'', going platinum, thanks to the international [[Ashford & Simpson]]-composed single, \"[[I'm Every Woman]]\". Khan continued to promote the album in 1979. In early 1979, Calhoun would be replaced by John \"J.R.\" Robinson as the group's drummer.\n\n===Decline and final years===\nFollowing Calhoun's replacement, another change came when ABC Records was absorbed by [[MCA Records|MCA]], bringing the group to MCA. While Khan promoted ''Chaka'', Rufus put out a less favorably received Khan-less album, ''[[Numbers (Rufus album)|Numbers]]''. Khan returned to record with the band for the [[Quincy Jones]]-produced ''[[Masterjam]]''. By now, Rufus and Khan were split in two, both acts being treated separately. Khan's stardom helped ''Masterjam'' go gold thanks to the funk-laden disco recording, \"[[Do You Love What You Feel]]\".\n\nThough Khan would later say that she was ready to leave Rufus upon the time she released ''Chaka'' in 1978, she discovered that she had two more albums left in her ABC/MCA contract with the band and agreed to fulfill her obligations. Following ''Masterjam'', one of the contractual albums, and another Khan-less album, ''[[Party 'Til You're Broke]]'', which did not sell well, the factions of Rufus and Khan reunited for their last MCA album, ''[[Camouflage (Rufus album)|Camouflage]]'' in 1981. Feelings of tension were felt during the album sessions. This resulted in situations where Khan would either record her vocals alone to a [[click track]] prior to the band's instrumentation being added later or vice versa.\n\nUnfortunately, the album failed to garner attention, mainly due to Khan's solo obligations, which now included two more gold-certified studio albums, ''[[Naughty (Chaka Khan album)|Naughty]]'' and ''[[What Cha' Gonna Do for Me]]''. With the release of ''Camouflage'', Khan was free to leave the group, and following her exit in early 1982, the remaining members of Rufus released what became their final studio album, ''[[Seal in Red]]'' in 1983 which, like their previous albums, went unnoticed.\n\nRufus band members sensed that their tenure was over and agreed to split, and release one last live album to commemorate the occasion. The band asked Khan to contribute to their final concert performance which would be filmed by Warner Bros., and she obliged, reuniting with the group for what was to be later released as a [[documentary film]] titled ''Stompin' At the Savoy''. Warner Bros. Declined to release the film at that time and released only the [[Stompin' at the Savoy - Live|live album]]. The filmed concert has since been released to home-video.\n\nThe album included four Khan-led studio songs, including the Dave Wolinski composition \"[[Ain't Nobody]]\", which got attention when a producer for the film, ''[[Breakin']]'' heard it while screening songs for the movie's soundtrack. Warner eventually released the song (with the billing '''Rufus and Chaka Khan''') and the song became a top 30 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit, reaching number-one on the R&B chart and hitting number eight on the UK singles chart. The success of the track led to the band receiving its second [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].\n\nFollowing this success, Rufus went their separate ways for good with Khan continuing her solo career, with the release of the single \"[[I Feel for You]]\" cementing her success.\n\n===Post-break up===\nIn 2001, Rufus (Kevin Murphy, Tony Maiden, Bobby Watson, Dave Wolinski, and [[John Robinson (drummer)|J.R. Robinson]]) and Chaka Khan reunited for a brief tour, which Khan described in her 2003 autobiography, ''Chaka! Through the Fire'' (co-written with Tonya Bolden). Khan and Maiden reunited on the modernized Rufus medley, \"Pack'd My Bags\"/ \"You Got the Love\", on Khan's double Grammy Award-winning 2007 album, ''[[Funk This]]''. When discussing another potential reunion with Rufus during a 2008 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Khan said the band's classic lineup (which includes Andre Fischer and Nate Morgan) had no plans on reuniting, with Khan stating that touring with Tony Maiden, one of the few Rufus band mates Khan kept a close friendship with, was the closest to another Rufus reunion. A lineup of Rufus including Bobby Watson and J.R. Robinson started a short tour in 2008. Neither founding member Kevin Murphy, mainstay Tony Maiden nor Dave Wolinski participated in this tour. In September 2011, the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] committee announced that the band and Khan were jointly nominated for induction to the 27th annual class. They had been eligible since 1999 (with the committee counting the band's first album as ''Rags to Rufus'' rather than 1973's ''Rufus''). It was their first year of nomination. Earlier in the year, Khan received a solo star at the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Rufus was again nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in September 2017.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Rufus among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal Studios fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n;Former members\n*Lee Graziano \u2013 drums <small>(1970\u20131972)</small>\n*Chuck Colbert Jr. \u2013 bass <small>(1970)</small>\n*[[Al Ciner]] \u2013 guitar <small>(1970\u20131974)</small>\n*Paulette McWilliams \u2013 vocals <small>(1970\u20131972)</small>\n*James Stella \u2013 vocals <small>(1970\u20131972)</small>\n*[[Kevin Murphy (musician)|Kevin Murphy]] \u2013 keyboards <small>(1970\u20131983)</small>\n*[[Willie Weeks]] \u2013 bass <small>(1970\u20131972)</small>\n*[[Chaka Khan]] \u2013 vocals <small>(1972\u20131983)</small>{{efn|Khan would release her solo debut album ''[[Chaka (1978 album)|Chaka]]'' in 1978, and would remain with the group until 1982.

Its name comes from the [[asterisk]] (*) symbol for a signal used in [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF) dialing.\n\nAsterisk was created in 1999 by [[Mark Spencer (computer engineer)|Mark Spencer]] of [[Digium]], today a division of [[Sangoma Technologies Corporation]].<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Stephen P. | last1 = Olejniczak | first2 = Brady | last2 = Kirby | title = Asterisk For Dummies | isbn = 9780470098547 | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2007 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/asteriskfordummi0000olej }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first1 = Jim | last1 = Van Meggelen | first2 = Jared | last2 = Smith | first3 = Leif | last3 = Madsen | title = Asterisk: The Future of Telephony | isbn = 9780596510480 | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media, Inc.]] | year = 2007 }}</ref> Originally designed for [[Linux]],<ref>The README for version 0.1.0 states: \"Currently, the Asterisk Open Source PBX is only known to run on the Linux OS, although it may be portable to other UNIX-like operating systems as well.\" See [http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk/asterisk.git;a=blob;f=README;h=c50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80;hb=da258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212090901/http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk%2Fasterisk.git%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3DREADME%3Bh%3Dc50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80%3Bhb%3Dda258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab |date=2017-02-12 }}</ref> Asterisk runs on a variety of [[operating system]]s, including [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and can be installed in embedded systems based on [[OpenWrt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/voip/asterisk |title=Asterisk on OpenWrt |accessdate=2018-06-10}}</ref><ref>[http://doc.astlinux.org/userdoc:boot-usb-storage AstLinux: Boot via USB Flash Storage]</ref>\n\n==Features==\nThe Asterisk software includes many features available in commercial and proprietary PBX systems: [[voice mail]], [[conference call]]ing, [[interactive voice response]] (phone menus), and [[automatic call distribution]]. Users can create new functionality by writing dial plan scripts in several of Asterisk's own ''extensions'' languages, by adding custom loadable modules written in PHP or [[C (programming language)|C]], or by implementing ''[[Asterisk Gateway Interface]]'' (AGI) programs using any programming language capable of communicating via the standard streams system ([[stdin]] and [[stdout]]) or by network TCP sockets.\n\nAsterisk supports several standard [[voice over IP]] protocols, including the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), the [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP), and [[H.323]]. Asterisk supports most SIP telephones, acting both as registrar and [[back-to-back user agent]]. It can serve as a gateway between IP phones and the PSTN via T- or E-carrier interfaces or analog FXO cards. The [[Inter-Asterisk eXchange]]<nowiki> (IAX) protocol, RFC 5456, native to Asterisk, provides efficient </nowiki>[[trunking]] of calls between Asterisk PBX systems, in addition to distributing some configuration logic. Many VoIP service providers support it for call completion into the PSTN, often because they themselves have deployed Asterisk or offer it as a hosted application. Some telephones also support the IAX protocol.\n\nBy supporting a variety of traditional and VoIP telephony services, Asterisk allows deployers to build telephone systems, or migrate existing systems to new technologies. Some sites are using Asterisk to replace proprietary PBXes, others provide additional features, such as voice mail or voice response menus, or virtual [[call shop]]s, or to reduce cost by carrying long-distance calls over the Internet (toll bypass).\n\nIn addition to VoIP protocols, Asterisk supports traditional circuit-switching protocols such as [[Integrated_Services_Digital_Network|ISDN]] and [[Signalling_System_No._7|SS7]]. This requires appropriate hardware interface cards, marketed by third-party vendors. Each protocol requires the installation of software modules. In Asterisk release 14 the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus audio codec]] is supported.\n\n==Internationalization==\nWhile initially developed in the [[United States]], Asterisk has become a popular [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] PBX worldwide. It allows having multiple sets of voice prompts identified by language (and even multiple sets of prompts for each language) as well as support for time formats  in different languages. Several sets of prompts for the interactive voice response and voice mail features are included with Asterisk: American, British, and Australian English, Canadian French, Japanese, Russian, Mexican Spanish and Swedish.<ref>[http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/sounds/ download page of sound files for Asterisk]</ref> A few novelty prompts are offered, such as jokes<ref>\u05e5 [http://www.speechtechblog.com/2011/02/16/you-are-not-the-next-caller-in-line \"You are not the next caller in line\"], parody on-hold message where a pre-recorded Allison Smith sheepishly confesses (at 0:00:45) that the caller is actually *not* next in queue and would be lucky to get a response at 11:30pm from the cleaning lady after other workers had left for the day.</ref> and a themed \"zombie apocalypse\" message for [[Halloween]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |title=Zombie-Proof Your Phone System |publisher=Go.digium.com |accessdate=2016-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004354/http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref> Additionally, voice sets are offered for commercial sale in various languages, dialects, and genders.\n\nThe default set of English-language Asterisk prompts are recorded by professional telephone voice Allison Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivrvoice.com/asterisk-voice-recording/|title=Asterisk Voice Recordings|work=The IVR Voice}}</ref>\n\n==Derived products==\nAsterisk is a core component in many commercial products and open-source projects.

This interface (which is at the heart of many of the most popular Asterisk distributions, such as AsteriskNOW, Elastix, the FreePBX Distro, and PBX in a Flash), is unarguably a very large part of why Asterisk has been as successful as it has. With the FreePBX interface, you can configure and manage many aspects of an Asterisk system without touching a single configuration file. While we purists may like everyone to work only with the config files, we recognize that for many, learning Linux and editing these files by hand is simply not going to happen. For those folks, there is FreePBX, and it has our respect for the important contributions it has made to the success of Asterisk.}}</ref> \n* [[LinuxMCE]] bundles Asterisk to provide telephony; there is also an embedded version of Asterisk for OpenWrt routers.\n* PBX in a Flash/Incredible PBX and [[trixbox]] are software PBXes based on Asterisk.\n* [[Elastix]] previously used Asterisk, [[HylaFAX]], [[Openfire]] and [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]] to offer PBX, fax, instant messaging and email functions, respectively, before switching to [[3CX]].\n* [[Issabel]] is an open-source [[Unified Communications]] software which uses Asterisk for telephony functions.

Its name comes from the [[asterisk]] (*) symbol for a signal used in [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF) dialing.\n\nAsterisk was created in 1999 by [[Mark Spencer (computer engineer)|Mark Spencer]] of [[Digium]], today a division of [[Sangoma Technologies Corporation]].<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Stephen P. | last1 = Olejniczak | first2 = Brady | last2 = Kirby | title = Asterisk For Dummies | isbn = 9780470098547 | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2007 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/asteriskfordummi0000olej }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first1 = Jim | last1 = Van Meggelen | first2 = Jared | last2 = Smith | first3 = Leif | last3 = Madsen | title = Asterisk: The Future of Telephony | isbn = 9780596510480 | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media, Inc.]] | year = 2007 }}</ref> Originally designed for [[Linux]],<ref>The README for version 0.1.0 states: \"Currently, the Asterisk Open Source PBX is only known to run on the Linux OS, although it may be portable to other UNIX-like operating systems as well.\" See [http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk/asterisk.git;a=blob;f=README;h=c50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80;hb=da258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212090901/http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk%2Fasterisk.git%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3DREADME%3Bh%3Dc50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80%3Bhb%3Dda258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab |date=2017-02-12 }}</ref> Asterisk runs on a variety of [[operating system]]s, including [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and can be installed in embedded systems based on [[OpenWrt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/voip/asterisk |title=Asterisk on OpenWrt |accessdate=2018-06-10}}</ref><ref>[http://doc.astlinux.org/userdoc:boot-usb-storage AstLinux: Boot via USB Flash Storage]</ref>\n\n==Features==\nThe Asterisk software includes many features available in commercial and proprietary PBX systems: [[voice mail]], [[conference call]]ing, [[interactive voice response]] (phone menus), and [[automatic call distribution]]. Users can create new functionality by writing dial plan scripts in several of Asterisk's own ''extensions'' languages, by adding custom loadable modules written in PHP or [[C (programming language)|C]], or by implementing ''[[Asterisk Gateway Interface]]'' (AGI) programs using any programming language capable of communicating via the standard streams system ([[stdin]] and [[stdout]]) or by network TCP sockets.\n\nAsterisk supports several standard [[voice over IP]] protocols, including the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), the [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP), and [[H.323]]. Asterisk supports most SIP telephones, acting both as registrar and [[back-to-back user agent]]. It can serve as a gateway between IP phones and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) via T- or E-carrier interfaces or analog FXO cards. The [[Inter-Asterisk eXchange]]<nowiki> (IAX) protocol, RFC 5456, native to Asterisk, provides efficient </nowiki>[[trunking]] of calls between Asterisk PBX systems, in addition to distributing some configuration logic. Many VoIP service providers support it for call completion into the PSTN, often because they themselves have deployed Asterisk or offer it as a hosted application. Some telephones also support the IAX protocol.\n\nBy supporting a variety of traditional and VoIP telephony services, Asterisk allows deployers to build telephone systems, or migrate existing systems to new technologies. Some sites are using Asterisk to replace proprietary PBXes, others provide additional features, such as voice mail or voice response menus, or virtual [[call shop]]s, or to reduce cost by carrying long-distance calls over the Internet (toll bypass).\n\nIn addition to VoIP protocols, Asterisk supports traditional circuit-switching protocols such as [[Integrated_Services_Digital_Network|ISDN]] and [[Signalling_System_No._7|SS7]]. This requires appropriate hardware interface cards, marketed by third-party vendors. Each protocol requires the installation of software modules. In Asterisk release 14 the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus audio codec]] is supported.\n\n==Internationalization==\nWhile initially developed in the [[United States]], Asterisk has become a popular [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] PBX worldwide. It allows having multiple sets of voice prompts identified by language (and even multiple sets of prompts for each language) as well as support for time formats  in different languages. Several sets of prompts for the interactive voice response and voice mail features are included with Asterisk: American, British, and Australian English, Canadian French, Japanese, Russian, Mexican Spanish and Swedish.<ref>[http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/sounds/ download page of sound files for Asterisk]</ref> A few novelty prompts are offered, such as jokes<ref>\u05e5 [http://www.speechtechblog.com/2011/02/16/you-are-not-the-next-caller-in-line \"You are not the next caller in line\"], parody on-hold message where a pre-recorded Allison Smith sheepishly confesses (at 0:00:45) that the caller is actually *not* next in queue and would be lucky to get a response at 11:30pm from the cleaning lady after other workers had left for the day.</ref> and a themed \"zombie apocalypse\" message for [[Halloween]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |title=Zombie-Proof Your Phone System |publisher=Go.digium.com |accessdate=2016-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004354/http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref> Additionally, voice sets are offered for commercial sale in various languages, dialects, and genders.\n\nThe default set of English-language Asterisk prompts are recorded by professional telephone voice Allison Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivrvoice.com/asterisk-voice-recording/|title=Asterisk Voice Recordings|work=The IVR Voice}}</ref>\n\n==Derived products==\nAsterisk is a core component in many commercial products and open-source projects.

{"title_page": "F\u00e9don's rebellion", "text_new": "'''F\u00e9don's rebellion''' (also known as the '''Brigands' War''',{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{refn|Predominently by the British at the time.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}|group=note}} March 2, 1795 \u2013 June 19, 1796) was an uprising against [[Great Britain|British]] rule of [[Grenada]], predominantly led by free mixed-race [[French language|French-speakers]].  Although a significant number of slaves were involved, they fought on both sides.  The stated purpose of the rebellion was to create a black republic as had already occurred in neighbouring [[Haiti]] rather than to free slaves, so it is not properly called a [[slave rebellion]], although freedom of the slaves would have been a probable consequence of its success.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Julien F\u00e9don]],{{refn|Also given without the [[Acute accent]], and occasionally spelt Foedon or Feydon.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=xiv}}|group=note}} owner of a plantation in the mountainous interior of the island, and encouraged by [[French Revolution]]ary leaders on [[Guadeloupe]], the rebels seized control of most of the island ([[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital, was never taken), but were eventually crushed by a military expedition led by General [[Ralph Abercromby]].\n\n==Background==\nGrenada was formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=31}} The French [[French capture of Grenada 1779|re-captured the island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after [[Comte d'Estaing]] won the bloody land and naval [[Battle of Grenada]] in July 1779.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=44}} However, the island was restored to Britain with the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in 1783.{{sfn|Newman|Brown|1997|p=533}} The context of the country's political tribulations, argues Martin, was \"an oppressive slave plantation complex\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} The situation was worse for the [[Free people of color|black French]], argues Martin, as\u2014even though they were [[Freedman|free]]\u2014they were generally treated as third-class citizens by both white French and the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}}\n\nNews of the French revolution was, says the historian [[Kit Candlin]], \"particularly prescient\" in Grenada, especially as two-thirds of the 5,000 free population were French.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} The political upheavals in neighbouring Haiti provided the motivation for a similar rebellion in Grenada, and also provided a sufficient diversion to allow it to happen.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}} It was not, however, strictly a [[slave rebellion]]. In the aftermath, it was noted that perhaps only half the island's slave population had joined the rebels, the other half, comments Candlin, were \" found cowering in their\nplantations or discovered aimlessly wandering the island\u2019s roads, unsure of what to do\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\n==Causes of the revolution==\nInternal grievances, rather than external influence, were the fundamental cause of F\u00e9don's rebellion, argues the scholar John Angus Martin, being an \"anti-discriminatory rebellion for social, political and religious rights by the French who orchestrated and led the rebellion against the British colonial\ngovernment\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There were some external influences: the biggest was the [[French Revolution]] and its ideology, [[Tom Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', the revolt in Haiti and the general discontent that pervaded the Caribbean during the period.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The had been a smouldering discontent with the British administration for some time before the rebellion.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=1\u20132}} The rebellion, led as it was by slave owners and planters rather than the salves themselves indicates that the French revolution that inspired it was seen as a method of enabling social mobility for the French rather than to free slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nBritish governance of the island was becoming \"increasingly harsh\", suggests Martin, especially against the French inhabitants whose previous political and social influence and power was now increasingly restricted by the new management.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} Although the intention to allow a form of [[Representative government]] had been declared in a [[royal proclamation]],{{sfn|Muller|2017|p=139}} this was continually deferred due to British suspicions that any democratic assembly would be dominated by the French.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\n===Planning===\nIt is possible that the planning of the rebellion took up to 18 months. The conspiracy was composed of a [[kernal]] of around 50 individuals and of diverse social composition, including white [[bourgeoise]] and free-French blacks. No slaves, however, appear to have been involved in the planning stages of the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nSupplies were initially received by French revolutionaries in [[Guadeloupe]]\u2014including [[materiel]] and financing\u2014under [[Victor Hugues]].{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The conspiracy had been successfully hidden from the authorities, notes Martin, and \"it wasn't until the day leading up to the rebellion that some British residents began to notice unusual activities among the rebels, but by then it was too late to act\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nThe conspirators' headquarters was F\u00e9don's remote [[plantation]] in Belvedere Estate.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}\n\n===Participants===\nCandlin has estimated that around 12,500 slaves took an active role in the rebellion, or half the island's slave population.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}{{refn|Many others, she notes, \"hedged their bets or took opportunities as they came\", for instance, to escape the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}|group=note}} Although the slaves who revolted were doing so for with the aim of their own emancipation as their primary goal, they appear to have had a longer-term intention of abolishing the system itself.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There was, however, a \"stark diversity of ideas and personalities\" among them.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nLeaders included F\u00e9don's brother-in-law [[Charles Nogues]]{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[Jean Pierre Lavallee]], who were close friends with Victor Hughes; Hughes looked protected Nogues' son while the rebellion was ongoing.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} Nogues wasa prominent [[tailor]] on the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} Prominent whites included [[Clozier d'Arcuiel]], [[Jean Baptiste Olliviere]] and the [[Chevalier du Suze]] who were important strategists in the military campaign as well as its administration.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} As well as Nogue, leading freed men included [[Stanislaus Besson]], [[Etienne Ventour]], and [[Joachim Phillip]],{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} a coloured free [[Coloniser|planter]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} F\u00e9don appears to have come under internal criticism for a having a dictatorial approach.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\n====Leadership====\nF\u00e9don was both [[General]] of the army and head of the revolutionary council, known as the \"Commission of the 24\", which, despite concerns as to his dictatorial attitude, F\u00e9don does seem to have regularly requested advice from.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} The leadership element was particularly concentrated in residents of the parishes of [[Saint John Parish, Grenada|St John]] and [[Gouyave]]. F\u00e9don, for example, was from the latter, as were a number of \"prominent whites\" he associated with.{{sfn|Martin|2017|pp=13\u201314}} Another leading figure, [[Joachim Philip]], was, according to Candlin, a \"most interesting man\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}} From a large and extremely prosperous family of Greadan planters, he felt that he had been repeatedly ignored for office or patronage by the British administration.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\n==Outbreak and the first week of operations==\nF\u00e9don\u2014now holding the rank of General\u2014directed the opening assaults on the night of 2\u20133 March 1795,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} simultaneously attacking the towns of Gouyave and [[Grenville, Grenada|Grenville]], in the parishes of St John and St Andrew respectively.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} At the former, on the east of the island, a force of freedmen captured 40 British residents and withdrew with them to their headquarters in Belvedere. In the west, at Grenville, and led by F\u00e9don and Lavalee, the insurgents attacked and overran the town, killing 11 of the 15 British they discovered.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{refn|F\u00e9don later blamed this massacre on a non-existent French Revolutionary army he claimed had invaded.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}|group=note}} They also returned to Belvedere, capturing more hostages and gathering more support as they did.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} Only a few hours into the rebellion\u2014\"with a combination of planning and good fortune\", comments Martin\u2014they captured [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Grenada|the island's governor]], [[Ninian Home]]. This was not only a propaganda coup for the rebels but physically inhibited the British response to the rising by his enforced absence from leadership.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}\n\nThe rebels announced that any Frenchman who failed to join the insurrection would be deemed an enemy o the enterprise, outlawed and they goods confiscated.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}\n\n===Marching on St George's===\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Without entering into any detail of our rights, we summon you, and all the inhabitants, of every denomination in this colony, to surrender, within the space of two hours, to the republican forces under our command...And we give you notice, that in case of your not submitting, as you are enjoined, you shall be liable to all the scourges of a disastrous war ...\nDone at our camp, the fourth of March in the third year of the French Republic, one and indivisible.\nJulien F\u00e9don, Of\ufb01cer of the Republic, appointed at Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Julien F\u00e9don, 4 March 1796|align=right|width=25em}}\n\nBy the morning of 4 March, the rebel army approached St George's. Drumming themselves on, they were heard at a distance; one commentator later wrote how the local [[militia]] declared they would defend their lives, families and properties or die in the attempt. It was, said the observer, \"a chaotic and most melancholy scene\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} A delegation comprising Nogues and Philip demanded access to the gubernatorial council; this was granted and they proceeded to make two proclamations. The first\u2014\"chillingly uncompromising\"\u2014was from F\u00e9don, demanding the British surrender. The next speech had been prepared by Victor Huges, emphasising the extent of his victory over the British at Guadaloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Time and the defeat of the English forces at Guadeloupe had weakened the remembrance of the heinous crimes by which the vile satellites of GEORGE had sullied the Windward Islands...that from and after the date of this our of\ufb01cial declaration, the assassination of each and every individual republican (of whatever colour he is; and in whatever island it may happen) shall be expiated by the death of two English of\ufb01cers, our prisoners.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Victor Huges to the British council in St George's, 4 March 1796|align=left|width=25em}}\n\nNogues and Philip were fed and watered by the British\u2014which \"they calmly enjoyed\"\u2014while the latter went into consultation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}} Outside, meanwhile, the rest of the gang that had accompanied them was becoming increasingly fractious and was being continually augmented by supporters in St George's. The British procrastinated, suggests Candlin, probably because the deputy governor, one McKenzie, was unused to taking command.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nThe rebels, who identified strongly with the French Revolution, wore [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour sashes]] and declaimed ''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|Libert\u00e9, equalit\u00e9 ou la mort]]'' (\"liberty, equality or death\") as their slogan,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} which was engraved on their brass helmets.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\nBy the end of the week, the rebel ranks had swollen to over 7,000 people, comprising coloured and black freemen, whites and self-emancipated.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n===British response===\nThe British, besieged in the south in the capital, [[St. George's, Grenada|St George's]], were taken by surprise, and this frustrated their efforts at a concerted response.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although in disarray, when the rebels called upon the administration to dissolve itself, the British were unwilling to do so.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although Nogues' and Philip's negotiations with McKenzie lasted three hours, they left with nothing tangible to show for it, and it is likely that the deputy governor expected reinforcements shortly. This belief enabled McKenzie to dismiss the rebels' demands, saying, \"with some stoicism...that any British governor, indeed any British subject, imprisoned or otherwise would rather die with honour than face the ignominy of surrendering an island to slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n==Course of the rebellion==\nThe rebels received further assistance from Hughes, in the form of armed squadrons, which had sufficient success to establish an administrative ''[[Department (country subdivision)|d\u00e9partment]]'' under the rebels' direct control.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}\n\nThe rebellion, argues Martin, \"raged for 15 months, and saw extreme brutality and destruction\" take place.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Many of the white french rebels surrendered to the British as the rebellion increased in ferocity; they may have felt more endangered from the rebels than from the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nAlthough the rebels massively outnumbered the British, F\u00e9don's side lacked the experienced tacticians and strategists possessed by the British, and their assaults\u2014while large-scale and brutal\u2014were disorganised.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although controlled most of the countryside, F\u00e9don's army was unable to displace the British from St George's, while the latter also had the advantage of [[Royal Navy|superior sea power]]. This was used to great effect, eventually cutting Grenada off from its supply lines to St Lucia and Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\nSickness, mostly from [[Yellow fever]], pervaded the British Army.{{refn|In [[British America|Colonial times]] and during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area. The mortality rate in British garrisons in [[Jamaica]] was seven times that of garrisons in Canada, mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases.{{sfn|McNeill|2002|pp=10\u201316}}|group=note}} In April, a British [[Brigadier-General]], [[Colin Lindsay]], was so distraught with the fever that he left his camp, went out into the rain, and shot himself.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n===Attack on Belvedere===\nIn May 1795, the British launched a surprise night-attack on F\u00e9don's Belvedere base with a force comprising reinforcements from [[Barbados]] and the sailors and marines from a passing British [[frigate]]; also present were a number of Spanish soldiers sent by the governor of [[Trinidad]] in sympathy. The army's commander, Lindsay, had killed himself, so the command fell to his inexperienced subordinate, Colonel Schaw. The British troops, in particular, were weakened by sickness, and this lost them the element of surprise they had relied on for victory.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}{{refn|They were not always weak with sickness; before the assault on Belvedere was finally launched, the attack had already been cancelled twice through the troops getting plastered on [[rum]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}|group=note}}\n\nThe fighting was bitter; the Belvedere Estate was situated on elevated ground and the British were at a severe tactical disadvantage. Their attack had dissipated by morning. The failure was the result, says Candlin, of \"poor coordination, coupled with bad weather and mere bad luck\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} In retaliation for the attack, F\u00e9don had 47 hostages in his care killed. This number included the island's governor, Ninian Home.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n==Support==\n===External===\nCommunication was maintained with fellow revolutionaries in Haiti, Guadaloupe{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[St Lucia]], although this was a somewhat \"uneasy relationship\", suggests Martin, as F\u00e9don, on the one hand, wanted as much assistance as he could receive, but on the other was wary of allowing external forces too much influence within his movement.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} As a result, he increasingly ignored the exhortations of his comrades on St Lucia to unity and enforced his own strategy and discipline.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\nIt seems likely, says Martin, that while French revolutionaries elsewhere in the Caribbean wanted more direct involvement in F\u00e9don's rebellion, he went to lengths to limit their active participation because \"he did not want checks on his own authority\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} He suggests, furthermore, that this backing was \"vital to the success of the rebellion, and it proved detrimental when British forces\nsucceeded in cutting it off\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}\n\n===Internal dissention===\nFrom almost the point the rebellion had been declared, rifts appeared in the ranks. In the first week, a mutinous rebel shot Lavalee, and was then himself [[Execution by firing squad|ordered executed]] by F\u00e9don. Martin suggests that internal relations went downhill rapidly on account of the rebels' failure to swiftly overcome the British forces.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Nogues, too, seems to have fallen out with the leadership relatively quickly; although an original member of the Commission of 24, he left it soon after the rebellion broke out.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin notes that the causes of Nogues' falling out with F\u00e9don is now unknown, but in a letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand urged him to strive for unity:{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We are pained to see how divided you are; the enemy will hear of it, and will take advantage of it to fall upon you and defeat you. Let ambition give way to love of the Republic. It is impossible for you all to be in charge; obey those who command you and do not force us to use harsh measures against you. Listen to our appeals, they are for your own good.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}}}\n\n[[Gaspar Goyrand]], in St Lucia, wrote that he had heard that \"several individuals have desired to act a part in this revolution, who, from a spirit of jealousy, of ambition, or the insanity of pride, have endeavoured to revive prejudices condemned to profound oblivion\".{{sfn|Hay|1823|p=44}} He reminded F\u00e9don that, for as long as his \"ambition [is] to wear epaulettes\" rather than unite his army, he was hurting the rebellion's chances.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n===Summoned by Goyrand===\nIn October 1795, Goyrand finally took action against F\u00e9don's increasing distancing. Goyrand ordered the dissolution of the Commission of 24 and summoned F\u00e9don to Guadeloupe. Nogues had brought charges against F\u00e9don, and Goyrand was investigating, but F\u00e9don failed to appear. As a result, he was stripped of his command of the French revolutionary troops in Grenada he had been sent, although he maintained his control of the freedmen and slaves.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n==Collapse of the rebellion==\nBy June 1796 the British had regained control of most of the island, and now, comments Martin, \"the might of the [[British Empire|Brotish Empire]] descended\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} The effectiveness of the British assault led to large losses among the slaves.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the collapse of the rebellion, around 200 rebels were either enslaved or executed in reprisal. Overall, approximately 25% of the island's slave population\u2014around 7,000 people\u2014died during the revolt. Another 500\u2014charged with being in possession of arms\u2014were sold off the island.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\nDue to the ultimate failure of the rebellion, it impossible for scholars to know what would have happened consequently. Martin suggests that the most likely immediate result would have been\u2014mirroring Haiti\u2014the abolishing of slavery.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\nGoyrand, in St Lucia, put the failing of the rebellion down to the rebels' lack of unity. In a later letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand told him that{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We had predicted, citizen, you are divided, you were overcome, thus re-join that love of the Republic to replace your ambitious desires. We want to send you forces to repair the loss that disunion has just made you.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}}}\n\nAs a result of his falling out with F\u00e9don, Nogues left Grenada and joined Goyrand's staff in St Lucia.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin argues that the ideological and strategic divisions within the rebel leadership fundamentally weakened it, and made it incapable of meeting the increasingly effective sorties of the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n==Historiography==\nThe main sources for scholars of F\u00e9don's Rebellion are original documents, mostly held at the [[National Archives (UK)|The National Arhives]] in [[Kew]], and a number of contemporary books. These are [[eye-witness]] descriptions of the rebellion, but are all from the perspective of the British, and, suggests Candlin, \"show a predictable bias to the eventual victors in the con\ufb02ict\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=5}} The most important near-contemporary source is a monograph by [[D. G. Garraway]] of 1877, in which he [[synthesizes]] the contemporary recollections. The rebellion remains, says Candlin however, \"of all the\nmajor slave revolts and insurrections in the Atlantic world...the least studied and the least mentioned\" in the literature.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nMartin argues that, while \"almost all analyses of [the rebellion] define it as a slave revolt or a revolt against the slave system\", the number of white French involved necessitates a far more nuanced view.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} Candlin has argued that \"in unleashing the power of the slaves, including their own, they [the rebel leaders] had betrayed everyone who remained loyal to the old system\". {{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nMartin has compared F\u00e9don's Rebellion with the 1979 [[Grenadian Revolution]] as being equally \"defining moments\" in the history of the country, both \"for what they set out to achieve and the impact they have had on Grenadian society ever since\",{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=1}} and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]]'s main base before the uprising was named camp F\u00e9don.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} Often considered second only to the Haitian Revolution in its regional significance, and many Grenadians, he suggests, see F\u00e9don as a [[Folk hero|national hero]]. Indeed, he suggests that those who led the revolution 200 years later saw themselves as part of a historical tradition that sprang from the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}}\n\nAlthough those slaves who joined F\u00e9don's army enjoyed a greater degree of freedom than they had, the vast majority of the island's slaves watched from the sidelines. Martin suggests that choosing the wrong side would mean harsh retaliation, and they chose to avoid this.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n==Memorials==\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brizan|first=G.

Although a significant number of slaves were involved, they fought on both sides.  The stated purpose of the rebellion was to create a black republic as had already occurred in neighbouring [[Haiti]] rather than to free slaves, so it is not properly called a [[slave rebellion]], although freedom of the slaves would have been a probable consequence of its success.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Julien F\u00e9don]],{{refn|Also given without the [[Acute accent]], and occasionally spelt Foedon or Feydon.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=xiv}}|group=note}} owner of a plantation in the mountainous interior of the island, and encouraged by [[French Revolution]]ary leaders on [[Guadeloupe]], the rebels seized control of most of the island ([[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital, was never taken), but were eventually crushed by a military expedition led by General [[Ralph Abercromby]].\n\n==Background==\nGrenada was formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=31}} The French [[French capture of Grenada 1779|re-captured the island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after [[Comte d'Estaing]] won the bloody land and naval [[Battle of Grenada]] in July 1779.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=44}} However, the island was restored to Britain with the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in 1783.{{sfn|Newman|Brown|1997|p=533}} The context of the country's political tribulations, argues Martin, was \"an oppressive slave plantation complex\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} The situation was worse for the [[Free people of color|black French]], argues Martin, as\u2014even though they were [[Freedman||free]]\u2014they were generally treated as third-class citizens by both white French and the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}} \n\nNews of the French revolution was, says the historian [[Kit Candlin]], \"particularly prescient\" in Grenada, especially as two-thirds of the 5,000 free population were French.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} The political upheavals in neighbouring Haiti provided the motivation for a similar rebellion in Grenada, and also provided a sufficient diversion to allow it to happen.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}} It was not, however, strictly a [[slave rebellion]]. In the aftermath, it was noted that perhaps only half the island's slave population had joined the rebels, the other half, comments Candlin, were \" found cowering in their\nplantations or discovered aimlessly wandering the island\u2019s roads, unsure of what to do\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\n==Causes of the revolution==\nInternal grievances, rather than external influence, were the fundamental cause of F\u00e9don's rebellion, argues the scholar John Angus Martin, being an \"anti-discriminatory rebellion for social, political and religious rights by the French who orchestrated and led the rebellion against the British colonial\ngovernment\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There were some external influences: the biggest was the [[French Revolution]] and its ideology, [[Tom Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', the revolt in Haiti and the general discontent that pervaded the Caribbean during the period.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The had been a smouldering discontent with the British administration for some time before the rebellion.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=1\u20132}} The rebellion, led as it was by slave owners and planters rather than the salves themselves indicates that the French revolution that inspired it was seen as a method of enabling social mobility for the French rather than to free slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nBritish governance of the island was becoming \"increasingly harsh\", suggests Martin, especially against the French inhabitants whose previous political and social influence and power was now increasingly restricted by the new management.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} Although the intention to allow a form of [[Representative government]] had been declared in a [[royal proclamation]],{{sfn|Muller|2017|p=139}} this was continually deferred due to British suspicions that any democratic assembly would be dominated by the French.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\n===Planning===\nIt is possible that the planning of the rebellion took up to 18 months. The conspiracy was composed of a [[kernal]] of around 50 individuals and of diverse social composition, including white [[bourgeoise]] and free-French blacks. No slaves, however, appear to have been involved in the planning stages of the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nSupplies were initially received by French revolutionaries in [[Guadeloupe]]\u2014including [[materiel]] and financing\u2014under [[Victor Hugues]].{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The conspiracy had been successfully hidden from the authorities, notes Martin, and \"it wasn't until the day leading up to the rebellion that some British residents began to notice unusual activities among the rebels, but by then it was too late to act\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nThe conspirators' headquarters was F\u00e9don's remote [[plantation]] in Belvedere Estate.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}\n\n===Participants===\nCandlin has estimated that around 12,500 slaves took an active role in the rebellion, or half the island's slave population.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}{{refn|Many others, she notes, \"hedged their bets or took opportunities as they came\", for instance, to escape the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}|group=note}} Although the slaves who revolted were doing so for with the aim of their own emancipation as their primary goal, they appear to have had a longer-term intention of abolishing the system itself.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There was, however, a \"stark diversity of ideas and personalities\" among them.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nLeaders included F\u00e9don's brother-in-law [[Charles Nogues]]{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[Jean Pierre Lavallee]], who were close friends with Victor Hughes; Hughes looked protected Nogues' son while the rebellion was ongoing.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} Nogues wasa prominent [[tailor]] on the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} Prominent whites included [[Clozier d'Arcuiel]], [[Jean Baptiste Olliviere]] and the [[Chevalier du Suze]] who were important strategists in the military campaign as well as its administration.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} As well as Nogue, leading freed men included [[Stanislaus Besson]], [[Etienne Ventour]], and [[Joachim Phillip]],{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} a coloured free [[Coloniser|planter]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} F\u00e9don appears to have come under internal criticism for a having a dictatorial approach.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\n====Leadership====\nF\u00e9don was both [[General]] of the army and head of the revolutionary council, known as the \"Commission of the 24\", which, despite concerns as to his dictatorial attitude, F\u00e9don does seem to have regularly requested advice from.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} The leadership element was particularly concentrated in residents of the parishes of [[Saint John Parish, Grenada|St John]] and [[Gouyave]]. F\u00e9don, for example, was from the latter, as were a number of \"prominent whites\" he associated with.{{sfn|Martin|2017|pp=13\u201314}} Another leading figure, [[Joachim Philip]], was, according to Candlin, a \"most interesting man\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}} From a large and extremely prosperous family of Greadan planters, he felt that he had been repeatedly ignored for office or patronage by the British administration.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\n==Outbreak and the first week of operations==\nF\u00e9don\u2014now holding the rank of General\u2014directed the opening assaults on the night of 2\u20133 March 1795,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} simultaneously attacking the towns of Gouyave and [[Grenville, Grenada|Grenville]], in the parishes of St John and St Andrew respectively.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} At the former, on the east of the island, a force of freedmen captured 40 British residents and withdrew with them to their headquarters in Belvedere. In the west, at Grenville, and led by F\u00e9don and Lavalee, the insurgents attacked and overran the town, killing 11 of the 15 British they discovered.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{refn|F\u00e9don later blamed this massacre on a non-existent French Revolutionary army he claimed had invaded.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}|group=note}} They also returned to Belvedere, capturing more hostages and gathering more support as they did.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} Only a few hours into the rebellion\u2014\"with a combination of planning and good fortune\", comments Martin\u2014they captured [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Grenada|the island's governor]], [[Ninian Home]]. This was not only a propaganda coup for the rebels but physically inhibited the British response to the rising by his enforced absence from leadership.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}\n\nThe rebels announced that any Frenchman who failed to join the insurrection would be deemed an enemy o the enterprise, outlawed and they goods confiscated.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}\n\n===Marching on St George's===\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Without entering into any detail of our rights, we summon you, and all the inhabitants, of every denomination in this colony, to surrender, within the space of two hours, to the republican forces under our command...And we give you notice, that in case of your not submitting, as you are enjoined, you shall be liable to all the scourges of a disastrous war ...\nDone at our camp, the fourth of March in the third year of the French Republic, one and indivisible.\nJulien F\u00e9don, Of\ufb01cer of the Republic, appointed at Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Julien F\u00e9don, 4 March 1796|align=right|width=25em}}\n\nBy the morning of 4 March, the rebel army approached St George's.

It was, said the observer, \"a chaotic and most melancholy scene\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} A delegation comprising Nogues and Philip demanded access to the gubernatorial council; this was granted and they proceeded to make two proclamations. The first\u2014\"chillingly uncompromising\"\u2014was from F\u00e9don, demanding the British surrender. The next speech had been prepared by Victor Huges, emphasising the extent of his victory over the British at Guadaloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Time and the defeat of the English forces at Guadeloupe had weakened the remembrance of the heinous crimes by which the vile satellites of GEORGE had sullied the Windward Islands...that from and after the date of this our of\ufb01cial declaration, the assassination of each and every individual republican (of whatever colour he is; and in whatever island it may happen) shall be expiated by the death of two English of\ufb01cers, our prisoners.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Victor Huges to the British council in St George's, 4 March 1796|align=left|width=25em}}\n\nNogues and Philip were fed and watered by the British\u2014which \"they calmly enjoyed\"\u2014while the latter went into consultation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}} Outside, meanwhile, the rest of the gang that had accompanied them was becoming increasingly fractious and was being continually augmented by supporters in St George's. The British procrastinated, suggests Candlin, probably because the deputy governor, one McKenzie, was unused to taking command.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}} \n\nThe rebels, who identified strongly with the French Revolution, wore [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour sashes]] and declaimed ''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|Libert\u00e9, equalit\u00e9 ou la mort]]'' (\"liberty, equality or death\") as their slogan,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} which was engraved on their brass helmets.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\nBy the end of the week, the rebel ranks had swollen to over 7,000 people, comprising coloured and black freemen, whites and self-emancipated.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} \n\n===British response===\nThe British, besieged in the south in the capital, [[St. George's, Grenada|St George's]], were taken by surprise, and this frustrated their efforts at a concerted response.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although in disarray, when the rebels called upon the administration to dissolve itself, the British were unwilling to do so.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although Nogues' and Philip's negotiations with McKenzie lasted three hours, they left with nothing tangible to show for it, and it is likely that the deputy governor expected reinforcements shortly. This belief enabled McKenzie to dismiss the rebels' demands, saying, \"with some stoicism...that any British governor, indeed any British subject, imprisoned or otherwise would rather die with honour than face the ignominy of surrendering an island to slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n==Course of the rebellion==\nThe rebels received further assistance from Hughes, in the form of armed squadrons, which had sufficient success to establish an administrative ''[[Department (country subdivision)|d\u00e9partment]]'' under the rebels' direct control.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}  \n\nThe rebellion, argues Martin, \"raged for 15 months, and saw extreme brutality and destruction\" take place.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Many of the white french rebels surrendered to the British as the rebellion increased in ferocity; they may have felt more endangered from the rebels than from the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} \n\nAlthough the rebels massively outnumbered the British, F\u00e9don's side lacked the experienced tacticians and strategists possessed by the British, and their assaults\u2014while large-scale and brutal\u2014were disorganised.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although controlled most of the countryside, F\u00e9don's army was unable to displace the British from St George's, while the latter also had the advantage of [[Royal Navy|superior sea power]]. This was used to great effect, eventually cutting Grenada off from its supply lines to St Lucia and Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\nSickness, mostly from [[Yellow fever]], pervaded the British Army.{{refn|In [[British America|Colonial times]] and during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area. The mortality rate in British garrisons in [[Jamaica]] was seven times that of garrisons in Canada, mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases.{{sfn|McNeill|2002|pp=10\u201316}}|group=note}} In April, a British [[Brigadier-General]], [[Colin Lindsay]], was so distraught with the fever that he left his camp, went out into the rain, and shot himself.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} \n\n===Attack on Belvedere===\nIn May 1795, the British launched a surprise night-attack on F\u00e9don's Belvedere base with a force comprising reinforcements from [[Barbados]] and the sailors and marines from a passing British [[frigate]]; also present were a number of Spanish soldiers sent by the governor of [[Trinidad]] in sympathy. The army's commander, Lindsay, had killed himself, so the command fell to his inexperienced subordinate, Colonel Schaw. The British troops, in particular, were weakened by sickness, and this lost them the element of surprise they had relied on for victory.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}{{refn|They were not always weak with sickness; before the assault on Belvedere was finally launched, the attack had already been cancelled twice through the troops getting plastered on [[rum]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}|group=note}} \n\nThe fighting was bitter; the Belvedere Estate was situated on elevated ground and the British were at a severe tactical disadvantage. Their attack had dissipated by morning. The failure was the result, says Candlin, of \"poor coordination, coupled with bad weather and mere bad luck\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} In retaliation for the attack, F\u00e9don had 47 hostages in his care killed. This number included the island's governor, Ninian Home.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n==Support==\n===External===\nCommunication was maintained with fellow revolutionaries in Haiti, Guadaloupe{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[St Lucia]], although this was a somewhat \"uneasy relationship\", suggests Martin, as F\u00e9don, on the one hand, wanted as much assistance as he could receive, but on the other was wary of allowing external forces too much influence within his movement.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} As a result, he increasingly ignored the exhortations of his comrades on St Lucia to unity and enforced his own strategy and discipline.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\nIt seems likely, says Martin, that while French revolutionaries elsewhere in the Caribbean wanted more direct involvement in F\u00e9don's rebellion, he went to lengths to limit their active participation because \"he did not want checks on his own authority\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} He suggests, furthermore, that this backing was \"vital to the success of the rebellion, and it proved detrimental when British forces\nsucceeded in cutting it off\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}\n\n===Internal dissention===\nFrom almost the point the rebellion had been declared, rifts appeared in the ranks. In the first week, a mutinous rebel shot Lavalee, and was then himself [[Execution by firing squad|ordered executed]] by F\u00e9don. Martin suggests that internal relations went downhill rapidly on account of the rebels' failure to swiftly overcome the British forces.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Nogues, too, seems to have fallen out with the leadership relatively quickly; although an original member of the Commission of 24, he left it soon after the rebellion broke out.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin notes that the causes of Nogues' falling out with F\u00e9don is now unknown, but in a letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand urged him to strive for unity:{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We are pained to see how divided you are; the enemy will hear of it, and will take advantage of it to fall upon you and defeat you. Let ambition give way to love of the Republic. It is impossible for you all to be in charge; obey those who command you and do not force us to use harsh measures against you. Listen to our appeals, they are for your own good.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}}}\n\n[[Gaspar Goyrand]], in St Lucia, wrote that he had heard that \"several individuals have desired to act a part in this revolution, who, from a spirit of jealousy, of ambition, or the insanity of pride, have endeavoured to revive prejudices condemned to profound oblivion\".{{sfn|Hay|1823|p=44}} He reminded F\u00e9don that, for as long as his \"ambition [is] to wear epaulettes\" rather than unite his army, he was hurting the rebellion's chances.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n===Summoned by Goyrand===\nIn October 1795, Goyrand finally took action against F\u00e9don's increasing distancing. Goyrand ordered the dissolution of the Commission of 24 and summoned F\u00e9don to Guadeloupe. Nogues had brought charges against F\u00e9don, and Goyrand was investigating, but F\u00e9don failed to appear. As a result, he was stripped of his command of the French revolutionary troops in Grenada he had been sent, although he maintained his control of the freedmen and slaves.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n==Collapse of the rebellion==\nBy June 1796 the British had regained control of most of the island, and now, comments Martin, \"the might of the [[British Empire|Brotish Empire]] descended\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} The effectiveness of the British assault led to large losses among the slaves.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the collapse of the rebellion, around 200 rebels were either enslaved or executed in reprisal. Overall, approximately 25% of the island's slave population\u2014around 7,000 people\u2014died during the revolt. Another 500\u2014charged with being in possession of arms\u2014were sold off the island.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\nDue to the ultimate failure of the rebellion, it impossible for scholars to know what would have happened consequently. Martin suggests that the most likely immediate result would have been\u2014mirroring Haiti\u2014the abolishing of slavery.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\nGoyrand, in St Lucia, put the failing of the rebellion down to the rebels' lack of unity. In a later letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand told him that{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We had predicted, citizen, you are divided, you were overcome, thus re-join that love of the Republic to replace your ambitious desires. We want to send you forces to repair the loss that disunion has just made you.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}}}\n\nAs a result of his falling out with F\u00e9don, Nogues left Grenada and joined Goyrand's staff in St Lucia.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin argues that the ideological and strategic divisions within the rebel leadership fundamentally weakened it, and made it incapable of meeting the increasingly effective sorties of the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n==Historiography==\nThe main sources for scholars of F\u00e9don's Rebellion are original documents, mostly held at the [[National Archives (UK)|The National Arhives]] in [[Kew]], and a number of contemporary books. These are [[eye-witness]] descriptions of the rebellion, but are all from the perspective of the British, and, suggests Candlin, \"show a predictable bias to the eventual victors in the con\ufb02ict\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=5}} The most important near-contemporary source is a monograph by [[D. G. Garraway]] of 1877, in which he [[synthesizes]] the contemporary recollections. The rebellion remains, says Candlin however, \"of all the\nmajor slave revolts and insurrections in the Atlantic world...the least studied and the least mentioned\" in the literature.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nMartin argues that, while \"almost all analyses of [the rebellion] define it as a slave revolt or a revolt against the slave system\", the number of white French involved necessitates a far more nuanced view.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} Candlin has argued that \"in unleashing the power of the slaves, including their own, they [the rebel leaders] had betrayed everyone who remained loyal to the old system\". {{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nMartin has compared F\u00e9don's Rebellion with the 1979 [[Grenadian Revolution]] as being equally \"defining moments\" in the history of the country, both \"for what they set out to achieve and the impact they have had on Grenadian society ever since\",{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=1}} and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]]'s main base before the uprising was named camp F\u00e9don.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} Often considered second only to the Haitian Revolution in its regional significance, and many Grenadians, he suggests, see F\u00e9don as a [[Folk hero|national hero]]. Indeed, he suggests that those who led the revolution 200 years later saw themselves as part of a historical tradition that sprang from the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}}  \n\nAlthough those slaves who joined F\u00e9don's army enjoyed a greater degree of freedom than they had, the vast majority of the island's slaves watched from the sidelines. Martin suggests that choosing the wrong side would mean harsh retaliation, and they chose to avoid this.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}  \n\n==Memorials==\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brizan|first=G.
