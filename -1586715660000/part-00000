Retrieved 2011-03-16.</ref> Most of the creek above [[Lake Piru]] is located in the [[Los Padres National Forest]]. There are two major [[reservoir]]s on Piru Creek, Lake Piru and [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]], which respectively store water for local irrigation and the [[California State Water Project]].\n\n==Course==\nPiru Creek originates as several small springs on the north side of [[Pine Mountain Ridge (California)|Pine Mountain Ridge]] in the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]], in the Los Padres National Forest. It flows eastwards through a gentle valley, where it is joined by Cedar Creek from the right. After the Cedar Creek confluence the stream turns northeast, receives Sheep Creek from the left, and Mutau Creek from the right. Piru Creek receives Lockwood Creek from the left at Sunset [[campground]] on Lockwood Flat, and flows east into a canyon where the valley walls pull in and rise steeper and higher above the river.<ref name=\"topoquest\">{{cite web \n|author = [[United States Geological Survey]] \n|title = United States Geological Survey Topographic Maps \n| publisher = [[TopoQuest]] \n| url = http://www.topoquest.com/map.php\n| accessdate = 2010-03-28}}</ref><ref name=\"ACMEmapper\">{{cite map\n|publisher=ACME Mapper\n|title=USGS Topo Maps for United States\n|year=\n|cartography=[[United States Geological Survey]]\n|accessdate=2010-03-28\n|url=http://mapper.acme.com/}}</ref>\n\nThe Smith Fork of Piru Creek, with headwaters in the [[San Emigdio Mountains]], comes in from the left about {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of [[Gorman, California|Gorman]]. Piru Creek then turns sharply southeast and enters the [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]] reservoir impounded behind [[Pyramid Dam]], which stores imported water from the West Branch of the [[California Aqueduct]] for Ventura County and Los Angeles County. [[Interstate 5]] runs almost a {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above the east side of the reservoir/former canyon.\n\nBelow Pyramid Dam, Piru Creek maintains a relatively constant flow due to releases of reservoir water. It turns south and flows through the [[Topatopa Mountains]] via the Piru Gorge and along old route of [[U.S. Route 99 in California|Hwy 99]]\u2212Pyramid Dam Road, forming the boundary between Mount Pinos and Saugus Ranger Districts of the [[Los Padres National Forest]] and dropping over Piru Creek Falls.<ref name=\"topoquest\"/><ref name=\"ACMEmapper\"/><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Waterfalls-Southern-Central-California/dp/0971281424 \"The Definitive Guide to the Waterfalls of Southern and Central California\"], Chris Shaffer, 1997; {{ISBN|0971281424}}.</ref>\n\nThe creek flows south, still along the route of old Hwy 99\u2212Pyramid Dam Road and through Cherry Canyon, to Frenchman's Flat and the confluence with Osito Creek (left). The creek turns sharply to the west entering another gorge, then south through it where it receives from the right Fish Creek of the northeastern [[Cobblestone Mountain (California)|Cobblestone Mountain]] watershed, ephemeral Turtle Creek (right) and Michael Creek (left), and then from the right Agua Blanca Creek of the western and southern Cobblestone Mountain watershed. It crosses the boundary between [[Los Angeles County]] and [[Ventura County]] five times before leaving the Los Padres National Forest and being impounded behind [[Santa Felicia Dam]] in [[Lake Piru]], the second reservoir on the creek.\n\nBelow this point the canyon widens and the creek becomes a wide gravelly [[Arroyo (creek)|wash]]. It reaches the [[Santa Clara River Valley]] at the town of [[Piru, California|Piru]], and crosses under [[California State Route 126|State Route 126]] to join the Santa Clara River.<ref name=\"topoquest\"/><ref name=\"ACMEmapper\"/>\n\n==History==\nThousands of years ago, Native Americans of the [[Chumash people|Chumash group]] lived in the area, but by 500&nbsp;CE, their former territory along Piru Creek had been occupied by the [[Tataviam people|Tataviam]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It is believed that there were once up to 25 Native American villages on the river, of which eight have been thoroughly studied.

There are two major [[reservoir]]s on Piru Creek, Lake Piru and [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]], which respectively store water for local irrigation and the [[California State Water Project]].\n\n==Course==\nPiru Creek originates as several small springs on the north side of [[Pine Mountain Ridge (California)|Pine Mountain Ridge]] in the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]], in the Los Padres National Forest. It flows eastwards through a gentle valley, where it is joined by Cedar Creek from the right. After the Cedar Creek confluence the stream turns northeast, receives Sheep Creek from the left, and Mutau Creek from the right. Piru Creek receives Lockwood Creek from the left at Sunset [[campground]] on Lockwood Flat, and flows east into a canyon where the valley walls pull in and rise steeper and higher above the river.<ref name=\"topoquest\">{{cite web \n|author = [[United States Geological Survey]] \n|title = United States Geological Survey Topographic Maps \n| publisher = [[TopoQuest]] \n| url = http://www.topoquest.com/map.php\n| accessdate = 2010-03-28}}</ref><ref name=\"ACMEmapper\">{{cite map\n|publisher=ACME Mapper\n|title=USGS Topo Maps for United States\n|year=\n|cartography=[[United States Geological Survey]]\n|accessdate=2010-03-28\n|url=http://mapper.acme.com/}}</ref>\n\nThe Smith Fork of Piru Creek, with headwaters in the [[San Emigdio Mountains]], comes in from the left about {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of [[Gorman, California|Gorman]]. Piru Creek then turns sharply southeast and enters the [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]] reservoir impounded behind [[Pyramid Dam]], which stores imported water from the West Branch of the [[California Aqueduct]] for Ventura County and Los Angeles County. [[Interstate 5]] runs almost a {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above the east side of the reservoir/former canyon.\n\nBelow Pyramid Dam, Piru Creek maintains a relatively constant flow due to releases of reservoir water. It turns south and flows through the [[Topatopa Mountains]] via the Piru Gorge and along old route of [[U.S. Route 99 in California|Hwy 99]]\u2212Pyramid Dam Road, forming the boundary between Mount Pinos and Saugus Ranger Districts of the [[Los Padres National Forest]] and dropping over Piru Creek Falls.<ref name=\"topoquest\"/><ref name=\"ACMEmapper\"/><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Waterfalls-Southern-Central-California/dp/0971281424 \"The Definitive Guide to the Waterfalls of Southern and Central California\"], Chris Shaffer, 1997; {{ISBN|0971281424}}.</ref>\n\nThe creek flows south, still along the route of old Hwy 99\u2212Pyramid Dam Road and through Cherry Canyon, to Frenchman's Flat and the confluence with Osito Creek (left). The creek turns sharply to the west entering another gorge, then south through it where it receives from the right Fish Creek of the northeastern [[Cobblestone Mountain (California)|Cobblestone Mountain]] watershed, ephemeral Turtle Creek (right) and Michael Creek (left), and then from the right Agua Blanca Creek of the western and southern Cobblestone Mountain watershed. It crosses the boundary between [[Los Angeles County]] and [[Ventura County]] five times before leaving the Los Padres National Forest and being impounded behind [[Santa Felicia Dam]] in [[Lake Piru]], the second reservoir on the creek.\n\nBelow this point the canyon widens and the creek becomes a wide gravelly [[Arroyo (creek)|wash]]. It reaches the [[Santa Clara River Valley]] at the town of [[Piru, California|Piru]], and crosses under [[California State Route 126|State Route 126]] to join the Santa Clara River.<ref name=\"topoquest\"/><ref name=\"ACMEmapper\"/>\n\n==History==\nThousands of years ago, Native Americans of the [[Chumash people|Chumash group]] lived in the area, but by 500&nbsp;CE, their former territory along Piru Creek had been occupied by the [[Tataviam people|Tataviam]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It is believed that there were once up to 25 Native American villages on the river, of which eight have been thoroughly studied.

At one of the literary meetings organized in his area, he met with the Albanian writer [[Sterjo Spasse]]. Spasse's words \"Lexo sa m\u00eb shum\u00eb, dhe provo t\u00eb shkruash!\" (Read as much as you can, and try writing!) had a significant impact on him, increased his curiosity, and forged his will of becoming a writer. Zoto writing on the impressions of his encounter with Spasse was sent to the newspaper ''Z\u00ebri i Rinis\u00eb'' (Voice of Youth), but wasn't published. Nevertheless, he continued writing short stories.<ref name=\"Dielli\"/>\nHe sent his first collection of stories to the other Albanian writer, Sotir Andoni who was from the same town, who helped with further instructions on how to improve the technique of story-writing. With the membership and active frequentation of the literary class of the Culture Palace (Alb: ''Pallati i Kultur\u00ebs'') in [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]], came a big jump in the quality of his works. There he came in contact and befriended other future writers as [[Teodor La\u00e7o]] and Ko\u00e7i Petriti.<ref name=\"Dielli\"/><ref>{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fa9DAQAAIAAJ&q=petraq+zoto&dq=petraq+zoto&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXxsLerM_JAhVkoYMKHduADZw4FBDoAQhPMAY| title=Koh\u00eb p\u00ebr t\u00eb kujtuar, koh\u00eb p\u00ebr t\u00eb harruar: sh\u00ebnime politike e letrare, 1997-1998| author=Teodor La\u00e7o| publisher=Botimet Toena| year=1998|page=65| isbn=9789992710647|location=Tirana| oclc=45330045}}</ref>\n<br>His first published story was in the [[almanac]] ''Kor\u00e7a letrare'' (Literary Kor\u00e7\u00eb), selected by the writer  Andon Mara.

There he worked, created, and was affirmed as a writer and director in the culture field. For over 30 years he served as director of the Culture Palace in Kor\u00e7\u00eb, followed by the Kor\u00e7\u00eb Theater, until 1990 when he was fired on direct orders of one of the [[Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania|politburo members]], due to a recital of [[Lindita Theodhori]] which was considered \"too modernist\".<ref name=\"Yzeiri\"/> He was also chairman of the local branch of the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists|League of Writers and Artists]], which comprised approximately 120 writers and poets as members. Inspired by the patriotic work of [[Themistokli G\u00ebrmenji]], [[Mihal Grameno]], Jovan Kosturi, [[Sevasti Qiriazi]], and others, he published in 1981 a collection of historical stories.<ref name=\"Dielli\"/>\n<br>Since 2000, Zoto lived in [[Tirana]]. During 2001-2005, he worked as editor of the \"M\u00ebsonj\u00ebtorja\" publishing house there.<ref name=\"Devolli\"/> He continued to write till his last moments, and died in 2015 in Tirana.\n\n==Profile==\nZoto's moto was \"The literature is not a battlefield, where the writers struggle to grab the trophies from one another, but a huge field where each one works his own parcel, waters it, takes care of it, and at the end harvests its desired fruits. So, each one has his/her own part, can contribute, in other words, introduce a new literary value with every new book\".\nZoto created real personages based on his own personal experience, also on his life events, his ancestors, and influenced by the elite of the writers of Kor\u00e7\u00eb region, such as Sterjo Spasse, [[Dritero Agolli]], Sotir Andoni, Vasil Xha\u00e7ka, Teodor La\u00e7o, Vangjush Ziko, Petraq Kolevica, Petraq Samsuri, etc.<ref name=\"Dielli\"/>\n\nAs one of the pioneers of the short stories genre of the [[Albanian literature]], he is established as a strong narrator, who possessed the ability and literary strength of creating realistic personages with a sharp sense of both \"the possible\" and \"the unpredictable\". He always focused on difficult subjects, transforming them into stories which transmit hope and positivism.<ref name=\"Dielli\"/>\n\n==Work==\n'''Collections of stories'''\n*''Tirka'', 1966, publisher in two volumes:\n**''M\u00ebsuesi im i par\u00eb''' (My first teacher), Tirana: Sht\u00ebpia Botonj\u00ebse \"Naim Frash\u00ebri\", 1966.\n**''Nd\u00ebrgjegjja'' (Conscience), Tirana: Sht\u00ebpia Botonj\u00ebse \"Naim Frash\u00ebri\", 1967.\n*''Dritat nuk u shuan'' (The lights didn't turn off), Tirana: Sht\u00ebpia Botonj\u00ebse \"Naim Frash\u00ebri\", 1967.

At one of the literary meetings organized in his area, he met with the Albanian writer [[Sterjo Spasse]]. Spasse's words \"Lexo sa m\u00eb shum\u00eb, dhe provo t\u00eb shkruash!\" (Read as much as you can, and try writing!) had a significant impact on him, increased his curiosity, and forged his will of becoming a writer. Zoto writing on the impressions of his encounter with Spasse was sent to the newspaper ''Z\u00ebri i Rinis\u00eb'' (Voice of Youth), but wasn't published. Nevertheless, he continued writing short stories.<ref name=\"Dielli\"/>\nHe sent his first collection of stories to the other Albanian writer, Sotir Andoni who was from the same town, who helped with further instructions on how to improve the technique of story-writing. With the membership and active frequentation of the literary class of the Culture Palace (Alb: ''Pallati i Kultur\u00ebs'') in [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]], came a big jump in the quality of his works.

There he worked, created, and was affirmed as a writer and director in the culture field. For over 30 years he served as director of the Culture Palace in Kor\u00e7\u00eb, followed by the Kor\u00e7\u00eb Theater, until 1990 when he was fired on direct orders of one of the [[Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania|politburo members]], due to a recital of [[Lindita Theodhori]] which was considered \"too modernist\".<ref name=\"Yzeiri\"/> He was also chairman of the local branch of the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists|League of Writers and Artists]], which comprised approximately 120 writers and poets as members. Inspired by the patriotic work of [[Themistokli G\u00ebrmenji]], [[Mihal Grameno]], Jovan Kosturi, [[Sevasti Qiriazi]], and others, he published in 1981 a collection of historical stories.<ref name=\"Dielli\"/>\n<br>Since 2000, Zoto lived in [[Tirana]]. During 2001-2005, he worked as editor of the \"M\u00ebsonj\u00ebtorja\" publishing house there.<ref name=\"Devolli\"/> He continued to write till his last moments, and died in 2015 in Tirana.\n\n==Profile==\nZoto's moto was \"The literature is not a battlefield, where the writers struggle to grab the trophies from one another, but a huge field where each one works his own parcel, waters it, takes care of it, and at the end harvests its desired fruits. So, each one has his/her own part, can contribute, in other words, introduce a new literary value with every new book\".\nZoto created real personages based on his own personal experience, also on his life events, his ancestors, and influenced by the elite of the writers of Kor\u00e7\u00eb region, such as Sterjo Spasse, [[Dritero Agolli]], Sotir Andoni, Vasil Xha\u00e7ka, Teodor La\u00e7o, Vangjush Ziko, Petraq Kolevica, Petraq Samsuri, etc.<ref name=\"Dielli\"/>\n\nAs one of the pioneers of the short stories genre of the [[Albanian literature]], he is established as a strong narrator, who possessed the ability and literary strength of creating realistic personages with a sharp sense of both \"the possible\" and \"the unpredictable\".
