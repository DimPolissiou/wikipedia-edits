It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] species of the [[genus]] '''''Dicerorhinus'''''. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands {{convert|112|-|145|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of {{convert|2.36|-|3.18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a tail of {{convert|35|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The weight is reported to range from {{convert|500|to|1000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, averaging {{convert|700|-|800|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, although there is a single record of a {{convert|2000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} specimen. Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.\n\nMembers of the species once inhabited [[rainforests]], [[swamp]]s, and [[cloud forest]]s in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China.

No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting. [[territorial marking|Marking their territories]] is done by scraping soil with their feet, bending saplings into distinctive patterns, and leaving excrement. The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating, at dawn, and just after dusk. During the day, they [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mud baths to cool down and rest. In the [[rainy season]], they move to higher elevations; in the cooler months, they return to lower areas in their range.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/> When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from [[ectoparasite]]s and other insects. Captive specimens, deprived of adequate wallowing, have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, [[suppuration]]s, eye problems, inflamed nails, and hair loss, and have eventually died. One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80\u2013300 minutes (an average of 166 minutes) per day spent in wallows.<ref name=Wallows>{{cite journal| title = Wallows and Wallow Utilization of the Sumatran Rhinoceros (''Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis'') in a Natural Enclosure in Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia | year = 2001 | journal = Journal of Wildlife and Parks | volume = 19 | pages = 7\u201312 | last = Julia Ng | first = S.C. |author2=Z.

Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, [[urination]], and increased physical contact, with both male and female using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the [[black rhinoceros]]. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.<ref name=ZZ2005>{{cite journal |last1=Zainal Zahari |first1=Z. |last2=Rosnina |first2=Y. |last3=Wahid |first3=H. |last4=Yap |first4=K.

In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.<ref name=LitStud/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Commons|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Mammals}}\n*[http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/species/sumatran-rhino/ Sumatran Rhino Info] & [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=imgs&CODE=tax_images&taxon=8 Sumatran Rhino Pictures] on the [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com Rhino Resource Center]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111180859/http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Dicerorhinus_sumatrensis/ Sumatran Rhino] at [[Arkive]].\n*[http://www.rhinoandforestfund.org Rhino and Forest Fund]\n*[http://www.borneorhinoalliance.org Borneo Rhino Alliance]\n*[http://www.michielhegener.nl/maps/Sumatraanse-neushoorn-def.pdf distribution map 2017]\n*[https://savesumatranrhinos.org/#reverseDecline Map by The National Geographic, 2018]\n\n{{Perissodactyla}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29220}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Southeast Asia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Sumatra|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Borneo|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of India|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Indonesia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Malaysia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1814]]\n[[Category:Critically endangered fauna of Asia]]\n[[Category:EDGE species|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Miocene mammals]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Hairy rhinoceros|the extinct megafauna|woolly rhinoceros}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Endangered species of small Asian rhinoceros}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date = November 2019}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = Sumatran rhinoceros<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Perissodactyla |id=14100054 |page=635}}</ref>\n| fossil_range = {{Fossilrange|Early Pleistocene|Recent}}\n| image = Sumatran Rhinoceros at Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary Lampung Indonesia 2013.JPG\n| image_caption = Sumatran rhinoceros at Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Lampung, Indonesia\n| status = CR\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=IUCN/>\n| status2 = CITES_A1\n| status2_system = CITES\n| status2_ref = <ref>''[https://cites.org/eng/node/21233 Dicerorhinus sumatrensis]'' Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</ref>\n| genus = Dicerorhinus\n| species = sumatrensis\n| authority = ([[Johann Fischer von Waldheim|Fischer]], 1814)<ref name=Taxhistory/>\n<imagemap>\nimage:Sumatran Rhinoceros Range.svg.png|250px|Sumatran rhino range \ncircle 320 510 12 [[Taman Negara National Park]]\ncircle 595 505 12 [[Tabin Wildlife Reserve]]\ncircle 250 550 12 [[Gunung Leuser National Park]]\ncircle 315 660 12 [[Kerinci Seblat National Park]]\ncircle 355 712 12 [[Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park]]\ncircle 375 700 12 [[Way Kambas National Park]]\n\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n<center><small>\nSumatran rhinoceros range (excluding population in [[East Kalimantan]]) <ref>Derived from range maps in:\n* {{cite book | last = Foose | first = Thomas J. and [[van Strien, Nico]] | year = 1997 | title = Asian Rhinos \u2013 Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan | publisher = [[IUCN]], Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, UK | isbn = 2-8317-0336-0}}<br>and\n* {{cite book | title = The Return of the Unicorns; The Natural History and Conservation of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros | last = Dinerstein | first = Eric | publisher = [[Columbia University Press]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-231-08450-1 }}<br>This map does not include unconfirmed historical sightings in Laos and Vietnam or possible remaining populations in Burma.</ref></small></center>\n| subdivision_ranks = Subspecies\n| subdivision = *''[[D. s. harrissoni]]'' <small>Groves, 1965</small>\n*''D. s. sumatrensis'' <small>Fischer, 1814</small>\n*''D. s. lasiotis'' <small>Buckland, 1872</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''Sumatran rhinoceros''', also known as the '''hairy rhinoceros''' or '''Asian two-horned rhinoceros''' (''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis''), is a rare member of the family [[Rhinocerotidae]] and one of five extant species of [[rhinoceros]]. It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] species of the [[genus]] '''''Dicerorhinus'''''. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands {{convert|112|-|145|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of {{convert|2.36|-|3.18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a tail of {{convert|35|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The weight is reported to range from {{convert|500|to|1000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, averaging {{convert|700|-|800|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, although there is a single record of a {{convert|2000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} specimen. Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.\n\nMembers of the species once inhabited [[rainforests]], [[swamp]]s, and [[cloud forest]]s in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China.

No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting. [[territorial marking|Marking their territories]] is done by scraping soil with their feet, bending saplings into distinctive patterns, and leaving excrement. The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating, at dawn, and just after dusk. During the day, they [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mud baths to cool down and rest. In the [[rainy season]], they move to higher elevations; in the cooler months, they return to lower areas in their range.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/> When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from [[ectoparasite]]s and other insects. Captive specimens, deprived of adequate wallowing, have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, [[suppuration]]s, eye problems, inflamed nails, and hair loss, and have eventually died. One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80\u2013300 minutes (an average of 166 minutes) per day spent in wallows.<ref name=Wallows>{{cite journal| title = Wallows and Wallow Utilization of the Sumatran Rhinoceros (''Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis'') in a Natural Enclosure in Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia | year = 2001 | journal = Journal of Wildlife and Parks | volume = 19 | pages = 7\u201312 | last = Julia Ng | first = S.C. |author2=Z.

Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, [[urination]], and increased physical contact, with both male and female using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the [[black rhinoceros]]. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.<ref name=ZZ2005>{{cite journal |last1=Zainal Zahari |first1=Z. |last2=Rosnina |first2=Y. |last3=Wahid |first3=H. |last4=Yap |first4=K.

In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.<ref name=LitStud/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Commons|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Mammals}}\n*[http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/species/sumatran-rhino/ Sumatran Rhino Info] & [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=imgs&CODE=tax_images&taxon=8 Sumatran Rhino Pictures] on the [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com Rhino Resource Center]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111180859/http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Dicerorhinus_sumatrensis/ Sumatran Rhino] at [[Arkive]].\n*[http://www.rhinoandforestfund.org Rhino and Forest Fund]\n*[http://www.borneorhinoalliance.org Borneo Rhino Alliance]\n*[http://www.michielhegener.nl/maps/Sumatraanse-neushoorn-def.pdf distribution map 2017]\n*[https://savesumatranrhinos.org/#reverseDecline Map by The National Geographic, 2018]\n\n{{Perissodactyla}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29220}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Southeast Asia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Sumatra|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Borneo|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of India|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Indonesia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Malaysia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1814]]\n[[Category:Critically endangered fauna of Asia]]\n[[Category:EDGE species|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Miocene mammals]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n", "name_user": "AuH2ORepublican", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDistribution and habitat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_rhinoceros"}

{"title_page": "Indeterminacy (music)", "text_new": "{{Use Harvard referencing|date=May 2019}}\n'''Indeterminacy''' is a composing approach in which some aspects of a musical work are left open to chance or to the interpreter's free choice. [[John Cage]], a pioneer of indeterminacy, defined it as \"the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways\".\n\nThe earliest significant use of music indeterminacy features is found in many of the compositions of American composer [[Charles Ives]] in the early 20th century. [[Henry Cowell]] adopted Ives\u2019s ideas during the 1930s, in works allowing players to arrange the fragments of music in a number of different possible sequences. Beginning in the early 1950s, the term came to refer to the (mostly American) movement which grew up around Cage. This group included the other members of the [[New York School (art)#The composers|New York School]]. In Europe, following the introduction of the expression \"[[aleatory music]]\" by Meyer-Eppler, the French composer [[Pierre Boulez]] was largely responsible for popularizing the term.\n\n==Definition==\nDescribing indeterminacy, composer John Cage said: \"My intention is to let things be themselves\". Cage initially defined indeterminacy as \"the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways\" {{harv|Pritchett|1993|loc=108}}. Bryan Simms thus conflates indeterminacy with what Cage called chance composition when he claims that \"Any part of a musical work is indeterminate if it is chosen by chance, or if its performance is not precisely specified. The former case is called 'indeterminacy of composition'; the latter is called 'indeterminacy of performance'\" {{harv|Simms|1986|loc=357}}.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest significant use of music indeterminacy features is found in many of the compositions of American composer [[Charles Ives]] in the early 20th century. [[Henry Cowell]] adopted Ives's ideas during the 1930s, in such works as the ''Mosaic Quartet'' (String Quartet No. 3, 1934), which allows the players to arrange the fragments of music in a number of different possible sequences. Cowell also used specially devised notations to introduce variability into the performance of a work, sometimes instructing the performers to improvise a short passage or play ''ad libitum.'' [[John Cage]] is regarded as a pioneer of indeterminacy in music. Beginning in the early 1950s, the term came to refer to the (mostly American) movement which grew up around Cage. This group included the other members of the so-called [[New York School (art)#The composers|New York School]]: [[Earle Brown]], [[Morton Feldman]] and [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]]. Others working in this way included the [[Scratch Orchestra]] in the United Kingdom (1968 until the early 1970s) and the Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]] (born 1933). In Europe, following the introduction of the expression \"[[aleatory music]]\" by [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]], the French composer [[Pierre Boulez]] was largely responsible for popularizing the term {{harv|Boulez|1957}}.\n\nIn 1958 Cage gave two lectures in Europe, the first at Darmstadt, titled simply \"Indeterminacy\" {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=35\u201340}}, the second in Brussels called \"Indeterminacy: New Aspect of Form in Instrumental and Electronic Music\" (given again in an expanded form in 1959 at Teacher's College, Columbia). This second lecture consisted of a number of short stories (originally 30, expanded to ninety in the second version), each story read by Cage in exactly one minute; because of this time limit, the speed of Cage's delivery varied enormously {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=260}}. The second performance and a subsequent recording {{harv|Cage|1959}} contained music, also by Cage, played by [[David Tudor]] at the same time. Subsequently, Cage added still more stories, and published a selection of them, partly as an article, \"Indeterminacy\" {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=260\u201373}}, and partly as scattered interludes throughout his first collection of writings, ''Silence'' {{harv|Cage|1961}}.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the Dutch artist [[Iebele Abel]] developed an electronic instrument called ''Real-time Indeterminate Synthetic Music Feedback'' (RT-ISMF). The instrument was designed for empirical research on subjective experiences induced by real-time synthesized music, based on the output of electronic random number generators. The basic idea of this approach was that indeterminate music might evoke unique and exceptional human experience {{harv|Abel|2013|loc=26, 117\u201319}}.\n\n==Classification==\nIndeterminate or chance music can be divided into three groups: (1) the use of random procedures to produce a determinate, fixed score, (2) mobile form, and (3) indeterminate notation, including graphic notation and texts. The first group includes scores in which the chance element is involved only in the process of composition, so that every parameter is fixed before their performance. In John Cage\u2019s ''[[Music of Changes]]'' (1951), the process of composition involved applying decisions made using the ''[[I Ching]]'', a Chinese classic text that is commonly used as a divination system. The ''I Ching'' was applied to large charts of sounds, durations, dynamics, tempo and densities. Cage himself, however, regarded ''Music of Changes'' as a determinate work, because it is completely fixed from one performance to another {{harv|Pritchett|1993|loc=108}}. [[Iannis Xenakis]] used probability theories to define some microscopic aspects of ''[[Pithoprakta]]'' (1955\u201356), that is the Greek for \"actions by means of probability\". This work contains four sections, characterized by textural and timbral attributes, such as glissandi and pizzicati. At the macroscopic level, the sections are designed and controlled by the composer, but the single components of sound are generated by mathematical theories {{harv|Joe and Song|2002|loc=268}}. See: [[stochastic music]].\n\nIn the second type of indeterminate music (the only type of indeterminate music according to Cage's definition), chance elements involve the performance. Notated events are provided by the composer, but their arrangement is left to the determination of the performer. According to Cage,  examples include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Art of Fugue]]'', Morton Feldman's ''Intersection 3'', Earle Brown's ''Four Systems'', and Christian Wolff's ''Duo for Pianists II'' {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=35\u201339}}. A form of limited indeterminacy was used by [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]] (beginning with ''[[Jeux v\u00e9nitiens]]'' in 1960\u201361) {{harv|Rae|2001}}, where extensive passages of pitches and rhythms are fully specified, but the rhythmic coordination of parts within the ensemble is subject to an element of chance. Earle Brown\u2019s ''Twenty-Five Pages'', uses 25 unbound pages, and called for anywhere between one and 25 pianists. The score allowed the performer(s) to arrange the pages in whatever order they saw fit. Also, the pages were notated symmetrically and without clefs so that the top and bottom orientation is reversible.\n\n\"Open form\" is a term sometimes used for \"mobile\" or \"polyvalent\" musical forms, where the order of movements or sections is indeterminate or left up to the performer. [[Roman Haubenstock-Ramati]] composed a series of influential \"mobiles\" such as ''Interpolation'' (1958).\n\nHowever, \"open form\" in music is also used in the sense defined by the art historian Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin (1915) to mean a work which is fundamentally incomplete, represents an unfinished activity, or points outside of itself. In this sense, a \"mobile form\" can be either \"open\" or \"closed\". An example of a \"dynamic, closed\" mobile musical composition is [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Zyklus]]'' (1959) {{harv|Maconie|2005|loc=185}}. [[Terry Riley]]'s ''[[In C]]'' (1964) was composed of 53 short sequences; each member of the ensemble can repeat a given sequence as many times as desired before going on to the next, making the details of each performance of ''In C'' unique. However, because the overall course is fixed, it is a closed form.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe greatest degree of indeterminacy is reached by the third type of indeterminate music, in [[graphic notation (music)|graphic score]] pieces, in which the music is represented using symbols and illustrations suggesting how a work can be performed. [[Hans-Christoph Steiner]]'s score for ''Solitude'', created using Pure Data's data structures.This notation may be, like music on traditional staves, a time-pitch graph system. [[Earle Brown]]'s  ''December 1952'' consists purely of horizontal and vertical lines varying in width, spread out over the page; it is a landmark piece in the history of graphic notation of music. The role of the performer is to interpret the score visually and translate the graphical information to music. In Brown's notes on the work he even suggests that one consider this 2D space as 3D and imagine moving through it. [[Cornelius Cardew]]'s ''[[Treatise (music)|Treatise]]'' is a graphic musical score comprising 193 pages of lines, symbols, and various geometric or abstract shapes that generally eschew conventional musical notation. Although the score allows for absolute interpretive freedom (no one interpretation will sound like another), the work is not normally played spontaneously, as Cardew had previously suggested that performers devise in advance their own rules and methods for interpreting and performing the work. There are, however, infinite possibilities for the interpretation of ''Treatise'' that fall within the implications of the piece and general principles of experimental music performance in the late 1960s, including presentation as visual art and map-reading.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Discography==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Cage|1959}}|reference=Cage, John. 1959.

[[John Cage]] is regarded as a pioneer of indeterminacy in music. Beginning in the early 1950s, the term came to refer to the (mostly American) movement which grew up around Cage. This group included the other members of the so-called [[New York School (art)#The composers|New York School]]: [[Earle Brown]], [[Morton Feldman]] and [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]]. Others working in this way included the [[Scratch Orchestra]] in the United Kingdom (1968 until the early 1970s) and the Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]] (born 1933). In Europe, following the introduction of the expression \"[[aleatory music]]\" by [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]], the French composer [[Pierre Boulez]] was largely responsible for popularizing the term {{harv|Boulez|1957}}.\n\nIn 1958 Cage gave two lectures in Europe, the first at Darmstadt, titled simply \"Indeterminacy\" {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=35\u201340}}, the second in Brussels called \"Indeterminacy: New Aspect of Form in Instrumental and Electronic Music\" (given again in an expanded form in 1959 at Teacher's College, Columbia). This second lecture consisted of a number of short stories (originally 30, expanded to ninety in the second version), each story read by Cage in exactly one minute; because of this time limit, the speed of Cage's delivery varied enormously {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=260}}. The second performance and a subsequent recording {{harv|Cage|1959}} contained music, also by Cage, played by [[David Tudor]] at the same time. Subsequently, Cage added still more stories, and published a selection of them, partly as an article, \"Indeterminacy\" {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=260\u201373}}, and partly as scattered interludes throughout his first collection of writings, ''Silence'' {{harv|Cage|1961}}.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the Dutch artist [[Iebele Abel]] developed an electronic instrument called ''Real-time Indeterminate Synthetic Music Feedback'' (RT-ISMF). The instrument was designed for empirical research on subjective experiences induced by real-time synthesized music, based on the output of electronic random number generators. The basic idea of this approach was that indeterminate music might evoke unique and exceptional human experience {{harv|Abel|2013|loc=26, 117\u201319}}.\n\n==Classification==\nIndeterminate or chance music can be divided into three groups: (1) the use of random procedures to produce a determinate, fixed score, (2) mobile form, and (3) indeterminate notation, including graphic notation and texts. The first group includes scores in which the chance element is involved only in the process of composition, so that every parameter is fixed before their performance. In John Cage\u2019s ''[[Music of Changes]]'' (1951), the process of composition involved applying decisions made using the ''[[I Ching]]'', a Chinese classic text that is commonly used as a divination system. The ''I Ching'' was applied to large charts of sounds, durations, dynamics, tempo and densities. Cage himself, however, regarded ''Music of Changes'' as a determinate work, because it is completely fixed from one performance to another {{harv|Pritchett|1993|loc=108}}. [[Iannis Xenakis]] used probability theories to define some microscopic aspects of ''[[Pithoprakta]]'' (1955\u201356), that is the Greek for \"actions by means of probability\". This work contains four sections, characterized by textural and timbral attributes, such as glissandi and pizzicati. At the macroscopic level, the sections are designed and controlled by the composer, but the single components of sound are generated by mathematical theories {{harv|Joe and Song|2002|loc=268}}. See: [[stochastic music]].\n\nIn the second type of indeterminate music (the only type of indeterminate music according to Cage's definition), chance elements involve the performance. Notated events are provided by the composer, but their arrangement is left to the determination of the performer. According to Cage,  examples include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Art of Fugue]]'', Morton Feldman's ''Intersection 3'', Earle Brown's ''Four Systems'', and Christian Wolff's ''Duo for Pianists II'' {{harv|Cage|1961|loc=35\u201339}}. A form of limited indeterminacy was used by [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]] (beginning with ''[[Jeux v\u00e9nitiens]]'' in 1960\u201361) {{harv|Rae|2001}}, where extensive passages of pitches and rhythms are fully specified, but the rhythmic coordination of parts within the ensemble is subject to an element of chance. Earle Brown\u2019s ''Twenty-Five Pages'', uses 25 unbound pages, and called for anywhere between one and 25 pianists. The score allowed the performer(s) to arrange the pages in whatever order they saw fit. Also, the pages were notated symmetrically and without clefs so that the top and bottom orientation is reversible.\n\n\"Open form\" is a term sometimes used for \"mobile\" or \"polyvalent\" musical forms, where the order of movements or sections is indeterminate or left up to the performer. [[Roman Haubenstock-Ramati]] composed a series of influential \"mobiles\" such as ''Interpolation'' (1958).\n\nHowever, \"open form\" in music is also used in the sense defined by the art historian Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin (1915) to mean a work which is fundamentally incomplete, represents an unfinished activity, or points outside of itself. In this sense, a \"mobile form\" can be either \"open\" or \"closed\". An example of a \"dynamic, closed\" mobile musical composition is [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Zyklus]]'' (1959) {{harv|Maconie|2005|loc=185}}. [[Terry Riley]]'s ''[[In C]]'' (1964) was composed of 53 short sequences; each member of the ensemble can repeat a given sequence as many times as desired before going on to the next, making the details of each performance of ''In C'' unique. However, because the overall course is fixed, it is a closed form.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe greatest degree of indeterminacy is reached by the third type of indeterminate music, in [[graphic notation (music)|graphic score]] pieces, in which the music is represented using symbols and illustrations suggesting how a work can be performed. [[Hans-Christoph Steiner]]'s score for ''Solitude'', created using Pure Data's data structures.This notation may be, like music on traditional staves, a time-pitch graph system. [[Earle Brown]]'s  ''December 1952'' consists purely of horizontal and vertical lines varying in width, spread out over the page; it is a landmark piece in the history of graphic notation of music. The role of the performer is to interpret the score visually and translate the graphical information to music. In Brown's notes on the work he even suggests that one consider this 2D space as 3D and imagine moving through it. [[Cornelius Cardew]]'s ''[[Treatise (music)|Treatise]]'' is a graphic musical score comprising 193 pages of lines, symbols, and various geometric or abstract shapes that generally eschew conventional musical notation. Although the score allows for absolute interpretive freedom (no one interpretation will sound like another), the work is not normally played spontaneously, as Cardew had previously suggested that performers devise in advance their own rules and methods for interpreting and performing the work. There are, however, infinite possibilities for the interpretation of ''Treatise'' that fall within the implications of the piece and general principles of experimental music performance in the late 1960s, including presentation as visual art and map-reading.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Discography==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Cage|1959}}|reference=Cage, John. 1959.

{"title_page": "Closing time effect", "text_new": "\"'''Closing time effect'''\" refers to the [[phenomenon]] that people's [[perception]] of other people's [[attractiveness]] increases as it gets later into the night. This observation was first coined by [[Mickey Gilley]] in his song, \"[[Don't the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time]]\" in [[1975]]. Subsequently, it caught the attention of [[social psychologist]]s who used scientific testing to gather evidence in support of the idea.\n\n==The first experiment==\n[[James W. Pennebaker]] et al. (1979) conducted the first [[experiment]] testing this [[observation]]. Using 52 males and 51 females as subjects at three [[bar]]s near a [[college campus]], experimenters asked individuals the following question: \"On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates 'not attractive', 5 indicates 'average', and 10 indicates 'extremely [[attractive]],' how would you rate the opposite-sex individuals here tonight.\" The experimenters took this survey at 9:00 pm, 10:30 pm and at midnight. Results showed that individuals' perception of people's [[attractiveness]] in the bar increased the later it got.\n\n==Theory==\nThe freedom of potentially going home with someone in the bar is threatened as the night comes closer to ending, according to the [[reactance (psychology)|reactance theory]] ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675534/ Brehm, 1966]). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247745267_Don't_the_Girls'_Get_Prettier_at_Closing_Time_A_Country_and_Western_Application_to_Psychology Pennebaker et al. (1979)] also suggested [[dissonance theory]] as an explanation, proposing that as the night progresses, individuals intention to leave with someone becomes stronger. However, leaving the bar with someone who they may find unattractive causes [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonance]], increasing the perceived attractiveness of the potential mate.\n\n==Other studies==\nFollowing the first [[Research|study]] performed by [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247745267_Don't_the_Girls'_Get_Prettier_at_Closing_Time_A_Country_and_Western_Application_to_Psychology Pennebaker et al. in 1979], [https://www.academia.edu/18774441/They_do_get_prettier_at_closing_time_A_repeated_measures_study_of_the_closing-time_effect_and_alcohol Nida and Koon (1983)] found evidence of the closing time effect in a [[country and western]] bar but did not find it in a campus bar. [https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-28158-001 Gladue and Delaney (1990)] found that individuals of the opposite gender became more attractive as a factor of time, but that photos of the opposite gender did not. They found that male participants rated the most attractive photos higher but ratings of the least attractive photos also decreased. [[Females]] showed no changes over time in their photo ratings of males. [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1804_2 Madey, Simo, Dillworth, and Kemper (1996)] found the effect in a nightclub near a university, but only for participants not in a [[Romance (love)|relationship]]. The authors argued that only participants not in a relationship should experience a threat to their choice of companion. [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167284103017 Sprecher et al. (1984)] did not find a closing-time effect.\n\n==The effect of alcohol==\nJohnco, Wheeler and Taylor (2010) measured the attractiveness of participants over a night while also controlling for the [[beer goggles|effect of alcohol consumption]] by measuring their [[blood alcohol content]] with a breathalyzer each time that they measured individuals' perceptions of physical attractiveness. They used BAC as a time varying [[covariate]] in a repeated measures design, with 87 participants at a beachside pub in [[Sydney]], Australia on four consecutive Saturday nights, between 9 pm and 12 am. They found that both perceptions of attractiveness as well as BAC increased as a factor of time. They concluded that BAC explained a significant portion of the increase in opposite-sex attractiveness but that a substantial effect remains after adjusting for BAC.\n\n==Other possible explanations==\nOne other possible explanation about the cause of this perception of higher attractiveness is \"mere familiarity or exposure\" ([https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0025848 Zajonc, 1968]). Previously seen stimuli may be perceived more positively than new stimuli. Another explanation comes from the commodity theory (Brock, 1968). According to [[commodity]] theory, as people find mates in the bar and leave with them, there is a scarcity of individuals left in the bar. This scarcity increases the desirability and perceived attractiveness of those left in the bar.\n\n==References==\n# [https://www.elsevier.com/books/psychological-reactance/brehm/978-0-12-129840-1 Brehm, J.

One U-boat was damaged.\n\n==Background==\nHX 65 formed of three sections sailing from the Americas, and was to divide into two sections for the landfall in the [[United Kingdom]]. \nThe main body, of 13 ships,  departed Halifax on 12 August 1940;<ref>Hague, p.126</ref> with ships gathered from the US eastern seaboard; it was led by [[convoy commodore]] [[Vice Admiral|V.Adm.]] BG Washington in the steamship ''Harpalyce''. It was accompanied by its ocean escort, the [[Armed Merchant Cruiser]] ''Voltaire'', and a local escort of two [[Royal Canadian Navy|RCN]] warships. \nIt was joined on 14 August by 16 ships from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], on [[Cape Breton Island]], also with a local escort. These had gathered from ports on the [[Saint Lawrence River|St Lawrence]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref>Hague, Arnold; HX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref>\nOn 16 August the convoy was joined by BHX 65, 22 ships from the [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]], that had gathered at [[Bermuda]], departing there on 11 August escorted by the AMC ''Montclare''.<ref>Hague, Arnold; BHX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref> \n\nRanged against HX 65 were U-boats of the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy's]] [[1st U-boat Flotilla|1st]], [[2nd U-boat Flotilla|2nd]] and [[7th U-boat Flotilla|7th]] U-boat Flotillas, operating from [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]].\n\n==Action==\nOn 22 August HX 65\u2019s Western Approaches escort began to arrive; the destroyer {{HMCS|Skeena|D59|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Godetia|K72|2}} left the outbound OA 201, arriving later that day. On 24 August the destroyer {{HMS|Westcott|D47|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Gladiolus|K34|2}} arrived from OB 201.<ref>Hague lists ''Gladiolus'' as escort for OB 201 with ''Westcott'', but not joining HX 65. Uboat.net has ''Gladiolus'' joining HX 65 with ''Westcott'' on 24th, but from OA 201.</ref>  \n\nOn the morning of 24 August  tanker ''La Brea'' (one of two ships that had dropped out of HX 65 5 days earlier) was sighted by {{GS|U-48|1939|2}} in the North West Approaches WNW of [[Rockall]]. She was attacked and sunk, leaving two boats of survivors in bad weather and rough seas. They made landfall in the [[Hebrides]] over the next two days.<ref>Blair p181</ref><ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65 HX 65] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref> \n\nOn the evening of 24 August the convoy divided, one section (referred to in some sources as HX 65A) of 20 ships bound for [[Methil]] on Scotland\u2019s east coast via [[Cape Wrath]] and the north of Scotland, and a second section (HX 65 B) of 22 ships bound for Liverpool.\n\nThe Methil section, led by ''Harpalyce'' and  escorted by ''Skeena'' and ''Godetia'' was found by ''U-48'', which  attacked during the night of 24/25 August, sinking 2 ships, ''Empire Merlin'' and ''Athelcrest''. She was counter attacked by ''Godetia'' but escaped without damage.\nLater, on the morning of 25 August the convoy was sighted twice more, by {{GS|U-28|1936|2}} and {{GS|U-32|1937|2}}, but the convoy had been joined by a [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] from [[Coastal Command]], and both submerged on sighting the aircraft. ''U-32'' made a perfunctory attack, which failed.\nThat evening the convoy was found again, by {{GS|U-124|1940|2}}, and attacked just before midnight. ''U-124'' fired four torpedoes and claimed four ships sunk; the actual success was two ships sunk (''Harpalyce'' and ''Fircrest'') and another (''[[SS Stakesby (1930)|Stakesby]]'') damaged. ''Harpalyce'' and ''Fircrest'' went down quickly with heavy loss of life. ''Stakesby'' was abandoned, but was later salvaged by the tug ''[[HMT Thames (1938)|Thames]]'' and repaired. ''U-124'' was counterattacked by ''Godetia'' and damaged when she ran onto a rock. After the corvette had left, ''U-124'' was unable to continue convoy operations relegated to weather reporting.<ref>Blair p181-182</ref> \nLater that day the convoy was reinforced by {{HMS|Jaguar|F34|2}} and {{HMS|Javelin|F61|2}}, two destroyers from [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65A  HX 65A] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref>\nOn the evening of 26 August  the convoy came under air attack near [[Kinnaird Head]] by ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft from occupied Norway; eight [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]]s of KG 30 based at [[Aalborg]]. four ships were hit; one was sunk and three damaged. ''Nellie'' and ''City of Hankow'' made port safely, but ''Cape York'' sank under tow on the following day. Later on the night of 26/27 August a second air attack by four [[Heinkel He 115|He 115]] torpedo bombers of KuFlGr 506, based in  [[Stavanger]], hit ''Remuera'', which sank. The remaining 16 ships arrived at safely at  Methil on 27th.<ref>Hague, Arnold; HX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 25 August the Liverpool section, led by V.Adm. Leir in ''Manchester Merchant'' and escorted by ''Westcott'', was found by {{GS|U-57|1938|2}} which gave chase. Several tankers had fallen out of the convoy, to be chivvied by the escort, and one of these, ''Pecten'', was torpedoed by ''U-57''. The escort counter-attacked, but ''U-57'' escaped. This section was also reinforced on 26 August, by the sloop {{HMS|Lowestoft|L59|2}}. No further attacks developed and the 21 ships arrived without further incident at Liverpool on 27 August.<ref>Blair p184</ref><ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65B HX 65B] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref>\n\n==Forces involved==\n===Allied forces===\n====Merchant ships====\nConvoy information is from Arnold Hague's Convoyweb<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/HX/index.html|title=Convoy HX.65|publisher=Arnold Hague Convoy Database|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Merchant ships\n|-\n!

It was the 65th of the numbered series of merchant convoy] run by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from [[Halifax Harbour|Halifax]] to [[Liverpool]]. The convoy was attacked by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[U-boat]]s and aircraft, losing eight of its 51 ships sunk and a further three damaged. One U-boat was damaged.\n\n==Background==\nHX 65 formed of three sections sailing from the Americas, and was to divide into two sections for the landfall in the [[United Kingdom]]. \nThe main body, of 13 ships,  departed Halifax on 12 August 1940;<ref>Hague, p.126</ref> with ships gathered from the US eastern seaboard; it was led by [[convoy commodore]] [[Vice Admiral|V.Adm.]] BG Washington in the steamship ''Harpalyce''. It was accompanied by its ocean escort, the [[Armed Merchant Cruiser]] ''Voltaire'', and a local escort of two [[Royal Canadian Navy|RCN]] warships. \nIt was joined on 14 August by 16 ships from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], on [[Cape Breton Island]], also with a local escort. These had gathered from ports on the [[Saint Lawrence River|St Lawrence]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref>Hague, Arnold; HX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref>\nOn 16 August the convoy was joined by BHX 65, 22 ships from the [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]], that had gathered at [[Bermuda]], departing there on 11 August escorted by the AMC ''Montclare''.<ref>Hague, Arnold; BHX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref> \n\nRanged against HX 65 were U-boats of the [[Kreigsmarine|German Navy's]] [[1st U-boat Flotilla|1st]], [[2nd U-boat Flotilla|2nd]] and [[7th U-boat Flotilla|7th]] U-boat Flotillas, operating from [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]].\n\n==Action==\nOn 22 August HX 65\u2019s Western Approaches escort began to arrive; the destroyer {{HMCS|Skeena|D59|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Godetia|K72|2}} left the outbound OA 201, arriving later that day. On 24 August the destroyer {{HMS|Westcott|D47|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Gladiolus|K34|2}} arrived from OB 201.<ref>Hague lists ''Gladiolus'' as escort for OB 201 with ''Westcott'', but not joining HX 65. Uboat.net has ''Gladiolus'' joining HX 65 with ''Westcott'' on 24th, but from OA 201.</ref>  \n\nOn the morning of 24 August  tanker ''La Brea'' (one of two ships that had dropped out of HX 65 5 days earlier) was sighted by {{GS|U-48|1939|2}} in the North West Approaches WNW of [[Rockall]]. She was attacked and sunk, leaving two boats of survivors in bad weather and rough seas. They made landfall in the [[Hebrides]] over the next two days.<ref>Blair p181</ref><ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65 HX 65] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref> \n\nOn the evening of 24 August the convoy divided, one section (referred to in some sources as HX 65A) of 20 ships bound for [[Methil]] on Scotland\u2019s east coast via [[Cape Wrath]] and the north of Scotland, and a second section (HX 65 B) of 22 ships bound for Liverpool.\n\nThe Methil section, led by ''Harpalyce'' and  escorted by ''Skeena'' and ''Godetia'' was found by ''U-48'', which  attacked during the night of 24/25 August, sinking 2 ships, ''Empire Merlin'' and ''Athelcrest''. She was counter attacked by ''Godetia'' but escaped without damage.\nLater, on the morning of 25 August the convoy was sighted twice more, by {{GS|U-28|1936|2}} and {{GS|U-32|1937|2}}, but the convoy had been joined by a [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] from [[Coastal Command]], and both submerged on sighting the aircraft. ''U-32'' made a perfunctory attack, which failed.\nThat evening the convoy was found again, by {{GS|U-124|1940|2}}, and attacked just before midnight. ''U-124'' fired four torpedoes and claimed four ships sunk; the actual success was two ships sunk (''Harpalyce'' and ''Fircrest'') and another (''[[SS Stakesby (1930)|Stakesby]]'') damaged. ''Harpalyce'' and ''Fircrest'' went down quickly with heavy loss of life. ''Stakesby'' was abandoned, but was later salvaged by the tug ''[[HMT Thames (1938)|Thames]]'' and repaired. ''U-124'' was counterattacked by ''Godetia'' and damaged when she ran onto a rock. After the corvette had left, ''U-124'' was unable to continue convoy operations relegated to weather reporting.<ref>Blair p181-182</ref> \nLater that day the convoy was reinforced by {{HMS|Jaguar|F34|2}} and {{HMS|Javelin|F61|2}}, two destroyers from [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65A  HX 65A] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref>\nOn the evening of 26 August  the convoy came under air attack near [[Kinnaird Head]] by ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft from occupied Norway; eight [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]]s of KG 30 based at [[Aalborg]]. four ships were hit; one was sunk and three damaged. ''Nellie'' and ''City of Hankow'' made port safely, but ''Cape York'' sank under tow on the following day. Later on the night of 26/27 August a second air attack by four [[Heinkel He 115|He 115]] torpedo bombers of KuFlGr 506, based in  [[Stavanger]], hit ''Remuera'', which sank. The remaining 16 ships arrived at safely at  Methil on 27th.<ref>Hague, Arnold; HX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 25 August the Liverpool section, led by V.Adm. Leir in ''Manchester Merchant'' and escorted by ''Westcott'', was found by {{GS|U-57|1938|2}} which gave chase. Several tankers had fallen out of the convoy, to be chivvied by the escort, and one of these, ''Pecten'', was torpedoed by ''U-57''. The escort counter-attacked, but ''U-57'' escaped. This section was also reinforced on 26 August, by the sloop {{HMS|Lowestoft|L59|2}}. No further attacks developed and the 21 ships arrived without further incident at Liverpool on 27 August.<ref>Blair p184</ref><ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65B HX 65B] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref>\n\n==Forces involved==\n===Allied forces===\n====Merchant ships====\nConvoy information is from Arnold Hague's Convoyweb<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/HX/index.html|title=Convoy HX.65|publisher=Arnold Hague Convoy Database|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Merchant ships\n|-\n!

Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but otherwise did minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]]. An area of rotation developed along this decaying boundary, developing into the season's first tropical depression around 00:00&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;29 while located about 225&nbsp;miles (360&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Tampa, Florida]]. The incipient cyclone moved steadily northeast and intensified into a tropical storm twelve hours later. It reached an initial peak of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) while in the Gulf of Mexico, making landfall at that intensity near [[Palm Harbor, Florida]], at 22:00&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;29. The system initially weakened while crossing the state and emerging into the Atlantic, but surface observations along the North Carolina coastline supported peak winds around 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) as the storm accelerated northeast; it is possible the cyclone possessed hurricane-force winds offshore. By 00:00&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;1, the system transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] as an [[occluded front]] became attached to the circulation. It made landfall in [[Nova Scotia]] late on August&nbsp;1 and curved northwest, dissipating over northern [[New Brunswick]] the next day.<ref name=\"Meta\">{{cite web|author=Christopher W.

Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but otherwise did minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].

From October 16\u201317, a cold front moved eastward across the basin. An area of low pressure formed along the southern end of the dissipating boundary, initially harboring characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. This low became more symmetric while also intensifying, therefore transitioning into a hurricane by 00:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19 while located roughly 715&nbsp;miles (1,150&nbsp;km) southeast of Newfoundland. The system attained peak winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) within six hours and weakened shortly thereafter while moving west-northwest. It fell to tropical storm intensity by early on October&nbsp;20; by 00:00&nbsp;UTC the next day, there were no further indications of the storm. It either dissipated or was absorbed by a front encroaching from the west.<ref name=\"Meta\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other storms===\nIn addition to the eleven known tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm strength in the Atlantic in 1937, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project also identified five [[tropical depression]]s. The first of these lasted from August&nbsp;1\u20134 over the central Atlantic without affecting land, ultimately degenerating into a tropical wave. A second tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico and passed near New Orleans, Louisiana, on August&nbsp;29. A nearly stationary tropical depression developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September&nbsp;29 and dissipated two days later; it may have been absorbed by [[#Tropical Storm Ten|Tropical Storm Ten]]. This system was originally included in the [[HURDAT|official Atlantic hurricane track database]] as a tropical storm, but was found to have winds of only 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) by the reanalysis. On October&nbsp;8, a northward-moving tropical depression spawned from a tropical wave well east of the Lesser Antilles, eventually transitioning into an extratropical system on October&nbsp;14. The season's final tropical cyclone was a nearly stationary tropical depression that persisted in the central Caribbean Sea between October&nbsp;25\u201329. The reanalysis project also examined eleven other disturbances from 1937 for possible tropical or subtropical cyclone characteristics, including a low-pressure system that split from a front over the open Atlantic on January&nbsp;1.<ref name=\"Meta\" />\n\n==Season effects==\nThe table below includes the duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damage, and death totals of all tropical cyclones in the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season.

According to the ''Global Resource Information Database'' of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], it shrank by as much as 95% from about 1963 to 1998, but \"the 2007 (satellite) image shows significant improvement over previous years.\"{{sfn|United Nations|2007}} Lake Chad is economically important, providing [[water]] to more than 30 million people living in the four countries surrounding it ([[Chad]], [[Cameroon]], [[Niger]], and [[Nigeria]]) on the central part of the [[Sahel]].{{sfn|AllAfrica|2012}} It is the largest lake in the [[Chad Basin]].\n\n==Geography and hydrology==\nThe freshwater lake is located in the [[Sahel|Sahelian zone]] of West-central Africa. It is located in the interior basin which used to be occupied by a much larger ancient sea sometimes called Mega Chad. The lake is historically ranked as one of the largest lakes in Africa. Its surface area varies by season as well as from year to year. Lake Chad is mainly in the far west of [[Chad]], bordering on northeastern [[Nigeria]]. \n\nThe [[Chari River]], fed by its tributary the [[Logone River|Logone]], provides over 90% of the lake's water, with a small amount coming from the [[Yobe River]] in [[Nigeria]]/[[Niger]]. Despite high levels of evaporation, the lake is [[fresh water]]. Over half of the lake's area is taken up by its many small [[islands]] (including the [[Bogomerom Archipelago]]), reedbeds and mud [[Bank (geography)|banks]], and a belt of [[swampland]] across the middle divides the northern and southern halves. The shorelines are largely composed of [[marshes]].\n\nBecause Lake Chad is very shallow\u2014only {{convert|10.5|m|ft|0}} at its deepest\u2014its area is particularly sensitive to small changes in average depth, and consequently it also shows seasonal fluctuations in size. Lake Chad has no apparent outlet, but its waters [[percolate]] into the [[Soro Depression|Soro]] and [[Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression|Bod\u00e9l\u00e9]] depressions. The climate is dry most of the year, with moderate rainfall from June through September.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Megatschad GIS.PNG|right|thumb|upright=1.3|Maximum extension of the Holocene \"Lake Mega-Chad\"]]\n[[Image:ShrinkingLakeChad-1973-1997-EO.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Lake Chad in a 2001 satellite image, with the actual lake in blue, and vegetation on top of the old lake bed in green.

The name ''Chad'' is derived from the [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] word \u201cS\u00e1d\u01dd\u201d meaning \"large expanse of water\".{{sfn|Room|1994|p=}} The lake is the remnant of a former [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]], paleolake Mega-Chad, which existed during the [[African humid period]]. At its largest, sometime before 5000 BC, Lake Mega-Chad was the largest of four Saharan paleolakes, and is estimated to have covered an area of {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, larger than the [[Caspian Sea]] is today, and may have extended as far northeast as within {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[Faya-Largeau]].{{sfn|Drake|Bristow|2006|pp=901, 910}}{{sfn|Stewart|2009|loc=Chapter: Dead and dying seas}} At its largest extent the river [[Mayo K\u00e9bbi]] represented the outlet of the paleolake Mega-Chad, connecting it to the [[Niger River]] and the Atlantic.<ref>Leblanc et al.

During the time of [[Augustus]] Lake Chad was still a huge lake and two Roman expeditions were performed in order to reach it: Septimius Flaccus and Julius Maternus reached the \"lake of hippopotamus\"{{cn|date=November 2017}} (as the lake was called by [[Claudius Ptolemaeus]]). They moved from coastal Tripolitania and passed near the [[Tibesti mountains]]. Both expeditions passed through the territory of the [[Garamantes]], and were able to leave a small garrison on the \"lake of hippopotamus and rhinoceros\" after three months of travel in desert lands.\n\nLake Chad was first surveyed from shore by Europeans in 1823, and it was considered to be one of the largest lakes in the world then.{{sfn|Funk & Wagnalls|1973|}} In 1851, a party including the German explorer [[Heinrich Barth]] carried a boat overland from Tripoli across the Sahara Desert by camel and made the first European waterborne survey.<ref name=kemper>{{cite book |url= |title=Labyrinth of Kingdoms: 10,000 Miles Through Islamic Africa |publisher=W.

He writes:\n\n<blockquote>Altogether France has enough to occupy her in Central Africa for some time to come: and even when the long task is finished, the conquered regions are not likely to be of great value. They include the desert of the Great Sahara and wide expanses of equally profitless scrub or marsh. Only one important river, the Shari, flows through them, and never reaches the sea: and even Lake Chad, into which the Shari flows, appears to be leaking through some subterranean exit, and is rapidly changing from a lake into an immense swamp.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4943 |title=The River War: An Account of the Reconquest of the Sudan |author=Winston Churchill|date=1902 |accessdate=31 May 2017|via=www.gutenberg.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLake Chad has shrunk considerably since the 1960s, when its shoreline had an elevation of about {{convert|286|m|ft}} above sea level{{sfn|Drake|Bristow|2006|loc=Figures 1, 10}} and it had an area of more than {{convert|26,000|km2|mi2}}, making its surface the fourth largest in Africa.

In 1983, Lake Chad was reported to have covered {{convert|10000|to|25000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},{{sfn|World Lakes Database|1983|p=}} had a maximum depth of 11 metres (36&nbsp;ft),{{sfn|World Lakes Database|1983|p=}} and a volume of {{convert|72|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|World Lakes Database|1983|p=}}\n\nBy 2000, its extent had fallen to less than {{convert|1500|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.  A 2001 study published in the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' blamed the lake's retreat largely on [[overgrazing]] in the area surrounding the lake, causing [[desertification]] and a decline in vegetation.{{sfn|Coe|Foley|2001|p=|}} The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and the [[Lake Chad Basin Commission]] concur that at least half of the lake's decrease is attributable to shifting climate patterns. UNEP blames human water use, such as inefficient damming and irrigation methods, for the rest of the shrinkage.{{sfn|CNN|2007|p=}} As late as December 2014, Lake Chad was still sufficient in size and volume such that boats could capsize or sink. The European Space Agency has recently presented data showing an actual increase in lake extent of Lake Chad between the years of 1985 to 2011.<ref>http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/10/lake_chad_water_extent_increase/13371177-1-eng-GB/Lake_Chad_water_extent_increase.gif</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lake Chad 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|A map of the lake in 1973]]\n[[Image:Mittelholzer-tschadsee.jpg|thumb|upright|Lake Chad in 1930, aerial photograph by [[Walter Mittelholzer]]]]\n\nReferring to the [[floodplain]] as a lake may be misleading, as less than half of Lake Chad is covered by water through an entire year. The remaining sections are considered as [[wetlands]].\n\nLake Chad's volume of {{convert|72|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}{{sfn|World Lakes Database|1983|p=}} is very small relative to that of [[Lake Tanganyika]] ({{convert|18900|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}), and [[Lake Victoria]] ({{convert|2750|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}), African lakes with similar surface areas.\n\n==Flora==\nThe lake is home to more than 44 species of [[algae]].  In particular it is one of the world's major producers of wild [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]]<!--Bacteria =/= algae-->.  The lake also has large areas of swamp and reedbeds. The floodplains on the southern lakeshore are covered in wetland grasses such as ''[[Echinochloa]] pyramidalis'', ''[[Vetiveria nigritana]]'', ''[[Oryza longistaminata]]'', and ''[[Hyparrhenia rufa]]''.\n\n==Fauna==\nThe entire Lake Chad [[Drainage basin|basin]] holds 179 [[fish]] species, of which more than half are shared with the [[Niger River|Niger River Basin]], about half are shared with the [[Nile River Basin]], and about a quarter are shared with the [[Congo River Basin]].{{sfn|Hughes|Hughes|1992|p=}} Lake Chad itself holds 85 fish species.{{sfn|Hughes|Hughes|1992|p=}} Of the 25 [[Endemism|endemics]] in the basin, only ''[[Brycinus]] dageti'' is found in the lake itself,{{sfn|Hughes|Hughes|1992|p=}} and it is perhaps better treated as a dwarf [[subspecies]] of ''Brycinus nurse''.<ref name=FishBase>{{FishBase species | genus = Brycinus | species = nurse | month = May | year = 2011}}</ref> This relatively low [[species richness]] and virtual lack of endemic fish species contrasts strongly with other large African lakes, such as [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Malawi|Malawi]].{{sfn|Nelson|2006|p=}}\n\nThere are many [[floating island]]s in the lake. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including [[African elephants|elephants]], [[hippopotamus]], [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]] (all in decline), and large communities of migrating birds including wintering [[duck]]s, [[ruff]] (''Philomachus pugnax'') and other waterfowl and shore birds. There are two near-endemic birds in the region, the [[river prinia]] (''Prinia fluviatilis'') and the [[rusty lark]] (''Mirafra rufa''). The shrinking of the lake is threatening nesting sites of the [[black crowned crane|black-crowned crane]] (''Balearica pavonina pavonina''). During the wet season, fish move into the mineral-rich lake to breed and find food. Carnivores such as the [[Central African cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii''), the [[striped hyena]] (''Hyaena hyaena'') and the [[caracal]] (''Felis caracal'') used to inhabit areas surrounding the lake.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lake Chad flooded savanna|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0904|publisher=WWF World Wildlife.org|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Threats and preservation==\nThere is some debate over the mechanisms causing the lake's disappearance. The leading theory, which is most often cited by the UN, is that the unsustainable usage of the lake by both governments and local communities has caused the lake to be [[water exploitation|over-used]], not allowing it to replenish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article116.html|title=Lake Chad: almost gone|accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nRecently, however, an additional theory is gaining traction. This states that European [[air pollution]] had shifted rainfall patterns farther south, thereby making the region drier and not allowing the lake to replenish. Since the implementation of new regulations in the EU concerning air pollutants, much of this rainfall is now beginning to return, thereby explaining the small improvements observed since 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechangenews.com/2013/06/18/lake-chads-receding-waters-linked-to-european-air-pollution/|title=Lake Chad's receding waters linked to European air pollution \u2013 Climate Home \u2013 climate change news|date=18 June 2013|work=Climate Home \u2013 climate change news|accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe only protected area is the Lake Chad Game Reserve, which covers half of the area next to the lake that belongs to Nigeria.

[[endorheic]] [[lake]] in [[Africa]], which has varied in size over the centuries. According to the ''Global Resource Information Database'' of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], it shrank by as much as 95% from about 1963 to 1998, but \"the 2007 (satellite) image shows significant improvement over previous years.\"{{sfn|United Nations|2007}} Lake Chad is economically important, providing [[water]] to more than 30 million people living in the four countries surrounding it ([[Chad]], [[Cameroon]], [[Niger]], and [[Nigeria]]) on the central part of the [[Sahel]].{{sfn|AllAfrica|2012}} It is the largest lake in the [[Chad Basin]].\n\n==Geography and hydrology==\nThe freshwater lake is located in the [[Sahel|Sahelian zone]] of West-central Africa. It is located in the interior basin which used to be occupied by a much larger ancient sea sometimes called Mega Chad. The lake is historically ranked as one of the largest lakes in Africa. Its surface area varies by season as well as from year to year. Lake Chad is mainly in the far west of [[Chad]], bordering on northeastern [[Nigeria]]. \n\nThe [[Chari River]], fed by its tributary the [[Logone River|Logone]], provides over 90% of the lake's water, with a small amount coming from the [[Yobe River]] in [[Nigeria]]/[[Niger]]. Despite high levels of evaporation, the lake is [[fresh water]]. Over half of the lake's area is taken up by its many small [[islands]] (including the [[Bogomerom Archipelago]]), reedbeds and mud [[Bank (geography)|banks]], and a belt of [[swampland]] across the middle divides the northern and southern halves. The shorelines are largely composed of [[marshes]].\n\nBecause Lake Chad is very shallow\u2014only {{convert|10.5|m|ft|0}} at its deepest\u2014its area is particularly sensitive to small changes in average depth, and consequently it also shows seasonal fluctuations in size. Lake Chad has no apparent outlet, but its waters [[percolate]] into the [[Soro Depression|Soro]] and [[Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression|Bod\u00e9l\u00e9]] depressions. The climate is dry most of the year, with moderate rainfall from June through September.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Megatschad GIS.PNG|right|thumb|upright=1.3|Maximum extension of the Holocene \"Lake Mega-Chad\"]]\n[[Image:ShrinkingLakeChad-1973-1997-EO.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Lake Chad in a 2001 satellite image, with the actual lake in blue, and vegetation on top of the old lake bed in green.

The name ''Chad'' is derived from the [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] word \u201cS\u00e1d\u01dd\u201d meaning \"large expanse of water\".{{sfn|Room|1994|p=}} The lake is the remnant of a former [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]], paleolake Mega-Chad, which existed during the [[African humid period]]. At its largest, sometime before 5000 BC, Lake Mega-Chad was the largest of four Saharan paleolakes, and is estimated to have covered an area of {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, larger than the [[Caspian Sea]] is today, and may have extended as far northeast as within {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[Faya-Largeau]].{{sfn|Drake|Bristow|2006|pp=901, 910}}{{sfn|Stewart|2009|loc=Chapter: Dead and dying seas}} At its largest extent the river [[Mayo K\u00e9bbi]] represented the outlet of the paleolake Mega-Chad, connecting it to the [[Niger River]] and the Atlantic.<ref>Leblanc et al. (2006). \"Reconstruction of megalake Chad using shuttle radar topographic mission data\".

During the time of [[Augustus]] Lake Chad was still a huge lake and two Roman expeditions were performed in order to reach it: Septimius Flaccus and Julius Maternus reached the \"lake of hippopotamus\"{{cn|date=November 2017}} (as the lake was called by [[Claudius Ptolemaeus]]). They moved from coastal Tripolitania and passed near the [[Tibesti mountains]]. Both expeditions passed through the territory of the [[Garamantes]], and were able to leave a small garrison on the \"lake of hippopotamus and rhinoceros\" after three months of travel in desert lands.\n\nLake Chad was first surveyed from shore by Europeans in 1823, and it was considered to be one of the largest lakes in the world then.{{sfn|Funk & Wagnalls|1973|}} In 1851, a party including the German explorer [[Heinrich Barth]] carried a boat overland from Tripoli across the Sahara Desert by camel and made the first European waterborne survey.<ref name=kemper>{{cite book |url= |title=Labyrinth of Kingdoms: 10,000 Miles Through Islamic Africa |publisher=W. W. Norton |author=Steve Kemper |year=2012 |isbn=978-0393079661 }}</ref> British expedition leader [[James Richardson (explorer of the Sahara)|James Richardson]] died just days before reaching the lake.\n\nIn Winston Churchill's book ''The River War: An Account of the Reconquest of the Sudan'', published in 1899, he specifically mentions the shrinking of Lake Chad. He writes:\n\n<blockquote>Altogether France has enough to occupy her in Central Africa for some time to come: and even when the long task is finished, the conquered regions are not likely to be of great value. They include the desert of the Great Sahara and wide expanses of equally profitless scrub or marsh. Only one important river, the Shari, flows through them, and never reaches the sea: and even Lake Chad, into which the Shari flows, appears to be leaking through some subterranean exit, and is rapidly changing from a lake into an immense swamp.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4943 |title=The River War: An Account of the Reconquest of the Sudan |author=Winston Churchill|date=1902 |accessdate=31 May 2017|via=www.gutenberg.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLake Chad has shrunk considerably since the 1960s, when its shoreline had an elevation of about {{convert|286|m|ft}} above sea level{{sfn|Drake|Bristow|2006|loc=Figures 1, 10}} and it had an area of more than {{convert|26,000|km2|mi2}}, making its surface the fourth largest in Africa. An increased demand on the lake's water from the local population has likely accelerated its shrinkage over the past 40 years.{{sfn|WaterNews|2008|p=}}\n\n[[File:\u0141\u00f3d\u017a rybak\u00f3w Kanuri - Jezioro Czad - 001264s.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] tribal fishermen in 1970s]]\n\nThe size of Lake Chad greatly varies seasonally with the flooding of the wetlands areas. In 1983, Lake Chad was reported to have covered {{convert|10000|to|25000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},{{sfn|World Lakes Database|1983|p=}} had a maximum depth of 11 metres (36&nbsp;ft),{{sfn|World Lakes Database|1983|p=}} and a volume of {{convert|72|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|World Lakes Database|1983|p=}}\n\nBy 2000, its extent had fallen to less than {{convert|1500|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.  A 2001 study published in the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' blamed the lake's retreat largely on [[overgrazing]] in the area surrounding the lake, causing [[desertification]] and a decline in vegetation.{{sfn|Coe|Foley|2001|p=|}} The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and the [[Lake Chad Basin Commission]] concur that at least half of the lake's decrease is attributable to shifting climate patterns. UNEP blames human water use, such as inefficient damming and irrigation methods, for the rest of the shrinkage.{{sfn|CNN|2007|p=}} As late as December 2014, Lake Chad was still sufficient in size and volume such that boats could capsize or sink. The European Space Agency has recently presented data showing an actual increase in lake extent of Lake Chad between the years of 1985 to 2011.<ref>http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/10/lake_chad_water_extent_increase/13371177-1-eng-GB/Lake_Chad_water_extent_increase.gif</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lake Chad 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|A map of the lake in 1973]]\n[[Image:Mittelholzer-tschadsee.jpg|thumb|upright|Lake Chad in 1930, aerial photograph by [[Walter Mittelholzer]]]]\n\nReferring to the [[floodplain]] as a lake may be misleading, as less than half of Lake Chad is covered by water through an entire year. The remaining sections are considered as [[wetlands]].\n\nLake Chad's volume of {{convert|72|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}{{sfn|World Lakes Database|1983|p=}} is very small relative to that of [[Lake Tanganyika]] ({{convert|18900|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}), and [[Lake Victoria]] ({{convert|2750|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}), African lakes with similar surface areas.\n\n==Flora==\nThe lake is home to more than 44 species of [[algae]].  In particular it is one of the world's major producers of wild [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]]<!--Bacteria =/= algae-->.  The lake also has large areas of swamp and reedbeds. The floodplains on the southern lakeshore are covered in wetland grasses such as ''[[Echinochloa]] pyramidalis'', ''[[Vetiveria nigritana]]'', ''[[Oryza longistaminata]]'', and ''[[Hyparrhenia rufa]]''.\n\n==Fauna==\nThe entire Lake Chad [[Drainage basin|basin]] holds 179 [[fish]] species, of which more than half are shared with the [[Niger River|Niger River Basin]], about half are shared with the [[Nile River Basin]], and about a quarter are shared with the [[Congo River Basin]].{{sfn|Hughes|Hughes|1992|p=}} Lake Chad itself holds 85 fish species.{{sfn|Hughes|Hughes|1992|p=}} Of the 25 [[Endemism|endemics]] in the basin, only ''[[Brycinus]] dageti'' is found in the lake itself,{{sfn|Hughes|Hughes|1992|p=}} and it is perhaps better treated as a dwarf [[subspecies]] of ''Brycinus nurse''.<ref name=FishBase>{{FishBase species | genus = Brycinus | species = nurse | month = May | year = 2011}}</ref> This relatively low [[species richness]] and virtual lack of endemic fish species contrasts strongly with other large African lakes, such as [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Malawi|Malawi]].{{sfn|Nelson|2006|p=}}\n\nThere are many [[floating island]]s in the lake. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including [[African elephants|elephants]], [[hippopotamus]], [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]] (all in decline), and large communities of migrating birds including wintering [[duck]]s, [[ruff]] (''Philomachus pugnax'') and other waterfowl and shore birds. There are two near-endemic birds in the region, the [[river prinia]] (''Prinia fluviatilis'') and the [[rusty lark]] (''Mirafra rufa''). The shrinking of the lake is threatening nesting sites of the [[black crowned crane|black-crowned crane]] (''Balearica pavonina pavonina''). During the wet season, fish move into the mineral-rich lake to breed and find food. Carnivores such as the [[Central African cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii''), the [[striped hyena]] (''Hyaena hyaena'') and the [[caracal]] (''Felis caracal'') used to inhabit areas surrounding the lake.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lake Chad flooded savanna|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0904|publisher=WWF World Wildlife.org|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Threats and preservation==\nThere is some debate over the mechanisms causing the lake's disappearance. The leading theory, which is most often cited by the UN, is that the unsustainable usage of the lake by both governments and local communities has caused the lake to be [[water exploitation|over-used]], not allowing it to replenish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article116.html|title=Lake Chad: almost gone|accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nRecently, however, an additional theory is gaining traction. This states that European [[air pollution]] had shifted rainfall patterns farther south, thereby making the region drier and not allowing the lake to replenish. Since the implementation of new regulations in the EU concerning air pollutants, much of this rainfall is now beginning to return, thereby explaining the small improvements observed since 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechangenews.com/2013/06/18/lake-chads-receding-waters-linked-to-european-air-pollution/|title=Lake Chad's receding waters linked to European air pollution \u2013 Climate Home \u2013 climate change news|date=18 June 2013|work=Climate Home \u2013 climate change news|accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe only protected area is the Lake Chad Game Reserve, which covers half of the area next to the lake that belongs to Nigeria. The whole lake has been declared a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar site]] of international importance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/1749|title=Lake Chad Wetlands in Nigeria {{!}} Ramsar Sites Information Service|website=rsis.ramsar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations 73rd General Assembly, the President of Nigeria urged the international community to assist in combatting the root causes of conflict surrounding the Lake Chad [[Endorheic basin]].

The copious amount of water from the Ubangi would revitalize the dying Lake Chad and provide livelihood in fishing and enhanced agriculture to tens of millions of central Africans and [[Sahel]]ians. Interbasin water transfer schemes were proposed in the 1980s and 1990s by Nigerian engineer J. Umolu (ZCN scheme) and Italian firm Bonifica (the Transaqua canal scheme).{{sfn|Pearce|1991|p=}}{{sfn|Umolu|1990|pp=218\u2013262}}{{sfn|Chapman|Baker|1992|}}{{sfn|Umolu|1994|loc=Section X}} \n\nIn 1994, the [[Lake Chad Basin Commission]] (LCBC) proposed a similar project, and at a March 2008 summit, the heads of state of the LCBC member countries committed to the diversion project.{{sfn|Voice of America|2008}} In April 2008, the LCBC advertised a request for proposals for a World Bank-funded feasibility study.{{citation needed|date = November 2013}} Neighboring countries have agreed to commit resources to restoring the lake, notably Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/april-2012/africa%E2%80%99s-vanishing-lake-chad|title=Africa's vanishing Lake Chad|accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-contributes-5m-to-restore-receding-lake-chad/176595/|title=Nigeria Contributes $5m to Restore Receding Lake Chad, Articles \u2013 THISDAY LIVE|accessdate=5 December 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911201524/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-contributes-5m-to-restore-receding-lake-chad/176595/|archivedate=11 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Local impact===\nThe dwindling of the lake has devastating impacts on Nigeria.<ref name=D+C>{{cite news |title=The dwindling lake|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/climate-change-lake-chad-region-affects-several-countries-negatively|author=Damilola Oyedele|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=11 May 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> Because of the way it has shrunk dramatically in recent decades, the lake has been labeled an [[ecological catastrophe]] by the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].{{sfn|Voice of America|2009}} Human population expansion and unsustainable human water extraction from Lake Chad have caused several natural species to be stressed and threatened by declining lake levels.

It lies on the [[Allan Water]], a northern tributary of the [[River Forth]], built largely on the well-wooded slopes of the Westerton and Airthrey estates, sheltered by the [[Ochil Hills]] from the north and east winds. Most of the town is to the east of the river; the bridge is part of the [[A9 road (Scotland)|A9]], Scotland's longest road, while the railway line and the [[M9 motorway (Scotland)|M9]] pass to the west of the river. [[Bridge of Allan railway station]] is on the electrified [[Edinburgh to Dunblane Line]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], the local people of the area were known as the [[Maeatae]] and it was they who constructed a powerful [[hillfort]] nearby. The early village consisted of seven small [[clachans]]: Bridge End, Kierfield, Old Lecropt, Pathfoot, Logie, Corntown and the Milne of Airthrey. The villages were very separate and the villagers lived in the small world of their own communities.\n\nThe site occupied by modern Bridge of Allan stretches from the clachan of Logie across the [[Allan Water]] to the [[University of Stirling]]. It was first mentioned in a charter granted by [[David I of Scotland|King David I]]. The charter was written in connection with a dispute between the nuns of [[North Berwick]] and the monks at [[Dunfermline Abbey]] over the tithes of Airthrey and [[Cornton|Corntown]]. It is un-dated, but had been granted by 1146.\n\nA hog's back, narrow, stone bridge was built to replace the old ford across the River Allan in 1520. It rose sharply from the riverbank and dipped steeply at the other side. Soon after a few cottages began to appear around the ends of the bridge and an embryonic Bridge of Allan slowly formed. In the woods above the bridge, a mine opened. This was worked from around 1550, and quantities of copper, silver and gold were extracted.\n\nBy the middle of the seventeenth century, the Airthrey Estate had passed to relatives of the [[Duke of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]], the Grahams. [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|James Graham]] rose for the king during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], and in 1645 as the army of the [[Duke of Argyll]] passed through the Airthrey estate on its way to the [[battle of Kilsyth]] they burned down the manor house.\n\nThe [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] were in Bridge of Allan in 1745, where three hundred highlanders set up a roadblock on the bridge and charged a toll for its passage. One of the old toll posts is still on display on the path leading up from the road.\n\nIn the early 19th century the town was little developed and typified by small, straw-roofed cottages.<ref>Robert Chambers, \"Picture of Scotland\" 1827</ref>\n\nMajor Alexander Henderson, the Laird of Westerton, drew up plans of how he wanted the village to be laid out in 1850, envisaging spacious streets with pleasure grounds in the woods. He also erected a fountain in Market Street. It was at this time that many handsome stone villas were built on wide thoroughfares, with practically every second house becoming a lodging house as Bridge of Allan became a renowned [[spa town]], especially during the boom years of [[Hydrotherapy#Hydropathic establishment|hydropathic establishments]].<ref name=\"BradleyDupreeDurie429\">{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=James|last2=Dupree|first2=Mageurite|last3=Durie|first3=Alastair|year=1997|title=Taking the Water Cure: The Hydropathic Movement in Scotland, 1840-1940|url=http://www.h-net.org/~business/bhcweb/publications/BEHprint/v026n2/p0426-p0437.pdf|journal=Business and Economic History|volume=26|issue=2|page=429|accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref><ref name=\"Shifrin\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianturkishbath.org/6DIRECTORY/ListBodies/HydroSF.htm|title=Victorian Turkish Baths Directory|last=Shifrin|first=Malcolm|date=3 October 2008|work=Victorian Turkish Baths: Their origin, development, and gradual decline|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> Among the visitors was [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]<ref>https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/bridge-of-allan-p235601</ref> who visited annually during his youth.\n\nIn 1870 Bridge of Allan became an independent Police Burgh with its own Provost.<ref>Logie: A Parish History, Menzies Fergusson 1905</ref> In the same year [[Laurence Pullar|Laurence]] and [[Edmund Pullar]] moved to Bridge of Allan to open the huge Keirfield Works on the south-west of the town.
