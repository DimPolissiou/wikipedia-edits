{"title_page": "Papiria gens", "text_new": "The '''gens Papiria''' was an ancient [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family at [[ancient Rome|Rome]].  According to tradition, the Papirii had already achieved prominence in the time of the [[Roman kingdom|kings]], and the first [[Rex Sacrorum]] was a member of this [[gens]].  [[Lucius Papirius Mugillanus]] was the first of the Papirii to obtain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 444 BC.  The patrician members of the family regularly occupied the highest offices of the Roman state down to the time of the [[Punic Wars]].  Most of the Papirii who held office under the later [[Roman Republic|Republic]] belonged to various [[plebs|plebeian]] branches of the family.  Although the most illustrious Papirii flourished in the time of the Republic, a number of the family continued to hold high office during the first two centuries of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 118 (\"Papiria Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n[[Cicero]] described the history of the Papirii to his friend, Papirius Paetus, a plebeian member of the family, who was unaware of the patrician origin of the family.  According to Cicero, the Papirii were one of the ''gentes minores'', the lesser of two divisions made amongst the patrician gentes at Rome.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\">Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Familiares'', ix. 21.</ref>  The ''gentes maiores'' were the greatest or most noble patrician houses, while the rest of the patrician families made up the ''gentes minores''.  The precise distinction between the two divisions is not known, nor have any lists of the families belonging to each survived from antiquity.  However, it has been suggested that the ''gentes maiores'' consisted, at least in part, of the families who came to Rome in the time of [[Romulus]], while the ''gentes minores'' consisted of the patrician families that were enrolled after the destruction of [[Alba Longa]], or under the Tarquins.<ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\nThe original form of the [[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]] ''Papirius'' was ''Papisius'', and all of the early Papirii would have been known by this name, although in later times they were always referred to as Papirii.  A number of other ancient nomina experienced the same evolution; ''Fusius'' becoming ''Furius'', ''Valesius'' becoming ''Valerius'', and ''Vetusius'' becoming ''Veturius''.  Cicero writes that the first of the Papirii to adopt the \"modern\" spelling was Lucius Papirius Crassus, consul in BC 336.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief [[praenomen|praenomina]] of the Papirii during the Republic were ''[[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]], [[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]], [[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]], [[Manius (praenomen)|Manius]]'', and ''[[Spurius (praenomen)|Spurius]]''.  The first three were the most common of all Roman names, while ''Manius'' and ''Spurius'' were much more distinctive.  The only other praenomina found among the patrician Papirii are ''[[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]'', and perhaps ''[[Sextus (praenomen)|Sextus]]'' or ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]]'', known from individual instances, but only ''Publius'' is known from the other members of the gens.  The plebeian Papirii Carbones used primarily ''Gaius'' and ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]''; this last was a common name not found among the ancient patrician stirpes, but which was still used by the Papirii of imperial times.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nFrom at least the time of the early Republic, the Papirii are divided into a number of branches, or ''stirpes'', distinguished by their surnames.  Cicero lists the patrician [[cognomen|cognomina]] of the Papirii as ''Crassus, Cursor, Maso'', and ''Mugillanus'', while the plebeian families included those of ''Carbo, Paetus'', and ''Turdus''.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\nThe Papirii Mugillani were the first of these families to obtain the consulship.  Their surname was derived from an ancient city of [[Latium]] known as ''Mugilla'', the ancestral home of the Papirii.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 1119 (\"Mugillanus\").</ref>  According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], Mugilla was conquered by [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Coriolanus]] after he was banished from Rome and went over to the [[Volsci]].<ref>Dionysius, viii. 36.</ref>  It must have been in the vicinity of the Volscian towns of [[Pollusca]] and [[Corioli]], but it was evidently deserted at a very early date, as [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] does not mention it among his list of former cities in Latium.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'', vol. II, p. 376 (\"Mugilla\").</ref>\n\nThe Papirii Crassi appear almost simultaneously with the Mugillani, and remained a distinct family down to the [[Samnite Wars|Second Samnite War]].  Their surname, ''Crassus'', which means \"thick\" or \"fat\", was common to a number of prominent gentes, including the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]] and the [[Licinia (gens)|Licinii]].<ref>Chase, p. 110.</ref>\n\n''Cursor'', the surname of the third branch of the Papirii to achieve prominence, means \"a runner\", and was probably bestowed upon the ancestor of the family because of his speed.  The Papirii Cursores appear in history from the early fourth century BC to the beginning of the third.<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 904, 905 (\"Cursor\").</ref>\n\nThe surname ''Maso'', sometimes spelled ''Masso'', is derived from the [[Latin]] ''massa'', a \"mass\" or \"lump\".<ref>Chase, p. 113.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. masso''.</ref>  The Papirii Masones were the last of the distinct patrician families of this gens, although some of the other Papirii were also patricians, including Lucius Papirius Praetextatus, [[Roman censor|censor]] in 272 BC.  The Masones occur from the end of the fourth century BC down to the time of Cicero.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 970 (\"Maso\").</ref><ref name=\"Broughton I 198\">Broughton, vol. I, p. 198.</ref>\n\nAmong the plebeian branches of the Papiria gens, the most important was that surnamed ''Carbo'', referring to a piece of coal or charcoal; metaphorically, something black, or of little value.<ref name=\"Chase 113\">Chase, p. 113.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. carbo, coal''.</ref>  The Papirii Carbones appear in the first half of the second century BC, and continued down to the time of Cicero.<ref name=\"DGRBM Carbo\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 610\u2013612 (\"Carbo\").</ref>\n\n''Paetus'', the surname of Cicero's plebeian friend, referred to a mild defect of vision, variously described as \"blink-eyed\", or \"squinty\".  This common cognomen implied a lesser deficit than ''Strabo'', \"squinty\", ''Luscus'', \"one-eyed\", or ''Caecus'', \"blind\", and could even be regarded as endearing; it was an epithet of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].<ref>Chase, p. 109.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. paetus, caecus, luscus, strabo''.</ref><ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

According to tradition, the Papirii had already achieved prominence in the time of the [[Roman kingdom|kings]], and the first [[Rex Sacrorum]] was a member of this [[gens]].  [[Lucius Papirius Mugillanus]] was the first of the Papirii to obtain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 444 BC.  The patrician members of the family regularly occupied the highest offices of the Roman state down to the time of the [[Punic Wars]].  Most of the Papirii who held office under the later [[Roman Republic|Republic]] belonged to various [[plebs|plebeian]] branches of the family.  Although the most illustrious Papirii flourished in the time of the Republic, a number of the family continued to hold high office during the first two centuries of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 118 (\"Papiria Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n[[Cicero]] described the history of the Papirii to his friend, Papirius Paetus, a plebeian member of the family, who was unaware of the patrician origin of the family.  According to Cicero, the Papirii were one of the ''gentes minores'', the lesser of two divisions made amongst the patrician gentes at Rome.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\">Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Familiares'', ix. 21.</ref>  The ''gentes maiores'' were the greatest or most noble patrician houses, while the rest of the patrician families made up the ''gentes minores''.  The precise distinction between the two divisions is not known, nor have any lists of the families belonging to each survived from antiquity.  However, it has been suggested that the ''gentes maiores'' consisted, at least in part, of the families who came to Rome in the time of [[Romulus]], while the ''gentes minores'' consisted of the patrician families that were enrolled after the destruction of [[Alba Longa]], or under the Tarquins.<ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\nThe original form of the [[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]] ''Papirius'' was ''Papisius'', and all of the early Papirii would have been known by this name, although in later times they were always referred to as Papirii.  A number of other ancient nomina experienced the same evolution; ''Fusius'' becoming ''Furius'', ''Valesius'' becoming ''Valerius'', and ''Vetusius'' becoming ''Veturius''.  Cicero writes that the first of the Papirii to adopt the \"modern\" spelling was Lucius Papirius Crassus, consul in BC 336.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief [[praenomen|praenomina]] of the Papirii during the Republic were ''[[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]], [[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]], [[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]], [[Manius (praenomen)|Manius]]'', and ''[[Spurius (praenomen)|Spurius]]''.  The first three were the most common of all Roman names, while ''Manius'' and ''Spurius'' were much more distinctive.  The only other praenomina found among the patrician Papirii are ''[[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]'', and perhaps ''[[Sextus (praenomen)|Sextus]]'' or ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]]'', known from individual instances, but only ''Publius'' is known from the other members of the gens.  The plebeian Papirii Carbones used primarily ''Gaius'' and ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]''; this last was a common name not found among the ancient patrician stirpes, but which was still used by the Papirii of imperial times.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nFrom at least the time of the early Republic, the Papirii are divided into a number of branches, or ''stirpes'', distinguished by their surnames.  Cicero lists the patrician [[cognomen|cognomina]] of the Papirii as ''Crassus, Cursor, Maso'', and ''Mugillanus'', while the plebeian families included those of ''Carbo, Paetus'', and ''Turdus''.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\nThe Papirii Mugillani were the first of these families to obtain the consulship.  Their surname was derived from an ancient city of [[Latium]] known as ''Mugilla'', the ancestral home of the Papirii.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 1119 (\"Mugillanus\").</ref>  According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], Mugilla was conquered by [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Coriolanus]] after he was banished from Rome and went over to the [[Volsci]].<ref>Dionysius, viii. 36.</ref>  It must have been in the vicinity of the Volscian towns of [[Pollusca]] and [[Corioli]], but it was evidently deserted at a very early date, as [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] does not mention it among his list of former cities in Latium.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'', vol. II, p. 376 (\"Mugilla\").</ref>\n\nThe Papirii Crassi appear almost simultaneously with the Mugillani, and remained a distinct family down to the [[Samnite Wars|Second Samnite War]].  Their surname, ''Crassus'', which means \"thick\" or \"fat\", was common to a number of prominent gentes, including the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]] and the [[Licinia (gens)|Licinii]].<ref>Chase, p. 110.</ref>\n\n''Cursor'', the surname of the third branch of the Papirii to achieve prominence, means \"a runner\", and was probably bestowed upon the ancestor of the family because of his speed.  The Papirii Cursores appear in history from the early fourth century BC to the beginning of the third.<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 904, 905 (\"Cursor\").</ref>\n\nThe surname ''Maso'', sometimes spelled ''Masso'', is derived from the [[Latin]] ''massa'', a \"mass\" or \"lump\".<ref>Chase, p. 113.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. masso''.</ref>  The Papirii Masones were the last of the distinct patrician families of this gens, although some of the other Papirii were also patricians, including Lucius Papirius Praetextatus, [[Roman censor|censor]] in 272 BC.  The Masones occur from the end of the fourth century BC down to the time of Cicero.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 970 (\"Maso\").</ref><ref name=\"Broughton I 198\">Broughton, vol. I, p. 198.</ref>\n\nAmong the plebeian branches of the Papiria gens, the most important was that surnamed ''Carbo'', referring to a piece of coal or charcoal; metaphorically, something black, or of little value.<ref name=\"Chase 113\">Chase, p. 113.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. carbo, coal''.</ref>  The Papirii Carbones appear in the first half of the second century BC, and continued down to the time of Cicero.<ref name=\"DGRBM Carbo\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 610\u2013612 (\"Carbo\").</ref>\n\n''Paetus'', the surname of Cicero's plebeian friend, referred to a mild defect of vision, variously described as \"blink-eyed\", or \"squinty\".  This common cognomen implied a lesser deficit than ''Strabo'', \"squinty\", ''Luscus'', \"one-eyed\", or ''Caecus'', \"blind\", and could even be regarded as endearing; it was an epithet of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].<ref>Chase, p. 109.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. paetus, caecus, luscus, strabo''.</ref><ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.
