This image was taken shortly before the sign's 1978 restoration.]]\nOver the course of more than half a century, the sign, designed to stand for only 18 months, sustained extensive damage and deterioration.\n\nThe letter ''H'' was destroyed in the 1940s. According to one account, the sign's caretaker Albert Kothe, driving while intoxicated, was nearing the top of Mount Lee when he lost control of his vehicle and drove off the cliff directly behind the ''H''. While Kothe was not injured, his car and the letter ''H'' were both destroyed. The Hollywood Sign Trust disputes this story, and instead says that the ''H'' was felled by heavy winds in early 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodsign.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hollywood-Sign-Brochure-FINAL_102918.pdf|title=The Saga of the Sign|author=Hollywood Sign Trust|date=October 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce began a contract with the City of Los Angeles Parks Department to repair and rebuild the sign.

According to one account, the sign's caretaker Albert Kothe, driving while intoxicated, was nearing the top of Mount Lee when he lost control of his vehicle and drove off the cliff directly behind the ''H''. While Kothe was not injured, his car and the letter ''H'' were both destroyed.
