His father was a Manhattan tailor.<ref name=\"vty\" />\n\nBegelman was in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. He then became a student at [[New York University]]. Following college, he worked in the insurance business.<ref name=\"vty\" /> He worked at the Music Corporation of America ([[MCA Inc.]]) for more than 11 years starting in the mid-1950s,<ref name=\"vty\" /> eventually becoming vice president. He left in 1960 to co-found the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA) with [[Freddie Fields]].<ref name=\"vty\" /> Their clients included [[Judy Garland]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Fred Astaire]]. At CMA, Fields and Begelman pioneered the movie \"package\", where the talent agency put their stars, directors and writers together on a single project.<ref name=\"vty\" />\n\nBegelman left CMA in 1973 to take over the floundering [[Columbia Pictures]]. Begelman used his package method at Columbia, dramatically changing the company's image by producing such hits as ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), ''[[Funny Lady]]'' (1975) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).<ref name=\"vty\" /> Begelman was among the first Hollywood agents to cross over and rise to the top of the studio system.\n\n==Embezzlement scandal==\nIn February 1977, actor [[Cliff Robertson]] received a [[IRS tax forms#1099 series|1099]] form from the IRS indicating he had received $10,000 from Columbia Pictures during 1976. He had never received the money, and discovered that his signature on the cashed check had been forged. Robertson's report started a criminal investigation. The [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) verified that the $10,000 check was a forgery, and it was tracked to Begelman. He was ultimately fined and sentenced to community service and a public service, anti-drug documentary for the forgeries.<ref name=\"vty\" />\n\nColumbia Pictures suspended Begelman on a paid vacation and announced its own investigation. The studio discovered that Begelman had embezzled an additional $65,000 through other forged checks. However, the studio [[board of directors]] wanted to keep the matter out of the press. The Begelman scandal led to a rift between Columbia executives. Columbia Pictures [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Alan Hirschfield]] was ousted from the studio in 1978 following his refusal to reinstate Begelman on moral grounds.<ref name=variety>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Stedman|title=Alan Hirschfield, Former Columbia Chief Exec, Dies at 79 |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/alan-hirschfield-former-columbia-chief-exec-dies-at-79-1201408596/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2015-01-16 |accessdate=2015-02-08}}</ref> Following a brief reinstatement, Begelman was quietly fired. The studio released a statement saying he had suffered emotional problems.\n\nDespite the pressure to remain quiet, Robertson and his wife [[Dina Merrill]] spoke to the press. David McClintick broke the story in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 1978, later turning it into a best-selling book, ''Indecent Exposure'' (1982). Robertson later claimed he had been blacklisted during the 1980s for coming forward about the Begelman affair, and had few roles during this period.\n\n[[Kirk Douglas]], in his autobiography ''[[The Ragman's Son]]'' (1988), wrote of the scandal: \n{{Quote\n|text= \nThis is the town where Cliff Robertson exposed David Begelman as a forger and a thief, with the net result that Begelman got a standing ovation at a Hollywood restaurant, while Robertson was blacklisted for four years.

Yale responded that Begelman had never attended that university. The ''New West'' article said that \"although Begelman was indicted for forgery and grand theft, the Hollywood types were more outraged that he had listed Yale in ''Who's Who''. Apparently they figured that everybody steals money. It was the fact that he lied about Yale that drove them crazy.\"\n\n==Judy Garland management==\n{{unreferenced section|date = March 2020}}\nIn 1993, a book by Coyne Steven Sanders, ''Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show'' (Morrow 1990), about the history of Judy Garland's [[CBS Television]] series ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' (1963\u20131964), devoted a chapter to possible embezzlement of Garland's funds by Begelman. Garland's estranged husband at the time, [[Sid Luft]], hired an attorney to audit her income from the time Begelman began representing her with fellow agent [[Freddie Fields]]. It was discovered that several hundred thousand dollars were missing, much of it written in checks to \"Cash\" and endorsed by Begelman at various casinos in Las Vegas. Other entries in her accounts showed large sums paid for \"protection\" with no authorization, all approved by Begelman, though Garland had no personal security. In addition, a 1963 Cadillac convertible, given to Garland as partial payment for appearances on [[Jack Paar]]'s television program, was titled to Begelman. Garland never knew the car was part of her compensation for her appearance.\n\nIn addition, Begelman told Garland a photo existed of her, partially nude, having her stomach pumped in a hospital emergency room after a drug overdose in London, and that blackmailers were demanding $50,000 to turn over the picture and all negatives. As she was in negotiations with CBS at the time for her new television series, Garland paid rather than face the adverse publicity and potentially damaging the deal's prospects. Luft's attorney eventually determined that the check went to a holding company with a business address in New York City owned by Begelman, and was further traced to a personal account of Begelman.\n\nRather than confront Begelman at a time when he was playing such a pivotal role in her show business re-emergence, Garland decided to eat the financial losses based upon the promise of millions coming from the deal with CBS. However, once her show was cancelled, she and Luft sued Begelman for the hundreds of thousands he had allegedly stolen as well as $1 million in punitive damages. Due to her dire financial situation at the time, Garland was forced to settle the suit for royalties owed her by [[Capitol Records]] that Begelman and Fields, as her agents, had collected but were holding because of the lawsuit.\n\n==Sherwood Productions / Gladden Entertainment==\nIn January 1980, Begelman returned to the production world and became COO and president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signing a four-year contract worth $1.9 million.<ref name=UA/> In 1981, MGM acquired [[United Artists]] and in October, Begelman was appointed as chairman and CEO of UA<ref name=UA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 7, 1981|page=5|title=Begelman Furnishes UA With New Chair|last=Tusher|first=Will}}</ref> but with the exception of ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' and ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'', he was unable to repeat his success at Columbia and was dismissed in 1982.<ref>{{citation|last=Finler|first=Joel W.|date=April 2, 1992|title=The Hollywood Story|edition=Second|publisher=Mandarin|page=[https://archive.org/details/hollywoodstory00joel/page/327 327]|ISBN=0-7493-0637-8|url=https://archive.org/details/hollywoodstory00joel/page/327}}</ref> After leaving MGM/UA, Begelman was offered a position to run a production company, Sherwood Productions, by backer [[Bruce McNall]].<ref>McNall & D'Antonio, pg. 88</ref> Under Sherwood, Begelman backed ''[[WarGames]]'' (which started production at MGM), ''[[Mr. Mom]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension]]'', and ''[[Blame It on Rio]]''. According to the makers of ''Buckaroo Banzai'', Begelman continued to be engaged in fraud: reporting inflated figures to investors but producing the films for much less to pocket the difference.\n\nWhen investor [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]] pulled out of Sherwood in 1984, Begelman took the slack and founded Gladden Entertainment (named after Gladyce, his wife)<ref name=NYTGladyce>{{cite news|title=Gladyce Largever Begelman, Author and Party Consultant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/30/obituaries/gladyce-largever-begelman-author-and-party-consultant.html|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=30 June 1986}}</ref> with the remaining assets<ref>McNall & D'Antonio, pg. 94\u201398</ref> and repartnering with McNall. There, he greenlit ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'', ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]'', ''[[The Fabulous Baker Boys]]'', ''[[Short Time]]'' and ''[[Mannequin Two: On the Move]]''. ''Short Time'' and ''Mannequin Two'' did poorly. In 1988, McNall sold 40% of his ownership to foreign investors. At the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, Begelman revealed that the company had a distribution deal with MGM, Live Entertainment and Rank Film Distributors for 10-film and $150-million. However, [[Credit Lyonnais]] had placed a lien on Gladden's assets as the bank was owed $90 million. A petition was filed by Hollywood's three major talent guilds in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles to liquidate the company for failure to pay actors, directors and writers residuals in the amount of $4.1 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bates|first1=James|last2=Dillman|first2=Lisa|title=Guilds Seek Back Residuals From Gladden|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-07/business/fi-43179_1_film-production|accessdate=May 23, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 7, 1994}}</ref> Begelman left Gladden Entertainment to found Gladden Productions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bates|first1=James|last2=Dillman|first2=Lisa|title=Embattled McNall Sued in Back Rent Dispute|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-15/sports/sp-46346_1_real-estate|accessdate=May 23, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 15, 1994}}</ref> However, he was not able to get funding for the new production company.<ref name=vty>{{cite news|last1=Eller|first1=Claudia|last2=Dutka|first2=Eliane|title=Begelman, Ex-Columbia Chief, an Apparent Suicide|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-09/news/mn-33242_1_david-begelman|accessdate=May 23, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 9, 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and suicide==\nBegelman was married four times.

His father was a Manhattan tailor.<ref name=\"vty\" />\n\nBegelman was in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. He then became a student at [[New York University]]. Following college, he worked in the insurance business.<ref name=\"vty\" /> He worked at the Music Corporation of America ([[MCA Inc.]]) for more than 11 years starting in the mid-1950s,<ref name=\"vty\" /> eventually becoming vice president. He left in 1960 to co-found the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA) with [[Freddie Fields]].<ref name=\"vty\" /> Their clients included [[Judy Garland]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Fred Astaire]]. At CMA, Fields and Begelman pioneered the movie \"package\", where the talent agency put their stars, directors and writers together on a single project.<ref name=\"vty\" />\n\nBegelman left CMA in 1973 to take over the floundering [[Columbia Pictures]]. Begelman used his package method at Columbia, dramatically changing the company's image by producing such hits as ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), ''[[Funny Lady]]'' (1975) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).<ref name=\"vty\" /> Begelman was among the first Hollywood agents to cross over and rise to the top of the studio system.\n\n==Embezzlement scandal==\nIn February 1977, actor [[Cliff Robertson]] received a [[IRS tax forms#1099 series|1099]] form from the IRS indicating he had received $10,000 from Columbia Pictures during 1976. He had never received the money, and discovered that his signature on the cashed check had been forged. Robertson's report started a criminal investigation. The [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) verified that the $10,000 check was a forgery, and it was tracked to Begelman. He was ultimately fined and sentenced to community service and a public service, anti-drug documentary for the forgeries.<ref name=\"vty\" />\n\nColumbia Pictures suspended Begelman on a paid vacation and announced its own investigation. The studio discovered that Begelman had embezzled an additional $65,000 through other forged checks. However, the studio [[board of directors]] wanted to keep the matter out of the press. The Begelman scandal led to a rift between Columbia executives. Columbia Pictures [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Alan Hirschfield]] was ousted from the studio in 1978 following his refusal to reinstate Begelman on moral grounds.<ref name=variety>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Stedman|title=Alan Hirschfield, Former Columbia Chief Exec, Dies at 79 |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/alan-hirschfield-former-columbia-chief-exec-dies-at-79-1201408596/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2015-01-16 |accessdate=2015-02-08}}</ref> Following a brief reinstatement, Begelman was quietly fired. The studio released a statement saying he had suffered emotional problems.\n\nDespite the pressure to remain quiet, Robertson and his wife [[Dina Merrill]] spoke to the press. David McClintick broke the story in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 1978, later turning it into a best-selling book, ''Indecent Exposure'' (1982). Robertson later claimed he had been blacklisted during the 1980s for coming forward about the Begelman affair, and had few roles during this period.\n\n[[Kirk Douglas]], in his autobiography ''[[The Ragman's Son]]'' (1988), wrote of the scandal: \n{{Quote\n|text= \nThis is the town where Cliff Robertson exposed David Begelman as a forger and a thief, with the net result that Begelman got a standing ovation at a Hollywood restaurant, while Robertson was blacklisted for four years. On the bad days, you think of what [[Tallulah Bankhead]] said: \"Who do I have to fuck to get out of this business?\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Douglas |first= Kirk |date= 1988 |title= The Ragman's Son |url= https://archive.org/details/ragmanssonaut00doug_0 |url-access= registration |location= [[New York City]] |publisher= [[Pocket Books]] |page= [https://archive.org/details/ragmanssonaut00doug_0/page/133 133] |isbn= 0-671-63718-5 |author-link= Kirk Douglas }}</ref>\n}}\n\nA writer for ''New West'' magazine, working on this story, queried Begelman's claimed alma mater, [[Yale University]], listed in his ''[[Marquis Who's Who|Who's Who]]'' entry. Yale responded that Begelman had never attended that university. The ''New West'' article said that \"although Begelman was indicted for forgery and grand theft, the Hollywood types were more outraged that he had listed Yale in ''Who's Who''. Apparently they figured that everybody steals money. It was the fact that he lied about Yale that drove them crazy.\"\n\n==Judy Garland management==\n{{unreferenced section|date = March 2020}}\nIn 1993, a book by Coyne Steven Sanders, ''Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show'' (Morrow 1990), about the history of Judy Garland's [[CBS Television]] series ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' (1963\u20131964), devoted a chapter to possible embezzlement of Garland's funds by Begelman. Garland's estranged husband at the time, [[Sid Luft]], hired an attorney to audit her income from the time Begelman began representing her with fellow agent [[Freddie Fields]]. It was discovered that several hundred thousand dollars were missing, much of it written in checks to \"Cash\" and endorsed by Begelman at various casinos in Las Vegas. Other entries in her accounts showed large sums paid for \"protection\" with no authorization, all approved by Begelman, though Garland had no personal security. In addition, a 1963 Cadillac convertible, given to Garland as partial payment for appearances on [[Jack Paar]]'s television program, was titled to Begelman. Garland never knew the car was part of her compensation for her appearance.\n\nIn addition, Begelman told Garland a photo existed of her, partially nude, having her stomach pumped in a hospital emergency room after a drug overdose in London, and that blackmailers were demanding $50,000 to turn over the picture and all negatives. As she was in negotiations with CBS at the time for her new television series, Garland paid rather than face the adverse publicity and potentially damaging the deal's prospects. Luft's attorney eventually determined that the check went to a holding company with a business address in New York City owned by Begelman, and was further traced to a personal account of Begelman.\n\nRather than confront Begelman at a time when he was playing such a pivotal role in her show business re-emergence, Garland decided to eat the financial losses based upon the promise of millions coming from the deal with CBS. However, once her show was cancelled, she and Luft sued Begelman for the hundreds of thousands he had allegedly stolen as well as $1 million in punitive damages. Due to her dire financial situation at the time, Garland was forced to settle the suit for royalties owed her by [[Capitol Records]] that Begelman and Fields, as her agents, had collected but were holding because of the lawsuit.\n\n==Sherwood Productions / Gladden Entertainment==\nIn January 1980, Begelman returned to the production world and became COO and president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signing a four-year contract worth $1.9 million.<ref name=UA/> In 1981, MGM acquired [[United Artists]] and in October, Begelman was appointed as chairman and CEO of UA<ref name=UA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 7, 1981|page=5|title=Begelman Furnishes UA With New Chair|last=Tusher|first=Will}}</ref> but with the exception of ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' and ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'', he was unable to repeat his success at Columbia and was dismissed in 1982.<ref>{{citation|last=Finler|first=Joel W.|date=April 2, 1992|title=The Hollywood Story|edition=Second|publisher=Mandarin|page=[https://archive.org/details/hollywoodstory00joel/page/327 327]|ISBN=0-7493-0637-8|url=https://archive.org/details/hollywoodstory00joel/page/327}}</ref> After leaving MGM/UA, Begelman was offered a position to run a production company, Sherwood Productions, by backer [[Bruce McNall]].<ref>McNall & D'Antonio, pg. 88</ref> Under Sherwood, Begelman backed ''[[WarGames]]'' (which started production at MGM), ''[[Mr. Mom]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension]]'', and ''[[Blame It on Rio]]''. According to the makers of ''Buckaroo Banzai'', Begelman continued to be engaged in fraud: reporting inflated figures to investors but producing the films for much less to pocket the difference.\n\nWhen investor [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]] pulled out of Sherwood in 1984, Begelman took the slack and founded Gladden Entertainment (named after Gladyce, his wife)<ref name=NYTGladyce>{{cite news|title=Gladyce Largever Begelman, Author and Party Consultant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/30/obituaries/gladyce-largever-begelman-author-and-party-consultant.html|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=30 June 1986}}</ref> with the remaining assets<ref>McNall & D'Antonio, pg. 94\u201398</ref> and repartnering with McNall. There, he greenlit ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'', ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]'', ''[[The Fabulous Baker Boys]]'', ''[[Short Time]]'' and ''[[Mannequin Two: On the Move]]''. ''Short Time'' and ''Mannequin Two'' did poorly. In 1988, McNall sold 40% of his ownership to foreign investors. At the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, Begelman revealed that the company had a distribution deal with MGM, Live Entertainment and Rank Film Distributors for 10-film and $150-million. However, [[Credit Lyonnais]] had placed a lien on Gladden's assets as the bank was owed $90 million. A petition was filed by Hollywood's three major talent guilds in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles to liquidate the company for failure to pay actors, directors and writers residuals in the amount of $4.1 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bates|first1=James|last2=Dillman|first2=Lisa|title=Guilds Seek Back Residuals From Gladden|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-07/business/fi-43179_1_film-production|accessdate=May 23, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 7, 1994}}</ref> Begelman left Gladden Entertainment to found Gladden Productions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bates|first1=James|last2=Dillman|first2=Lisa|title=Embattled McNall Sued in Back Rent Dispute|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-15/sports/sp-46346_1_real-estate|accessdate=May 23, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 15, 1994}}</ref> However, he was not able to get funding for the new production company.<ref name=vty>{{cite news|last1=Eller|first1=Claudia|last2=Dutka|first2=Eliane|title=Begelman, Ex-Columbia Chief, an Apparent Suicide|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-09/news/mn-33242_1_david-begelman|accessdate=May 23, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 9, 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and suicide==\nBegelman was married four times.

an art school and studio that was influential in the teaching and promotion of [[printmaking]] in the 20th century. Originally located in [[Paris]], the studio relocated to [[New York City|New York]] during the years surrounding [[World War II]]. It moved back to Paris in 1950.\n\n==History==\nThe Atelier 17 studio was formed as an experimental workshop for the graphic arts in Paris, France in 1927 by [[Stanley William Hayter]] (1901\u20131988).<ref name=\"mma\">{{cite web |last1=Farrell |first1=Jennifer |title=Expanding Possibilities: Stanley William Hayter and Atelier 17 |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/ruminations/2016/workshop-and-legacy-stanley-william-hayter |website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=17 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Atelier Contrepoint\">{{cite web |title=20th Century modern printmaking - S.

By 1940 the studio's founder, Hayter, left Paris as World War II was starting. He moved to New York City and reopened his Atelier 17 studio there.
