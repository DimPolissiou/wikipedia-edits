However, the work was not printed until the end of 1783, and new advertisements pointed to its suitability as a Christmas present. It was reviewed in ''{{ill|Svenska Parnassen|sv}}'', and received good reviews.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=246-247}}\n\n==Publication==\n[[File:William Hogarth Beer Street detail.jpeg|thumb|The book's illustrator, Elias Martin, studied [[William Hogarth]]'s illustrations, such as his 1751 ''[[Beer Street]]'' (detail shown).]]\n\n''Bacchi Tempel'' was published in 1783 by Kongliga Tryckeriet, the Swedish royal printing press in Stockholm. It was Bellman's first book. The illustrations were by the landscape painter [[Elias Martin]]; they were engraved by his brother [[Johan Fredrik Martin]]. The brothers were friends of Bellman's; Elias had studied painting, especially [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]'s, in London and had come back to Stockholm in 1780. The book had been planned as the first volume of a two-volume set; the second was to have been ''Fr\u00f6jas Tempel'' (\"Freya's Temple\"), but it never appeared.{{sfn|Britten Austin|1967|pp=132-133}}\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Bacchi Tempel.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Elias Martin of drunken celebrations by the \"Order of [[Bacchus]]\" from ''Bacchi Tempel'', 1783, engraved by his brother [[Johan Fredrik Martin]].]]\n\nThe play takes place around a temple dedicated to [[Bacchus]], the god of wine, on an island of mixed flora and fauna: there are pine trees and crows as well as parrots and almond trees. Somewhere nearby, the goddess of pleasure [[Fr\u00f6ja]] also has a temple. Around the temple, a celebration is being commemorated by the dead Movitz, initially by a group of [backers] under the leadership of the highly pregnant Ulla Winblad. The work begins with a stormy night, but at dawn the storm passes and everything turns into rural idyll, and the readers are informed that it is Movitz who is the father of Ulla's children, and she describes how it came to be in this particular place. Then the male participants, the \"brothers of the order\" arrive in boats, led by the order's \"grenadier\" Mollberg and its sexton Trundman, and march up to the temple. When they arrive, together with barrels of drink, songs and celebrations are held in honour first of the dead, then of Trundman and the brothers, Ulla and the priests, the order's chancellor Planberg, and finally the head of the order, Janke Jensen. The rituals are interrupted from time to time by various intermezzos, but eventually fade out completely as Ulla gives birth to a new Movitz, and everything turns into a happy party.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=248-250}}\n\nThe extended version seems to have become difficult to play; where the original version could be performed in one hour, the final required at least two. The entire extension is due to longer monologues and additional pieces of music, making it rather static as a piece of theatre.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|p=250}}\n\nThe added landscape depictions are partly based on the nature being painted as a picture, which, however, must at the same time be animated and linked together with the speaker's emotions. Thus, when the initial storm is portrayed by the Bacchus priestess, it is not only a storm, but also her own anxiety and terror as described, in pre-romantic style. When the storm has subsided, the priestesses' attitude to the surroundings also changes, and the now pastoral landscape instead evokes happy memories of past happiness, when Movitz with roses in his hair used to honour the wine god with song. Ulla then takes the word, and more and more excitedly she describes his memories of him, before she sees through a telescope both the love goddess in the sky and a young \"nymph\" named Belinda.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=251-256}}\n\nWhen the men arrive, the women quickly become more crass: they describe the \"Knights of Bacchus\" in ironic terms as \"heroes\" who, however, urinate on planks and resemble roast pigs. Sexton Trundman takes over and describes the night's storm, with words taken from [[Jacob Wallenberg]]'s ''{{ill|Min son p\u00e5 galejan|sv}}'' (\"My son at the galley\"), possibly to add an air of authenticity.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=257-259}}\n\nIn the closing passage, spoken by Janke Jensen, it is no longer a question of depicting nature: now a mythological tableau is painted, with Movitz on [[Mount Olympus]] together with ancient gods and heroes such as [[Mars (mythology)| Mars]], [[Pompey]], and [[Hannibal]]. Suddenly he turns back to mortality, and goes on to portray Movitz's earthly existence as a drunkard, until he is interrupted by Ulla giving birth to his and Movitz's children, who resemble him right down to his red nose.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=259-261}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:B\u00f6ljan sig mindre r\u00f6r.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8<!--double image-->|''B\u00f6ljan sig mindre r\u00f6r'' (Still'd is the hasty wave), one of the songs in the book<ref>The [[Bellman Society]] have recorded the song, available at {{cite web |last1=Fr\u00f6ling |first1=Anders |title=B\u00f6ljan sig mindre r\u00f6r ur Bacchi Tempel |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MliX6MQ2EQ |publisher=[[Bellman Society|Bellmanss\u00e4llskapet]] |accessdate=15 December 2019}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Swedish scholar [[Lars L\u00f6nnroth]] called the book \"a curious hybrid of [[comic opera]] and [[mock-heroic]] poetry\", and one of Bellman's \"most ambitious\" projects, intended, in response to Kellgren's attack, to prove that he was a serious poet.

In 1780, extended versions in handwriting were handed over to [[Elis Schr\u00f6derheim]] and {{ill|Samuel af Ugglas|sv}}, suggesting that the author had great ambitions with the work, possibly with the aim of improving his reputation after he was attacked by the famous critic [[Johan Henric Kellgren]] in 1778 through the derisive ''{{ill|Mina l\u00f6jen|sv}}'' (\"My Laughter\").{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=244-245}}{{sfn|Burman|2019|pp=299, 438, 457, 539-542}} Bellman continued to work with the work, adding, among other things, long descriptions of nature in [[alexandrines]] in the style of [[James Thomson (poet, born 1700)|James Thomson]].{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=244-245}}{{sfn|Britten Austin|1967|pp=132-133}}\n\nThe work was advertised for sale via subscription in ''[[Stockholms Posten]]'' in September 1782, as a \"poetic, comic and musical work\". The announcement was aimed at \"lovers of madness\", which again points to ambitions. However, the work was not printed until the end of 1783, and new advertisements pointed to its suitability as a Christmas present. It was reviewed in ''{{ill|Svenska Parnassen|sv}}'', and received good reviews.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=246-247}}\n\n==Publication==\n[[File:William Hogarth Beer Street detail.jpeg|thumb|The book's illustrator, Elias Martin, studied [[William Hogarth]]'s illustrations, such as his 1751 ''[[Beer Street]]'' (detail shown).]]\n\n''Bacchi Tempel'' was published in 1783 by Kongliga Tryckeriet, the Swedish royal printing press in Stockholm. It was Bellman's first book. The illustrations were by the landscape painter [[Elias Martin]]; they were engraved by his brother [[Johan Fredrik Martin]]. The brothers were friends of Bellman's; Elias had studied painting, especially [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]'s, in London and had come back to Stockholm in 1780. The book had been planned as the first volume of a two-volume set; the second was to have been ''Fr\u00f6jas Tempel'' (\"Freya's Temple\"), but it never appeared.{{sfn|Britten Austin|1967|pp=132-133}}\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Bacchi Tempel.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Elias Martin of drunken celebrations by the \"Order of [[Bacchus]]\" from ''Bacchi Tempel'', 1783, engraved by his brother [[Johan Fredrik Martin]].]]\n\nThe play takes place around a temple dedicated to [[Bacchus]], the god of wine, on an island of mixed flora and fauna: there are pine trees and crows as well as parrots and almond trees. Somewhere nearby, the goddess of pleasure [[Fr\u00f6ja]] also has a temple. Around the temple, a celebration is being commemorated by the dead Movitz, initially by a group of [backers] under the leadership of the highly pregnant Ulla Winblad. The work begins with a stormy night, but at dawn the storm passes and everything turns into rural idyll, and the readers are informed that it is Movitz who is the father of Ulla's children, and she describes how it came to be in this particular place. Then the male participants, the \"brothers of the order\" arrive in boats, led by the order's \"grenadier\" Mollberg and its sexton Trundman, and march up to the temple. When they arrive, together with barrels of drink, songs and celebrations are held in honour first of the dead, then of Trundman and the brothers, Ulla and the priests, the order's chancellor Planberg, and finally the head of the order, Janke Jensen. The rituals are interrupted from time to time by various intermezzos, but eventually fade out completely as Ulla gives birth to a new Movitz, and everything turns into a happy party.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=248-250}}\n\nThe extended version seems to have become difficult to play; where the original version could be performed in one hour, the final required at least two. The entire extension is due to longer monologues and additional pieces of music, making it rather static as a piece of theatre.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|p=250}}\n\nThe added landscape depictions are partly based on the nature being painted as a picture, which, however, must at the same time be animated and linked together with the speaker's emotions. Thus, when the initial storm is portrayed by the Bacchus priestess, it is not only a storm, but also her own anxiety and terror as described, in pre-romantic style. When the storm has subsided, the priestesses' attitude to the surroundings also changes, and the now pastoral landscape instead evokes happy memories of past happiness, when Movitz with roses in his hair used to honour the wine god with song. Ulla then takes the word, and more and more excitedly she describes his memories of him, before she sees through a telescope both the love goddess in the sky and a young \"nymph\" named Belinda.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=251-256}}\n\nWhen the men arrive, the women quickly become more crass: they describe the \"Knights of Bacchus\" in ironic terms as \"heroes\" who, however, urinate on planks and resemble roast pigs. Sexton Trundman takes over and describes the night's storm, with words taken from [[Jacob Wallenberg]]'s ''{{ill|Min son p\u00e5 galejan|sv}}'' (\"My son at the galley\"), possibly to add an air of authenticity.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=257-259}}\n\nIn the closing passage, spoken by Janke Jensen, it is no longer a question of depicting nature: now a mythological tableau is painted, with Movitz on [[Mount Olympus]] together with ancient gods and heroes such as [[Mars (mythology)| Mars]], [[Pompey]], and [[Hannibal]]. Suddenly he turns back to mortality, and goes on to portray Movitz's earthly existence as a drunkard, until he is interrupted by Ulla giving birth to his and Movitz's children, who resemble him right down to his red nose.{{sfn|L\u00f6nnroth|2005|pp=259-261}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:B\u00f6ljan sig mindre r\u00f6r.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8<!--double image-->|''B\u00f6ljan sig mindre r\u00f6r'' (Still'd is the hasty wave), one of the songs in the book<ref>The [[Bellman Society]] have recorded the song, available at {{cite web |last1=Fr\u00f6ling |first1=Anders |title=B\u00f6ljan sig mindre r\u00f6r ur Bacchi Tempel |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MliX6MQ2EQ |publisher=[[Bellman Society|Bellmanss\u00e4llskapet]] |accessdate=15 December 2019}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Swedish scholar [[Lars L\u00f6nnroth]] called the book \"a curious hybrid of [[comic opera]] and [[mock-heroic]] poetry\", and one of Bellman's \"most ambitious\" projects, intended, in response to Kellgren's attack, to prove that he was a serious poet.

The modern Welsh name, ''Y Bont-faen'', translates as 'the stone bridge'. The English name is a direct translation of the older Welsh name of the town.<ref>Wyn Owen, H. and Morgan, R.

It is one of very few medieval [[walled town]]s in Wales, and substantial portions of the walls, together with the south gate, are still standing. On 13 March 1254, Cowbridge received its first borough charter from [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester|Richard de Clare]],<ref>''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''.

In 1245, he seized the manors of Llanblethian, Ruthin and Talyfan from Richard Siward, and the lordships of [[Miskin]] and Glynrhondda from Hywel ap Maredudd. In Llanblethian he founded the town of Cowbridge and in Miskin he founded the castle and town of [[Llantrisant]]. The largely medieval church of the Holy Cross was initially a [[chapel of ease]] to the parish church at Llanblethian. In 1307 [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford|Earl Gilbert de Clare]], grandson of Richard de Clare, began work on the stone fortifications of [[St Quintins Castle]] in Llanblethian.\n\nThe [[Battle of Stalling Down]] was fought near Cowbridge between an English army, serving [[Henry IV of England]] and a combined force of French and Welsh soldiers under [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] in 1403.  Details of the battle, its exact site and its outcome are scant, but the site has been recognised by [[Cadw]] for possible inclusion in a Register of Historic Battlefields in Wales.<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/battle-sites-set-official-status-1834514 Wales Online, \"Battle sites set to get official status\", 19 May 2011].

It was just outside the town that he held the first meeting of the [[Gorsedd]], an assembly of bards, in 1795. [[Cowbridge Grammar School]] was founded in 1608 and had close links with [[Jesus College, Oxford]] through its later benefactor, Dr [[Leoline Jenkins]]. Its famous pupils included the poet [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]] and the actor Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]]. The old [[grammar school]] eventually merged with Cowbridge High School for Girls to become a [[comprehensive school]], and the original buildings, having for some time lain derelict, have been converted into private accommodation.\n\n===Notable buildings===\n[[File:Boxing Day Hunt in Cowbridge.jpg|thumb|Boxing Day Hunt in Cowbridge]]\nThe present [[Cowbridge Town Hall]], a building whose foundations date back perhaps as far as the [[Elizabethan era]], served as a prison until 1830, when it was converted into a town hall to replace the former [[Guild Hall]], demolished at that date. The New Palladian Town Hall was built in 1830 by Isaiah Verity of Ash Hall who in gratitude was made a Freeman of Cowbridge. The money for the reconstruction was raised by public subscription.\n\nEight of the original prison cells are still intact, six of which house the exhibits of Cowbridge Museum.<ref>[http://www.cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/abtcouncil.html Cowbridge (Ancient Borough) with Llanblethian Town Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143320/http://cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/abtcouncil.html |date=2014-07-14 }}. Accessed 11 June 2013</ref> The remainder of the building is used by the town council and for public events. The museum holds archaeological finds from Cowbridge and district, as well as displays on the later history of the town, including industrial and domestic artefacts, a photographic collection, and a small historical costume collection.\n\nThe main street contains a number of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] houses, including the former town houses of important local families such as the Edmondes and Carnes. The Carnes' town house is known as Great House, a Grade 2* listed property of Medieval origin.\n\n===Modern times===\nCowbridge contains the following [[public house|inns]]: the Bear Hotel, the Horse and Groom, the Edmondes Arms, the Duke of Wellington and the Vale of Glamorgan. The latter is located at the premises of the former Vale of Glamorgan Brewery.\n\nClosely attached to the town of Cowbridge is the village of Aberthin. Aberthin contains two inns; The Hare and Hounds and The Farmers Arms.\n\nCowbridge once had a railway station, which opened in 1865 and closed in 1951.\n\nOn the 21 March 1950 a [[Bristol Freighter]] (Registration: G-AHJJ) on a test flight took off from [[Bristol Filton Airport]]. The aircraft crashed near Cowbridge after a structural failure of the fuselage. It caused the aircraft to enter spin and crash. The accident killed all four  passengers and crew on board.<ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19500321-0</ref>\n\nCowbridge was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=These towns have been named as the best places to live in Wales|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/towns-named-best-places-wales-12719747|publisher=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nA [[Cowbridge (electoral ward)|Cowbridge]] [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] exists for elections to the [[Vale of Glamorgan Council]].

It achieved 94% A*-C at GCSE in 2010. The school was located on three sites, with the Lower School in the south-west of the town and Middle School and [[Sixth Form]] in the north-east. Cowbridge Comprehensive School completed a major redevelopment in September 2010 to bring the entire school to one site (the former Middle School/Sixth Form site) using [[Welsh Assembly Government]] funding.<ref>[http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/our_council/council/minutes,_agendas__reports/reports/cabinet/2008/08-12-03/cowbridge_school.aspx Vale of Glamorgan Council]</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, the new school was officially opened to students. All approximately 1300 students can now be found on the one site instead of the three separate buildings that were all situated in different locations in Cowbridge. The former sixth form site on Aberthin Road is now derelict and awaiting redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pyke|first1=Chris|title=The grand derelict buildings currently for sale in Wales|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/commercial-property/grand-derelict-buildings-currently-sale-14508193|website=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\nY Bontfaen primary school in Borough Close has a roll of about 245 including the nursery Y Blodau Fach.\nYsgol Iolo Morganwg with Y Meithrin (\"the nursery\") is adjacent and is a Welsh speaking school.\n\n==Sport==\nCowbridge is home to [[Cowbridge RFC]] a [[Welsh Rugby Union]] affiliated [[rugby union]] team, which fields two senior, a youth and ladies team.\nCowbridge Cricket Club first played in 1840 and now has six senior and junior teams and is affiliated to the South Wales Cricket Association. Notable cricketers who have played for the club include former test players Hugh Morris, John Clay, [[Tony Lewis]], C F Walters and on one famous occasion [[Douglas Jardine]]. Among the many county cricketers produced by the club are the Glamorgan players Ben Wright and [[Alex Jones (cricketer)|Alex Jones]]. Glamorgan CCC played county fixtures at Cowbridge in the 1930s.\n\nCowbridge also has a leisure centre where can be found various clubs including, tennis, football and badminton. Behind Cowbridge Leisure Centre is Cowbridge Bowling Club and tennis courts.\n\nSeptember 2009 also saw the reintroduction of senior football to Cowbridge Town after a ten-year absence. Starting in the third tier of the Vale of Glamorgan Amateur Football League the team achieved great success in their first season back, achieving an unlikely cup-promotion double. The 2011-12 season saw the club gain their second promotion in three years to reach the premier division.\n\n==Cultural Activities==\nCowbridge is also home to the Cowbridge Amateur Dramatic Society (CADS), based at the Market Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Market Theatre|url=http://www.market-theatre.com/}}</ref> CADS was formed in 1947 and aims to stage three main productions each year. The Society also publishes a newsletter, ''\"The Thespian\"'', three or four times each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Market Theatre|url=http://www.market-theatre.com|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1997, when it 'outgrew' the Town Hall stage, Cowbridge was also home to the Cowbridge Amateur Operatic Society (CAOS).  Founded by a small group of enthusiasts, its first production was  \"The Pirates of Penzance\" in 1969.  CAOS continued its Gilbert and Sullivan theme until 1974, when the show of the year was \"Die Fledermaus\".  Still going strong, and having grown a youth wing (Total CAOS), CAOS is now based at Llantwit Major.\n\nSince 2004, the town has hosted the annual [[Cowbridge Food and Drink Festival]]. Currently, the festival takes place in late spring having originally taken place every October. The festival incorporates various food and drink exhibitors, food court and fringe festival. Many of the town's inns hold beer, ale and cider events.\n\nIn 2010 the Cowbridge Music Festival was founded which takes place every autumn in various venues throughout the town. The festival is made up of classical music, jazz and folk music and boasts an excellent outreach programme. In 2014 the acclaimed violinist [[Nicola Benedetti]] became the festival's patron.\n\nCowbridge History Society was created in 2013 out of a merger between the former Cowbridge & District Local History Society (founded in the 1970s) and Cowbridge Record Society, publishers of several books on the topics relating to the history of the town. It holds monthly meetings at the Town Hall throughout the winter and funds a Local History Studies Room (the \"Jeff Alden Room\") containing archival material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cowbridgehistorysociety.org/about-us.php|title=About Us|website=Cowbridge History Society|access-date=17 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n*[[Ieuan Evans]], former Wales rugby union player and rugby commentator\n*[[Anneka Rice]], television presenter\n*[[Stephen McPhail]], Irish international and current Cardiff City football player\n*[[Ernest William Jones]], cricketer for Glamorgan and Wales<ref name=\"James William Webb-Jones, Profile, Cricket Archive\"/>\n*[[Caryl Parry Jones]], singer and actress\n*[[James William Webb-Jones]], choral conductor<ref name=\"James William Webb-Jones, Profile, Cricket Archive\">{{cite web|title=James William Webb-Jones, Profile, Cricket Archive|url-access=subscription |url= https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1469/1469491/1469491.html}}</ref>\n*[[Nia Roberts (presenter)|Nia Roberts]], television and radio presenter\n\nNotable people who attended school in Cowbridge include:\n*[[Garfield Owen]] Welsh dual-code international rugby union, and rugby league footballer of the 1950s and 1960s\n*[[Patrick Hannan (presenter)|Patrick Hannan]], political journalist\n*Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]], Oscar-winning actor\n*[[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]], poet\n*[[Frances Hoggan]], First British woman to receive a doctorate in medicine from a university in Europe, and the first woman doctor to be registered in Wales.\n*[[Robin Hawkins]], lead singer and bassist of Welsh rock band 'The Automatic'.\n*[[James Frost]], singer and guitarist of The Automatic.\n*[[Iwan Griffiths]], drummer of The Automatic.\n*[[Nicky Piper]], former boxer\n*[[Rhian Wilkinson]], Olympic football player who represented Canada at the [[Football at the 2011 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]], [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|FIFA Women's World Cup]] and [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Twinning==\n\nCowbridge is twinned with [[Clisson]] in the [[Loire-Atlantique]] [[Departments of France|department]] in northwestern [[France]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Cowbridge Physic Garden]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\nC.

It is one of very few medieval [[walled town]]s in Wales, and substantial portions of the walls, together with the south gate, are still standing. On 13 March 1254, Cowbridge received its first borough charter from [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester|Richard de Clare]],<ref>''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''.

Richard de Clare was one of the most powerful Barons of the day, having huge estates stretching across much of south Wales and also lands in southeast England.\n\nThe [[Cowbridge town wall|town walls]] were built sometime in the latter half of the 13th century.<ref name=\"GG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk/arch/query/page.php?watprn=GGAT00248s|title=Cowbridge Town Wall |publisher=The Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Environment Record|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> From 1243, de Clare was actively extending his authority in Glamorgan. In 1245, he seized the manors of Llanblethian, Ruthin and Talyfan from Richard Siward, and the lordships of [[Miskin]] and Glynrhondda from Hywel ap Maredudd. In Llanblethian he founded the town of Cowbridge and in Miskin he founded the castle and town of [[Llantrisant]]. The largely medieval church of the Holy Cross was initially a [[chapel of ease]] to the parish church at Llanblethian. In 1307 [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford|Earl Gilbert de Clare]], grandson of Richard de Clare, began work on the stone fortifications of [[St Quintins Castle]] in Llanblethian.\n\nThe [[Battle of Stalling Down]] was fought near Cowbridge between an English army, serving [[Henry IV of England]] and a combined force of French and Welsh soldiers under [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] in 1403.  Details of the battle, its exact site and its outcome are scant, but the site has been recognised by [[Cadw]] for possible inclusion in a Register of Historic Battlefields in Wales.<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/battle-sites-set-official-status-1834514 Wales Online, \"Battle sites set to get official status\", 19 May 2011].

It was just outside the town that he held the first meeting of the [[Gorsedd]], an assembly of bards, in 1795. [[Cowbridge Grammar School]] was founded in 1608 and had close links with [[Jesus College, Oxford]] through its later benefactor, Dr [[Leoline Jenkins]]. Its famous pupils included the poet [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]] and the actor Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]]. The old [[grammar school]] eventually merged with Cowbridge High School for Girls to become a [[comprehensive school]], and the original buildings, having for some time lain derelict, have been converted into private accommodation.\n\n===Notable buildings===\n[[File:Boxing Day Hunt in Cowbridge.jpg|thumb|Boxing Day Hunt in Cowbridge]]\nThe present [[Cowbridge Town Hall]], a building whose foundations date back perhaps as far as the [[Elizabethan era]], served as a prison until 1830, when it was converted into a town hall to replace the former [[Guild Hall]], demolished at that date. The New Palladian Town Hall was built in 1830 by Isaiah Verity of Ash Hall who in gratitude was made a Freeman of Cowbridge. The money for the reconstruction was raised by public subscription.\n\nEight of the original prison cells are still intact, six of which house the exhibits of Cowbridge Museum.<ref>[http://www.cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/abtcouncil.html Cowbridge (Ancient Borough) with Llanblethian Town Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143320/http://cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/abtcouncil.html |date=2014-07-14 }}. Accessed 11 June 2013</ref> The remainder of the building is used by the town council and for public events. The museum holds archaeological finds from Cowbridge and district, as well as displays on the later history of the town, including industrial and domestic artefacts, a photographic collection, and a small historical costume collection.\n\nThe main street contains a number of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] houses, including the former town houses of important local families such as the Edmondes and Carnes. The Carnes' town house is known as Great House, a Grade 2* listed property of Medieval origin.\n\n===Modern times===\nCowbridge contains the following [[public house|inns]]: the Bear Hotel, the Horse and Groom, the Edmondes Arms, the Duke of Wellington and the Vale of Glamorgan. The latter is located at the premises of the former Vale of Glamorgan Brewery.\n\nClosely attached to the town of Cowbridge is the village of Aberthin. Aberthin contains two inns; The Hare and Hounds and The Farmers Arms.\n\nCowbridge once had a railway station, which opened in 1865 and closed in 1951.\n\nOn the 21 March 1950 a [[Bristol Freighter]] (Registration: G-AHJJ) on a test flight took off from [[Bristol Filton Airport]]. The aircraft crashed near Cowbridge after a structural failure of the fuselage. It caused the aircraft to enter spin and crash. The accident killed all four  passengers and crew on board.<ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19500321-0</ref>\n\nCowbridge was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=These towns have been named as the best places to live in Wales|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/towns-named-best-places-wales-12719747|publisher=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nA [[Cowbridge (electoral ward)|Cowbridge]] [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] exists for elections to the [[Vale of Glamorgan Council]]. This ward includes Cowbridge and Llanblethian but stretches south to Llanfair. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,180.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/cowbridge-w05000638#sthash.Ns7sQoDJ.dpbs|title=Ward population 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Schools==\n[[Cowbridge Comprehensive School]] has approximately 1500 pupils, and is one of the best performing [[secondary school]]s in Wales. It achieved 94% A*-C at GCSE in 2010. The school was located on three sites, with the Lower School in the south-west of the town and Middle School and [[Sixth Form]] in the north-east. Cowbridge Comprehensive School completed a major redevelopment in September 2010 to bring the entire school to one site (the former Middle School/Sixth Form site) using [[Welsh Assembly Government]] funding.<ref>[http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/our_council/council/minutes,_agendas__reports/reports/cabinet/2008/08-12-03/cowbridge_school.aspx Vale of Glamorgan Council]</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, the new school was officially opened to students. All approximately 1300 students can now be found on the one site instead of the three separate buildings that were all situated in different locations in Cowbridge. The former sixth form site on Aberthin Road is now derelict and awaiting redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pyke|first1=Chris|title=The grand derelict buildings currently for sale in Wales|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/commercial-property/grand-derelict-buildings-currently-sale-14508193|website=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\nY Bontfaen primary school in Borough Close has a roll of about 245 including the nursery Y Blodau Fach.\nYsgol Iolo Morganwg with Y Meithrin (\"the nursery\") is adjacent and is a Welsh speaking school.\n\n==Sport==\nCowbridge is home to [[Cowbridge RFC]] a [[Welsh Rugby Union]] affiliated [[rugby union]] team, which fields two senior, a youth and ladies team.\nCowbridge Cricket Club first played in 1840 and now has six senior and junior teams and is affiliated to the South Wales Cricket Association. Notable cricketers who have played for the club include former test players Hugh Morris, John Clay, [[Tony Lewis]], C F Walters and on one famous occasion [[Douglas Jardine]]. Among the many county cricketers produced by the club are the Glamorgan players Ben Wright and [[Alex Jones (cricketer)|Alex Jones]]. Glamorgan CCC played county fixtures at Cowbridge in the 1930s.\n\nCowbridge also has a leisure centre where can be found various clubs including, tennis, football and badminton. Behind Cowbridge Leisure Centre is Cowbridge Bowling Club and tennis courts.\n\nSeptember 2009 also saw the reintroduction of senior football to Cowbridge Town after a ten-year absence. Starting in the third tier of the Vale of Glamorgan Amateur Football League the team achieved great success in their first season back, achieving an unlikely cup-promotion double. The 2011-12 season saw the club gain their second promotion in three years to reach the premier division.\n\n==Cultural Activities==\nCowbridge is also home to the Cowbridge Amateur Dramatic Society (CADS), based at the Market Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Market Theatre|url=http://www.market-theatre.com/}}</ref> CADS was formed in 1947 and aims to stage three main productions each year. The Society also publishes a newsletter, ''\"The Thespian\"'', three or four times each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Market Theatre|url=http://www.market-theatre.com|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1997, when it 'outgrew' the Town Hall stage, Cowbridge was also home to the Cowbridge Amateur Operatic Society (CAOS).  Founded by a small group of enthusiasts, its first production was  \"The Pirates of Penzance\" in 1969.  CAOS continued its Gilbert and Sullivan theme until 1974, when the show of the year was \"Die Fledermaus\".  Still going strong, and having grown a youth wing (Total CAOS), CAOS is now based at Llantwit Major.\n\nSince 2004, the town has hosted the annual [[Cowbridge Food and Drink Festival]]. Currently, the festival takes place in late spring having originally taken place every October. The festival incorporates various food and drink exhibitors, food court and fringe festival. Many of the town's inns hold beer, ale and cider events.\n\nIn 2010 the Cowbridge Music Festival was founded which takes place every autumn in various venues throughout the town. The festival is made up of classical music, jazz and folk music and boasts an excellent outreach programme. In 2014 the acclaimed violinist [[Nicola Benedetti]] became the festival's patron.\n\nCowbridge History Society was created in 2013 out of a merger between the former Cowbridge & District Local History Society (founded in the 1970s) and Cowbridge Record Society, publishers of several books on the topics relating to the history of the town. It holds monthly meetings at the Town Hall throughout the winter and funds a Local History Studies Room (the \"Jeff Alden Room\") containing archival material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cowbridgehistorysociety.org/about-us.php|title=About Us|website=Cowbridge History Society|access-date=17 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n*[[Ieuan Evans]], former Wales rugby union player and rugby commentator\n*[[Anneka Rice]], television presenter\n*[[Stephen McPhail]], Irish international and current Cardiff City football player\n*[[Ernest William Jones]], cricketer for Glamorgan and Wales<ref name=\"James William Webb-Jones, Profile, Cricket Archive\"/>\n*[[Caryl Parry Jones]], singer and actress\n*[[James William Webb-Jones]], choral conductor<ref name=\"James William Webb-Jones, Profile, Cricket Archive\">{{cite web|title=James William Webb-Jones, Profile, Cricket Archive|url-access=subscription |url= https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1469/1469491/1469491.html}}</ref>\n*[[Nia Roberts (presenter)|Nia Roberts]], television and radio presenter\n\nNotable people who attended school in Cowbridge include:\n*[[Garfield Owen]] Welsh dual-code international rugby union, and rugby league footballer of the 1950s and 1960s\n*[[Patrick Hannan (presenter)|Patrick Hannan]], political journalist\n*Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]], Oscar-winning actor\n*[[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]], poet\n*[[Frances Hoggan]], First British woman to receive a doctorate in medicine from a university in Europe, and the first woman doctor to be registered in Wales.\n*[[Robin Hawkins]], lead singer and bassist of Welsh rock band 'The Automatic'.\n*[[James Frost]], singer and guitarist of The Automatic.\n*[[Iwan Griffiths]], drummer of The Automatic.\n*[[Nicky Piper]], former boxer\n*[[Rhian Wilkinson]], Olympic football player who represented Canada at the [[Football at the 2011 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]], [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|FIFA Women's World Cup]] and [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Twinning==\n\nCowbridge is twinned with [[Clisson]] in the [[Loire-Atlantique]] [[Departments of France|department]] in northwestern [[France]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Cowbridge Physic Garden]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\nC.
