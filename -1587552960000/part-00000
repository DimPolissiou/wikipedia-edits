The advent of totalitarianism marked the beginning of a new political era in the 20th century. This form of government is characterized by the presence of a single political party and more specifically, by a powerful leader (a real [[role model]]) who imposes his personal and political prominence. The two fundamental aspects that contribute to the maintenance of the power are: a steadfast collaboration between the government and the police force, and a highly developed ideology. Here, the government has \"total control of mass communications and social and economic organizations\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Neil|date=2010|title=Review: Totalitarianism, Social Science, and the Margins.|jstor=canajsocicahican.35.3.463|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology|volume= 35| issue =  3|pages= 463\u201369|doi=10.29173/cjs8876|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to [[Hannah Arendt]], totalitarianism is a new and extreme form of dictatorship composed of \"atomized, isolated individuals\".<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=661026|title=Dictators and dictatorships: understanding authoritarian regimes and their leaders|last=Ezrow|first=Natasha M|last2=Frantz|first2=Erica|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-1602-4|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}</ref> In addition, she affirmed that ideology plays a leading role in defining how the entire society should be organized. According to the political scientist [[Juan Linz]], the distinction between an authoritarian regime and a totalitarian one is that while an authoritarian regime seeks to suffocate politics and political mobilization, totalitarianism seeks to control politics and political mobilization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Totalitarian and authoritarian regimes|last=Linz|first=Juan J|date=2009|publisher=Rienner|isbn=978-1-55587-866-5|location=Boulder, CO|language=English|oclc = 985592359}}</ref>\n\nHowever, one of the most recent classification of dictatorships does not identify [[Totalitarianism]] as a form of dictatorship. In [[Barbara Geddes (academic)|Barbara Geddes]]'s study, she focused in how elite-leader and elite-mass relations influence [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics. Geddes typology identifies the key institutions that structure elite politics in dictatorships (i.e. parties and militaries). The study is based on, and directly related to, factors like: the simplicity of the categorizations, cross-national applicability, the emphasis on elites and leaders, and the incorporation of institutions (parties and militaries) as central to shaping politics. According to Barbara Geddes, a dictatorial government may be classified in five typologies: Military Dictatorships, Single-party Dictatorships, Personalist Dictatorships, [[Monarchy|Monarchies]], Hybrid Dictatorships.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Military dictatorships ===\n{{main|Military dictatorship}}\nMilitary dictatorships are regimes in which a group of officers holds power, determines who will lead the country, and exercises influence over policy. High-level [[elite]]s and a [[Leadership|leader]] are the members of the military dictatorship. Military dictatorships are characterized by rule by a professionalized military as an institution. In military regimes, elites are referred to as junta members; they are typically senior officers (and often other high-level officers) in the military.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friedrich|first=Carl|date=1950|title=Military Government and Dictatorship.|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume= 267|pages= 1\u20137|oclc=5723774494|doi=10.1177/000271625026700102}}</ref>\n\n=== Single-party dictatorships ===\n{{Main|One-party state}}\nSingle-party dictatorships are regimes in which one party dominates politics. In single-party dictatorships, a single party has access to political posts and control over policy. In single-party dictatorships, party elites are typically members of the ruling body of the party, sometimes called the [[central committee]], [[politburo]], or [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]]. These groups of individuals controls the selection of party officials and \"organizes the distribution of benefits to supporters and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders\".<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Personalist dictatorships ===\nPersonalist dictatorships are regimes in which all power lies in the hands of a single individual. Personalist dictatorships differ from other forms of dictatorships in their access to key political positions, other fruits of office, and depend much more on the discretion of the personalist dictator.

These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into \"stationary bandits\". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, they will be able to make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater taxable base. Thus a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits. This is the rationality that bandits use in order to justify their transformation from \"roving bandits\" into \"stationary bandits\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Absolute monarchy]]\n* [[Autocracy]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Military dictatorship#Civil-military dictatorship|Civil-military dictatorship]]\n* [[Constitutional dictatorship]]\n* [[Stalinism]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Juche]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]\n* [[Elective dictatorship]]\n* [[Family dictatorship]]\n* ''[[How Democracies Die]]''\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Generalissimo]]\n* [[List of titles used by dictators]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)|Maximum Leader]]\n* [[Mobutism]]\n* [[Nazism]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* [[People's democratic dictatorship]]\n* [[Right-wing dictatorship]]\n* [[Selectorate theory]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)|Strongman]]\n* [[Supreme leader]]\n* [[Theocracy]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://docupedia.de/zg/Behrends_dictatorship_v2_en_2017 Behrends, Jan C.

This form of government is characterized by the presence of a single political party and more specifically, by a powerful leader (a real [[role model]]) who imposes his personal and political prominence. The two fundamental aspects that contribute to the maintenance of the power are: a steadfast collaboration between the government and the police force, and a highly developed ideology.

The study is based on, and directly related to, factors like: the simplicity of the categorizations, cross-national applicability, the emphasis on elites and leaders, and the incorporation of institutions (parties and militaries) as central to shaping politics.

These groups of individuals controls the selection of party officials and \"organizes the distribution of benefits to supporters and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders\".<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Personalist dictatorships ===\nPersonalist dictatorships are regimes in which all power lies in the hands of a single individual. Personalist dictatorships differ from other forms of dictatorships in their access to key political positions, other fruits of office, and depend much more on the discretion of the personalist dictator. Personalist dictators may be members of the military or leaders of a political party. Yet, neither the military nor the party exercises power independent from the dictator. In personalist dictatorships, the elite corps is usually made up of close friends or family members of the dictator. These individuals are all typically handpicked to serve their posts by the dictator.<ref name=\":02\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Peceny|first=Mark|date=2003|title=Peaceful Parties and Puzzling Personalists.|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume= 97| issue =  2|pages= 339\u201342|oclc=208155326|doi=10.1017/s0003055403000716}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, personalist dictatorships are more repressive than other forms of dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frantz|first=Erica|last2=Kendall-Taylor|first2=Andrea|last3=Wright|first3=Joseph|last4=Xu|first4=Xu|date=2019-08-27|title=Personalization of Power and Repression in Dictatorships|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706049|journal=The Journal of Politics|pages=000\u2013000|doi=10.1086/706049|issn=0022-3816}}</ref>\n\n=== Monarchic dictatorships ===\n{{main|Absolute monarchy}}\n[[File:Salman of Saudi Arabia (2017-10-05) 2.jpg|thumb|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>\"[http://www.dawn.com/news/1159990 Call them \u2018Dictators\u2019, not \u2018Kings\u2019]\".

Roman dictators were allocated absolute power during times of emergency. In execution, their power was originally neither arbitrary nor unaccountable, being subject to law and requiring retrospective justification. There were no such dictatorships after the beginning of the 2nd century BC and later dictators such as [[Sulla]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s exercised power much more personally and arbitrarily. As the Roman Emperor was a [[king]] in all but name, a concept that remained anathema to traditional Roman society, the institution was not carried forward into the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n=== 19th-century Latin American caudillos ===\n{{main|Caudillo}}\n[[File:Santaanna1.JPG|170px|thumb|right|[[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] wearing [[Mexico|Mexican]] military uniform]]\nAfter the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, various dictators came to power in many liberated countries. Often leading a private army, these ''[[caudillo]]s'' or self-appointed political-military leaders, attacked weak national [[government]]s once they controlled a region's political and economic powers, with examples such as [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in Mexico and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Argentina. Such dictators have been also referred to as \"[[personalismo]]s\".\n\nThe wave of [[military dictatorship]]s in South America in the second half of the twentieth century left a particular mark on [[Latin American culture]]. In [[Latin American literature]], the [[dictator novel]] challenging dictatorship and ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' is a significant genre. There are also many [[films depicting Latin American military dictatorships]].\n\n=== Communism and Fascism in 20th-century dictatorships ===\nIn the first half of the 20th century, [[Communism|Communist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]] dictatorships appeared in a variety of scientifically and technologically advanced countries, which are distinct from dictatorships in Latin America and post-colonial dictatorships in Africa and Asia. Leading examples of modern totalitarian dictatorship include:\n* [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], [[Hideki Tojo]]'s [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922-1943)|Italy]], [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], and [[Ion Antonescu]]'s [[Romania]].\n\n* [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Xi Jinping]]'s [[People's Republic of China]], [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]'s North Korea, [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Vietnam]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]]'s [[Romania]], the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]],  and other Communist dictatorships that appeared after [[World War II]] in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, Latin America, Africa and other countries.\n\n===Dictatorships in Africa and Asia after World War II===\n[[File:Prins Bernhard in Zaire (voorheen Belgisch Congo), Bernhard en Mobutu, Bestanddeelnr 926-6037.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator]]\nAfter World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers. These constitutions often failed to work without a strong middle class or work against the preexisting autocratic rule. Some elected presidents and prime ministers captured power by suppressing the opposition and installing one-party rule and others established military dictatorships through their armies.

These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into \"stationary bandits\". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, they will be able to make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater taxable base. Thus a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits. This is the rationality that bandits use in order to justify their transformation from \"roving bandits\" into \"stationary bandits\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Absolute monarchy]]\n* [[Autocracy]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Military dictatorship#Civil-military dictatorship|Civil-military dictatorship]]\n* [[Constitutional dictatorship]]\n* [[Stalinism]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Juche]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]\n* [[Elective dictatorship]]\n* [[Family dictatorship]]\n* ''[[How Democracies Die]]''\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Generalissimo]]\n* [[List of titles used by dictators]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)|Maximum Leader]]\n* [[Mobutism]]\n* [[Nazism]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* [[People's democratic dictatorship]]\n* [[Right-wing dictatorship]]\n* [[Selectorate theory]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)|Strongman]]\n* [[Supreme leader]]\n* [[Theocracy]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://docupedia.de/zg/Behrends_dictatorship_v2_en_2017 Behrends, Jan C.

{"title_page": "Yogesh Jaluria", "text_new": "Professor '''Yogesh Jaluria''' is Board of Governors Professor and Distinguished Professor at [[Rutgers University|Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey]], in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. He is a specialist in thermal sciences and engineering [1].\n\n== Biography ==\nJaluria was born in India, where he received his B.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 1970 from the   [[Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi]], standing first in his graduating class. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from [[Cornell University]] in 1972 and 1974, respectively.\n\nHe was a member of the research staff at [[Bell Labs]], Princeton, from 1974 to 1976. He then returned to India to take an academic position at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India (1976\u201380), before returning to the US,  and joining Rutgers University. At Rutgers, Professor Jaluria served as Chairman of his department from 2005-2011, and as Interim Dean of Engineering during 2008-2009.  He was made a distinguished professor in 1991 and was appointed as Board of Governors Professor in 2001 [2].\n\n== Professional work ==\nJaluria is known for his work on [[natural convection]], or buoyancy-driven flows. He wrote the first book on this topic and was a co-author of a later extensive treatise on the subject [3, 4]. Both of these books were translated into [[Russian language|Russian]], with extensive circulation in Eastern Europe.  He has worked in the areas of  computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and heat transfer, materials processing, such as [[optical fiber]] drawing [5], chemical vapor deposition and polymer extrusion [6], optimization of thermal systems [7], cooling of electronic systems, solar energy, and building fires [8]. His most significant specific work includes the determination of feasible and optimal conditions in thermal processing, innovative methods for cooling electronic systems, growth and spread of building fires, basic understanding of transition to turbulence and effects of stratification and conjugate transport, multiscale modeling and quantification of mixing processes in extrusion.  He has contributed over 500 articles, including over 210 in peer-reviewed archival journal articles, authored or co-authored 9 books, and edited or co-edited 10 books. All these books have had a major impact on the field due to innovative and pioneering approaches in research, engineering and education presented by them.\n\n== Honors  ==\nJaluria has received the Max Jakob Memorial Award [9], the highest honor in this field, from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), as well as the Freeman Scholar Award [10], Worcester Reed Warner Medal [11] and the Heat Transfer Memorial Award [12] from ASME; the Society made him an honorary member in 2012 [13]. He received the Donald Q. Kern Award from the AIChE, and the Luikov Medal from the International Center for Heat and Mass Transfer. He gave the ASME Richard Henry Thurston Award Lecture \"Buoyancy-Induced Flows in Nature and Technology\" in 2003 [14]. He is also a Fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \n\nHe received the Distinguished Alumni Award from IIT, Delhi, India, in 1994, and the Daniel Gorenstein Memorial Award from Rutgers in 2010. \n\nHe was the Editor of ASME Journal of Heat Transfer from 2005 to 2010 [15, 16]. During that time, he was instrumental in founding a new archival ASME journal, Journal of Thermal Science and Engineering Applications. He is presently the President of the American Society of Thermal and Fluids Engineers, an international non-profit organization focused on research and engineering in these and related fields, with particular emphasis on industry, international collaboration and emerging young researchers [17]. \n\n== Personal Life  ==\nProfessor Jaluria and his wife, Anuradha, are long time residents of New Jersey.  They currently reside in [[Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey]], having previously lived in [[East Brunswick, New Jersey]].

The game was first announced with the codename ''Project A'' in October 2019. It is set to be released for [[Microsoft Windows]]  in the summer of 2020, with a [[closed beta]] that launched on April 7, 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Valorant'' is a team-based [[tactical shooter]] and [[first-person shooter]]  set in the near-future.<ref name=\"Goslin 2020a\" /><ref name=\"Goslin 2020b\" /><ref name=\"Goslin 2020c\" /><ref name=\"First Announced 1\" /> Players assume the control of agents, characters who come from a plethora of countries and cultures around the world.<ref name=\"First Announced 1\" /> In the main game mode, players join either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities and use an economic system to purchase their abilities and weapons. The game has an assortment of weapons including  [[Sidearm (weapon)|sidearms]], [[submachine guns]], [[shotguns]], [[machine guns]], [[assault rifles]], [[sniper rifles]].<ref name=\"Geddes 2020\" /><ref name=\"Toms 2020\" /> Each weapon has a [[Recoil|recoil pattern]] which has to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately.<ref name=\"Geddes 2020\" /><ref name=\"Toms 2020\" /> The attacking team has a bomb, called the Spike, that they need to plant on a site. If the attacking team successfully protects the Spike and it detonates, they get a point. If the defending team successfully defuses the Spike, or the 100-second round timer expires, the defending team gets a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated, the opposing team earns a point. After twelve rounds, the attacking team switches to the defending team and vice versa. The first team to win the best of 24 rounds wins the match.<ref name=\"Goslin 2020b\" /><ref name=\"Shea 2020\" /><ref name=\"First Announced 1\" />\n\nThere are currently ten known agents in ''Valorant''.
