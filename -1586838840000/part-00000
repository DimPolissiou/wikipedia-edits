They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the [[Great Basin]]. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt, destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.\n\nThe [[Truckee River]] is Reno's primary source of drinking water. It supplies Reno with {{convert|80|e6U.S.gal|lk=out}} of water a day during the summer, and {{convert|40|e6U.S.gal}} of water per day in the winter. Before the water goes to the homes around the Reno area, it must go to one of two [[water treatment]] plants, Chalk Bluff or Glendale Water Treatment Plant. To help save water, golf courses in Reno have been using treated effluent water rather than treated water from one of Reno's water plants.\n\nThe Reno-Sparks [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plant discharges tertiary treated effluent to the Truckee River. In the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30&nbsp;million U.S. gallons (70 to 110&nbsp;million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], aggravating water quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. Local agencies working with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have developed several watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded discharge. To accomplish this successful outcome, the [[DSSAM Model]] was developed and calibrated for the Truckee River to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set.<ref>C. Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. 1987. ''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C.</ref>  The resulting management strategies included measures such as [[land use]] controls in the Lake Tahoe basin, urban [[surface runoff|runoff]] controls in Reno and Sparks, and [[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] for wastewater discharge.\n[[File:Steamboat Springs Nevada.jpg|thumb|Reno Nevada and the [[Truckee Meadows]] south west of the Reno Tahoe International Airport has a large herd of [[Mustang]] horses.

The city has 300 days of sunshine per year. Summer thunderstorms can occur between April and October. The eastern side of town and the mountains east of Reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often, and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind, called a \"[[Washoe Zephyr]]\", can develop in the Sierra Nevada, causing air to be pulled down in the Sierra Nevada and Reno, destroying or preventing thunderstorms, but the same wind can push air upward against the Virginia Range and other mountain ranges east of Reno, creating powerful thunderstorms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reno, NV|url=http://www.visitrenotahoe.com/destination/reno|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106184552/http://www.visitrenotahoe.com/destination/reno|url-status=live|archive-date=January 6, 2009|publisher=Reno Tahoe Visitors website|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Brian O'Hara|author2=Gary Barbato|author3=John James|author4=Heather Angeloff|author5=Tom Cylke|title=Weather and Climate of the Reno-Carson City-Lake Tahoe Region|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BWgg69xcGsC&pg=PA71|year=2007|publisher=NV Bureau of Mines & Geology|isbn=978-1-888035-11-7|page=71}}</ref>\n\nThe monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|35.3|\u00b0F|1}} in December to {{convert|74.9|\u00b0F|1}} in July, with the [[diurnal temperature variation]] reaching {{convert|40|F-change}} in summer, still lower than much of the high desert to the east.

Older casinos were torn down ([[Mapes Hotel]], [[Fitzgeralds Gaming|Fitzgerald's Nevada Club]], Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, [[Harold's Club]], Palace Club), or smaller casinos like the [[Comstock Hotel & Casino|Comstock]], Sundowner, [[The Montage Reno|Golden Phoenix]], Kings Inn, Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were either closed or were converted into condos.\n\nBecause of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and Sacramento, while [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] has historically served more tourists from [[Southern California]] and the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] area.\n\nSeveral local large hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the downtown core. These larger hotel casinos are the [[Atlantis Casino Resort|Atlantis]], the [[Peppermill Reno|Peppermill]] and the [[Grand Sierra Resort]]. The Peppermill was chosen as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by ''Casino Player'' and ''Nevada'' magazines. In 2005, the Peppermill Reno began a $300&nbsp;million [[Tuscany|Tuscan]]-themed expansion.\n\nReno holds several events throughout the year to draw tourists to the area.

The [[city council]] is the core of the government, with seven members. Five of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the [[primary election|primary]] by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the citywide election. The other two council members are the at-large member, who represents the entire city, and the mayor, who is elected by the people of the city. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.\n\nThere is an elected [[city attorney]] who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court, and prosecutes misdemeanors.\n\nThe city's charter calls for a [[council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government, meaning the council appoints only two positions, the [[city manager]], who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the [[city clerk]]. The city manager is in charge of the budget and workforce for all city programs. The city clerk, who records the proceedings of the council, makes appointments for the council, and makes sure efficient copying and printing services are available.\n\nIn 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should explore the idea of becoming one combined governmental body.<ref>{{cite news |title=Combining local governments is questioned on ballot issue |first=Susan |last=Voyles |date=October 24, 2010 |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |page=10A}}</ref> Fifty-four&nbsp;percent of voters approved of the ballot measure to make an inquiry into consolidating the governments.<ref>{{cite news |title=Election Results: Nevada |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/nevada }}</ref>\n\n===Fire department===\nThe city of Reno is protected by the [[Reno Fire Department]] (RFD) manning 14 fire stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=189 |title=City of Reno : Fire Department |publisher=Reno.gov |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118012232/https://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=189 |archivedate=January 18, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=253 |title=City of Reno : Administration |publisher=Reno.gov |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119161713/http://reno.gov/index.aspx?page=253 |archivedate=January 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe Reno Fire Department (RFD) provides all-risk emergency service to the City of Reno residents.

This is the highest level of emergency medical care available in the field.\n\nIn addition to responding to fires, whether they occur in structures, vegetation/brush or vehicles, the fire department also provides rescue capabilities for almost any type of emergency situation.\n\nThis includes quick and efficient emergency medical care for the citizens; a hazardous materials team capable of identifying unknown materials and controlling a release disaster; and preparedness and management of large-scale incidents.\n\nMaintaining this level of service requires nearly constant training of personnel. This training maintains both the skills needed to operate safely in emergency environments and the physical fitness necessary to reduce the likelihood and severity of injuries.\n\nThe minimum annual-training requirement to maintain firefighting and medical skills is 240 hours per year.

They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the [[Great Basin]]. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt, destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.\n\nThe [[Truckee River]] is Reno's primary source of drinking water. It supplies Reno with {{convert|80|e6U.S.gal|lk=out}} of water a day during the summer, and {{convert|40|e6U.S.gal}} of water per day in the winter. Before the water goes to the homes around the Reno area, it must go to one of two [[water treatment]] plants, Chalk Bluff or Glendale Water Treatment Plant. To help save water, golf courses in Reno have been using treated effluent water rather than treated water from one of Reno's water plants.\n\nThe Reno-Sparks [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plant discharges tertiary treated effluent to the Truckee River. In the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30&nbsp;million U.S. gallons (70 to 110&nbsp;million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], aggravating water quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. Local agencies working with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have developed several watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded discharge. To accomplish this successful outcome, the [[DSSAM Model]] was developed and calibrated for the Truckee River to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set.<ref>C.

Older casinos were torn down ([[Mapes Hotel]], [[Fitzgeralds Gaming|Fitzgerald's Nevada Club]], Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, [[Harold's Club]], Palace Club), or smaller casinos like the [[Comstock Hotel & Casino|Comstock]], Sundowner, [[The Montage Reno|Golden Phoenix]], Kings Inn, Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were either closed or were converted into condos.\n\nBecause of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and Sacramento, while [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] has historically served more tourists from [[Southern California]] and the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] area.\n\nSeveral local large hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the downtown core. These larger hotel casinos are the [[Atlantis Casino Resort|Atlantis]], the [[Peppermill Reno|Peppermill]] and the [[Grand Sierra Resort]]. The Peppermill was chosen as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by ''Casino Player'' and ''Nevada'' magazines.

The [[city council]] is the core of the government, with seven members. Five of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the [[primary election|primary]] by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the citywide election. The other two council members are the at-large member, who represents the entire city, and the mayor, who is elected by the people of the city. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.\n\nThere is an elected [[city attorney]] who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court, and prosecutes misdemeanors.\n\nThe city's charter calls for a [[council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government, meaning the council appoints only two positions, the [[city manager]], who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the [[city clerk]].

This training maintains both the skills needed to operate safely in emergency environments and the physical fitness necessary to reduce the likelihood and severity of injuries.\n\nThe minimum annual-training requirement to maintain firefighting and medical skills is 240 hours per year.

The episode is the first episode of a two-part story, the second part being \"[[The Zygon Inversion]]\" on 7 November.\n\nIn the episode, a peace treaty agreed between humans and shapeshifting aliens called [[Zygon]]s in the 50th anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" has started to fail.

In London, the splinter group, which seeks to be themselves no matter what, kidnaps and kills Zygon High Command, leaving a Zygon called Bonnie in charge. In Turmezistan, Osgood is forced to read a video message declaring the splinter group's intent to go to war. At the block of flats where [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] lives, Clara is knocked unconscious and hidden in a pod underground. Bonnie takes Clara's place.\n\nThe Doctor travels to Turmezistan via the aeroplane afforded him by being [[President of Earth]] to rescue Osgood.

The sheriff reveals herself as a Zygon, and prepares to kill Kate. In London, Bonnie tricks UNIT scientist Jac into going to Clara's block with UNIT troops, where a lift takes them to a series of underground tunnels, which lifts across the city are connected to. When one pod is revealed to contain Clara, Jac realises that Clara was switched with a Zygon. Jac and the troops are killed by the splinter group when they attempt to escape.

She fires the missile at the plane.\n\n===Continuity===\nEvents from the [[Fourth Doctor]] serial ''[[Terror of the Zygons]]'' (1975) are brought up in the episode.

The play is a farce whose plot is based on the introduction of an awkward, boorish, but honest American, Asa Trenchard, to his aristocratic English relatives when he goes to England to claim the family estate. The play premiered with great success at [[Olympic Theatre, New York|Laura Keene's Theatre]] in New York City in 1858, with Keene in the cast, the title character played by [[Joseph Jefferson]] and [[Edward Askew Sothern]], playing [[Lord Dundreary]], who eventually parlayed this supporting role into a leading one. The play's long-running 1861 London production was another decided hit\n\nAlthough the play achieved great renown during its first few years and remained very popular throughout the second half of the 19th century, it is best remembered as the play [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was attending in [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., when he was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated]] by actor and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]] on April 14, 1865.\n\n==Theatrical acclaim and \"Lord Dundreary\"==\n[[File:The autobiography of Joseph Jefferson (1890) (14758819816).jpg|thumb|Edward Sothern as Lord Dundreary, sporting \"Dundrearies\"]]\nAmong ''Our American Cousin'''s cast was British actor [[Edward Askew Sothern]], playing [[Lord Dundreary]], a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. Sothern had already achieved fame on the New York stage in the play ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|Camille]]'' in 1856, and had been reluctant to take on the role because he felt that it was too small and unimportant. He mentioned his qualms to his friend [[Joseph Jefferson]], who had been cast in the lead role, and Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: \"There are no small parts, only small actors.\"<ref>Havard, Bernard (2008), ''Walnut Street Theatre'', Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, p. 40, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-5770-0}}.</ref>\n\n''Our American Cousin'' premiered in New York on October 15, 1858. After several weeks of performances, Sothern began portraying the role more broadly, as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to nonsensical references to sayings of his \"bwother\" Sam.<ref>Pemberton, T. Edgar (1890), [https://archive.org/details/amemoiredwardas01pembgoog <!-- quote=Edward Askew Sothern. --> ''A Memoir of Edward Askew Sothern''], London: Richard Bentley and Son, p. 319.</ref> His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and mockery in both the United States and England. Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time.<ref name=dnb>Holder, Heidi J.

And the character's style of beard \u2013 long, bushy [[sideburns]] \u2013 gave the English language the word \"[[wikt:dundrearies|dundrearies]]\". In his autobiography, writer [[George Robert Sims]] recalled that \"we went Dundreary mad in '61.

Florence Trenchard, an aristocratic young beauty, loves [[Lieutenant]] Harry Vernon of the [[Royal Navy]], but she is unable to marry him until he progresses to a higher rank. She receives a letter from her brother Ned, who is currently in the United States. Ned has met some rustic cousins from a branch of the family that had immigrated to America two centuries earlier. They relay to Ned that great-uncle Mark Trenchard had, after angrily disinheriting his children and leaving England years ago, found these cousins in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]]. He had moved in with them and eventually made Asa, one of the sons, heir to his property in England. Asa is now sailing to England to claim the estate.\n\nAsa is noisy, coarse, and vulgar, but honestly forthright and colourful. The English Trenchards are alternately amused and appalled by this Vermont cousin. Richard Coyle, agent of the estate, meets with Sir Edward Trenchard (Florence's father) and tells the baronet that the family faces bankruptcy unless they can repay a debt to Coyle. Coyle is concealing the evidence that the loan had been repaid long ago by Sir Edward's late father. Coyle suggests that the loan would be satisfied if he may marry Florence, who detests him. Meanwhile, Asa and the butler, Binny, try to understand each other's unfamiliar ways, as Asa tries to understand what the purpose of a shower might be, dousing himself while fully clothed.\n\n===Act II===\nMrs. Mountchessington is staying at Trenchard Manor. She advises Augusta, her daughter, to be attentive to the presumably wealthy Vermont \"savage\". Meanwhile, her other daughter Georgina is courting an imbecilic nobleman named Dundreary by pretending to be ill. Florence's old tutor, the unhappy alcoholic Abel Murcott, warns her that Coyle intends to marry her. Asa overhears this and offers Florence his help. Murcott is Coyle's clerk and has found proof that Florence's late grandfather paid off the loan to Coyle.\n\nFlorence and Asa visit her cousin, Mary Meredith. Mary is the granddaughter of old Mark Trenchard, who left his estate to Asa. Mary is very poor and has been raised as a humble dairy maid. Asa does not care about her social status and is attracted to her. Florence has not been able to bring herself to tell Mary that her grandfather's fortune had been left to Asa. Florence tells Asa that she loves Harry, who needs a good assignment to a ship. Asa uses his country wile to persuade Dundreary to help Harry get a ship. Meanwhile, Coyle has been up to no good, and the bailiffs arrive at Trenchard Manor.\n\n===Act III===\nAt her dairy, Asa tells Mary about her grandfather in America, but he fibs about the end of the tale: He says that old Mark Trenchard changed his mind about disinheriting his English children and burned his will. Asa promptly burns the will himself. Florence discovers this and points it out to Mary, saying: \"It means that he is a true hero, and he loves you, you little rogue.\" Meanwhile, Mrs. Mountchessington still hopes that Asa will propose to Augusta. When Asa tells them that Mark Trenchard had left Mary his fortune, Augusta and Mrs. Mountchessington are quite rude, but Asa stands up for himself.\n\nAsa proposes to Mary and is happily accepted. He then sneaks into Coyle's office with Murcott and retrieves the paper that shows that the debt was paid. Asa confronts Coyle and insists that Coyle must pay off Sir Edward's other debts, with his doubtless ill-gotten gains, and also apologize to Florence for trying to force her into marriage. He also demands Coyle's resignation as the steward of Trenchard Manor, making Murcott steward instead. Murcott is so pleased that he vows to stop drinking. Coyle has no choice but to do all this. Florence marries Harry, Dundreary marries Georgina, and Augusta marries an old beau. Even the servants marry.\n\n==Lincoln assassination==\n[[File:American Cousin Evening Star Apr 14 1865.png|thumb|Advertisement for ''Our American Cousin'' (Washington ''[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]]'', April 14, 1865)]]\n{{main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}\n\nThe play's most famous performance was at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on April 14, 1865.

The play is a farce whose plot is based on the introduction of an awkward, boorish, but honest American, Asa Trenchard, to his aristocratic English relatives when he goes to England to claim the family estate. The play premiered with great success at [[Olympic Theatre, New York|Laura Keene's Theatre]] in New York City in 1858, with Keene in the cast, the title character played by [[Joseph Jefferson]] and [[Edward Askew Sothern]], playing [[Lord Dundreary]], who eventually parlayed this supporting role into a leading one. The play's long-running 1861 London production was another decided hit\n\nAlthough the play achieved great renown during its first few years and remained very popular throughout the second half of the 19th century, it is best remembered as the play [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was attending in [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., when he was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated]] by actor and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]] on April 14, 1865.\n\n==Theatrical acclaim and \"Lord Dundreary\"==\n[[File:The autobiography of Joseph Jefferson (1890) (14758819816).jpg|thumb|Edward Sothern as Lord Dundreary, sporting \"Dundrearies\"]]\nAmong ''Our American Cousin'''s cast was British actor [[Edward Askew Sothern]], playing [[Lord Dundreary]], a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. Sothern had already achieved fame on the New York stage in the play ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|Camille]]'' in 1856, and had been reluctant to take on the role because he felt that it was too small and unimportant. He mentioned his qualms to his friend [[Joseph Jefferson]], who had been cast in the lead role, and Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: \"There are no small parts, only small actors.\"<ref>Havard, Bernard (2008), ''Walnut Street Theatre'', Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, p. 40, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-5770-0}}.</ref>\n\n''Our American Cousin'' premiered in New York on October 15, 1858. After several weeks of performances, Sothern began portraying the role more broadly, as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to nonsensical references to sayings of his \"bwother\" Sam.<ref>Pemberton, T. Edgar (1890), [https://archive.org/details/amemoiredwardas01pembgoog <!-- quote=Edward Askew Sothern. --> ''A Memoir of Edward Askew Sothern''], London: Richard Bentley and Son, p. 319.</ref> His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and mockery in both the United States and England. Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time.<ref name=dnb>Holder, Heidi J.

In his autobiography, writer [[George Robert Sims]] recalled that \"we went Dundreary mad in '61.

Center staff arrange, describe, preserve, and make collections accessible in support of scholarship, exhibitions, publications, and education.\n\nThe Archives Center occupies over {{convert|12000|ft|m}} of shelving in the National Museum of American History building. Subject strengths include the history of radio, television, the telegraph, computing, and other aspects of the history of technology with a special interest in the history of invention; advertising, marketing, and entrepreneurship; commercial visual ephemera (post cards, greeting cards); American music (sheet music, jazz) and musical instruments. These, and a wide range of other subjects, are documented in business records, personal papers, and extensive holdings of motion picture film, video and sound recordings, historical photographs, and oral histories.\n\n===Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation===\nThe Lemelson Center, an initiative of the [[Lemelson Foundation]], produces educational programs, popular and academic publications, exhibitions, podcasts and symposia about invention. The mission of the Lemelson Center is to document, interpret and disseminate information about invention and innovation, encourage creativity in young people, and foster an appreciation for the central role of innovation in the history of the [[United States]]. The Center frequently provides a multi-year focus on some aspect of how invention has influenced American society, such as its 2002 \"'Invention and the Environment\" theme. Programs include an annual symposium, presentations and guest speakers, and often the publication of a book highlighting a particular topic.\n\nThe Center provides free curricular material to classrooms throughout the [[United States]], organizes traveling museum exhibitions (such as ''Invention at Play''), and provides research opportunities. It obtains archival collections related to invention for the museum's Archives Center. Such collections consist of the papers and materials that document the work of past and current American inventors.\n\n==Directors==\nThe following individuals have served as the director of the NMAH. The museum was initially created on July 1, 1957 as the National Museum of American History within the United States National Museum; it became the National Museum of History and Technology in 1969 and the National Museum of American History in 1980.<ref name=\"SNAC\">[http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w64g7qc5 National Museum of American History (U.S.).

The newly conserved flag, the centerpiece of the renovated museum, is displayed in a climate-controlled room at the heart of the museum. An interactive display by [[Potion Design]], just across the room from the flag, features a full-size, digital reproduction of the flag that allows patrons to learn more about it by touching different areas on the flag.\n\nThe ''[[George Washington (Greenough)|George Washington]]'' statue, sculpted by [[Horatio Greenough]] for exhibit in the [[Capitol Rotunda|Rotunda of the United States Capitol]] and in celebration of the centennial of Washington's birth, is the signature artifact for 2 West, the west wing of the second floor of the museum.\n\nThe second floor also houses the museum's new welcome center and a store.

Center staff arrange, describe, preserve, and make collections accessible in support of scholarship, exhibitions, publications, and education.\n\nThe Archives Center occupies over {{convert|12000|ft|m}} of shelving in the National Museum of American History building. Subject strengths include the history of radio, television, the telegraph, computing, and other aspects of the history of technology with a special interest in the history of invention; advertising, marketing, and entrepreneurship; commercial visual ephemera (post cards, greeting cards); American music (sheet music, jazz) and musical instruments. These, and a wide range of other subjects, are documented in business records, personal papers, and extensive holdings of motion picture film, video and sound recordings, historical photographs, and oral histories.\n\n===Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation===\nThe Lemelson Center, an initiative of the [[Lemelson Foundation]], produces educational programs, popular and academic publications, exhibitions, podcasts and symposia about invention. The mission of the Lemelson Center is to document, interpret and disseminate information about invention and innovation, encourage creativity in young people, and foster an appreciation for the central role of innovation in the history of the [[United States]]. The Center frequently provides a multi-year focus on some aspect of how invention has influenced American society, such as its 2002 \"'Invention and the Environment\" theme. Programs include an annual symposium, presentations and guest speakers, and often the publication of a book highlighting a particular topic.\n\nThe Center provides free curricular material to classrooms throughout the [[United States]], organizes traveling museum exhibitions (such as ''Invention at Play''), and provides research opportunities. It obtains archival collections related to invention for the museum's Archives Center. Such collections consist of the papers and materials that document the work of past and current American inventors.\n\n==Directors==\nThe following individuals have served as the director of the NMAH. The museum was initially created on July 1, 1957 as the National Museum of American History within the United States National Museum; it became the National Museum of History and Technology in 1969 and the National Museum of American History in 1980.<ref name=\"SNAC\">[http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w64g7qc5 National Museum of American History (U.S.).
