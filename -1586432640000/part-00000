An elite [[mercenary]] and [[Assassination|assassin]], she is sought by the [[bounty hunter]]s \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" and [[List of The Mandalorian characters|Toro Calican]] in \"[[Chapter 5: The Gunslinger]]\".\n\nPortrayed by actress [[Ming-Na Wen]], Fennec Shand is the first major ''Star Wars'' villain character portrayed by an Asian actress. Elements of the character's personality were inspired by the [[fennec fox]], including its trickiness, stealthiness, maneuverability, and ability to survive. The fox also influenced the design of Fennec's costume and hairstyle. Costume designer Joseph Porro incorporated orange accents into Fennec's black costume, and Wen recommended the character's hair include braids inspired by the fennec fox.\n\nFennec Shand has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike, and has been described as a fan favorite. Several reviewers felt the character was eliminated too quickly and did not get the chance to live up to her potential. Some critics have speculated the character could still be alive.\n\n==Appearances==\nIn ''[[The Mandalorian]]'', Fennec Shand is presented as an elite [[mercenary]] and [[Assassination|assassin]] who developed a significant reputation committing murders for the galaxy's top crime syndicates,<ref name=\"Gemmill1206\">{{cite news |last=Gemmill |first=Allie |title=Is Fennec Shand really dead?

Over a number of years however, an increasing proportion of countries' telecommunications administrations{{Snd}} together with their government and military users{{Snd}} have permitted Amateur Radio operation in the 5&nbsp;MHz area on a short or longer term basis, ranging from discrete channels to a frequency band allocation.\n\nAt the closing meeting of the 2015 [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC-15) on 27 November 2015, amongst the Final Acts signed into the International Radio Regulations was one approving \"A Worldwide Frequency Allocation of 5351.5&ndash;5366.5&nbsp;kHz to the Amateur Service on a secondary basis\".<ref name=\"ARRL-WRC15_Approves_Band\">{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/world-radiocommunication-conference-approves-global-60-meter-allocation |title=World Radiocommunication Conference Approves Global 60 Meter Allocation! |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaru-r1.org/index.php/3-news/newsflash/1492-new-band-at-5-mhz |title=New Band at 5&nbsp;MHz |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[International Amateur Radio Union]] Region 1 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref> The ITU's enhanced band allocation limits most amateurs to 15&nbsp;watts [[effective isotropic radiated power]] (EIRP), with some countries allowed up to 25&nbsp;W EIRP.<ref name=\"ARRL-WRC15_Approves_Band\"/><ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\"/>  The ITU allocation came into effect January 1, 2017,<ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\"/> after which each country's national administration must formally revise their rules to permit amateur operation.\n\nPrior to WRC-15, all 5&nbsp;MHz Amateur allocations made by individual administrations were in accordance with [http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/frr.htm Article 4.4] of the ITU Radio Regulations, which requires non-interference with other radio services. Where two-way amateur radio communication is authorized on 60&nbsp;m, it has generally been within the frequency range 5250&ndash;5450&nbsp;kHz, but the whole of this range is not necessarily available and allocations vary significantly from country-to-country. This has been particularly true in latter years since the award at WRC-12 of the range 5250&ndash;5275&nbsp;kHz to the Radiolocation Service, thus effectively reducing the former frequency range down to 5275&ndash;5450&nbsp;kHz.\n\nIn some countries the allocation is still channelized at present, whereas others have block or band allocations or a mixture. Voice operation is generally in [[single sideband|upper sideband]] (USB) mode to facilitate inter-communication by non-amateur service users if necessary. In the [[United States]] and its Dependencies, channelized USB is mandatory. Where channelization is used, the USB suppressed carrier frequency (a.k.a. 'dial' frequency) is normally 1.5&nbsp;kHz below the quoted channel frequency. For example, 5403.5&nbsp;kHz is the 'dial' frequency for the channel centered on 5405&nbsp;kHz.  The \"center\" of the channel is based on the assumption that the bandwidth of SSB transmissions are 3&nbsp;kHz, at most.  Transmitters that are capable of wider SSB bandwidths should be adjusted for 3&nbsp;kHz bandwidth or less so their emissions stay within the allocated channel.\n\nAmateur equipment made in [[Japan]] and surrounding countries often did not originally support the 60-meter allocation. However it is usually possible to modify such equipment to work correctly on these frequencies within the terms of the individual's licensing conditions. More recently, commercial amateur radio equipment manufactured in Asia has begun to include provision for 60&nbsp;m / 5&nbsp;MHz operation, following the WRC-15 decision.\n\n== International Regulatory Status and World Radiocommunication Conferences ==\nThe amateur radio service is unusual in the fact that it is regulated by international treaty. Worldwide amateur allocations are determined by the International Telecommunication Union<ref>http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx</ref> (ITU), which allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits,<ref>http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/index.asp?category=information&link=rhome&lang=en</ref> develops the technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect and strive to improve access to ICTs to underserved communities worldwide. This is done through successive World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) which take place approximately every 3{{Snd}} 5 years, when telecommunications administrations and organisations from all around the globe meet to make decisions on these elements.\n[[File:ITU 2.jpg|thumb|ITU headquarters, Geneva]]\n\nAt the conclusion of the ITU 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12) on Friday 17 February 2012, Resolution 649 [COM6/12] (WRC12) was ratified as being placed on the Agenda for the following WRC in 2015 (WRC-15).

Less affected by [[Ionosphere|D-Layer]] absorption than 80&nbsp;m, the 60-meter (5&nbsp;MHz) band is an ideal candidate for [[Near Vertical Incidence Skywave| Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)]], the most commonly used technique capable of providing seamless local-to-medium distance HF communications. Information about the [[critical frequency|Critical Frequency (foF2)]] of the [[Ionosphere]] at any one time is highly important for setting up and maintaining reliable NVIS radio links.

A number of these transmit 24/7 (but not all) and some personal beacons are activated as required.\n\nIn the United Kingdom (ITU Region 1) Only GB3ORK (Orkneys{{Snd}} IO89ka) is now active on 5290&nbsp;kHz. The timing of the transmission is every 15 minutes starting at 2 minutes after the hour ( i.e. 02, 17, 32 and 47 minutes ). GB3ORK transmits a [[WSJT (amateur radio software)#JT9|JT9A]] sequence in addition to stepped power levels. Originally three beacons transmitted sequentially on the hour and each subsequent 15 minutes primarily using CW. They were in transmission order  {{Snd}} GB3RAL, GB3WES and GB3ORK, from approximately southern, central and northern locations in the UK respectively. GB3WES closed down on March 11, 2020, when its Notice of Variation (i.e. licence) expired and in July 2017, the licence for 5&nbsp;MHz operation of the southern beacon GB3RAL was not renewed owing to site difficulties.

The beacon transmits from Sursee (Locator: JN47be) using a half-wave dipole, configured for high-angle radiation as an NVIS 'fountain' type antenna at a height above ground of 0.12 of a wavelength. A reflector is placed beneath the antenna. The aim of the system is to explore the propagation conditions on 5&nbsp;MHz in the hills and valleys of Switzerland in relation to its possible suitability as an Emergency Communications band.

Government stations using these frequencies are authorized significantly more power than Amateurs.\n\nAs a part of preparation of justification for a 60-meter band, the ARRL organized a group of twelve amateur radio operators, most of whom had experience in trying to communicate with stations in the Caribbean to obtain eyewitness reports of hurricanes in that region.  The group was assigned by FCC WA2Xxx call signs and allowed to transmit on the 60-meter band as experimental stations. That group's report of conditions on that band became central to ARRL's request for the band for amateur use.  That initial effort stressed continuous communication with the Caribbean hurricane region and timely reports to the Miami National Hurricane Center to supplement other observations and to take emergency messages.  ARRL requested an article for its QST magazine from Charles Harpole, K4VUD and WA2Xxx, about the band's use, but that article was only placed briefly on the ARRL Internet site.  ARRL confirmed that their plan was to move away from hurricane and emergency uses of the band toward general amateur uses.  Harpole, as K4VUD near Orlando, Florida, made the first transatlantic two-way ham radio communication with a ham station near London; notice of that achievement was also suppressed by ARRL fearing FCC concern that the band become too rapidly a normal use amateur band {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n.\n\n==Countries with band allocations==\n\n'''Andorra''' (ITU Region 1): In June 2016 Andorran amateurs were permitted access to the new WRC-15 60&nbsp;m allocation from 5351.5 to 5366.5&nbsp;kHz on a Secondary basis with a maximum power of 15&nbsp;W EIRP; modes are permitted CW and SSB.

4.4,Trial Basis, or any combination of these.]]\n\nThe '''60-meter band''' or '''5&nbsp;MHz band''' is a relatively new [[amateur radio]] allocation, first introduced in 2002, that was originally only available in a few countries, such as the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], [[Ireland]] and [[Iceland]]. Over a number of years however, an increasing proportion of countries' telecommunications administrations{{Snd}} together with their government and military users{{Snd}} have permitted Amateur Radio operation in the 5&nbsp;MHz area on a short or longer term basis, ranging from discrete channels to a frequency band allocation.\n\nAt the closing meeting of the 2015 [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC-15) on 27 November 2015, amongst the Final Acts signed into the International Radio Regulations was one approving \"A Worldwide Frequency Allocation of 5351.5&ndash;5366.5&nbsp;kHz to the Amateur Service on a secondary basis\".<ref name=\"ARRL-WRC15_Approves_Band\">{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/world-radiocommunication-conference-approves-global-60-meter-allocation |title=World Radiocommunication Conference Approves Global 60 Meter Allocation! |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaru-r1.org/index.php/3-news/newsflash/1492-new-band-at-5-mhz |title=New Band at 5&nbsp;MHz |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[International Amateur Radio Union]] Region 1 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref> The ITU's enhanced band allocation limits most amateurs to 15&nbsp;watts [[effective isotropic radiated power]] (EIRP), with some countries allowed up to 25&nbsp;W EIRP.<ref name=\"ARRL-WRC15_Approves_Band\"/><ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\"/>  The ITU allocation came into effect January 1, 2017,<ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\"/> after which each country's national administration must formally revise their rules to permit amateur operation.\n\nPrior to WRC-15, all 5&nbsp;MHz Amateur allocations made by individual administrations were in accordance with [http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/frr.htm Article 4.4] of the ITU Radio Regulations, which requires non-interference with other radio services. Where two-way amateur radio communication is authorized on 60&nbsp;m, it has generally been within the frequency range 5250&ndash;5450&nbsp;kHz, but the whole of this range is not necessarily available and allocations vary significantly from country-to-country. This has been particularly true in latter years since the award at WRC-12 of the range 5250&ndash;5275&nbsp;kHz to the Radiolocation Service, thus effectively reducing the former frequency range down to 5275&ndash;5450&nbsp;kHz.\n\nIn some countries the allocation is still channelized at present, whereas others have block or band allocations or a mixture. Voice operation is generally in [[single sideband|upper sideband]] (USB) mode to facilitate inter-communication by non-amateur service users if necessary. In the [[United States]] and its Dependencies, channelized USB is mandatory. Where channelization is used, the USB suppressed carrier frequency (a.k.a. 'dial' frequency) is normally 1.5&nbsp;kHz below the quoted channel frequency. For example, 5403.5&nbsp;kHz is the 'dial' frequency for the channel centered on 5405&nbsp;kHz.  The \"center\" of the channel is based on the assumption that the bandwidth of SSB transmissions are 3&nbsp;kHz, at most.  Transmitters that are capable of wider SSB bandwidths should be adjusted for 3&nbsp;kHz bandwidth or less so their emissions stay within the allocated channel.\n\nAmateur equipment made in [[Japan]] and surrounding countries often did not originally support the 60-meter allocation. However it is usually possible to modify such equipment to work correctly on these frequencies within the terms of the individual's licensing conditions. More recently, commercial amateur radio equipment manufactured in Asia has begun to include provision for 60&nbsp;m / 5&nbsp;MHz operation, following the WRC-15 decision.\n\n== International Regulatory Status and World Radiocommunication Conferences ==\nThe amateur radio service is unusual in the fact that it is regulated by international treaty. Worldwide amateur allocations are determined by the International Telecommunication Union<ref>http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx</ref> (ITU), which allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits,<ref>http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/index.asp?category=information&link=rhome&lang=en</ref> develops the technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect and strive to improve access to ICTs to underserved communities worldwide. This is done through successive World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) which take place approximately every 3{{Snd}} 5 years, when telecommunications administrations and organisations from all around the globe meet to make decisions on these elements.\n[[File:ITU 2.jpg|thumb|ITU headquarters, Geneva]]\n\nAt the conclusion of the ITU 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12) on Friday 17 February 2012, Resolution 649 [COM6/12] (WRC12) was ratified as being placed on the Agenda for the following WRC in 2015 (WRC-15). This resolution invited WRC-15 to consider \"The possibility of making an allocation of an appropriate amount of spectrum, not necessarily contiguous, to the amateur service on a secondary basis within the band 5250\u20135450&nbsp;kHz\".<ref name=\"ITU-649-20120601\">{{cite web |title=Resolution 649 (WRC-12){{Snd}} Possible allocation to the amateur service on a secondary basis at around 5,300&nbsp;kHz |url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/oth/0c/0a/R0C0A00000A0018PDFE.pdf |website=[[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] |date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the decision at WRC-12 to implement a Radiolocation allocation from 5250 to 5275&nbsp;kHz, the candidate band for an amateur allocation at WRC-15 subsequently became truncated to the 5275 to 5450&nbsp;kHz sector.\n \nOn September 11, 2014, the National Telecommunications Agency of Brazil (ANATEL) announced its intention to propose an amateur service allocation from 5275 to 5450&nbsp;kHz in the 60&nbsp;m band at the next meeting of CITEL (Inter-American Telecommunication Commission).<ref>http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2014/september/brazil_proposes_5275_to_5450_khz.htm</ref> At the [https://www.citel.oas.org/en/Pages/default.aspx CITEL] Regional Conference held in M\u00e9rida City, Mexico in October 2014, the conference recognised\nan IAP (Inter-American Proposal) for a Secondary Amateur Allocation from 5275 to 5450&nbsp;kHz.

Less affected by [[Ionosphere|D-Layer]] absorption than 80&nbsp;m, the 60-meter (5&nbsp;MHz) band is an ideal candidate for [[Near Vertical Incidence Skywave| Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)]], the most commonly used technique capable of providing seamless local-to-medium distance HF communications. Information about the [[critical frequency|Critical Frequency (foF2)]] of the [[Ionosphere]] at any one time is highly important for setting up and maintaining reliable NVIS radio links. This information can be found online from [[Ionogram]]s produced by local [[ionosonde]]s at this site<ref>{{cite web|url=http://car.uml.edu/common/DIDBFastStationList |title=DIDBase Station list |publisher=Car.uml.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==Propagation beacons==\nA number of amateur [[radio propagation beacon]]s are active on 5&nbsp;MHz, some of which produce a sequence of varying power levels in various transmission formats. A number of these transmit 24/7 (but not all) and some personal beacons are activated as required.\n\nIn the United Kingdom (ITU Region 1) Only GB3ORK (Orkneys{{Snd}} IO89ka) is now active on 5290&nbsp;kHz. The timing of the transmission is every 15 minutes starting at 2 minutes after the hour ( i.e. 02, 17, 32 and 47 minutes ). GB3ORK transmits a [[WSJT (amateur radio software)#JT9|JT9A]] sequence in addition to stepped power levels. Originally three beacons transmitted sequentially on the hour and each subsequent 15 minutes primarily using CW. They were in transmission order  {{Snd}} GB3RAL, GB3WES and GB3ORK, from approximately southern, central and northern locations in the UK respectively. GB3WES closed down on March 11, 2020, when its Notice of Variation (i.e. licence) expired and in July 2017, the licence for 5&nbsp;MHz operation of the southern beacon GB3RAL was not renewed owing to site difficulties.  Details of the original British beacon network, including design and building, can be found on the [http://rsgb.org/main/operating/band-plans/hf/5mhz/uk-5-mhz-beacon-chain/ 5&nbsp;MHz beacon page] of the [[Radio Society of Great Britain]] (RSGB) website. \n\nOn the 5290&nbsp;kHz channel (5289.5&nbsp;kHz USB) also is the Danish (ITU Region 1) personal beacon OV1BCN<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oz1fjb.dk/page8.html |title=oz1fjb_dk{{Snd}} 5&nbsp;MHz.

''(Info: Lars, OZ1FJB)''\n\nThe South African Amateur Radio League{{Snd}} SARL{{Snd}} (ITU Region 1) As of May 2017, the South African 5&nbsp;MHz WSPR Cluster has two permanent beacons{{Snd}} currently ZS6SRL in Johannesburg (KG33wv) and ZS1OA (JF95fx) in Cape Town.<ref>http://www.amateurradio.org.za/propresearch.htm</ref> Although no longer operational, when SARL first announced its intention to have a 5&nbsp;MHz Beacon operational, the South African club KARTS{{Snd}} Kempton Park Amateur Radio and Technical Society commissioned a [[WSPR (Amateur radio software)|WSPR]] beacon callsign ZS6KTS (KG43cw), initially on 5250&nbsp;kHz. At a meeting during Summer 2014 with their regulator, ICASA (The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa), SARL reached an agreement to exchange their channel at 5250&nbsp;kHz for the more common beacon channel of 5290&nbsp;kHz.\n\nThe 60&nbsp;m band was released for amateur radio in Switzerland (ITU Region 1) in January 2017, however the Sursee Amateur Radio Club obtained earlier the necessary official authorizations from their [https://web.archive.org/web/20140523203444/http://www.bakom.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en Federal Office of Communications] for a Swiss 5&nbsp;MHz Experimental Beacon project. Using the callsign HB9AW, the beacon became operational on 5291.0&nbsp;kHz at 0000{{Clarify |date=February 2020 |reason=Time zone?}} on 1 June 2014. The transmission commences with the call sign HB9AW in CW (100HA1B), followed by five 2 seconds-long dashes. The dashes are each accurately attenuated by 10&nbsp;dB in the EIRP power sequence 10&nbsp;W, 5&nbsp;W, 1&nbsp;W, 100&nbsp;mW, concluding with 10&nbsp;mW, and repeats every 5 minutes, commencing on the hour. The beacon transmits from Sursee (Locator: JN47be) using a half-wave dipole, configured for high-angle radiation as an NVIS 'fountain' type antenna at a height above ground of 0.12 of a wavelength. A reflector is placed beneath the antenna. The aim of the system is to explore the propagation conditions on 5&nbsp;MHz in the hills and valleys of Switzerland in relation to its possible suitability as an Emergency Communications band.

It is co-sited with the DK\u00d8WCY 30 and 80&nbsp;m beacons. Owing to considerations of the rising cost of electrical power, the operational schedule of DRA5 has changed and it no longer transmits over the full 24-hour period. It is currently operational 0400\u20132200 UTC during the Summertime period and 0500\u20132300 UTC during the Wintertime period. These times of year correspond to those of the seasonal clock changes in Germany.''(Source: Beacon keeper DK4VW e-mail 18th July 2013)''\n\nThe Hungarian 60&nbsp;m CW Beacon HG7BHB (ITU Region 1), which could be found on 5352.5&nbsp;kHz has now ceased operation.  Established in 2015 by MRASZ, the Hungarian national amateur radio society, the beacon went out of order on 20 February 2017 and following a substantial increase in activity near its frequency plus the fact that an alternative frequency was not available, the decision was taken to switch off the HG7BHB beacon\n\nIn addition, individual [[WSPR (Amateur radio software)|WSPR]] beacon experiments using powers as low as 1 watt in the UK have led to reception reports from the US and Middle East.

Government stations using these frequencies are authorized significantly more power than Amateurs.\n\nAs a part of preparation of justification for a 60-meter band, the ARRL organized a group of twelve amateur radio operators, most of whom had experience in trying to communicate with stations in the Caribbean to obtain eyewitness reports of hurricanes in that region.  The group was assigned by FCC WA2Xxx call signs and allowed to transmit on the 60-meter band as experimental stations. That group's report of conditions on that band became central to ARRL's request for the band for amateur use.  That initial effort stressed continuous communication with the Caribbean hurricane region and timely reports to the Miami National Hurricane Center to supplement other observations and to take emergency messages.  ARRL requested an article for its QST magazine from Charles Harpole, K4VUD and WA2Xxx, about the band's use, but that article was only placed briefly on the ARRL Internet site.  ARRL confirmed that their plan was to move away from hurricane and emergency uses of the band toward general amateur uses.  Harpole, as K4VUD near Orlando, Florida, made the first transatlantic two-way ham radio communication with a ham station near London; notice of that achievement was also suppressed by ARRL fearing FCC concern that the band become too rapidly a normal use amateur band {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n.\n\n==Countries with band allocations==\n\n'''Andorra''' (ITU Region 1): In June 2016 Andorran amateurs were permitted access to the new WRC-15 60&nbsp;m allocation from 5351.5 to 5366.5&nbsp;kHz on a Secondary basis with a maximum power of 15&nbsp;W EIRP; modes are permitted CW and SSB.

The Spirit closely resembles [[Father Christmas]] from [[English folklore]].\n\n==Description==\nThe Ghost of Christmas present is the second of the three spirits (after the visitations by [[Jacob Marley]] and the [[ent. He shows Scrooge how other people, especially those he knows, celebrate [[Christmas]] in order to show the reader what people think of Scrooge behind his back.\n\nWhen he first appears before Scrooge, he invites him to \"come in and know me better, man\". According to Dickens' novel, the Ghost of Christmas Present appears to Scrooge as \"a jolly giant\" with dark brown curls. He wears a fur-lined green robe and on his head a holly wreath set with shining icicles. He carries a large torch, made to resemble a [[cornucopia]], and appears accompanied by a great feast. He states that he has had \"more than eighteen hundred\" brothers and later reveals the ability to change his size to fit into any space. He also bears a scabbard with no sword in it, a representation of peace on Earth and good will toward men.\n\nThe spirit transports Scrooge around the city, showing him scenes of festivity and also deprivation that are happening as they watch, sprinkling a little warmth from his torch as he travels. Amongst the visits are the city streets, Scrooge's nephew\u2019s Christmas party, and the family of his impoverished clerk, [[Bob Cratchit]]. Scrooge takes an interest in Cratchit's desperately-ill son, Tiny Tim, and asks the Ghost if Tim will live. The Ghost first states that \"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die\", and then \u2013 quick to use Scrooge's past heartless comments to two charitable solicitors against him \u2013 states, \"What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population\". The spirit then warns Scrooge to \"forebear that wicked tongue until you have discovered for yourself what the surplus is, and where it is\" and chillingly tells him \"It may be, that in the sight of heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than MILLIONS like this poor man's child\".\n\nThe spirit finally reveals to Scrooge two emaciated children, subhuman in appearance and loathsome to behold, clinging to his robes, and names the boy as ''Ignorance'' and the girl as ''Want''. The spirit warns Scrooge, \"Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom unless the writing be erased\".[Ignorance and Want, represent society's abandonment of the poor and the consequences of that abandonment. Above all else, A Christmas Carol is allegorical. Dickens was a strong proponent of taking care of society's poor and downtrodden, and this is why he chose to represent them in children]. The spirit once again quotes Scrooge, who asks if the grotesque children have \"no refuge, no resource\", and the spirit retorts with more of Scrooge's own words: \"Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?\"\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present, having already aged, reveals that he will only exist on Earth for a \"very brief\" time, implied to be that single Christmas holiday. He finally disappears at the stroke of midnight on [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], and leaves Scrooge to face the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], as it approaches \"like a mist along the ground\".\n\n== Appearance in notable film and TV adaptations ==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{in popular culture|date=January 2017}}{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n}}\n* In the 1935 film ''[[Scrooge (1935 film)|Scrooge]]'' he is played by [[Oscar Asche]]. \n* In the 1938 film ''[[A Christmas Carol (1938 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' he is played by [[Lionel Braham]].\n* In the 1951 film ''[[Scrooge (1951 film)|Scrooge]]'' he is played by [[Francis De Wolff]].\n* In the 1962 TV special ''[[Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol]]'', he appears before the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] was meant to.\n* In the musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)]]'' he is played by [[Kenneth More]]\n* In the [[Academy Award]]-winning animated film ''[[A Christmas Carol (1971 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (1971) he is played by [[Felix Felton]].\n* In the [[Disney]] 1983 animated adaptation titled ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', [[Willie the Giant]] (voiced by [[Will Ryan]]) portrays the ghost.\n* In the [[A Christmas Carol (1984 film)|1984 film]] starring [[George C.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

Classical crossover\u2019s excessive sentimentality and reliance on [spectacle] often provoke the disdain of critics from the worlds of both popular music and opera, but perhaps the vitriol has just as much to do with the singer\u2019s age and gender. Young girls frequently become the scrutinized objects of the public\u2019s gaze. ... [T]he cluster of behaviors customarily defined as \"girlish\" are frequently devalued, mocked, and marginalized. ... Throughout history prodigies have been received in a similar manner, as the public would rather dismiss or devalue their accomplishments than accept evidence of extraordinariness. ... With her embodiment of both sheltered innocence ... and hyperability ...

Classical crossover\u2019s excessive sentimentality and reliance on [spectacle] often provoke the disdain of critics from the worlds of both popular music and opera, but perhaps the vitriol has just as much to do with the singer\u2019s age and gender. Young girls frequently become the scrutinized objects of the public\u2019s gaze. ... [T]he cluster of behaviors customarily defined as \"girlish\" are frequently devalued, mocked, and marginalized. ... Throughout history prodigies have been received in a similar manner, as the public would rather dismiss or devalue their accomplishments than accept evidence of extraordinariness. ... With her embodiment of both sheltered innocence ... and hyperability ...
