It is also known as '''automatic speech recognition''' ('''ASR'''), '''computer speech recognition''' or '''speech to text''' ('''STT'''). It incorporates knowledge and research in the [[computer science]], [[linguistics]] and [[computer engineering]] fields.\n\nSome speech recognition systems require \"training\" (also called \"enrollment\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated [[vocabulary]] into the system.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used in many systems. Language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as [[document classification]] or [[statistical machine translation]].\n\n===Hidden Markov models===\n{{Main|Hidden Markov model}}\nModern general-purpose speech recognition systems are based on Hidden Markov Models. These are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities. HMMs are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a short-time stationary signal. In a short time-scale (e.g., 10 milliseconds), speech can be approximated as a [[stationary process]]. Speech can be thought of as a [[Markov model]] for many stochastic purposes.\n\nAnother reason why HMMs are popular is because they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use. In speech recognition, the hidden Markov model would output a sequence of ''n''-dimensional real-valued vectors (with ''n'' being a small integer, such as 10), outputting one of these every 10 milliseconds. The vectors would consist of [[cepstrum|cepstral]] coefficients, which are obtained by taking a [[Fourier transform]] of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a [[cosine transform]], then taking the first (most significant) coefficients. The hidden Markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance Gaussians, which will give a likelihood for each observed vector. Each word, or (for more general speech recognition systems), each [[phoneme]], will have a different output distribution; a hidden Markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden Markov models for the separate words and phonemes.\n\nDescribed above are the core elements of the most common, HMM-based approach to speech recognition. Modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above. A typical large-vocabulary system would need [[context dependency]] for the phonemes (so phonemes with different left and right context have different realizations as HMM states); it would use [[cepstral normalization]] to normalize for different speaker and recording conditions; for further speaker normalization it might use vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) for male-female normalization and [[maximum likelihood linear regression]] (MLLR) for more general speaker adaptation. The features would have so-called [[delta coefficient|delta]] and [[delta-delta coefficient]]s to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use [[heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis]] (HLDA); or might skip the delta and delta-delta coefficients and use [[splicing (speech recognition)|splicing]] and an [[Linear Discriminant Analysis|LDA]]-based projection followed perhaps by [[heteroscedastic]] linear discriminant analysis or a [[global semi-tied co variance]] transform (also known as [[maximum likelihood linear transform]], or MLLT). Many systems use so-called discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to HMM parameter estimation and instead optimize some classification-related measure of the training data. Examples are maximum [[mutual information]] (MMI), minimum classification error (MCE) and minimum phone error (MPE).\n\nDecoding of the speech (the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence) would probably use the [[Viterbi algorithm]] to find the best path, and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden Markov model, which includes both the acoustic and language model information, and combining it statically beforehand (the [[finite state transducer]], or FST, approach).\n\nA possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate, and to use a better scoring function ([[re scoring (ASR)|re scoring]]) to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score. The set of candidates can be kept either as a list (the [[N-best list]] approach) or as a subset of the models (a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]). Re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the [[Bayes risk]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1       = Goel\n |first1      = Vaibhava\n |last2       = Byrne\n |first2      = William J.\n |year        = 2000\n |title       = Minimum Bayes-risk automatic speech recognition\n |url         = http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/vgoel/publications/CSAL.ps\n |journal     = Computer Speech & Language\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 2\n |pages       = 115\u2013135\n |doi         = 10.1006/csla.2000.0138\n |accessdate  = 28 March 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225846/http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/vgoel/publications/CSAL.ps\n |archivedate = 25 July 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> (or an approximation thereof): Instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability, we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions (i.e., we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability). The loss function is usually the [[Levenshtein distance]], though it can be different distances for specific tasks; the set of possible transcriptions is, of course, pruned to maintain tractability. Efficient algorithms have been devised to re score [[lattice (order)|lattices]] represented as weighted [[finite state transducers]] with [[edit distance]]s represented themselves as a [[finite state transducer]] verifying certain assumptions.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last        = Mohri\n |first       = M.\n |year        = 2002\n |title       = Edit-Distance of Weighted Automata: General Definitions and Algorithms\n |url         = http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/edit.pdf\n |journal     = International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 6\n |pages       = 957\u2013982\n |doi         = 10.1142/S0129054103002114\n |accessdate  = 28 March 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120318032640/http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/edit.pdf\n |archivedate = 18 March 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Dynamic time warping (DTW)-based speech recognition===\n{{Main|Dynamic time warping}}\n\nDynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful HMM-based approach.\n\nDynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed. For instance, similarities in walking patterns would be detected, even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly, or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation. DTW has been applied to video, audio, and graphics&nbsp;\u2013 indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with DTW.\n\nA well-known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. In general, it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g., time series) with certain restrictions. That is, the sequences are \"warped\" non-linearly to match each other. This sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden Markov models.\n\n===Neural networks===\n{{Main|Artificial neural network}}\nNeural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in ASR in the late 1980s.

Traditional phonetic-based (i.e., all [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]]-based model) approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation, acoustic and [[language model]]. End-to-end models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer. This is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process. For example, a [[N-gram|n-gram language model]] is required for all HMM-based systems, and a typical n-gram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Speech and Language Processing|last=Jurafsky|first=Daniel|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Consequently, modern commercial ASR systems from [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] (as of 2017) are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally.\n\nThe first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based systems introduced by [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] of [[DeepMind|Google DeepMind]] and Navdeep Jaitly of the [[University of Toronto]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=Alex|year=2014|title=Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks|journal=ICML|volume=|pages=|via=|url=http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/graves14.pdf}}</ref> The model consisted of [[recurrent neural network]]s and a CTC layer. Jointly, the RNN-CTC model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together, however it is incapable of learning the language due to [[conditional independence]] assumptions similar to a HMM. Consequently, CTC models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to English characters, but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts. Later, [[Baidu]] expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in Chinese Mandarin and English.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Amodei|first=Dario|year=2016|title=Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin|eprint=1512.02595|class=cs.CL}}</ref> In 2016, [[University of Oxford]] presented LipNet,<ref>{{cite web|title=LipNet: How easy do you think lipreading is?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa5QGremQf8&list=PLXkuFIFnXUAPIrXKgtIpctv2NuSo7xw3k&index=1 |website=YouTube|accessdate=5 May 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427104009/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa5QGremQf8|archivedate=27 April 2017| df=dmy-all}}</ref> the first end-to-end sentence-level lip reading model, using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an RNN-CTC architecture, surpassing human-level performance in a restricted grammar dataset.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Assael|first=Yannis|last2=Shillingford|first2=Brendan|last3=Whiteson|first3=Shimon|last4=de Freitas|first4=Nando|date=5 November 2016 |title=LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading|eprint=1611.01599|class=cs.CV}}</ref> A large-scale CNN-RNN-CTC architecture was presented in 2018 by [[DeepMind|Google DeepMind]] achieving 6 times better performance than human experts.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite arxiv|last=Shillingford|first=Brendan|last2=Assael|first2=Yannis|last3=Hoffman|first3=Matthew W.|last4=Paine|first4=Thomas|last5=Hughes|first5=C\u00edan|last6=Prabhu|first6=Utsav|last7=Liao|first7=Hank|last8=Sak|first8=Hasim|last9=Rao|first9=Kanishka|date=2018-07-13|title=Large-Scale Visual Speech Recognition|eprint=1807.05162|class=cs.CV}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative approach to CTC-based models are attention-based models. Attention-based ASR models were introduced simultaneously by Chan et al. of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Google Brain]] and Bahdanau et al. of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al|University of Montreal]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=William|last2=Jaitly|first2=Navdeep|last3=Le|first3=Quoc|last4=Vinyals|first4=Oriol|year=2016|title=Listen, Attend and Spell: A Neural Network for Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition|journal=ICASSP|volume=|pages=|via=|url=https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/44926.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Bahdanau|first=Dzmitry|year=2016|title=End-to-End Attention-based Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition|eprint=1508.04395|class=cs.CL}}</ref> The model named \"Listen, Attend and Spell\" (LAS), literally \"listens\" to the acoustic signal, pays \"attention\" to different parts of the signal and \"spells\" out the transcript one character at a time. Unlike CTC-based models, attention-based models do not have conditional-independence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation, acoustic and language model directly. This means, during deployment, there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for applications with limited memory. By the end of 2016, the attention-based models have seen considerable success including outperforming the CTC models (with or without an external language model).<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Chorowski|first=Jan|last2=Jaitly|first2=Navdeep|date=8 December 2016 |title=Towards better decoding and language model integration in sequence to sequence models|eprint=1612.02695|class=cs.NE}}</ref> Various extensions have been proposed since the original LAS model.

Following the audio prompt, the system has a \"listening window\" during which it may accept a speech input for recognition.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n \nSimple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls, select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone, MP3 player or music-loaded flash drive. Voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model. Some of the most recent{{When|date=April 2014}} car models offer natural-language speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands, allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases. With such systems there is, therefore, no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Health care===\n\n====Medical documentation====\nIn the [[health care]] sector, speech recognition can be implemented in front-end or back-end of the medical documentation process. Front-end speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speech-recognition engine, the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken, and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document. Back-end or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a [[digital dictation]] system, the voice is routed through a speech-recognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor, where the draft is edited and report finalized. Deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently.\n\nOne of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] ([[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA]]) provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an EMR according to \"Meaningful Use\" standards. These standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the EMR (now more commonly referred to as an [[Electronic Health Record]] or EHR). The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, progress note or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data (e.g., numeric values or codes from a list or a [[controlled vocabulary]]) are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse.\n\nA more significant issue is that most EHRs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voice-recognition capabilities. A large part of the clinician's interaction with the EHR involves navigation through the user interface using menus, and tab/button clicks, and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse: voice-based navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits. By contrast, many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice \"macros\", where the use of certain phrases \u2013 e.g., \"normal report\", will automatically fill in a large number of default values and/or generate boilerplate, which will vary with the type of the exam \u2013 e.g., a chest X-ray vs. a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system.\n\nAs an alternative to this navigation by hand, cascaded use of speech recognition and [[information extraction]] has been studied<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suominen |first1=Hanna |last2=Zhou |first2=Liyuan |last3=Hanlen |first3=Leif |last4=Ferraro |first4=Gabriela |year=2015 |title=Benchmarking Clinical Speech Recognition and Information Extraction: New Data, Methods, and Evaluations |journal=JMIR Medical Informatics |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e19 |doi=10.2196/medinform.4321 |pmid=25917752 |pmc=4427705}}</ref> as a way to fill out a handover form for clinical proofing and sign-off. The results are encouraging, and the paper also opens data, together with the related performance benchmarks and some processing software, to the research and development community for studying clinical documentation and language-processing.\n\n====Therapeutic use====\nProlonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with [[word processor]]s has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in [[brain AVM]] patients who have been treated with [[Resection (surgery)|resection]]. Further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose AVMs have been treated using radiologic techniques.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Military===\n\n====High-performance fighter aircraft====\nSubstantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in [[fighter aircraft]]. Of particular note have been the US program in speech recognition for the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#Technology demonstrators, and test variants#Flight control variants#F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration|Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)]]/[[F-16]] aircraft ([[F-16 VISTA]]), the program in France for [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] aircraft, and other programs in the UK dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms. In these programs, speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft, with applications including: setting radio frequencies, commanding an autopilot system, setting steer-point coordinates and weapons release parameters, and controlling flight display.\n\nWorking with Swedish pilots flying in the [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|JAS-39]] Gripen cockpit, Englund (2004) found recognition deteriorated with increasing [[g-force|g-loads]]. The report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly. Contrary to what might have been expected, no effects of the broken English of the speakers were found. It was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer, as might have been expected. A restricted vocabulary, and above all, a proper syntax, could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially.<ref>{{cite thesis|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/1664.pdf|title=Speech recognition in the JAS&nbsp;39 Gripen aircraft: Adaptation to speech at different G-loads|first=Christine |last=Englund |publisher=[[Stockholm University|Stockholm Royal Institute of Technology]] |type=Masters thesis |year=2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002002102/http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/1664.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], currently in service with the UK [[RAF]], employs a speaker-dependent system, requiring each pilot to create a template. The system is not used for any safety-critical or weapon-critical tasks, such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage, but is used for a wide range of other cockpit functions. Voice commands are confirmed by visual and/or aural feedback. The system is seen as a major design feature in the reduction of pilot [[workload]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurofighter.com/the-aircraft#cockpit|title=The Cockpit |website=Eurofighter Typhoon |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301222529/https://www.eurofighter.com/the-aircraft#cockpit |archivedate=1 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and even allows the pilot to assign targets to his aircraft with two simple voice commands or to any of his wingmen with only five commands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofighter.com/capabilities/technology/voice-throttle-stick/direct-voice-input.html |title=Eurofighter Typhoon \u2013 The world's most advanced fighter aircraft |website=www.eurofighter.com |accessdate=1 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511025203/http://www.eurofighter.com/capabilities/technology/voice-throttle-stick/direct-voice-input.html |archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSpeaker-independent systems are also being developed and are under test for the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F35 Lightning II]] (JSF) and the [[Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master]] lead-in fighter trainer. These systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of 98%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071861|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020030310/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071861|archivedate=20 October 2007|first=John|last=Schutte|title=Researchers fine-tune F-35 pilot-aircraft speech system|date=15 October 2007|publisher=United States Air Force}}</ref>\n\n====Helicopters====\nThe problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise pertain strongly to the [[helicopter]] environment as well as to the jet fighter environment. The acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment, not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot, in general, does not wear a [[Fighter pilot helmet|facemask]], which would reduce acoustic noise in the [[microphone]]. Substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters, notably by the [[U.S. Army]] Avionics Research and Development Activity (AVRADA) and by the Royal Aerospace Establishment ([[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]]) in the UK. Work in France has included speech recognition in the [[Puma helicopter]]. There has also been much useful work in [[Canada]]. Results have been encouraging, and voice applications have included: control of communication radios, setting of [[navigation]] systems, and control of an automated target handover system.\n\nAs in fighter applications, the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness. Encouraging results are reported for the AVRADA tests, although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment. Much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall [[speech technology]] in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings.\n\n====Training air traffic controllers====\nTraining for air traffic controllers (ATC) represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems. Many ATC training systems currently require a person to act as a \"pseudo-pilot\", engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller, which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real ATC situation. Speech recognition and [[speech synthesis|synthesis]] techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as pseudo-pilot, thus reducing training and support personnel. In theory, Air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller, hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible. In practice, this is rarely the case. The FAA document 7110.65 details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers. While this document gives less than 150 examples of such phrases, the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of 500,000.\n\nThe USAF, USMC, US Army, US Navy, and FAA as well as a number of international ATC training organizations such as the Royal Australian Air Force and Civil Aviation Authorities in Italy, Brazil, and Canada are currently using ATC simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Telephony and other domains===\nASR is now commonplace in the field of [[telephony]] and is becoming more widespread in the field of [[computer gaming]] and simulation. In telephony systems, ASR is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with [[IVR]] systems. Despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing, in the field of document production, ASR has not seen the expected increases in use.\n\nThe improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in [[smartphone]]s. Speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface, for creating predefined or custom speech commands.\n\n=== Usage in education and daily life ===\nFor [[language learning]], speech recognition can be useful for learning a [[second language]].

Other measures of accuracy include [[Single Word Error Rate]] (SWER) and [[Command Success Rate]] (CSR).\n\nSpeech recognition by machine is a very complex problem, however. Vocalizations vary in terms of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed. Speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics. Accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following:<ref>National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"[http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/publications/ASRhistory/ The History of Automatic Speech Recognition Evaluation at NIST] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008210040/http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/publications/ASRhistory/ |date=8 October 2013 }}\".</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n* Vocabulary size and confusability\n* Speaker dependence versus independence\n* Isolated, discontinuous or continuous speech\n* Task and language constraints\n* Read versus spontaneous speech\n* Adverse conditions\n\n===Accuracy===\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors:\n* Error rates increase as the vocabulary size grows: \n::e.g. the 10 digits \"zero\" to \"nine\" can be recognized essentially perfectly, but vocabulary sizes of 200, 5000 or 100000 may have error rates of 3%, 7% or 45% respectively.\n* Vocabulary is hard to recognize if it contains confusing words:\n::e.g. the 26 letters of the English alphabet are difficult to discriminate because they are confusing words (most notoriously, the E-set: \"B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z\"); an 8% error rate is considered good for this vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* Speaker dependence vs. independence:\n::A speaker-dependent system is intended for use by a single speaker.\n::A speaker-independent system is intended for use by any speaker (more difficult).\n* Isolated, Discontinuous or continuous speech\n::With isolated speech, single words are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech.\nWith discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech. <br />\nWith continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used, therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech, different from both isolated and discontinuous speech.\n\n* Task and language constraints\n**e.g. Querying application may dismiss the hypothesis \"The apple is red.\"\n**e.g. Constraints may be semantic; rejecting \"The apple is angry.\"\n**e.g. Syntactic; rejecting \"Red is apple the.\"\n\nConstraints are often represented by a grammar. \n* Read vs. Spontaneous Speech \u2013 When a person reads it's usually in a context that has been previously prepared, but when a person uses spontaneous speech, it is difficult to recognize the speech because of the disfluencies (like \"uh\" and \"um\", false starts, incomplete sentences, stuttering, coughing, and laughter) and limited vocabulary. \n* Adverse conditions \u2013 Environmental noise (e.g. Noise in a car or a factory). Acoustical distortions (e.g. echoes, room acoustics)\nSpeech recognition is a multi-leveled pattern recognition task.\n* Acoustical signals are structured into a hierarchy of units, e.g. [[Phoneme]]s, Words, Phrases, and Sentences;\n* Each level provides additional constraints;\ne.g. Known word pronunciations or legal word sequences, which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at lower level;\n* This hierarchy of constraints are exploited. By combining decisions probabilistically at all lower levels, and making more deterministic decisions only at the highest level, speech recognition by a machine is a process broken into several phases. Computationally, it is a problem in which a sound pattern has to be recognized or classified into a category that represents a meaning to a human. Every acoustic signal can be broken in smaller more basic sub-signals. As the more complex sound signal is broken into the smaller sub-sounds, different levels are created, where at the top level we have complex sounds, which are made of simpler sounds on lower level, and going to lower levels even more, we create more basic and shorter and simpler sounds. The lowest level, where the sounds are the most fundamental, a machine would check for simple and more probabilistic rules of what sound should represent. Once these sounds are put together into more complex sound on upper level, a new set of more deterministic rules should predict what new complex sound should represent. The most upper level of a deterministic rule should figure out the meaning of complex expressions. In order to expand our knowledge about speech recognition we need to take into a consideration neural networks. There are four steps of neural network approaches: \n* Digitize the speech that we want to recognize\nFor telephone speech the sampling rate is 8000 samples per second; \n* Compute features of spectral-domain of the speech (with Fourier transform);\ncomputed every 10&nbsp;ms, with one 10&nbsp;ms section called a frame;\n\nAnalysis of four-step neural network approaches can be explained by further information. Sound is produced by air (or some other medium) vibration, which we register by ears, but machines by receivers. Basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions: [[amplitude]] (how strong is it), and [[frequency]] (how often it vibrates per second).\nAccuracy can be computed with the help of word error rate (WER). Word error rate can be calculated by aligning the recognized word and referenced word using dynamic string alignment. The problem may occur while computing the word error rate due to the difference between the sequence lengths of recognized word and referenced word. \nLet, S be the number of substitutions,\n  D be the number of deletions,\n  I be the number of insertions,\n  N be the number of word references.\nThe formula to compute the word error rate(WER) is \n       WER = (S+D+I)\u00f7N\nWhile computing the word recognition rate (WRR) word error rate (WER) is used and the formula is \n       WRR = 1- WER\n           = (N-S-D-I)\u00f7 N = (H-I)\u00f7N\nHere H is the number of correctly recognized words. H= N-(S+D).\n\n===Security concerns===\nSpeech recognition can become a means of attack, theft, or accidental operation. For example, activation words like \"Alexa\" spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately, or possibly take an unwanted action.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469383361/listen-up-your-ai-assistant-goes-crazy-for-npr-too |title=Listen Up: Your AI Assistant Goes Crazy For NPR Too |work=[[NPR]] |date=6 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723210358/http://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469383361/listen-up-your-ai-assistant-goes-crazy-for-npr-too |archivedate=23 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Voice-controlled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building, or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used in many systems. Language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as [[document classification]] or [[statistical machine translation]].\n\n===Hidden Markov models===\n{{Main|Hidden Markov model}}\nModern general-purpose speech recognition systems are based on Hidden Markov Models. These are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities. HMMs are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a short-time stationary signal. In a short time-scale (e.g., 10 milliseconds), speech can be approximated as a [[stationary process]]. Speech can be thought of as a [[Markov model]] for many stochastic purposes.\n\nAnother reason why HMMs are popular is because they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use. In speech recognition, the hidden Markov model would output a sequence of ''n''-dimensional real-valued vectors (with ''n'' being a small integer, such as 10), outputting one of these every 10 milliseconds. The vectors would consist of [[cepstrum|cepstral]] coefficients, which are obtained by taking a [[Fourier transform]] of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a [[cosine transform]], then taking the first (most significant) coefficients. The hidden Markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance Gaussians, which will give a likelihood for each observed vector. Each word, or (for more general speech recognition systems), each [[phoneme]], will have a different output distribution; a hidden Markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden Markov models for the separate words and phonemes.\n\nDescribed above are the core elements of the most common, HMM-based approach to speech recognition. Modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above. A typical large-vocabulary system would need [[context dependency]] for the phonemes (so phonemes with different left and right context have different realizations as HMM states); it would use [[cepstral normalization]] to normalize for different speaker and recording conditions; for further speaker normalization it might use vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) for male-female normalization and [[maximum likelihood linear regression]] (MLLR) for more general speaker adaptation. The features would have so-called [[delta coefficient|delta]] and [[delta-delta coefficient]]s to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use [[heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis]] (HLDA); or might skip the delta and delta-delta coefficients and use [[splicing (speech recognition)|splicing]] and an [[Linear Discriminant Analysis|LDA]]-based projection followed perhaps by [[heteroscedastic]] linear discriminant analysis or a [[global semi-tied co variance]] transform (also known as [[maximum likelihood linear transform]], or MLLT). Many systems use so-called discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to HMM parameter estimation and instead optimize some classification-related measure of the training data. Examples are maximum [[mutual information]] (MMI), minimum classification error (MCE) and minimum phone error (MPE).\n\nDecoding of the speech (the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence) would probably use the [[Viterbi algorithm]] to find the best path, and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden Markov model, which includes both the acoustic and language model information, and combining it statically beforehand (the [[finite state transducer]], or FST, approach).\n\nA possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate, and to use a better scoring function ([[re scoring (ASR)|re scoring]]) to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score. The set of candidates can be kept either as a list (the [[N-best list]] approach) or as a subset of the models (a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]). Re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the [[Bayes risk]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1       = Goel\n |first1      = Vaibhava\n |last2       = Byrne\n |first2      = William J.\n |year        = 2000\n |title       = Minimum Bayes-risk automatic speech recognition\n |url         = http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/vgoel/publications/CSAL.ps\n |journal     = Computer Speech & Language\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 2\n |pages       = 115\u2013135\n |doi         = 10.1006/csla.2000.0138\n |accessdate  = 28 March 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225846/http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/vgoel/publications/CSAL.ps\n |archivedate = 25 July 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> (or an approximation thereof): Instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability, we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions (i.e., we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability). The loss function is usually the [[Levenshtein distance]], though it can be different distances for specific tasks; the set of possible transcriptions is, of course, pruned to maintain tractability. Efficient algorithms have been devised to re score [[lattice (order)|lattices]] represented as weighted [[finite state transducers]] with [[edit distance]]s represented themselves as a [[finite state transducer]] verifying certain assumptions.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last        = Mohri\n |first       = M.\n |year        = 2002\n |title       = Edit-Distance of Weighted Automata: General Definitions and Algorithms\n |url         = http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/edit.pdf\n |journal     = International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 6\n |pages       = 957\u2013982\n |doi         = 10.1142/S0129054103002114\n |accessdate  = 28 March 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120318032640/http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/edit.pdf\n |archivedate = 18 March 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Dynamic time warping (DTW)-based speech recognition===\n{{Main|Dynamic time warping}}\n\nDynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful HMM-based approach.\n\nDynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed. For instance, similarities in walking patterns would be detected, even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly, or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation. DTW has been applied to video, audio, and graphics&nbsp;\u2013 indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with DTW.\n\nA well-known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. In general, it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g., time series) with certain restrictions. That is, the sequences are \"warped\" non-linearly to match each other. This sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden Markov models.\n\n===Neural networks===\n{{Main|Artificial neural network}}\nNeural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in ASR in the late 1980s.

Traditional phonetic-based (i.e., all [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]]-based model) approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation, acoustic and [[language model]]. End-to-end models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer. This is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process. For example, a [[N-gram|n-gram language model]] is required for all HMM-based systems, and a typical n-gram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Speech and Language Processing|last=Jurafsky|first=Daniel|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Consequently, modern commercial ASR systems from [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] (as of 2017) are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally.\n\nThe first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based systems introduced by [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] of [[DeepMind|Google DeepMind]] and Navdeep Jaitly of the [[University of Toronto]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=Alex|year=2014|title=Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks|journal=ICML|volume=|pages=|via=|url=http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/graves14.pdf}}</ref> The model consisted of [[recurrent neural network]]s and a CTC layer. Jointly, the RNN-CTC model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together, however it is incapable of learning the language due to [[conditional independence]] assumptions similar to a HMM. Consequently, CTC models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to English characters, but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts. Later, [[Baidu]] expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in Chinese Mandarin and English.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Amodei|first=Dario|year=2016|title=Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin|eprint=1512.02595|class=cs.CL}}</ref> In 2016, [[University of Oxford]] presented LipNet,<ref>{{cite web|title=LipNet: How easy do you think lipreading is?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa5QGremQf8&list=PLXkuFIFnXUAPIrXKgtIpctv2NuSo7xw3k&index=1 |website=YouTube|accessdate=5 May 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427104009/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa5QGremQf8|archivedate=27 April 2017| df=dmy-all}}</ref> the first end-to-end sentence-level lip reading model, using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an RNN-CTC architecture, surpassing human-level performance in a restricted grammar dataset.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Assael|first=Yannis|last2=Shillingford|first2=Brendan|last3=Whiteson|first3=Shimon|last4=de Freitas|first4=Nando|date=5 November 2016 |title=LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading|eprint=1611.01599|class=cs.CV}}</ref> A large-scale CNN-RNN-CTC architecture was presented in 2018 by [[DeepMind|Google DeepMind]] achieving 6 times better performance than human experts.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite arxiv|last=Shillingford|first=Brendan|last2=Assael|first2=Yannis|last3=Hoffman|first3=Matthew W.|last4=Paine|first4=Thomas|last5=Hughes|first5=C\u00edan|last6=Prabhu|first6=Utsav|last7=Liao|first7=Hank|last8=Sak|first8=Hasim|last9=Rao|first9=Kanishka|date=2018-07-13|title=Large-Scale Visual Speech Recognition|eprint=1807.05162|class=cs.CV}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative approach to CTC-based models are attention-based models. Attention-based ASR models were introduced simultaneously by Chan et al. of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Google Brain]] and Bahdanau et al. of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al|University of Montreal]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=William|last2=Jaitly|first2=Navdeep|last3=Le|first3=Quoc|last4=Vinyals|first4=Oriol|year=2016|title=Listen, Attend and Spell: A Neural Network for Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition|journal=ICASSP|volume=|pages=|via=|url=https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/44926.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Bahdanau|first=Dzmitry|year=2016|title=End-to-End Attention-based Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition|eprint=1508.04395|class=cs.CL}}</ref> The model named \"Listen, Attend and Spell\" (LAS), literally \"listens\" to the acoustic signal, pays \"attention\" to different parts of the signal and \"spells\" out the transcript one character at a time. Unlike CTC-based models, attention-based models do not have conditional-independence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation, acoustic and language model directly. This means, during deployment, there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for applications with limited memory. By the end of 2016, the attention-based models have seen considerable success including outperforming the CTC models (with or without an external language model).<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Chorowski|first=Jan|last2=Jaitly|first2=Navdeep|date=8 December 2016 |title=Towards better decoding and language model integration in sequence to sequence models|eprint=1612.02695|class=cs.NE}}</ref> Various extensions have been proposed since the original LAS model.

Following the audio prompt, the system has a \"listening window\" during which it may accept a speech input for recognition.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n \nSimple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls, select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone, MP3 player or music-loaded flash drive. Voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model. Some of the most recent{{When|date=April 2014}} car models offer natural-language speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands, allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases. With such systems there is, therefore, no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Health care===\n\n====Medical documentation====\nIn the [[health care]] sector, speech recognition can be implemented in front-end or back-end of the medical documentation process. Front-end speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speech-recognition engine, the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken, and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document. Back-end or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a [[digital dictation]] system, the voice is routed through a speech-recognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor, where the draft is edited and report finalized. Deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently.\n\nOne of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] ([[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA]]) provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an EMR according to \"Meaningful Use\" standards. These standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the EMR (now more commonly referred to as an [[Electronic Health Record]] or EHR). The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, progress note or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data (e.g., numeric values or codes from a list or a [[controlled vocabulary]]) are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse.\n\nA more significant issue is that most EHRs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voice-recognition capabilities. A large part of the clinician's interaction with the EHR involves navigation through the user interface using menus, and tab/button clicks, and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse: voice-based navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits. By contrast, many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice \"macros\", where the use of certain phrases \u2013 e.g., \"normal report\", will automatically fill in a large number of default values and/or generate boilerplate, which will vary with the type of the exam \u2013 e.g., a chest X-ray vs. a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system.\n\nAs an alternative to this navigation by hand, cascaded use of speech recognition and [[information extraction]] has been studied<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suominen |first1=Hanna |last2=Zhou |first2=Liyuan |last3=Hanlen |first3=Leif |last4=Ferraro |first4=Gabriela |year=2015 |title=Benchmarking Clinical Speech Recognition and Information Extraction: New Data, Methods, and Evaluations |journal=JMIR Medical Informatics |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e19 |doi=10.2196/medinform.4321 |pmid=25917752 |pmc=4427705}}</ref> as a way to fill out a handover form for clinical proofing and sign-off. The results are encouraging, and the paper also opens data, together with the related performance benchmarks and some processing software, to the research and development community for studying clinical documentation and language-processing.\n\n====Therapeutic use====\nProlonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with [[word processor]]s has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in [[brain AVM]] patients who have been treated with [[Resection (surgery)|resection]]. Further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose AVMs have been treated using radiologic techniques.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Military===\n\n====High-performance fighter aircraft====\nSubstantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in [[fighter aircraft]]. Of particular note have been the US program in speech recognition for the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#Technology demonstrators, and test variants#Flight control variants#F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration|Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)]]/[[F-16]] aircraft ([[F-16 VISTA]]), the program in France for [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] aircraft, and other programs in the UK dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms. In these programs, speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft, with applications including: setting radio frequencies, commanding an autopilot system, setting steer-point coordinates and weapons release parameters, and controlling flight display.\n\nWorking with Swedish pilots flying in the [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|JAS-39]] Gripen cockpit, Englund (2004) found recognition deteriorated with increasing [[g-force|g-loads]]. The report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly. Contrary to what might have been expected, no effects of the broken English of the speakers were found. It was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer, as might have been expected. A restricted vocabulary, and above all, a proper syntax, could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially.<ref>{{cite thesis|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/1664.pdf|title=Speech recognition in the JAS&nbsp;39 Gripen aircraft: Adaptation to speech at different G-loads|first=Christine |last=Englund |publisher=[[Stockholm University|Stockholm Royal Institute of Technology]] |type=Masters thesis |year=2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002002102/http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/1664.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], currently in service with the UK [[RAF]], employs a speaker-dependent system, requiring each pilot to create a template. The system is not used for any safety-critical or weapon-critical tasks, such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage, but is used for a wide range of other cockpit functions. Voice commands are confirmed by visual and/or aural feedback. The system is seen as a major design feature in the reduction of pilot [[workload]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurofighter.com/the-aircraft#cockpit|title=The Cockpit |website=Eurofighter Typhoon |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301222529/https://www.eurofighter.com/the-aircraft#cockpit |archivedate=1 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and even allows the pilot to assign targets to his aircraft with two simple voice commands or to any of his wingmen with only five commands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofighter.com/capabilities/technology/voice-throttle-stick/direct-voice-input.html |title=Eurofighter Typhoon \u2013 The world's most advanced fighter aircraft |website=www.eurofighter.com |accessdate=1 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511025203/http://www.eurofighter.com/capabilities/technology/voice-throttle-stick/direct-voice-input.html |archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSpeaker-independent systems are also being developed and are under test for the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F35 Lightning II]] (JSF) and the [[Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master]] lead-in fighter trainer. These systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of 98%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071861|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020030310/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071861|archivedate=20 October 2007|first=John|last=Schutte|title=Researchers fine-tune F-35 pilot-aircraft speech system|date=15 October 2007|publisher=United States Air Force}}</ref>\n\n====Helicopters====\nThe problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise pertain strongly to the [[helicopter]] environment as well as to the jet fighter environment. The acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment, not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot, in general, does not wear a [[Fighter pilot helmet|facemask]], which would reduce acoustic noise in the [[microphone]]. Substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters, notably by the [[U.S. Army]] Avionics Research and Development Activity (AVRADA) and by the Royal Aerospace Establishment ([[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]]) in the UK. Work in France has included speech recognition in the [[Puma helicopter]]. There has also been much useful work in [[Canada]]. Results have been encouraging, and voice applications have included: control of communication radios, setting of [[navigation]] systems, and control of an automated target handover system.\n\nAs in fighter applications, the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness. Encouraging results are reported for the AVRADA tests, although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment. Much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall [[speech technology]] in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings.\n\n====Training air traffic controllers====\nTraining for air traffic controllers (ATC) represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems. Many ATC training systems currently require a person to act as a \"pseudo-pilot\", engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller, which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real ATC situation. Speech recognition and [[speech synthesis|synthesis]] techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as pseudo-pilot, thus reducing training and support personnel. In theory, Air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller, hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible. In practice, this is rarely the case. The FAA document 7110.65 details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers. While this document gives less than 150 examples of such phrases, the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of 500,000.\n\nThe USAF, USMC, US Army, US Navy, and FAA as well as a number of international ATC training organizations such as the Royal Australian Air Force and Civil Aviation Authorities in Italy, Brazil, and Canada are currently using ATC simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Telephony and other domains===\nASR is now commonplace in the field of [[telephony]] and is becoming more widespread in the field of [[computer gaming]] and simulation. In telephony systems, ASR is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with [[IVR]] systems. Despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing, in the field of document production, ASR has not seen the expected increases in use.\n\nThe improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in [[smartphone]]s. Speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface, for creating predefined or custom speech commands.\n\n=== Usage in education and daily life ===\nFor [[language learning]], speech recognition can be useful for learning a [[second language]]. It can teach proper pronunciation, in addition to helping a person develop fluency with their speaking skills.<ref>{{cite web | last = Cerf | first = Vinton | last2 = Wrubel | first2 = Rob | last3 = Sherwood | first3 = Susan | title = Can speech-recognition software break down educational language barriers? | url = http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/speech-recognition-software-language-barriers | url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065245/http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/speech-recognition-software-language-barriers | archivedate=7 April 2014 | website=Curiosity.com | publisher = Discovery Communications | accessdate = 26 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nStudents who are blind (see [[Blindness and education]]) or have very low vision can benefit from using the technology to convey words and then hear the computer recite them, as well as use a computer by commanding with their voice, instead of having to look at the screen and keyboard.<ref name=brainline>{{cite web|title=Speech Recognition for Learning|publisher=National Center for Technology Innovation|year=2010|url=http://www.brainline.org/content/2010/12/speech-recognition-for-learning_pageall.html|accessdate=26 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413100513/http://www.brainline.org/content/2010/12/speech-recognition-for-learning_pageall.html|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><!--second host of same journal, if this becomes deadlink: http://www.ldonline.org/article/38655/ -->\n\nStudents who are physically disabled or suffer from [[Repetitive strain injury]]/other injuries to the upper extremities can be relieved from having to worry about handwriting, typing, or working with scribe on school assignments by using speech-to-text programs.

Other measures of accuracy include [[Single Word Error Rate]] (SWER) and [[Command Success Rate]] (CSR).\n\nSpeech recognition by machine is a very complex problem, however. Vocalizations vary in terms of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed. Speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics. Accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following:<ref>National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"[http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/publications/ASRhistory/ The History of Automatic Speech Recognition Evaluation at NIST] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008210040/http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/publications/ASRhistory/ |date=8 October 2013 }}\".</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n* Vocabulary size and confusability\n* Speaker dependence versus independence\n* Isolated, discontinuous or continuous speech\n* Task and language constraints\n* Read versus spontaneous speech\n* Adverse conditions\n\n===Accuracy===\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors:\n* Error rates increase as the vocabulary size grows: \n::e.g. the 10 digits \"zero\" to \"nine\" can be recognized essentially perfectly, but vocabulary sizes of 200, 5000 or 100000 may have error rates of 3%, 7% or 45% respectively.\n* Vocabulary is hard to recognize if it contains confusing words:\n::e.g. the 26 letters of the English alphabet are difficult to discriminate because they are confusing words (most notoriously, the E-set: \"B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z\"); an 8% error rate is considered good for this vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* Speaker dependence vs. independence:\n::A speaker-dependent system is intended for use by a single speaker.\n::A speaker-independent system is intended for use by any speaker (more difficult).\n* Isolated, Discontinuous or continuous speech\n::With isolated speech, single words are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech.\nWith discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech. <br />\nWith continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used, therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech, different from both isolated and discontinuous speech.\n\n* Task and language constraints\n**e.g. Querying application may dismiss the hypothesis \"The apple is red.\"\n**e.g. Constraints may be semantic; rejecting \"The apple is angry.\"\n**e.g. Syntactic; rejecting \"Red is apple the.\"\n\nConstraints are often represented by a grammar. \n* Read vs. Spontaneous Speech \u2013 When a person reads it's usually in a context that has been previously prepared, but when a person uses spontaneous speech, it is difficult to recognize the speech because of the disfluencies (like \"uh\" and \"um\", false starts, incomplete sentences, stuttering, coughing, and laughter) and limited vocabulary. \n* Adverse conditions \u2013 Environmental noise (e.g. Noise in a car or a factory). Acoustical distortions (e.g. echoes, room acoustics)\nSpeech recognition is a multi-leveled pattern recognition task.\n* Acoustical signals are structured into a hierarchy of units, e.g. [[Phoneme]]s, Words, Phrases, and Sentences;\n* Each level provides additional constraints;\ne.g. Known word pronunciations or legal word sequences, which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at lower level;\n* This hierarchy of constraints are exploited. By combining decisions probabilistically at all lower levels, and making more deterministic decisions only at the highest level, speech recognition by a machine is a process broken into several phases. Computationally, it is a problem in which a sound pattern has to be recognized or classified into a category that represents a meaning to a human. Every acoustic signal can be broken in smaller more basic sub-signals. As the more complex sound signal is broken into the smaller sub-sounds, different levels are created, where at the top level we have complex sounds, which are made of simpler sounds on lower level, and going to lower levels even more, we create more basic and shorter and simpler sounds. The lowest level, where the sounds are the most fundamental, a machine would check for simple and more probabilistic rules of what sound should represent. Once these sounds are put together into more complex sound on upper level, a new set of more deterministic rules should predict what new complex sound should represent. The most upper level of a deterministic rule should figure out the meaning of complex expressions. In order to expand our knowledge about speech recognition we need to take into a consideration neural networks. There are four steps of neural network approaches: \n* Digitize the speech that we want to recognize\nFor telephone speech the sampling rate is 8000 samples per second; \n* Compute features of spectral-domain of the speech (with Fourier transform);\ncomputed every 10&nbsp;ms, with one 10&nbsp;ms section called a frame;\n\nAnalysis of four-step neural network approaches can be explained by further information. Sound is produced by air (or some other medium) vibration, which we register by ears, but machines by receivers. Basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions: [[amplitude]] (how strong is it), and [[frequency]] (how often it vibrates per second).\nAccuracy can be computed with the help of word error rate (WER). Word error rate can be calculated by aligning the recognized word and referenced word using dynamic string alignment. The problem may occur while computing the word error rate due to the difference between the sequence lengths of recognized word and referenced word. \nLet, S be the number of substitutions,\n  D be the number of deletions,\n  I be the number of insertions,\n  N be the number of word references.\nThe formula to compute the word error rate(WER) is \n       WER = (S+D+I)\u00f7N\nWhile computing the word recognition rate (WRR) word error rate (WER) is used and the formula is \n       WRR = 1- WER\n           = (N-S-D-I)\u00f7 N = (H-I)\u00f7N\nHere H is the number of correctly recognized words. H= N-(S+D).\n\n===Security concerns===\nSpeech recognition can become a means of attack, theft, or accidental operation. For example, activation words like \"Alexa\" spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately, or possibly take an unwanted action.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469383361/listen-up-your-ai-assistant-goes-crazy-for-npr-too |title=Listen Up: Your AI Assistant Goes Crazy For NPR Too |work=[[NPR]] |date=6 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723210358/http://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469383361/listen-up-your-ai-assistant-goes-crazy-for-npr-too |archivedate=23 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Voice-controlled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building, or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside.

It was introduced at the 1997 [[Tokyo Motor Show]], as the concept car \"J\u2013MW.\" It went on sale April 24, 1998, with Honda series codes GA4 and GA6. On September 16, 1999 a version in four wheel drive of the Capa was released, using Honda's ''FullTime'' fourwheel drive system. \n\n[[Brake Assist]] was offered as standard equipment. Due to disappointing sales, the nameplate Capa was discontinued in 2002. It was available in Japan through  ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Primo]]'' and ''Honda Verno'' dealerships.\n\n==General information==\nAs the first generation of the 'J Mover' Series, the Honda Capa was developed on the [[Honda Logo]] platform. Its concept was based on a 'Small is Smart' way of thinking. Ease of use in everyday life, compactness, lightness and friendliness to the environment were some of the criteria built into the design. The proposal was that the Capa was to be 'Joyful' however this translates better as 'fun.' \n\nIt was one class larger than the ''kei'' sized [[Honda Life]], but smaller than the compact sized, [[Honda CR-V]] which based on the [[Honda Civic]] platform, and reflected the growing popularity of [[Mini MPV|MPV]]/[[SUV]]/[[minivan]] vehicles.\n\nThe Honda Capa was designed with the intention of creating a car that was to be the best size for town driving.

It was introduced at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show as the concept car \"J-MW.\" It went on sale April 24, 1998, with Honda series codes GA4 and GA6. On September 16, 1999 a 4WD version of the Capa was released, using Honda's Full-Time four-wheel-drive system. [[Brake Assist]] was offered as standard equipment. Due to disappointing sales the Capa nameplate was discontinued in 2002. It was available in Japan through  ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Primo]]'' and ''Honda Verno'' dealerships.\n\n==General information==\nAs the first generation of the 'J Mover' Series, the Honda Capa was developed on the [[Honda Logo]] platform. Its concept was based on a 'Small is Smart' way of thinking. Ease of use in everyday life, compactness, lightness and friendliness to the environment were some of the criteria built into the design. The proposal was that the Capa was to be 'Joyful' however this translates better as 'fun.' It was one class larger than the ''kei'' sized [[Honda Life]], but smaller than the compact sized, [[Honda CR-V]] which based on the [[Honda Civic]] platform, and reflected the growing popularity of [[Mini MPV|MPV]]/[[SUV]]/[[minivan]] vehicles.\n\nThe Honda Capa was designed with the intention of creating a car that was to be the best size for town driving. A car that could seat your family, with ample height for headroom and plenty of legroom considering its compact nature. To achieve this feat, Honda design the chassis based on a 'dual deck package.'\n\nThe Honda Capa was equipped with a 1.5-litre single-overhead-cam four-valve inline four-cylinder D15B engine. It was initially offered only with Honda's Multimatic [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), but following an update, a regular 4-speed automatic transmission option was introduced as a lower cost option on front-wheel-drive versions.\n\n==Engine==\n\n* Water-cooled, inline four-cylinder [[Honda D engine#D15B|Honda D15B]] engine\n* Single Overhead Cam 16-valve\n* Power output of {{convert|98|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6300&nbsp;rpm\n* Torque output of {{convert|13.6|kgm|Nm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} at 3500&nbsp;rpm\n* Bore x Stroke: 75&nbsp;mm x 74.5&nbsp;mm\n* Compression Ration: 9.4:1\n* Honda's PGM-FI Fuel Injection System\n* Fuel: Regular Unleaded\n* Fuel Tank size: {{convert|40|l|USgal}}\n\n==GA4/6 model updates==\n*1997 - Displayed at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] as the J-MW\n*1998 - Announced that sales would begin April 24, 1998\n*1999 - Minor update on model.

At the time of the original launch, only petrol engines were available. \n\nIn April 1990, the turbodiesel followed, and then the naturally aspirated diesel was added in the autumn of 1990.<ref name=\"salon91\">{{Cite journal | ref = s91 | editor-last = Bellu | editor-first = Ren\u00e9 | date = September 1990 | title = Salon: Toutes les Voitures du Monde 90/91 | issue = 14 & 15 | page = 145 | publisher = Homme N\u00b01 | journal = l'Auto Journal | location = Paris | language = fr }}</ref> High equipment levels, a luxurious interior, a smooth ride, and exceptional handling were strong points for the 605. \n\nBut [[Peugeot]] had always struggled to succeed with large cars outside France, and the 605 was no different.

The naturally aspirated diesel was discontinued at this time, as the new [[Peugeot 406|406]] was placed to supplant the lower specification 605s.\n\nPerformance and handling were improved as well, and many of the reliability issues were solved. Technological advances were made, most remarkably the side airbags, although sales remained low.\n\nAfter the launch of the well received [[Peugeot 406]] (that was larger than the 405 it replaced) in 1995, 605 sales dropped to near insignificant levels, and it was quietly dropped in September 1999. The 605's successor, the [[Peugeot 607]], was launched in the autumn of 1999, and was slightly more successful on the domestic and export markets.\n\nThe end of 605 production in 1999 spelled the end of the \"05\" generation [[Peugeot]]s in [[Europe]] after more than twenty years, this generation had started in 1977, with the [[Peugeot 305|305]].\n\n==Design and styling==\nIts appearance resembles that of the [[Alfa Romeo 164]], launched on 7 February 1987, and also styled by [[Pininfarina]].<ref name=\"thetruthaboutcars.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/01/curbside-classic-1991-alfa-romeo-164/|title=Curbside Classic: 1991 Alfa Romeo 164|accessdate=2011-11-28|work=thetruthaboutcars.com}}</ref> \n\nDespite the resemblance, the Peugeot did not use the [[Type Four platform|Type Four]] platform; it rode the same platform as the [[Citro\u00ebn XM]].<ref name=\"ateupwithmotor.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://ateupwithmotor.com/luxury-and-personal-luxury-cars/169-alfa-romeo-164-type-four-cars.html|title=Four of a Kind: The Alfa Romeo 164 and the \"Type Four\" Cars|accessdate=2011-11-28|work=ateupwithmotor.com}}</ref> As it closely followed Peugeot's [[design language]] of the time, the 605 bears a strong visual resemblance to the smaller [[Peugeot 405]], this was generally considered to harm the 605 in the marketplace, as the car was not distinguished enough from its lower cost brethren.<ref name=\"s91.68\">[[#s91|''Salon 90/91'']], p. 68</ref>\n\n==Engines==\n[[File:Peugeot 605 V6 engine.JPG|thumb|right|Peugeot 605 V6 12V (petrol engine)]]\nEight petrol engines were offered during the 605's lifetime:\n* 2.0 litre 8 valve carbureted inline four, {{convert|84|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.0 litre 8 valve fuel injected inline four, {{convert|79|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.0 litre 8 valve fuel injected inline four, {{convert|89|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} \u2013 a non catalyzed version available in many markets produces {{convert|94|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=im91>{{cite magazine | magazine = Intan Motor | title = Produk Baru: Peugeot 605 SRi, cuma rp 120 juta | trans-title = New Product: Peugeot 605 SRi, only 120 million rupiah | date = 1991-10-02 | issn = 0215-7713 | number = 91 | publisher = Yayasan Beraya Press | location = Jakarta | language = id | editor-last = Mustmar | editor-first = Andi | pages = 8-9 }}</ref>\n* 2.0 litre 8 valve fuel injected turbocharged inline four, {{convert|108|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.0 litre 16 valve fuel injected inline four, {{convert|97|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 3.0 litre 12 valve fuel injected V6, {{convert|123|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 3.0 litre 24 valve fuel injected V6, {{convert|147|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 3.0 litre 24 valve fuel injected V6, {{convert|142|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n\nAs well as three diesel engines:\n* 2.1 litre 12 valve normally aspirated inline four, indirect injection, {{convert|60|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.1 litre 12 valve turbocharged inline four, indirect injection, {{convert|80|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.5 litre 12 valve turbocharged inline four, indirect injection, {{convert|95|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n\nThe carbureted four cylinder petrol engine and the normally aspirated diesel (which arrived for the model year of 1991), though reliable, were generally considered to be simply over matched by the car's weight.

In the beginning of 1993, all PRV V6 engines lost 12&nbsp;cc of engine displacement, in order to fit in a lower taxation class in Switzerland.\n\nThe same issue affected the top of the range V6 24 version, in spite of its all new twenty four valve cylinder head, though a top speed of 235&nbsp;km/h (146&nbsp;mph) made poor fuel economy more acceptable to generally well heeled customers. The 2.1 turbo diesel was widely regarded {{Whom?|date=November 2010}} as a good powertrain, but was outclassed by the new [[fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] engines introduced in 1988 by [[Audi]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nA 2.0 litre (8 valve) turbocharged four cylinder petrol engine (150&nbsp;PS) was added in 1991, and provided good performance, but proved unreliable. Later, a 2.5 turbodiesel (130&nbsp;bhp) completed the diesel lineup.

At the time of the original launch, only petrol engines were available. \n\nIn April 1990, the turbodiesel followed, and then the naturally aspirated diesel was added in autumn 1990.<ref name=\"salon91\">{{Cite journal | ref = s91 | editor-last = Bellu | editor-first = Ren\u00e9 | date = September 1990 | title = Salon: Toutes les Voitures du Monde 90/91 | issue = 14 & 15 | page = 145 | publisher = Homme N\u00b01 | journal = l'Auto Journal | location = Paris | language = fr }}</ref>\n\nHigh equipment levels, a luxurious interior, a smooth ride, and exceptional handling were strong points for the 605. But [[Peugeot]] had always struggled to succeed with large cars outside France, and the 605 was no different. It was too similar in design and appearance to the smaller [[Peugeot 405]] to command a price premium, while its dashboard also drew criticism for its uninspired design. \n\n[[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]], like [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]]/[[Opel]], has not been able to address the \"luxury brand\" issue effectively, the automobile market seems to reward [[Market segment|segmentation]] by brands from one factory, like [[Lexus]]/[[Toyota]], [[Acura]]/[[Honda]], and [[Audi]]/[[Volkswagen]].\n\nAlso like the XM, the 605 initially suffered from quality issues that resulted in numerous breakdowns or malfunctions (particularly with the ambitious electrics).<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.autonews.com/article/19960513/SUB/605130802/peugeot-plans-706-successor-to-605-sedan | title = Peugeot plans '706' successor to 605 sedan | work = Automotive News | date = 1996-05-13 | last = Kable | first = Greg | publisher = Crain Communications, Inc. }}</ref> An extensive recall operation took place at great cost, in which most of the engine room wiring and exhaust system (as well as numerous other parts) were exchanged, but by then the damage to the car's reputation had been done.\n\nIn 1995, Peugeot tried to solve the problems by unveiling an extensively revamped 605 (known as the \"Phase 2\" model); it received a facelift which looked modern at its time, but also the interior was vastly improved by giving it more ergonomic controls and a refreshed look. The naturally aspirated diesel was discontinued at this time, as the new [[Peugeot 406|406]] was placed to supplant the lower specification 605s.\n\nPerformance and handling were improved as well, and many of the reliability issues were solved. Technological advances were made, most remarkably the side airbags, although sales remained low.\n\nAfter the launch of the well received [[Peugeot 406]] (that was larger than the 405 it replaced) in 1995, 605 sales dropped to near insignificant levels, and it was quietly dropped in September 1999. The 605's successor, the [[Peugeot 607]], was launched in the autumn of 1999, and was slightly more successful on the domestic and export markets.\n\nThe end of 605 production in 1999 spelled the end of the \"05\" generation [[Peugeot]]s in [[Europe]] after more than twenty years, this generation had started in 1977, with the [[Peugeot 305|305]].\n\n==Design and styling==\nIts appearance resembles that of the [[Alfa Romeo 164]], launched in 1987, and also styled by [[Pininfarina]].<ref name=\"thetruthaboutcars.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/01/curbside-classic-1991-alfa-romeo-164/|title=Curbside Classic: 1991 Alfa Romeo 164|accessdate=2011-11-28|work=thetruthaboutcars.com}}</ref> Despite the resemblance, the Peugeot did not use the [[Type Four platform|Type Four]] platform; it rode the same platform as the [[Citro\u00ebn XM]].<ref name=\"ateupwithmotor.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://ateupwithmotor.com/luxury-and-personal-luxury-cars/169-alfa-romeo-164-type-four-cars.html|title=Four of a Kind: The Alfa Romeo 164 and the \"Type Four\" Cars|accessdate=2011-11-28|work=ateupwithmotor.com}}</ref> As it closely followed Peugeot's [[design language]] of the time, the 605 bears a strong visual resemblance to the smaller [[Peugeot 405]], this was generally considered to harm the 605 in the marketplace, as the car was not distinguished enough from its lower cost brethren.<ref name=\"s91.68\">[[#s91|''Salon 90/91'']], p. 68</ref>\n\n==Engines==\n[[File:Peugeot 605 V6 engine.JPG|thumb|right|Peugeot 605 V6 12V (petrol engine)]]\nEight petrol engines were offered during the 605's lifetime:\n* 2.0 litre 8 valve carbureted inline four, {{convert|84|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.0 litre 8 valve fuel injected inline four, {{convert|79|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.0 litre 8 valve fuel injected inline four, {{convert|89|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} \u2013 a non catalyzed version available in many markets produces {{convert|94|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=im91>{{cite magazine | magazine = Intan Motor | title = Produk Baru: Peugeot 605 SRi, cuma rp 120 juta | trans-title = New Product: Peugeot 605 SRi, only 120 million rupiah | date = 1991-10-02 | issn = 0215-7713 | number = 91 | publisher = Yayasan Beraya Press | location = Jakarta | language = id | editor-last = Mustmar | editor-first = Andi | pages = 8-9 }}</ref>\n* 2.0 litre 8 valve fuel injected turbocharged inline four, {{convert|108|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.0 litre 16 valve fuel injected inline four, {{convert|97|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 3.0 litre 12 valve fuel injected V6, {{convert|123|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 3.0 litre 24 valve fuel injected V6, {{convert|147|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 3.0 litre 24 valve fuel injected V6, {{convert|142|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n\nAs well as three diesel engines:\n* 2.1 litre 12 valve normally aspirated inline four, indirect injection, {{convert|60|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.1 litre 12 valve turbocharged inline four, indirect injection, {{convert|80|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n* 2.5 litre 12 valve turbocharged inline four, indirect injection, {{convert|95|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}\n\nThe carbureted four cylinder petrol engine and the normally aspirated diesel (which arrived for the model year of 1991), though reliable, were generally considered to be simply over matched by the car's weight.

He was the fifth-born child in a family of thirteen children who lived on the border between [[Mozambique]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]]. He attended Gwenzi Primary School, a satellite of [[Mount Selinda]] Mission, that was established by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (now [http://esango.un.org/irene/?page=viewProfile&type=ngo&nr=1517&section=9 United Church of Christ Board for World Ministries]<ref>{{Cite web|title = CSO Net \u2013 Civil Society Network|url = http://esango.un.org/irene/?page=viewProfile&type=ngo&nr=1517&section=9|website = esango.un.org|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref>) in 1893. In 1955 he enrolled at and walked the twenty-five miles between Chikore Secondary School and his family's modest home in [[Mount Selinda]] at the beginning and end of every school term, carrying his wooden suitcase on his head through rivers and over mountains. After completing the Rhodesia Junior Certificate, in 1958 Mafico  enrolled to take the Cambridge School Certificate at Hartzell Secondary School near the city of [[Mutare]]\u2014in those colonial days the British education system being dominant. He paid his way through school by doing menial work after school. With the mentoring of Rev. John C. Heinrich, who was the superintendent of the American Board Mission (ABM) churches in Rhodesia, Mafico in 1960 embarked on his theological education at Epworth Theological School (now United Theological College) in [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]]. He was the first student to attend seminary with so much as a high school certificate. Following graduation in December 1962, Mafico was appointed pastor of the urban church of the [[United Church of Christ]] (formerly ABM), a church deliberately led by non-colonial, non-missionary non-elite persons who had not been educated in Europe but in Africa and who worshipped in the Shona language rather than English. In 1968 he enrolled at the [http://www.london.ac.uk/ University of London] (Rhodesia campus), and in 1970 he graduated as the first Rhodesian pastor to earn a bachelor's degree majoring in religious studies and history. Upon graduation, he taught Religious Knowledge, and was the first black school chaplain at Chikore High School; previously that position was held by white men who were part of the Western missionary apparatus.\n\n==Later years==\nIn August 1971, Mafico enrolled at [[Harvard Divinity School]] to pursue a master's degree in theology ([[Master of Theology|Th.M.]]), which he earned in 1973. He concurrently enrolled in the Ph.D. program in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]]. He graduated with both the M.A. (1977) and Ph.D. (1979), majoring in Old Testament/Hebrew Bible and history of the ancient Near East. He began teaching in the Department of Religious Studies, Classics, and Philosophy at the [[University of Zimbabwe]] in May 1979. In addition to teaching, Dr. Mafico served as the university's first chaplain. He introduced classical Hebrew into the curriculum, and mentored several students who are now renowned scholars like [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dora-mbuwayesango-34028121 Dora Mbuwayesango] and Robert Wafawanaka. He founded the University Evening School and became its first principal with a mission to enable ex-combatants to complete their high school education following Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. Among his graduates is the former vice president of Zimbabwe, Dr. [[Joice Mujuru|Joyce Mujuru]]. Currently, Mafico is distinguished professor of Old Testament/Hebrew Bible at [[Interdenominational Theological Center]] (ITC), Manicaland Development Council (MDC)(rural development), University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Choir Director, and United Church of Christ (UCC) Minister, this now worshipping in both English and various African languages. \n\n== Administration ==\nMafico has held many positions at [[Interdenominational Theological Center|ITC]], including: chair of Area I: Biblical Studies and Languages; chair of Doctor of Ministries (DMin, 1992\u201394) degree program; associate vice president for academic services/associate provost  (2003\u201310) and moved on to become vice president for academic services/provost (2011\u20132015). He resigned from administrative leadership in July 2015 to return to teaching. He now serves as the Theologian in Residence for the D.Min. degree program. He is also the editor of the ''Journal of the Interdenominational Theological Center'' (JITC) and the occasional book publications. Mafico served on the editorial Board of the ''Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages'' (1994\u20132006), and at the 2016 Biennial Meeting of The Association of Theological Studies of North America and Canada, he was elected to the ''Theological Education'' editorial board.\n\n==Honors and awards==\nInducted in the Theta Phi Honor Society (1995); twice nominated by ITC students as the best professor of the year (1994, 1997); awarded a plaque jointly by the board of trustees and ITC for his distinguished service as ITC provost and his long teaching and administrative career (Commencement 2015)\n\n===Membership in educational societies===\n* [[Society for the Study of Black Religion]]\n* [[Society of Biblical Literature]]\n* [http://www.harvardclubga.org/ Harvard Club of Georgia]\n* [http://www.itc.edu/inauguration Biblical Studies Club]\n* [http://www.itc.edu/inauguration Theta Phi Honors Association]\n\n==Spiritual pilgrimages==\nIn 1994, Mafico led the first of many international pilgrimages for spiritual renewal to [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Israel]], [[Greece]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

He was the fifth-born child in a family of thirteen children who lived on the border between [[Mozambique]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]]. He attended Gwenzi Primary School, a satellite of [[Mount Selinda]] Mission, that was established by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (now [http://esango.un.org/irene/?page=viewProfile&type=ngo&nr=1517&section=9 United Church of Christ Board for World Ministries]<ref>{{Cite web|title = CSO Net \u2013 Civil Society Network|url = http://esango.un.org/irene/?page=viewProfile&type=ngo&nr=1517&section=9|website = esango.un.org|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref>) in 1893. In 1955 he enrolled at and walked the twenty-five miles between Chikore Secondary School and his family's modest home in [[Mount Selinda]] at the beginning and end of every school term, carrying his wooden suitcase on his head through rivers and over mountains. After completing the Rhodesia Junior Certificate, in 1958 Mafico  enrolled to take the Cambridge School Certificate at Hartzell Secondary School near the city of [[Mutare]]\u2014in those colonial days the British education system being dominant. He paid his way through school by doing menial work after school. With the mentoring of Rev. John C. Heinrich, who was the superintendent of the American Board Mission (ABM) churches in Rhodesia, Mafico in 1960 embarked on his theological education at Epworth Theological School (now United Theological College) in [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]]. He was the first student to attend seminary with so much as a high school certificate. Following graduation in December 1962, Mafico was appointed pastor of the urban church of the [[United Church of Christ]] (formerly ABM), a church deliberately led by non-colonial, non-missionary non-elite persons who had not been educated in Europe but in Africa and who worshipped in the Shona language rather than English. In 1968 he enrolled at the [http://www.london.ac.uk/ University of London] (Rhodesia campus), and in 1970 he graduated as the first Rhodesian pastor to earn a bachelor's degree majoring in religious studies and history. Upon graduation, he taught Religious Knowledge, and was the first black school chaplain at Chikore High School; previously that position was held by white men who were part of the Western missionary apparatus.\n\n==Later years==\nIn August 1971, Mafico enrolled at [[Harvard Divinity School]] to pursue a master's degree in theology ([[Master of Theology|Th.M.]]), which he earned in 1973. He concurrently enrolled in the Ph.D. program in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]]. He graduated with both the M.A. (1977) and Ph.D. (1979), majoring in Old Testament/Hebrew Bible and history of the ancient Near East. He began teaching in the Department of Religious Studies, Classics, and Philosophy at the [[University of Zimbabwe]] in May 1979. In addition to teaching, Dr. Mafico served as the University's first chaplain. He introduced classical Hebrew into the curriculum, and mentored several students who are now renowned scholars like [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dora-mbuwayesango-34028121 Dora Mbuwayesango] and Robert Wafawanaka. He founded the University Evening School and became its first Principal with a mission to enable ex-combatants to complete their high school education following Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. Among his graduates is the former vice president of Zimbabwe, Dr. [[Joice Mujuru|Joyce Mujuru]]. Currently, Mafico is distinguished professor of Old Testament/Hebrew Bible at [[Interdenominational Theological Center]] (ITC), Manicaland Development Council (MDC)(rural development), University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Choir Director, and United Church of Christ (UCC) Minister, this now worshipping in both English and various African languages. \n\n== Administration ==\nMafico has held many positions at [[Interdenominational Theological Center|ITC]] including: Chair of Area I: Biblical Studies and Languages; Chair of Doctor of Ministries (DMin, 1992\u201394) degree program; associate vice president for academic services/associate provost  (2003\u201310) and moved on to become vice president for academic services/provost (2011-2015). He resigned from administrative leadership in July 2015 to return to teaching. He now serves as the Theologian in Residence for the D.Min. degree program. He is also the editor of the ''Journal of the Interdenominational Theological Center'' (JITC) and the occasional book publications. Mafico served on the editorial Board of the ''Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages'' (1994\u20132006), and at the 2016 Biennial Meeting of The Association of Theological Studies of North America and Canada, he was elected to the ''Theological Education'' editorial board.\n\n==Honors and awards==\nInducted in the Theta Phi Honor Society (1995); twice nominated by ITC students as the best professor of the year (1994, 1997); awarded a plaque jointly by the Board of Trustees and ITC for his distinguished service as ITC provost and his long teaching and administrative career (Commencement 2015)\n\n===Membership in educational societies===\n* [[Society for the Study of Black Religion]]\n* [[Society of Biblical Literature]]\n* [http://www.harvardclubga.org/ Harvard Club of Georgia]\n* [http://www.itc.edu/inauguration Biblical Studies Club]\n* [http://www.itc.edu/inauguration Theta Phi Honors Association]\n\n==Spiritual pilgrimages==\nIn 1994, Mafico led the first of many international pilgrimages for spiritual renewal to [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Israel]], [[Greece]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

They are differentiated from another part of the community, known in this context as the [[Northists]]. Today there are about 300,000 Knanaya in India and elsewhere.{{sfn|Fahlbusch|2008|p=286}}\n\nThe origins of the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Northist and Southist groups are unclear. Various traditions trace it back to the arrival of the [[Syrian]] merchant [[Thomas of Cana]] (Kn\u0101i Thoma) who led a migration of endogamous [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] [[Syriac Christians]] (possibly{{Weasel inline|date=April 2020}} of [[Jewish]] origin) to India in the 4th or 8th century. The Knanaya claim descent from Thomas of Cana and those who came with him. The ethnic division between the Knanaya and other St. Thomas Christians was present by the time of the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonization]] in the 16th century and was noted throughout the [[Colonial India|European colonial era]].\n\nToday, the majority of Knanaya are members of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Catholic]]) and the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church]] ([[Oriental Orthodox]]). They became increasingly prominent in Kerala in the late 19th century. Many Knanaya migrated away during the 20th and 21st centuries, largely westward, forming communities in non-Malayalam speaking areas, with a large expatriate community currently living in Houston, Texas and [[Chicago]], Illinois, United States.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Thomas of Cana.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana]]\nThe term ''Kn\u0101n\u0101ya'' derives from the name [[Thomas of Cana|Kn\u0101i Thoma]] ([[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as Thomas of Cana), an important figure in the Saint Thomas Christian tradition.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}} The term is derived from Thomas' [[Syriac language|Syriac]] adjectival epithet Kn\u0101'n\u0101ya in reference to the land of [[Canaan]] and is defined as meaning \"Those of Canaan\".{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=85}} The earliest written record of the term used as a designation of the community dates to the 1800s, however notations of the term itself are found in Knanaya folk songs such as the song of the erection of Kallisserry Church in 1580.{{sfn|Luke|1911|p=72}}{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=85}}  Members of the Knanaya Community are also generally called Kn\u0101i or Kn\u0101, in reference to Thomas. Many Knanaya families, especially those of the [[Kaduthuruthy]] region maintain the surname Kin\u0101n, a derivative of Thomas\u2019 epithet. Woman of these families preserve gendered forms of the term, examples of this being Kin\u0101ti Anna, Kin\u0101ti Mariam, etc.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=1}}\n\nThe ultimate derivation of Thomas' English epithet ''Cana'' is not clear: it may refer to the town of [[Cana]], which is mentioned in the [[Bible]], or it may instead refer to the land of [[Canaan]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}}Alternately, it may be a corruption of a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] term for merchant (''Kn\u0101yil'' in Malayalam).{{sfn|Neill|2004|p=42}} However, scholar Richard M. Swiderski states that none of these etymologies are entirely sound.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}} Knanaya priest and scholar Jacob Kollaparambil argues that the \"Cana\" form is a corruption introduced by European scholars in the 18th century based on the [[Malayalam]] form ''Kn\u0101y'' and its variants (Kn\u0101i, Kin\u0101n, Kn\u0101yi) found in the folk tradition of the Knanaya and the common parlance and literature of the people of Malabar.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|pp=1-20}} This may be a reference to the Christian community of Kynai, in B\u00e9t Aramay\u00e9 in Persia, a historical center of Syriac Christianity.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=1}} ''Knanaya'' is the spelling preferred by community members; other less common spellings include ''Cananites'' and ''Cnanites''.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nThe Knanaya are also known as ''Tekkumbhagar'' in Malayalam; this is generally translated into English as \"Southist\", or sometimes \"Southerner\" or \"Suddhist\". This is in reference to the historically significant geographical division between them and other Saint Thomas Christians, who are known as ''Vadakumbhagar'' or Northists in this context.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=73}}\n\n===Titles===\nHistorically the Knanaya held the title of being the \"protectors of seventeen castes\", an authority given to them by the [[Cheraman Perumal]] according to folk tradition. This title which was reflective of the historical high caste status of the Knanaya, is to this day exhibited during Knanaya marriage ceremonies when individuals taking part in the rituals ask permission before fulfilling their designated role. A prominent example of this is seen during the \"Chandam Charthal\" or grooms beautification ceremony, in which the barber petitions the assembly three times with the following request: \"I ask the gentlemen here who have superiority over 17 castes, may I shave the bridegroom?\".{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=470}}\n\nThe Knanaya were also known as ''Ancharapallikar'' or the \"Owners of Five and a Half churches\" a title reflective of the five churches owned by the Southist Community before the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599. The churches are listed as the following: Udayamperoor, Kaduthuruthy, Kottayam, Chunkom, and Kallissery. The \"half church\" is a reference to the half privilege and share the Knanaya held in other churches they co-owned with the Northist St. Thomas Christians, usually in areas where not many Knanaya lived.{{sfn|Vellian|2001|p=2}}\n\n==History==\n===Origins and traditions===\n[[File:Thomas of Cana and the Knanaya Depart for India.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana and the Knanaya Depart for India]]\nIt is not clear how the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Southern and Northern groups originated. The earliest extensive written evidence for the split dates to the 16th century.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=77}} The St. Thomas Christian tradition defines the division as being both geographical and ethnic, expressing that the Native St. Thomas Christians initially resided on the north side of the [[Chera Dynasty|Chera Empire's]] capitol city of Cranganore while the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya arrived and settled on the south side, which subsequently led to the designation Northist and Southist.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}} Directional divisions within communities are common in Kerala, including among Hindu groups.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201380}}{{sfn|Coward|1993|p=19}} A similar north\u2013south division is found among the [[Nairs]], and it historically appears to have been in place in the early [[Brahmin]] settlements in the area. The Saint Thomas Christians may have taken this trait from the Brahmins.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=73\u201374}} \n\n====Thomas of Cana\u2019s Expedition====\nThe historical rationale for the division between the majority St. Thomas Christians and minority Knanaya traces the divide to the figure of Thomas of Cana, a Syrian merchant who led a group of 72 [[Jewish Christians|Jewish-Christian]] immigrant families, a bishop named Uraha Mar Yausef, and clergymen from [[Mesopotamia]] to settle in  [[Cranganore]], [[India]] in the 4th century (some sources place these events as late as the 9th century).{{sfn|Baum & Winkler|2003|p=53}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|pp=60}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-26}} This story may reflect a historical migration of East Syrian Christians to India around this time, which established the region's relationship with the [[Church of the East]].{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=42\u201343}} In the commonly accepted accounts of this history, the Knanaya are the descendants of Thomas of Cana and his followers, while the Northists descend from the local Christian body which had been converted by [[Thomas the Apostle]] centuries earlier.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=74\u201376}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}} Elements of the Thomas of Cana story feature in ancient songs as well as the [[Thomas of Cana copper plates]] awarded to his followers by a local Hindu ruler.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|pp=460-461}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-26}}{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|p=52}} These plates are said to have granted Thomas\u2019 followers 72 social, economic, and religious rights from [[Cheraman Perumal]], the [[Chera]] king.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=63\u201364}} The plates were present in Kerala during the time of the Portuguese colonization in the early 17th century, but were lost during Portuguese rule.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=65\u201366}} The Knanaya invoke the plates as evidence of their descent from Thomas of Cana's mission.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=66\u201367}} This version of the Thomas of Cana narrative is the accepted history among both Knanaya and Northist scholars alike as well as scholarship in general.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Thodathil|2001|pp=111\u2013112}}\n[[File:Thomas of Cana receives privileges from Cheruman Perumal.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana Receives Privileges from Cheraman Perumal]]\n====Two Wives Legend====\nIn many other variants recorded during the colonial era, Thomas of Cana had two wives or partners, one of them being the ancestor of the endogamous Southists, and the other one being the ancestor of the Northist.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201380}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}} A number of traditions and stories have emerged to explain the status of either wife,{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=73\u201392}} and both Southists and Northists historically used variants of these traditions to claim superiority for their group.{{sfn|Baum & Winkler|2003|p=53}}\nThese variants are considered apocryphal and are not the accepted tradition among contemporary Northist and Southist scholars who generally believe them to be the consequence of rivalry between the St. Thomas Christians and Knanaya.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}} In some of these variants, the Southists' ancestor was Thomas\u2019 Syrian wife, while the Northists' was an indigenous [[Nair]] woman who became his second wife or concubine, implying that the Southists are Thomas\u2019 true heirs.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201377}} In other variants, both wives were Kerala natives, while the Southists' forebearer was from a higher caste.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=77\u201378}} More recent versions of this story downplay the importance of either wife's status, focusing instead on their descendants' marriage practices: the Northists intermarried with the natives, while the Knanaya enforced strict endogamy, maintaining a \"pure\" lineage.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nSome Northists also maintain versions of the Thomas of Cana story that counter the Knanayas' assertions. In the Northist versions, both Northists and Southists are descended from marriages between Thoma's party and indigenous Christians, but the Knanaya are descended from Syrian servants who married \"low caste\" Keralans; the Knanayas' endogamy and \"purity\" are thus borne out of their exclusion by the higher class Northists. These variants frequently trace Knanaya descent back to a ''dobi'' (washerwoman); in some versions of this story, she became Thoma's concubine, while in other she married a lower-caste [[Maaran]] boy.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=80\u201382}} This assertion is based on the 1676 Portuguese document \"M.S Sloane 2748-A\", a likely forgery attributed to the [[Discalced Carmelites|Carmelite]] priest Father Mathew.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=36}}\n\nHistorian of medieval India and Northist priest Pius Malekandathil argues that the two-wives legend was simply a creation of rivalry between the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya and the Native St. Thomas Christians. Malekandathil expresses that the story originated in the medieval era due to the two ethnic groups of Christians asserting socioeconomic dominance over the other. Furthermore,  Malekandathil notes that the two-wives legend is not the accepted tradition among the people of Kerala but instead that the indigenous Saint Thomas Christians got the appellation \"Northists\" because they were initially located on the northern part of the city of Cranganore, while the migrant Knanaya under the leadership of Thomas of Cana were given the southern side of the city which led to the generic title of \"Southists\".{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n====Jewish-Christian Claim====\nThe Knanaya strongly attest that the Syriac Christian migrants who arrived with Thomas of Cana were Jewish-Christians (endogamous Jews who converted to Syriac Christianity). This ideal is established from cultural aspects of the community such as Knanaya folk songs first written on palm-leave manuscripts in the 17th century from which the Knanaya disseminate much of their history and heritage. Many of the historical songs allude to the migrants being of Jewish descent such as the song ''Nallor Oraslem'' (The Good Jerusalem) which states the migrants prayed at the tomb of the [[Ezra|Jewish Prophet Ezra]] before departing to India. A plethora of Jewish scholars such as Dr. P.M. Jussay, Dr. Nathan Katz, Dr. Shalva Weil, and Dr. Ohpira Gamliel have all noted that the Knanaya maintain cultural similarities to Jewish communities, a factor which could allude to the communities claimed Jewish origins.{{sfn|Weil|1982|pp=175-196}}{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}}{{sfn|Gamliel|2009|pp=90}} Other scholars entirely accept the Jewish-Christian claim of the Knanaya such as Oxford historian Dr. Robert Eric Frykenberg.{{sfn|Frykenberg|2010|pp=109}}\n\nIn 1939, the Knanaya politician and author Joseph Chazhikaden published a book on the community, ''Tekkumbhagasamudayam Charitram'', in which he included some aspects of the communities Jewish claim. Chazhikaden built upon the Thomas of Cana tradition but asserted that Thomas' followers originated in [[Judea]]. According to Chazhikaden, the group converted to Christianity while maintaining their distinct culture and identity.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=95\u201396}} Eventually, they were forced out of their homeland and moved to [[Cranganore]], where they were welcomed by the ruler Cheraman Perumal and lived near, but maintained their separateness from, the indigenous \"Northist\" Saint Thomas Christians. Sociologist Richard Swiderski believes that the legend was \"conceived and promulgated\" by Chazhikaden himself.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=88}} Many modern Knanaya accept the account as factual, while others reject it. As with other Knanaya origin traditions, some Northists dispute and condemn it.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=89}}\n\n===Late Medieval Era===\nThe first written evidence of a Knanaya individual dates to the year 1301, with the writings of Zacharias the deacon of St. Kuriakose Church, Cranganore.{{sfn|Kollamparambil|2012|p=48}} Historically the Knanaya had a township and three churches namely of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas the Apostle]], [[Cyricus and Julitta|Saint Kuriakose]], and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] in the southern portion of the Chera Empire's capital city of Cranganore. According to tradition the three churches were built by Thomas of Cana when the community arrived to India.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=22}} Zacharias was the 14 year old deacon of St. Kuriakose Church as well as the scribe and pupil of [[Yaqob of India|Mar Yaqob of India]], a 14th-century East Syriac bishop of Cranganore.  Zacharias is the author of the oldest surviving Syriac manuscript of India archived as ''Vatican Syrian Codex 22'' which details the city of Cranganore, relations between the Church of the East and the St. Thomas Christians, the Patriarch [[Yahballaha III]], and Mar Yaqob of Cranganore whom he describes in the following quote:{{sfn|Hatch|2012|p=226}}\n\n<blockquote>\"This holy book was written in the royal, renowned and famous city of Chingala (Cranganore) in Malabar in the time of the great captain and director of the holy catholic church of the East.. our blessed and holy Father Mar Yahd Alaha V and in the time of bishop Mar Jacob, Metropolitan and director of the holy see of the Apostle Mar Thoma, that is to say, our great captain and the director of the entire holy church of Christian India\"{{sfn|Podipara|1979|p=15}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the year 1456 the Knanaya Community approached the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor to rebuild [[Kaduthuruthy Valiya Palli|Kaduthuruthy St. Mary's ''Valiya Palli'' (Great Church)]]. In audience with the King of Vadakkumkoor, the Knanaya presented him ''ponpannam'' (gold/gifts given to monarchs). After receiving permission to reconstruct the church, masons were called who during this time extended the walls of Kaduthuruthy Church and added a ''gopuram'' (entrance tower). The historical Knanaya folk song \"Alappan Adiyil\" written on [[palm-leaf manuscript]] records the reconstruction of Kaduthuruthy Church and includes the colophon date 1456. {{sfn|Luke|1911}}\n\n===Early Portuguese Era=== \n\nThe first known extensive written evidence for a division in the Saint Thomas Christian community dates to the 16th century, when [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonial]] officials took notice of it.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=83}}{{sfn|Sharma & Sharma|2004|p=12}} A 1518 letter by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary Alvaro Penteado mentions a conflict between the children of Thomas of Cana, hinting at a rift in the community in contemporary times.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=83}} In 1525, [[Yaqob Abuna|Mar Jacob]], a Chaldean bishop in India, recorded a battle the year before between the [[Kingdom of Cochin]] and the [[Zamorin of Calicut]] that destroyed Cranganore and many Knanaya homes and churches.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=2-3}}{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=30}} The destruction of their entire township and the burning of their churches caused the Knanaya to disperse from the city to other settlements.

This was epitomized by the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599 which took place at Udiamperoor Knanaya Church. The synod led by the Portuguese Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]] brought forth many social and liturgical reforms which forcefully Latinized the East Syriac Rite followed by the St. Thomas Christians and formally brought all the Indian churches under the Archdiocese of Goa and the Roman Catholic Church. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=208-214}} \n\nIn the 17th century, tensions began to broil between the St. Thomas Christians and the Portuguese over their hegemony of the community. The native Archdeacon and ecclesial head of the community, [[Thoma I|Archdeacon Thomas]] was often at odds with the Portuguese prelates. {{sfn|Frykenburg|2008|pp=367}} Tensions further grew with the arrival of the Syrian Bishop [[Ahatallah|Mor Ahatallah]] in India in 1652 who claimed to have been ordained as the \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and China\" by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. The St. Thomas Christians wholeheartedly welcomed Mor Ahatallah and Archdeacon Thomas had hoped that this new Syrian bishop could free the community from the yolk of the Portuguese hierarchy{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=316-317}} Knowing of his influence, the Portuguese had detained Mor Ahatallah at Cochin and arranged for a ship to take him Goa. Archdeacon Thomas is then noted to have arrived at Cochin backed by the militia of the St. Thomas Christians and demanded the Syrian bishops release. The Portuguese officials responded to Thomas and his militia by stating that the ship carrying Ahatallah had already left to Goa. {{sfn|Frykenburg|2008|pp=367-378}} After this, Mor Ahatallah was never heard from again in India which started to incite anti-Portuguese sentiment among the community. Rumors had spread that the Portuguese had drowned Mor Ahatallah in the harbor at Cochin, this rumor became the breaking point in the relationship between the St. Thomas Christians and the Portuguese {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=319}}\n\nIn mass rebellion against the Portuguese clergy and in particular Archbishop Francisco Garcia Mendes, the St. Thomas Christians met on January 3, 1653 at Our Lady of Mattenchery Church to convoke the [[Coonan Cross Oath]]. The oath expressed that the community would no longer obey Archbishop Garcia nor the Portuguese Jesuits but instead only recognize their native archdeacon as the governor of their church. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=319}} After the oath, scholar [[Stephen Neill]] notes that the Knanaya priest [[Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar]] of Kallissery played a major role in the eventual schism of the St. Thomas Christians from the Roman Catholic Church. Being a skilled Syriac writer, it is believed that Itty Thommen forged two letters supposedly from Mor Ahatallah one of which stated that in the absence of a bishop, twelve priests could lay hands on Archdeacon Thomas and consecrate him as their new patriarch, an old oriental Christian tradition. The two forged letters were read to mass crowds during church services and were received with much praise from the community. One of the letters was laid on the head of Archdeacon Thomas and twelve priests consecrated him as the first native bishop of Kerala. News of the event was spread throughout the churches of the St. Thomas Christians who accepted it with much joy in the fact that for the first time in their history a native bishop was consecrated.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=320-321}} \n\nDuring these events, nearly the entire Knanaya community had remained faithful to Archbishop Garcia, questioning the validity of Archdeacon Thomas\u2019 ordination as non-canonical, with only Itty Thommen and his parishioners at Kallissery Knanaya Church supporting the archdeacon. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=322}}{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=29-31}} Other priests of the Knanaya became aware of Itty Thommens actions and called them into question.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=322}} In October 1653, the Knanaya convened a meeting at Kottayam in-which it was decided that none of them should accept Archdeacon Thomas as their bishop, nor should any of their people meet with him. The community even resolved that a young Knanaya who had been given minor orders from Archdeacon Thomas should not be recognized as a priest. Out of the five churches of the Knanaya, Kaduthuruthy, Chunkom, Kottayam, and Udiamperoor remained staunchly faithful to Archbishop Garcia, while only Kallissery Church led by Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen remained in rebellion.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=29-31}} Northist St. Thomas Christians also almost entirely defected from Archdeacon Thomas and instead supported Thomas' cousin and rival [[Alexander De Campo|Parambil Chandy]]. Portuguese Archbishop and successor of Fransico Garcia, Giuseppe Maria Sebastiani noted that the Knanaya greatly supported Parambil Chandy even though he was a Northist St. Thomas Christian. In early 1663, the Knanaya tax-collector Pachikara Tharakan of Chunkom had met with Bishop Sebastiani and pledged the support of the Knanaya community to Parambil Chandy, stating that they would always remain obedient to him \"even if all others abandoned him\". In response, Parambil Chandy expressed that he would protect and preserve the Knanaya with his life, even more than his own community the Northist{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=35-36}} Parambil Chandy would be ordained as the Catholic bishop of the St. Thomas Christians in 1663 at Kaduthuruthy Knanaya Church.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=325}} \n\nThe St. Thomas Christians would now be forever internally divide into Catholic and Malankara factions with the majority of the community who sided with Parambil Chandy creating the basis for the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Catholic]]), while the minority who remained with Archdeaon Thomas creating the [[Malankara Church]] ([[Oriental Orthodox]]){{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=86}}\n\n===Later Colonial Era===\n[[File:Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan - 18th Century.jpg|thumb|Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan]]\nIn the early 18th century (1720) the Syrian Jacobite ''Catanar'' from Kaduthuruthy Fr.

In contrast to the previously documented notations from European sources in the 16th and 17th centuries,  Fr. Mathew's work is the first published native account of the historical traditions of the various ancient Christian missions to India such as that of St. Thomas the Apostle, Thomas of Cana, and bishops [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth]]. Fr. Veticutel expresses that the native St. Thomas Christians had long been without priests and presbyters.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=42}} The Catholicos of the East had sent Thomas of Cana to investigate the condition of the Church in India.

A town and church was then constructed in Cranganore upon which 472 houses were built in which the migrants and native St. Thomas Christians inhabited two distinct sides. {{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=44}}\n\nIn the late 18th century the Syrian Catholics could no longer tolerate the numerous abuses of power by the Roman Catholic Church towards the St. Thomas Christians which included the suppression of the Syriac Rite and the torturing of native clergy.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=15-18}} The tension between the Native Clergy and Roman Church met a breaking point when the Latin hierarchy had imprisoned and starved to death Northist ''Cathanar'' (Syriac priest) Chacko of Edappalli in 1774, who was wrongfully accused of stealing a monstrance.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=40-41}} After this the Malabar General Church Assembly had joined together in the venture of sending a delegation to Rome in order to meet the pope and have their grievances addressed as well as petition for the ordination of a native Syrian Catholic hierarch. The Northist cathanars [[Kariattil Ousep|Ousep Cariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar|Thomman Paremmakkal]] were tasked with undertaking the journey.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=40-41}} The journey was also greatly supported and funded by two Syrian Catholic ''Tharakans'' (ministers/tax collectors), Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla  of the Knanaya Community and Thachil Mathoo of the Northist St. Thomas Christians.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=41-75}} Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan had donated 30,000 ''chakrams'' (Indian currency) to the delegation, whose journey to Rome began in his home in the village of [[Neendoor]]. From Neendoor the delegation took Poothathil's country boat all the way to [[Colachel]] on the southern tip of India, after which point they left India.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=50}} The delegation also took one boy of each ethnic group to be admitted to the Propaganda College of Rome, Chacko Malayil of the Knanaya community and Mathoo Palakkal of the Northist.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=65}}\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Early 19th Century Knanaya.png|thumb|Early 20th Century Knanaya in traditional attire and wedding crowns]]\nIn the late 19th century social changes in [[British India]] led to increased wealth and social power for the Saint Thomas Christians. This social change tended to advance internal divisions within the community, including the Southist\u2013Northist division.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=87}} Through this period the Knanaya promoted their own uniqueness and independent identity to push for further opportunities for their community. They sought the establishment of Knanaya-centred diocese' for both the Malankara and Catholic churches, which were founded in 1910 and 1911, respectively.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=87}}\n\nLike other Saint Thomas Christians, many Knanaya have migrated away from Kerala and India since the 20th century. The largest Knanaya diaspora community is located in [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|p=169}} This community originated in the 1950s when a small number of Knanaya and other Kerala natives emigrated to the area as university students; they were followed by more substantial immigration after 1965. The immigrants met up periodically for social events, and in the 1970s organizations for Catholics, members of other Christian churches, and Hindus were formed. In the 1980s the various Indian Catholic [[particular church]]es sent chaplains to Chicago; in 1983 the [[Bishop of Kottayam]] sent a chaplain to minister specifically to the Knanaya Catholics.{{sfn|Jacobsen & Raj|2008|pp=202\u2013207}}\n\n==Genome Mapping==\nA 2019 preliminary genetic analysis of the Knanaya community was undertaken by American geneticist Dr. Razib Khan.

However the Knanaya maintain a unique sub-culture of their own and a number of scholars have found that the distinct traditions and customs of the Knanaya are similar to those of the [[Cochin Jews]] of Kerala. This can be seen through the similarity in folk songs and folk traditions which may reflect the Knanaya's claimed Judeo-Christian ancestry.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}} Scholar of Cochin Jewish culture and history P.M. Jussay notes the following about the cultural similarities: <blockquote>\u201cIn the many splendoured wonder of Kerala\u2019s population, the critical observer is intrigued by the striking similarities that exist between two small communities - the Cochin Jews and the Knanite Christians. Neither of them is said to be of the soil; but having taken root and flourished for long in this fertile land, they have been indistinguishably integrated with its colours and contours. The similarities become significant when the Knanites claim a Jewish origin\u201d</blockquote>{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118}}\n\n===Religious traditions===\nTraditionally the Knanaya have followed the religious traditions and practices of the wider Saint Thomas Christian community. In the 17th century, when the Saint Thomas Christians were split into Catholic and [[Malankara Church]] factions following the [[Coonan Cross Oath]], both the Knanaya and Northist groups were internally divided.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=84\u201385, 87}} The Malankara faction became affiliated with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], an [[Oriental Orthodox]] church based in [[Syria]], while the Catholic faction is now known as the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]. Beginning in the late 19th century, both Malankara and Catholic Knanaya lobbied for their own dioceses within their respective denominations. In 1910, the Syriac Orthodox Church established a distinct Knanaya-oriented diocese in [[Chingavanam]], which reports directly to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch]]. The following year, the Catholic Church established a Knanaya Catholic [[eparchy]] (diocese) in [[Kottayam]], known as the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n===Folk songs=== \n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Knanaya Folk Songs \n| cover    = Palm Leaf Relics of Knanaya Folk Songs.jpg\n| alt      =\n| caption  = Palm Leaf Manuscripts of Knanaya Folk Songs\n| type     =\n| artist   =\n| album    =\n| released =\n| format   =\n| recorded =\n| studio   =\n| venue    =\n| genre    = Music of Medieval India\n| length   = 48:39\n| label    =\n| composer =\n| lyricist =\n| producer =\n| misc     = {{External music video|{{YouTube|9SSJRlrcYS4|\"Knanaya Folk Songs\"}}}}\n}}\nKnanaya folk songs are ancient in origins and were first written down in the 17th century on [[palm leaf manuscripts]].

After doing so the Panan would receive payment for their performance in the form of a material donation of items such as betel leaves and other types of charitable aid. Likewise, the Panans would visit the homes of the Knanaya and sing songs of the communities history and heritage. In particular, the Panans would sing of a story in the life of Thomas of Cana during the reign of Cheraman Perumal. The story is narrated from the perspective of the leader of the bards known as Tiruvaranka Panan. The contents of the story revolves around a mission bestowed to Tiruvaranka by Thomas of Cana in which he is to travel to ''Ezhathunadu'' (Sri Lanka) and implore four castes, namely carpenters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, and molders, to return to Cranganore which they had left due to an infringement on their social traditions. The four castes are initially hesitant to return to Cranganore but are persuaded by Tiruvaranka when he shows them the golden staff of Thomas of Cana which he was granted to take on his journey as a sign of goodwill. After seeing the staff the four castes are content and in their satisfaction remove their own ornaments and smelt a golden crown for Thomas of Cana which they present to him upon their return to the Cranganore. Wearing the crown, Thomas and Tiruvarankan go to meet Cheraman Perumal who is pleased with the success of their mission and grants Thomas of Cana privileges. The remainder of the song sings of the seventy-two historical privileges bestowed upon Thomas.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=427-436}}\n\n===Folk traditions===\nAfter the burning of Craganore in 1524 during a battle between the  [[Zamorin of Calicut]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin]] which the city was a part of, the homes and temples of both the Cochin Jews and Knanaya were destroyed. The Knanaya historically commemorated this loss by carrying around a handful of charred earth as a keepsake from their ancestral settlement. From this act originated the custom of including a pinch of ash from a bride's home in a knot at the end of her new dress when she went to live with her husband. On account of this, Northists sometimes derisively dub the Knanaya \"Charam kettikal\", or knot makers of ash. The Cochin Jews had a similar custom of keeping a handful of earth from the place their temples once stood.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=30}} The burning of Craganore was a vital and drastic event for both the communities and figures heavily in their stories and songs{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=123}} \n\nBoth the Knanaya and Cochin Jews maintain folk traditions based on figures and stories of the Old Testament. Both groups particularly revere [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]]; the Knanaya perform a [[circle dance]] called \"Poorva Yousepintae Vattakali\" (\"Round Dance of Old Joseph\"), while the Cochin Jews also maintain songs glorifying Joseph.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=124}} The Knanaya and Cochin Jews give local flavor to their Old Testament-based songs, stories and traditions. A Knanaya folk song about [[Book of Tobit|Tobias]] describes his wedding as including Kerala paraphernalia, while a Cochin Jewish folk song describes [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] dressed and groomed like a [[Malayali]] girl or Cochin Jewish bride. For both the Knanaya and Cochin Jews, these flourishes make Bible stories relevant to their current experience.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=125}}\n\n===Passover traditions===\n[[File:Knajewfood.jpg|thumb|Pesaha Appam and Pal]]\nThe tradition of Passover or \"Pesaha\" is practiced every Holy Thursday in the homes of the Knanaya. On the night of Holy Thursday, the \"Pesaha Appam\" or Pesaha bread is made with unleavened flour along with a sweet drink made of milk and jaggery known as \"Pesaha Pal\" (in some families banana is also a part of this custom). The first batch of Pesaha appam is decorated and blessed with palm leaves from Palm Sunday set in the shape of a cross, the Pesaha milk also shares this adornment. The first batch is said to be the most sacred and is only given to members of the family. In ritualistic practice, the family gathers in the home and the father or grandfather of the household blesses and prays over the bread and milk, often also reading a bible passage. He then cuts, portions and distributes the bread, banana, and milk to his family members, giving it to males of the household first. Traditionally after the celebration is over any waste product that was used in the ritual was burned away according to the rules of Leviticus and the sacred nature of the practice. It should also be noted that all utensils and vessels used in the process are either brand new or washed in a ceremonial manner. Pesaha is also regularly practiced in the homes of the larger St. Thomas Christian community but the scope of usage can vary based on the specific denomination and region. Distinctions also occur based on the type of bread and products used and specific rituals that take place. Additionally, if a family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but brought to them by their Syrian Christian neighbors.{{sfn|Alumkalnal|2013|pp=57-71}}\n\n===Wedding traditions===\n[[File: Knanaya Wedding Crown.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Female Vethanmudi (Royal Crowns)]]\nThe Knanaya maintain distinctive wedding traditions and wedding customs that have helped to sustain their identity and culture. These traditions are an amalgamate of Judeo-Christian, Syriac, and Hindu customs, reflecting the Knanaya's claimed origins and the centuries that they have lived as a minority community in India. Historically, Knanaya marriage celebrations lasted several days, with many of the ceremonies centered around the home. In the present day, these ceremonies take place over three days and the wedding traditions can be divided into the categories of betrothal, groom, bride, reception, and miscellaneous. These ceremonies are also accompanied by numerous ancient songs characteristic of the Knanaya.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}}\n\nBetrothal customs include ''Kaipidutham'', or \"clasping of hands\". This is an initial agreement and fixing of the marriage, which involves the future bride and groom as well as their paternal uncles. The uncles clasp the hands of the betrothed in the presence of the priest at church. This symbolizes the uncles' and extended families', support and investment in the relationship.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=32-33}} Maternal uncles undertake a Maternal Uncles Agreement, at which they come together at the erection of the poles of the ''pandal'', a canopy and temporary hall set up for the wedding. The uncles from each party exchange a ''kindy'', or water bowl, for rinsing and hand washing. The dowry is also delivered by the bride's maternal uncle to the groom's uncle, and they kneel on a mat in front of a lighted lamp symbolizing Jesus and pray as though in front of an altar.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=32-33}}\n\nBride and groom participate in ceremonies in their respective homes on the eve of the wedding. The groom's ceremony is \"Antham Charthal\" which is now most commonly known as ''Chandam Charthal''. The name signifies the end or last day of the bachelor life of the boy as well as beautifying the boy. The village barber arrives at the pandal and requests permission to shave the groom three times. After receiving permission, the barber performs the ceremonial shaving (historically, this was his first shave), then takes him out to put oil on his head and bathe him, while the assembly sings ancient songs.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=33-34}} The bride's ceremony is ''Mylanchi Ideel'', or \"[[henna]] ceremony\". The bride's palms, feet, and nails are smeared with special green henna, by her maternal grandmother and aunts. Similar ceremonies are found among various ethnic groups across the Middle East, North Africa, and India; the Knanaya give it a Biblical meaning referencing the [[original sin]] of [[Eve]], stating that because Eve walked with her feet to the [[Tree of knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] and plucked its [[forbidden fruit]] with her palms, the feet and palms of the bride are smeared with henna to cleanse her of Eves original sin. The grandmother then takes the bride to be bathed and changed into a new dress.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=34-35}} Following these ceremonies the bride and groom return to the pandal for the ''Ichappad'' (sweet giving) ceremony, at which the bride and groom are fed white rice pudding with brown sugar by designated elders (paternal elders for the groom, maternal elders for the bride).{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=33-35}}\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Bar Mariam\n| cover    = Knanaya priests chant Bar Maryam.jpg\n| alt      =\n| caption  = Knanaya priests chant the \"Bar Mariam\"\n| type     =\n| artist   =\n| album    =\n| released =\n| format   =\n| recorded =\n| studio   =\n| venue    =\n| genre    = Paraliturgical\n| length   = 4:00-6:00\n| label    =\n| composer =\n| lyricist =\n| producer =\n| misc     = {{External music video|{{YouTube|tod-GfG7LTI|\"Bar Mariam\"}}}}\n}}\nPrior to entering the church for the wedding, the bride and groom greet their parents and elders for ''Sthuthi'' (\"Peace Blessing\"), where they receive blessings from their family. This is believed to be a reference to [[Sarah]] receiving her father's blessings in the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=35}} At the end of the marriage ceremony, the priests and congregation sing the \"[[Bar Mariam]]\" (\"Son of Mary\"), a \"paraliturgical\" Syriac chant referencing events from Jesus' life. After the chant, the priests bless the newlyweds with holy water to conclude the ceremony.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=35}}{{sfn|Palackal and Simon|2015}}\n\nThe [[wedding reception]] features several traditions. After the wedding, the assembly holds a great procession to the reception place, including celebratory music and a distinct ritualistic cheer known as \u201cNada Villi\u201d. In the end, the bride and groom are carried by their uncles up to the door.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}} In the reception pandal, the groom's mother leads the ''Nellum Neerum'' (\"Welcome Blessing\") to solemnly welcome the newlyweds. The groom's sister holds a lighted brass lamp and a bowl of water, paddy, and leaves from [[Palm Sunday]], symbolizing purification and fertility. The mother traces the [[sign of the cross]] on the couples' foreheads with a wet piece of palm leaf.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Special seats called ''manarcolam'' (marriage venue) are prepared for the couple by spreading sheets of wool and white linen, representing the hardships and blessings of married life.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}} The bride's mother then gives the ''Vazhu Pidutham'' (Mother's blessing) while placing her hands crosswise on the couple's heads, and all the women present sing the wedding song \"Vazhvenna Vazvhu\".{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Following the mother's blessing, relatives present gifts in ''Kacha Thazhukal'' (\"Gift Giving\"). The first gift is a new dress given to the bride's family; family members then remove their gold jewelry and place them on the newlyweds.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Afterward is the presentation of milk and fruit, which the couple drinks from the same cup.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}}\n\nAfter the reception is the ''Adachu Thura'' (Bridal Chamber Ceremony), where the bride's mother brings the groom special sweets and foods. The couple and their elders and friends enter the bridal chamber, where the bride's mother promises utensils and ornaments to the groom. They then exit the chamber and the bride and groom are anointed with oil and bathed. They put on new clothes and share a meal with the attendees. Special songs accompany each step.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=38}} Another miscellaneous tradition is the ''Margam Kali'' (\"The Way\", referring to the way of [[Thomas the Apostle]]), a traditional St. Thomas Christian dance. The dance and accompanying songs retell the story of Thomas and his mission to India. {{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\n===Food===\nThe Knanaya make several special foods. ''Pidy'' is a [[rice ball]] dish traditionally made when sending pregnant women home for a delivery, and some other occasions. ''Venpachor'' is a white rice pudding prepared on the eve of a wedding for the ceremonies of ''Chandam Charthal'' and ''Mylanchi Ideel''. Other bread-based foods and snacks favored by the Knanaya but consumed by the entire Kerala community are [[Achappam]], [[Kuzhalappam]], Avalosunda, and Churutt.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=28}}\n\nKnanaya historically ate on two plantain leaves, one placed over the other. According to folk tradition, this was a royal privilege granted to the community. Today, the Knanaya symbolize this by folding the left side of a plantain leaf underneath to make one leaf as two.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=29}} Knanaya eating together would eat from the same plantain leaf as a sign of cordiality. Catholic and Orthodox Knanaya dining together would eat from the left and right side of the leaf to show that despite their different religious affiliations, they were still part of a united ethnic community.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=28-29}}\n\n===Dress and ornaments===\nKnanaya women historically wore gold earrings with balls and small raised heads, one inch in diameter, known as ''Mekkamothiram'' or ''[[Kunukku]]'', the same earrings are also worn by the Northist Saint Thomas Christians. Southist and Northist women alike wear a distinct type of sari known as the ''Chatta Mundu''. This comprises the ''chatta'', a white [[blouse]] embroidered with design, and the ''mundu'' dress. The ''mundu'' is a long white cloth worn from the waist down, and includes 15 to 21 pleats covering the back thigh in a fan shape representing a palm leaf.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\nKnanaya men historically wore white shawls as a headdress and wore a white cloth wrapped around the waist. Both are tied in a special way known as ''Njettum Valum Ittu Kettuka''.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\n===Dance===\n[[File:Knanaya Margam Kali.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Margam Kali]]\nThe Knanaya maintain a distinct round dance, the [[Margamkali]], or \"the way/path\" of Thomas the Apostle. This traditional dance was historically performed among Saint Thomas Christians, but the Knanaya have played a prominent role in preserving and maintaining it since European contact. The Margamkali was traditionally a male dance exhibiting twelve players symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]] dancing in a circle around a lighted brass lamp representing Jesus. It is accompanied by ancient songs about Thomas the Apostle, based on the apocryphal 3rd-century text ''[[Acts of Thomas]]''. The song text consists of 450 lines, divided into 14 sections. These songs contain Syriac and Tamil diction, suggesting an origin before the emergence of the Malayalam language in Malabar between the 9th and 13th century.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}}\n\nThe Margamkali declined considerably after European colonization. In the 17th century, the Knanaya priest [[Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar]] revised the text, which has influenced its current structure. In 1910, scholar P.U. Luke published the text for the first time in his collection of ''Ancient Songs''.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}} In 1924 the European priest and scholar Father Hosten was enamored by the Margamkali he saw danced by the Knanaya in Kottayam. He attempted to present the dance at the 1925 Vatican Mission Exhibition, but it was not performed due to mass disapproval by Northist Saint Thomas Christians.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} In the 1960s the Saint Thomas Christian scholar of folk culture Chummar Choondal led a sociological survey of the Margamkali. He noted that by that time, it was solely practiced and propagated by the Knanaya and could not be found among Northist communities.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} Furthermore, Choondal found that all of the Margam teachers and groups of the time period were Knanaya.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} With Choondal's aid, the Knanaya priests George Karukaparambil and Jacob Vellian spearheaded research on the Margamkali in the 1970s and '80s with the help of 33 Knanaya ''ashans'' (teachers). The team systematized the Margamkali and promoted it among schools and cultural organizations. In 1995, Mar Kuriakose Kunnasserry, the bishop of the Knanaya Diocese of Kottayam, established Hadusa (Syriac for dancing/rejoicing) as an All India Institute of Christian Performing Arts.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}}\n\n===Funeral traditions===\nThe Knanaya hold to a death bed tradition based on Old Testament teachings, wherein a dying man gives a final blessing to his children and grandchildren. The father places his hand on the heads of kneeling recipients while giving the invocation.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}} Other funeral traditions include the ''Thazhukuka'', in which friends and relatives embrace a grieving family at a funeral. The family stands in line at the church as the priest sprinkles holy water on them, and friends embrace them. After the burial, the family holds a ceremony at home where they drink from a single tender coconut to symbolize their unity following the death of their loved one.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=28}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last=Alumkalnal | first=Sunish| year=2013 |title=Pesaha Celebration of Nasranis: A Sociocultural analysis| series= Journal of Indo-Judaic studies |volume=13 |ref={{sfnRef|Alumkalnal|2013}}}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ |ref={{sfnRef|Baum & Winkler|2003}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Coward|first=Harold |title=Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Perspectives and Encounters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eHgNyNimoAC&pg=PA19|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|isbn=978-81-208-1158-4 |ref={{sfnRef|Coward|1993}} }}\n*{{cite book|first=Ernst |last=Fahlbusch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&pg=PR1&dq=Fahlbusch+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity+volume+5&hl=de&sa=X&ei=4PWrUMHZIMSN4AS9joC4CQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Knanaya&f=false |title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity: Volume 5 |page=286 |isbn=9780802824172 |publisher=[[William B.

Today there are about 300,000 Knanaya in India and elsewhere.{{sfn|Fahlbusch|2008|p=286}}\n\nThe origins of the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Northist and Southist groups are unclear. Various traditions trace it back to the arrival of the Syrian merchant [[Thomas of Cana]] (Kn\u0101i Thoma) who led a migration of endogamous [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] [[Syriac Christians]] (possibly{{Weasel inline|date=April 2020}} of [[Jewish]] origin) to India in the 4th or 8th century. The Knanaya claim descent from Thomas of Cana and those who came with him. The ethnic division between the Knanaya and other St. Thomas Christians was present by the time of the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonization]] in the 16th century and was noted throughout the [[Colonial India|European colonial era]].\n\nToday, the majority of Knanaya are members of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Catholic]]) and the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church]] ([[Oriental Orthodox]]). They became increasingly prominent in Kerala in the late 19th century. Many Knanaya migrated away during the 20th and 21st centuries, largely westward, forming communities in non-Malayalam speaking areas, with a large expatriate community currently living in Houston, Texas and [[Chicago]], Illinois, United States.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Thomas of Cana.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana]]\nThe term ''Kn\u0101n\u0101ya'' derives from the name [[Thomas of Cana|Kn\u0101i Thoma]] ([[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as Thomas of Cana), an important figure in the Saint Thomas Christian tradition.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}} The term is derived from Thomas' [[Syriac language|Syriac]] adjectival epithet Kn\u0101'n\u0101ya in reference to the land of [[Canaan]] and is defined as meaning \"Those of Canaan\".{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=85}} The earliest written record of the term used as a designation of the community dates to the 1800s, however notations of the term itself are found in Knanaya folk songs such as the song of the erection of Kallisserry Church in 1580.{{sfn|Luke|1911|p=72}}{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=85}}  Members of the Knanaya Community are also generally called Kn\u0101i or Kn\u0101, in reference to Thomas. Many Knanaya families, especially those of the [[Kaduthuruthy]] region maintain the surname Kin\u0101n, a derivative of Thomas\u2019 epithet. Woman of these families preserve gendered forms of the term, examples of this being Kin\u0101ti Anna, Kin\u0101ti Mariam, etc.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=1}}\n\nThe ultimate derivation of Thomas' English epithet ''Cana'' is not clear: it may refer to the town of [[Cana]], which is mentioned in the [[Bible]], or it may instead refer to the land of [[Canaan]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}}Alternately, it may be a corruption of a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] term for merchant (''Kn\u0101yil'' in Malayalam).{{sfn|Neill|2004|p=42}} However, scholar Richard M. Swiderski states that none of these etymologies are entirely sound.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}} Knanaya priest and scholar Jacob Kollaparambil argues that the \"Cana\" form is a corruption introduced by European scholars in the 18th century based on the [[Malayalam]] form ''Kn\u0101y'' and its variants (Kn\u0101i, Kin\u0101n, Kn\u0101yi) found in the folk tradition of the Knanaya and the common parlance and literature of the people of Malabar.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|pp=1-20}} This may be a reference to the Christian community of Kynai, in B\u00e9t Aramay\u00e9 in Persia, a historical center of Syriac Christianity.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=1}} ''Knanaya'' is the spelling preferred by community members; other less common spellings include ''Cananites'' and ''Cnanites''.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nThe Knanaya are also known as ''Tekkumbhagar'' in Malayalam; this is generally translated into English as \"Southist\", or sometimes \"Southerner\" or \"Suddhist\". This is in reference to the historically significant geographical division between them and other Saint Thomas Christians, who are known as ''Vadakumbhagar'' or Northists in this context.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=73}}\n\n===Titles===\nHistorically the Knanaya held the title of being the \"protectors of seventeen castes\", an authority given to them by the [[Cheraman Perumal]] according to folk tradition. This title which was reflective of the historical high caste status of the Knanaya, is to this day exhibited during Knanaya marriage ceremonies when individuals taking part in the rituals ask permission before fulfilling their designated role. A prominent example of this is seen during the \"Chandam Charthal\" or grooms beautification ceremony, in which the barber petitions the assembly three times with the following request: \"I ask the gentlemen here who have superiority over 17 castes, may I shave the bridegroom?\".{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=470}}\n\nThe Knanaya were also known as ''Ancharapallikar'' or the \"Owners of Five and a Half churches\" a title reflective of the five churches owned by the Southist Community before the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599. The churches are listed as the following: Udayamperoor, Kaduthuruthy, Kottayam, Chunkom, and Kallissery. The \"half church\" is a reference to the half privilege and share the Knanaya held in other churches they co-owned with the Northist St. Thomas Christians, usually in areas where not many Knanaya lived.{{sfn|Vellian|2001|p=2}}\n\n==History==\n===Origins and traditions===\n[[File:Thomas of Cana and the Knanaya Depart for India.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana and the Knanaya Depart for India]]\nIt is not clear how the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Southern and Northern groups originated. The earliest extensive written evidence for the split dates to the 16th century.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=77}} The St. Thomas Christian tradition defines the division as being both geographical and ethnic, expressing that the Native St. Thomas Christians initially resided on the north side of the [[Chera Dynasty|Chera Empire's]] capitol city of Cranganore while the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya arrived and settled on the south side, which subsequently led to the designation Northist and Southist.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}} Directional divisions within communities are common in Kerala, including among Hindu groups.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201380}}{{sfn|Coward|1993|p=19}} A similar north\u2013south division is found among the [[Nairs]], and it historically appears to have been in place in the early [[Brahmin]] settlements in the area. The Saint Thomas Christians may have taken this trait from the Brahmins.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=73\u201374}} \n\n====Thomas of Cana\u2019s Expedition====\nThe historical rationale for the division between the majority St. Thomas Christians and minority Knanaya traces the divide to the figure of Thomas of Cana, a Syrian merchant who led a group of 72 [[Jewish Christians|Jewish-Christian]] immigrant families, a bishop named Uraha Mar Yausef, and clergymen from [[Mesopotamia]] to settle in  [[Cranganore]], [[India]] in the 4th century (some sources place these events as late as the 9th century).{{sfn|Baum & Winkler|2003|p=53}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|pp=60}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-26}} This story may reflect a historical migration of East Syrian Christians to India around this time, which established the region's relationship with the [[Church of the East]].{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=42\u201343}} In the commonly accepted accounts of this history, the Knanaya are the descendants of Thomas of Cana and his followers, while the Northists descend from the local Christian body which had been converted by [[Thomas the Apostle]] centuries earlier.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=74\u201376}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}} Elements of the Thomas of Cana story feature in ancient songs as well as the [[Thomas of Cana copper plates]] awarded to his followers by a local Hindu ruler.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|pp=460-461}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-26}}{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|p=52}} These plates are said to have granted Thomas\u2019 followers 72 social, economic, and religious rights from [[Cheraman Perumal]], the [[Chera]] king.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=63\u201364}} The plates were present in Kerala during the time of the Portuguese colonization in the early 17th century, but were lost during Portuguese rule.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=65\u201366}} The Knanaya invoke the plates as evidence of their descent from Thomas of Cana's mission.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=66\u201367}} This version of the Thomas of Cana narrative is the accepted history among both Knanaya and Northist scholars alike as well as scholarship in general.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Thodathil|2001|pp=111\u2013112}}\n[[File:Thomas of Cana receives privileges from Cheruman Perumal.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana Receives Privileges from Cheraman Perumal]]\n====Two Wives Legend====\nIn many other variants recorded during the colonial era, Thomas of Cana had two wives or partners, one of them being the ancestor of the endogamous Southists, and the other one being the ancestor of the Northist.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201380}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}} A number of traditions and stories have emerged to explain the status of either wife,{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=73\u201392}} and both Southists and Northists historically used variants of these traditions to claim superiority for their group.{{sfn|Baum & Winkler|2003|p=53}}\nThese variants are considered apocryphal and are not the accepted tradition among contemporary Northist and Southist scholars who generally believe them to be the consequence of rivalry between the St. Thomas Christians and Knanaya.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}} In some of these variants, the Southists' ancestor was Thomas\u2019 Syrian wife, while the Northists' was an indigenous [[Nair]] woman who became his second wife or concubine, implying that the Southists are Thomas\u2019 true heirs.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201377}} In other variants, both wives were Kerala natives, while the Southists' forebearer was from a higher caste.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=77\u201378}} More recent versions of this story downplay the importance of either wife's status, focusing instead on their descendants' marriage practices: the Northists intermarried with the natives, while the Knanaya enforced strict endogamy, maintaining a \"pure\" lineage.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nSome Northists also maintain versions of the Thomas of Cana story that counter the Knanayas' assertions. In the Northist versions, both Northists and Southists are descended from marriages between Thoma's party and indigenous Christians, but the Knanaya are descended from Syrian servants who married \"low caste\" Keralans; the Knanayas' endogamy and \"purity\" are thus borne out of their exclusion by the higher class Northists. These variants frequently trace Knanaya descent back to a ''dobi'' (washerwoman); in some versions of this story, she became Thoma's concubine, while in other she married a lower-caste [[Maaran]] boy.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=80\u201382}} This assertion is based on the 1676 Portuguese document \"M.S Sloane 2748-A\", a likely forgery attributed to the [[Discalced Carmelites|Carmelite]] priest Father Mathew.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=36}}\n\nHistorian of medieval India and Northist priest Pius Malekandathil argues that the two-wives legend was simply a creation of rivalry between the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya and the Native St. Thomas Christians. Malekandathil expresses that the story originated in the medieval era due to the two ethnic groups of Christians asserting socioeconomic dominance over the other. Furthermore,  Malekandathil notes that the two-wives legend is not the accepted tradition among the people of Kerala but instead that the indigenous Saint Thomas Christians got the appellation \"Northists\" because they were initially located on the northern part of the city of Cranganore, while the migrant Knanaya under the leadership of Thomas of Cana were given the southern side of the city which led to the generic title of \"Southists\".{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n====Jewish-Christian Claim====\nThe Knanaya strongly attest that the Syriac Christian migrants who arrived with Thomas of Cana were Jewish-Christians (endogamous Jews who converted to Syriac Christianity). This ideal is established from cultural aspects of the community such as Knanaya folk songs first written on palm-leave manuscripts in the 17th century from which the Knanaya disseminate much of their history and heritage. Many of the historical songs allude to the migrants being of Jewish descent such as the song ''Nallor Oraslem'' (The Good Jerusalem) which states the migrants prayed at the tomb of the [[Ezra|Jewish Prophet Ezra]] before departing to India. A plethora of Jewish scholars such as Dr. P.M. Jussay, Dr. Nathan Katz, Dr. Shalva Weil, and Dr. Ohpira Gamliel have all noted that the Knanaya maintain cultural similarities to Jewish communities, a factor which could allude to the communities claimed Jewish origins.{{sfn|Weil|1982|pp=175-196}}{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}}{{sfn|Gamliel|2009|pp=90}} Other scholars entirely accept the Jewish-Christian claim of the Knanaya such as Oxford historian Dr. Robert Eric Frykenberg.{{sfn|Frykenberg|2010|pp=109}}\n\nIn 1939, the Knanaya politician and author Joseph Chazhikaden published a book on the community, ''Tekkumbhagasamudayam Charitram'', in which he included some aspects of the communities Jewish claim. Chazhikaden built upon the Thomas of Cana tradition but asserted that Thomas' followers originated in [[Judea]]. According to Chazhikaden, the group converted to Christianity while maintaining their distinct culture and identity.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=95\u201396}} Eventually, they were forced out of their homeland and moved to [[Cranganore]], where they were welcomed by the ruler Cheraman Perumal and lived near, but maintained their separateness from, the indigenous \"Northist\" Saint Thomas Christians. Sociologist Richard Swiderski believes that the legend was \"conceived and promulgated\" by Chazhikaden himself.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=88}} Many modern Knanaya accept the account as factual, while others reject it. As with other Knanaya origin traditions, some Northists dispute and condemn it.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=89}}\n\n===Late Medieval Era===\nThe first written evidence of a Knanaya individual dates to the year 1301, with the writings of Zacharias the deacon of St. Kuriakose Church, Cranganore.{{sfn|Kollamparambil|2012|p=48}} Historically the Knanaya had a township and three churches namely of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas the Apostle]], [[Cyricus and Julitta|Saint Kuriakose]], and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] in the southern portion of the Chera Empire's capital city of Cranganore. According to tradition the three churches were built by Thomas of Cana when the community arrived to India.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=22}} Zacharias was the 14 year old deacon of St. Kuriakose Church as well as the scribe and pupil of [[Yaqob of India|Mar Yaqob of India]], a 14th-century East Syriac bishop of Cranganore.  Zacharias is the author of the oldest surviving Syriac manuscript of India archived as ''Vatican Syrian Codex 22'' which details the city of Cranganore, relations between the Church of the East and the St. Thomas Christians, the Patriarch [[Yahballaha III]], and Mar Yaqob of Cranganore whom he describes in the following quote:{{sfn|Hatch|2012|p=226}}\n\n<blockquote>\"This holy book was written in the royal, renowned and famous city of Chingala (Cranganore) in Malabar in the time of the great captain and director of the holy catholic church of the East.. our blessed and holy Father Mar Yahd Alaha V and in the time of bishop Mar Jacob, Metropolitan and director of the holy see of the Apostle Mar Thoma, that is to say, our great captain and the director of the entire holy church of Christian India\"{{sfn|Podipara|1979|p=15}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the year 1456 the Knanaya Community approached the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor to rebuild [[Kaduthuruthy Valiya Palli|Kaduthuruthy St. Mary's ''Valiya Palli'' (Great Church)]]. In audience with the King of Vadakkumkoor, the Knanaya presented him ''ponpannam'' (gold/gifts given to monarchs). After receiving permission to reconstruct the church, masons were called who during this time extended the walls of Kaduthuruthy Church and added a ''gopuram'' (entrance tower). The historical Knanaya folk song \"Alappan Adiyil\" written on [[palm-leaf manuscript]] records the reconstruction of Kaduthuruthy Church and includes the colophon date 1456. {{sfn|Luke|1911}}\n\n===Early Portuguese Era=== \n\nThe first known extensive written evidence for a division in the Saint Thomas Christian community dates to the 16th century, when [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonial]] officials took notice of it.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=83}}{{sfn|Sharma & Sharma|2004|p=12}} A 1518 letter by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary Alvaro Penteado mentions a conflict between the children of Thomas of Cana, hinting at a rift in the community in contemporary times.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=83}} In 1525, [[Yaqob Abuna|Mar Jacob]], a Chaldean bishop in India, recorded a battle the year before between the [[Kingdom of Cochin]] and the [[Zamorin of Calicut]] that destroyed Cranganore and many Knanaya homes and churches.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=2-3}}{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=30}} The destruction of their entire township and the burning of their churches caused the Knanaya to disperse from the city to other settlements.

Besides collecting duties, the Knanaya in Chunkom were also known to mold \"famous\" pottery.{{sfn|Whitehouse|1873|p=125}}\n\nIn the year 1550, the Portuguese commander Francesco Silveira de Menesis aided the [[Kingdom of Cochin|King of Cochin's]] army in a victorious battle against the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor (Kaduthuruthy), subsequently killing its king Veera Manikatachen.{{sfn|Whitehouse|1873|p=125}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=150}}{{sfn|Trivedi|2010|p=70}} After the death of their king, the entire army of the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor formed itself into ''chaver'' (suicide) squads and sought revenge against the Syrian Christians in the region who they viewed as co-religionist of the regicidal Portuguese. The Knanaya ''Tharakan'' (minister) Kunchacko of the Kunnassery Family was a member of the Vadakkankur Royal Court and a close advisor to the slain king. In order to save his people from the ire of the chaver squads, Kunchacko Tharakan gathered the Knanaya from their parish of [[Kaduthuruthy Valiya Palli|Kaduthuruthy St. Mary's ''Valiya Palli'' (Great Church)]], as well as all other Syrian Christians he could find within the vicinity of Vadakkankur and fled to the region of [[Mulanthuruthy]] where he eventually built [[Mulanthuruthy Marthoman Church|Mulanthuruthy Church]]. The Knanaya were later called back to Kaduthurthy by the descendants of Veera Manikatachan and left Mulanthuruthy Church in the care and protection of the Northist St. Thomas Christians who remained there.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=150}}{{sfn|Whitehouse|1873|p=125}}\n\n[[File:Persian Cross at Kottayam valiya pally.png|thumb|Persian Cross at Kottayam Valiya Palli]]\n\nDuring this same altercation with the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor in 1550, a portion of the Knanaya from Kaduthuruthy were invited to the city of Kottayam by its chieftain in the [[Thekkumkur|Kingdom of Thekkumkur]] and were given permission to build a church which they consecrated as Kottayam St. Mary's Knanaya Valiya Palli.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}}{{sfn|Trivedi|2010|p=71}} These Knanaya had brought with them ancient relics from Kaduthuruthy Church known as the [[St. Thomas Cross|Persian Crosses]] which are till this day exhibited at Kottayam Valiya Palli.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}}\n\nIn 1566 Portuguese official Damio De Goes records that the Thomas of Cana copper plate grant was given to the Portuguese treasurer Pero De Sequeia by the Chaldean Bishop of Cranganore Mar Jacob in 1524 after the destruction of the city in order to keep the plates safe.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}} Treasurer Pero De Sequeia then took the plates to the Portuguese governor of India Martim Afonso De Sousa who ordered the local people to translate the context of the plates.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}} To the governors dismay none of the local people could interpret the antiquity of the language on the plates, however the Portuguese eventually came into contact with a Cochin Jewish linguist who De Goes expresses was \u201cversed in many languages\u201d.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}}Governor De Sousa sent the plates to the Jewish linguist with orders from the King of Cochin to interpret and translate its context.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}}\n\nThe linguist translated the context of the plates and stated that they contained social, economic, and religious rights given to Thomas of Cana by a local ruler and were written in three languages, namely \u201cChaldean, Malabar, and Arabic\u201d.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}}De Goes notes that physically the plates were \u201cof fine metal each one palm and a half long and four fingers broad, written on both sides, and strung together at the top with a thick copper wire\u201d.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}}The Cochin Jew returned the plates to the Portuguese, who then had his Malayalam description of the plates translated to the Portuguese language in a written copy.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}} This copy was later sent by treasurer Pero De Sequeia to Portuguese King Dom Joao III.

This was epitomized by the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599 which took place at Udiamperoor Knanaya Church. The synod led by the Portuguese Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]] brought forth many social and liturgical reforms which forcefully Latinized the East Syriac Rite followed by the St. Thomas Christians and formally brought all the Indian churches under the Archdiocese of Goa and the Roman Catholic Church. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=208-214}} \n\nIn the 17th century, tensions began to broil between the St. Thomas Christians and the Portuguese over their hegemony of the community.

The oath expressed that the community would no longer obey Archbishop Garcia nor the Portuguese Jesuits but instead only recognize their native archdeacon as the governor of their church. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=319}} After the oath, scholar [[Stephen Neill]] notes that the Knanaya priest [[Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar]] of Kallissery played a major role in the eventual schism of the St. Thomas Christians from the Roman Catholic Church. Being a skilled Syriac writer, it is believed that Itty Thommen forged two letters supposedly from Mor Ahatallah one of which stated that in the absence of a bishop, twelve priests could lay hands on Archdeacon Thomas and consecrate him as their new patriarch, an old oriental Christian tradition. The two forged letters were read to mass crowds during church services and were received with much praise from the community. One of the letters was laid on the head of Archdeacon Thomas and twelve priests consecrated him as the first native bishop of Kerala. News of the event was spread throughout the churches of the St. Thomas Christians who accepted it with much joy in the fact that for the first time in their history a native bishop was consecrated.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=320-321}} \n\nDuring these events, nearly the entire Knanaya community had remained faithful to Archbishop Garcia, questioning the validity of Archdeacon Thomas\u2019 ordination as non-canonical, with only Itty Thommen and his parishioners at Kallissery Knanaya Church supporting the archdeacon. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=322}}{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=29-31}} Other priests of the Knanaya became aware of Itty Thommens actions and called them into question.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=322}} In October 1653, the Knanaya convened a meeting at Kottayam in-which it was decided that none of them should accept Archdeacon Thomas as their bishop, nor should any of their people meet with him. The community even resolved that a young Knanaya who had been given minor orders from Archdeacon Thomas should not be recognized as a priest. Out of the five churches of the Knanaya, Kaduthuruthy, Chunkom, Kottayam, and Udiamperoor remained staunchly faithful to Archbishop Garcia, while only Kallissery Church led by Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen remained in rebellion.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=29-31}} Northist St. Thomas Christians also almost entirely defected from Archdeacon Thomas and instead supported Thomas' cousin and rival [[Alexander De Campo|Parambil Chandy]]. Portuguese Archbishop and successor of Fransico Garcia, Giuseppe Maria Sebastiani noted that the Knanaya greatly supported Parambil Chandy even though he was a Northist St. Thomas Christian. In early 1663, the Knanaya tax-collector Pachikara Tharakan of Chunkom had met with Bishop Sebastiani and pledged the support of the Knanaya community to Parambil Chandy, stating that they would always remain obedient to him \"even if all others abandoned him\". In response, Parambil Chandy expressed that he would protect and preserve the Knanaya with his life, even more than his own community the Northist{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=35-36}} Parambil Chandy would be ordained as the Catholic bishop of the St. Thomas Christians in 1663 at Kaduthuruthy Knanaya Church.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=325}} \n\nThe St. Thomas Christians would now be forever internally divide into Catholic and Malankara factions with the majority of the community who sided with Parambil Chandy creating the basis for the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Catholic]]), while the minority who remained with Archdeaon Thomas creating the [[Malankara Church]] ([[Oriental Orthodox]]){{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=86}}\n\n===Later Colonial Era===\n[[File:Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan - 18th Century.jpg|thumb|Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan]]\nIn the early 18th century (1720) the Syrian Jacobite ''Catanar'' from Kaduthuruthy Fr. Mathew Veticutel wrote a short history of the Malabar Church in Syriac, which is archived today as ''MS 1213'' at Leyden Academy Library. In contrast to the previously documented notations from European sources in the 16th and 17th centuries,  Fr. Mathew's work is the first published native account of the historical traditions of the various ancient Christian missions to India such as that of St. Thomas the Apostle, Thomas of Cana, and bishops [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth]]. Fr. Veticutel expresses that the native St. Thomas Christians had long been without priests and presbyters.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=42}} The Catholicos of the East had sent Thomas of Cana to investigate the condition of the Church in India. When Thomas returned and reported on the St. Thomas Christians, the Catholicos ordered Thomas, Uraha Mar Yoseph (Metropolitan of Edessa), presbyters and deacons, as well as men and woman from Jerusalem, Baghdad, and Nineveh to embark to India.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=43}} When the migrants arrived in the year 345, they were met by the Native St. Thomas Christians and later approached the King of Malabar from whom they received land and privileges in the form of copper plates. A town and church was then constructed in Cranganore upon which 472 houses were built in which the migrants and native St. Thomas Christians inhabited two distinct sides. {{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=44}}\n\nIn the late 18th century the Syrian Catholics could no longer tolerate the numerous abuses of power by the Roman Catholic Church towards the St. Thomas Christians which included the suppression of the Syriac Rite and the torturing of native clergy.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=15-18}} The tension between the Native Clergy and Roman Church met a breaking point when the Latin hierarchy had imprisoned and starved to death Northist ''Cathanar'' (Syriac priest) Chacko of Edappalli in 1774, who was wrongfully accused of stealing a monstrance.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=40-41}} After this the Malabar General Church Assembly had joined together in the venture of sending a delegation to Rome in order to meet the pope and have their grievances addressed as well as petition for the ordination of a native Syrian Catholic hierarch. The Northist cathanars [[Kariattil Ousep|Ousep Cariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar|Thomman Paremmakkal]] were tasked with undertaking the journey.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=40-41}} The journey was also greatly supported and funded by two Syrian Catholic ''Tharakans'' (ministers/tax collectors), Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla  of the Knanaya Community and Thachil Mathoo of the Northist St. Thomas Christians.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=41-75}} Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan had donated 30,000 ''chakrams'' (Indian currency) to the delegation, whose journey to Rome began in his home in the village of [[Neendoor]]. From Neendoor the delegation took Poothathil's country boat all the way to [[Colachel]] on the southern tip of India, after which point they left India.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=50}} The delegation also took one boy of each ethnic group to be admitted to the Propaganda College of Rome, Chacko Malayil of the Knanaya community and Mathoo Palakkal of the Northist.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=65}}\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Early 19th Century Knanaya.png|thumb|Early 20th Century Knanaya in traditional attire and wedding crowns]]\nIn the late 19th century social changes in [[British India]] led to increased wealth and social power for the Saint Thomas Christians. This social change tended to advance internal divisions within the community, including the Southist\u2013Northist division.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=87}} Through this period the Knanaya promoted their own uniqueness and independent identity to push for further opportunities for their community. They sought the establishment of Knanaya-centred diocese' for both the Malankara and Catholic churches, which were founded in 1910 and 1911, respectively.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=87}}\n\nLike other Saint Thomas Christians, many Knanaya have migrated away from Kerala and India since the 20th century. The largest Knanaya diaspora community is located in [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|p=169}} This community originated in the 1950s when a small number of Knanaya and other Kerala natives emigrated to the area as university students; they were followed by more substantial immigration after 1965. The immigrants met up periodically for social events, and in the 1970s organizations for Catholics, members of other Christian churches, and Hindus were formed. In the 1980s the various Indian Catholic [[particular church]]es sent chaplains to Chicago; in 1983 the [[Bishop of Kottayam]] sent a chaplain to minister specifically to the Knanaya Catholics.{{sfn|Jacobsen & Raj|2008|pp=202\u2013207}}\n\n==Genome Mapping==\nA 2019 preliminary genetic analysis of the Knanaya community was undertaken by American geneticist Dr. Razib Khan. Dr. Khan compared four samples of the Knanaya to four samples of the broad Northist St. Thomas Christians by way of genome mapping.{{sfn|Khan|2019|}} Dr. Khan noted the following when comparing the two communities: <blockquote>\"It does seem in relation to the other more generically labeled St. Thomas Christians the four Knanaya show some noticeable Middle Eastern shift.\"{{sfn|Khan|2019|}}</blockquote> The study also used the Treemix tool (a method for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in the history of a set of populations) and noted that the Knanaya were again different from other St. Thomas Christians. After running the Treemix tool, Dr. Khan noted the following about the Knanayas genetic composition:<blockquote> \"...the Knanaya group was different from the other St. Thomas Christians, having a closer position to West Eurasians\".{{sfn|Khan|2019|}}</blockquote>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Knanaya Wedding.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Wedding Mid-20th Century]]\nLike other Saint Thomas Christians, Southist culture is largely derived from [[Syriac Christian]] culture mixed with local Indian customs, with later elements derived from Indian and European contacts. However the Knanaya maintain a unique sub-culture of their own and a number of scholars have found that the distinct traditions and customs of the Knanaya are similar to those of the [[Cochin Jews]] of Kerala. This can be seen through the similarity in folk songs and folk traditions which may reflect the Knanaya's claimed Judeo-Christian ancestry.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}} Scholar of Cochin Jewish culture and history P.M. Jussay notes the following about the cultural similarities: <blockquote>\u201cIn the many splendoured wonder of Kerala\u2019s population, the critical observer is intrigued by the striking similarities that exist between two small communities - the Cochin Jews and the Knanite Christians. Neither of them is said to be of the soil; but having taken root and flourished for long in this fertile land, they have been indistinguishably integrated with its colours and contours. The similarities become significant when the Knanites claim a Jewish origin\u201d</blockquote>{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118}}\n\n===Religious traditions===\nTraditionally the Knanaya have followed the religious traditions and practices of the wider Saint Thomas Christian community. In the 17th century, when the Saint Thomas Christians were split into Catholic and [[Malankara Church]] factions following the [[Coonan Cross Oath]], both the Knanaya and Northist groups were internally divided.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=84\u201385, 87}} The Malankara faction became affiliated with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], an [[Oriental Orthodox]] church based in [[Syria]], while the Catholic faction is now known as the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]. Beginning in the late 19th century, both Malankara and Catholic Knanaya lobbied for their own dioceses within their respective denominations. In 1910, the Syriac Orthodox Church established a distinct Knanaya-oriented diocese in [[Chingavanam]], which reports directly to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch]]. The following year, the Catholic Church established a Knanaya Catholic [[eparchy]] (diocese) in [[Kottayam]], known as the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n===Folk songs=== \n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Knanaya Folk Songs \n| cover    = Palm Leaf Relics of Knanaya Folk Songs.jpg\n| alt      =\n| caption  = Palm Leaf Manuscripts of Knanaya Folk Songs\n| type     =\n| artist   =\n| album    =\n| released =\n| format   =\n| recorded =\n| studio   =\n| venue    =\n| genre    = Music of Medieval India\n| length   = 48:39\n| label    =\n| composer =\n| lyricist =\n| producer =\n| misc     = {{External music video|{{YouTube|9SSJRlrcYS4|\"Knanaya Folk Songs\"}}}}\n}}\nKnanaya folk songs are ancient in origins and were first written down in the 17th century on [[palm leaf manuscripts]]. The texts of the palm leaves were compiled and published in 1910 by the Knanaya scholar P.U.

According to the Cochin Jewish scholar P. M. Jussay, \"these similarities are not accidental and cannot be easily explained\".{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=32}}\n\nKnanaya \"Kuli Pattu\" or Bath Song:\n<blockquote><poem>\n''\"Ponnum methiyadimel melle melle avan natannu\n(With golden sandals he slowly walked)\n''Velli methiyadimel melle melle aval natannu''\"''\n(With silver sandals she slowly walked){{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=121}}\n</poem></blockquote>\nCochin Jewish procession song:\n<blockquote><poem>\n''\"Ponnum methiyadimel melle natannan, Chiriyanandan,\n(With golden sandals Chiriyanandan ([[Joseph Rabban]]) slowly walked)\n''Velli methiyadimel melle natannan, Chiriyanandan''\"''\n(With silver sandals Chiriyanandan (Joseph Rabban) slowly walked){{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=121}}\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nSome songs show the influence of the Hindu culture of Kerala. For instance, the Knanaya song ''Mailanjipattu'' is adapted from the Hindu song ''Krishnagatha''.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988c|pp=128\u2013133}}\n\n===Songs of Hindu Bards===\nHistorically a class of bards known as ''Panans'' would visit the homes of nobles castes in Kerala and sing songs of heroic figures as well as legendary events. After doing so the Panan would receive payment for their performance in the form of a material donation of items such as betel leaves and other types of charitable aid. Likewise, the Panans would visit the homes of the Knanaya and sing songs of the communities history and heritage. In particular, the Panans would sing of a story in the life of Thomas of Cana during the reign of Cheraman Perumal. The story is narrated from the perspective of the leader of the bards known as Tiruvaranka Panan. The contents of the story revolves around a mission bestowed to Tiruvaranka by Thomas of Cana in which he is to travel to ''Ezhathunadu'' (Sri Lanka) and implore four castes, namely carpenters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, and molders, to return to Cranganore which they had left due to an infringement on their social traditions. The four castes are initially hesitant to return to Cranganore but are persuaded by Tiruvaranka when he shows them the golden staff of Thomas of Cana which he was granted to take on his journey as a sign of goodwill. After seeing the staff the four castes are content and in their satisfaction remove their own ornaments and smelt a golden crown for Thomas of Cana which they present to him upon their return to the Cranganore. Wearing the crown, Thomas and Tiruvarankan go to meet Cheraman Perumal who is pleased with the success of their mission and grants Thomas of Cana privileges. The remainder of the song sings of the seventy-two historical privileges bestowed upon Thomas.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=427-436}}\n\n===Folk traditions===\nAfter the burning of Craganore in 1524 during a battle between the  [[Zamorin of Calicut]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin]] which the city was a part of, the homes and temples of both the Cochin Jews and Knanaya were destroyed. The Knanaya historically commemorated this loss by carrying around a handful of charred earth as a keepsake from their ancestral settlement. From this act originated the custom of including a pinch of ash from a bride's home in a knot at the end of her new dress when she went to live with her husband. On account of this, Northists sometimes derisively dub the Knanaya \"Charam kettikal\", or knot makers of ash. The Cochin Jews had a similar custom of keeping a handful of earth from the place their temples once stood.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=30}} The burning of Craganore was a vital and drastic event for both the communities and figures heavily in their stories and songs{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=123}} \n\nBoth the Knanaya and Cochin Jews maintain folk traditions based on figures and stories of the Old Testament. Both groups particularly revere [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]]; the Knanaya perform a [[circle dance]] called \"Poorva Yousepintae Vattakali\" (\"Round Dance of Old Joseph\"), while the Cochin Jews also maintain songs glorifying Joseph.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=124}} The Knanaya and Cochin Jews give local flavor to their Old Testament-based songs, stories and traditions. A Knanaya folk song about [[Book of Tobit|Tobias]] describes his wedding as including Kerala paraphernalia, while a Cochin Jewish folk song describes [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] dressed and groomed like a [[Malayali]] girl or Cochin Jewish bride. For both the Knanaya and Cochin Jews, these flourishes make Bible stories relevant to their current experience.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=125}}\n\n===Passover traditions===\n[[File:Knajewfood.jpg|thumb|Pesaha Appam and Pal]]\nThe tradition of Passover or \"Pesaha\" is practiced every Holy Thursday in the homes of the Knanaya. On the night of Holy Thursday, the \"Pesaha Appam\" or Pesaha bread is made with unleavened flour along with a sweet drink made of milk and jaggery known as \"Pesaha Pal\" (in some families banana is also a part of this custom). The first batch of Pesaha appam is decorated and blessed with palm leaves from Palm Sunday set in the shape of a cross, the Pesaha milk also shares this adornment. The first batch is said to be the most sacred and is only given to members of the family. In ritualistic practice, the family gathers in the home and the father or grandfather of the household blesses and prays over the bread and milk, often also reading a bible passage. He then cuts, portions and distributes the bread, banana, and milk to his family members, giving it to males of the household first. Traditionally after the celebration is over any waste product that was used in the ritual was burned away according to the rules of Leviticus and the sacred nature of the practice. It should also be noted that all utensils and vessels used in the process are either brand new or washed in a ceremonial manner. Pesaha is also regularly practiced in the homes of the larger St. Thomas Christian community but the scope of usage can vary based on the specific denomination and region. Distinctions also occur based on the type of bread and products used and specific rituals that take place. Additionally, if a family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but brought to them by their Syrian Christian neighbors.{{sfn|Alumkalnal|2013|pp=57-71}}\n\n===Wedding traditions===\n[[File: Knanaya Wedding Crown.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Female Vethanmudi (Royal Crowns)]]\nThe Knanaya maintain distinctive wedding traditions and wedding customs that have helped to sustain their identity and culture. These traditions are an amalgamate of Judeo-Christian, Syriac, and Hindu customs, reflecting the Knanaya's claimed origins and the centuries that they have lived as a minority community in India. Historically, Knanaya marriage celebrations lasted several days, with many of the ceremonies centered around the home. In the present day, these ceremonies take place over three days and the wedding traditions can be divided into the categories of betrothal, groom, bride, reception, and miscellaneous. These ceremonies are also accompanied by numerous ancient songs characteristic of the Knanaya.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}}\n\nBetrothal customs include ''Kaipidutham'', or \"clasping of hands\". This is an initial agreement and fixing of the marriage, which involves the future bride and groom as well as their paternal uncles. The uncles clasp the hands of the betrothed in the presence of the priest at church. This symbolizes the uncles' and extended families', support and investment in the relationship.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=32-33}} Maternal uncles undertake a Maternal Uncles Agreement, at which they come together at the erection of the poles of the ''pandal'', a canopy and temporary hall set up for the wedding. The uncles from each party exchange a ''kindy'', or water bowl, for rinsing and hand washing. The dowry is also delivered by the bride's maternal uncle to the groom's uncle, and they kneel on a mat in front of a lighted lamp symbolizing Jesus and pray as though in front of an altar.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=32-33}}\n\nBride and groom participate in ceremonies in their respective homes on the eve of the wedding. The groom's ceremony is \"Antham Charthal\" which is now most commonly known as ''Chandam Charthal''. The name signifies the end or last day of the bachelor life of the boy as well as beautifying the boy. The village barber arrives at the pandal and requests permission to shave the groom three times. After receiving permission, the barber performs the ceremonial shaving (historically, this was his first shave), then takes him out to put oil on his head and bathe him, while the assembly sings ancient songs.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=33-34}} The bride's ceremony is ''Mylanchi Ideel'', or \"[[henna]] ceremony\". The bride's palms, feet, and nails are smeared with special green henna, by her maternal grandmother and aunts. Similar ceremonies are found among various ethnic groups across the Middle East, North Africa, and India; the Knanaya give it a Biblical meaning referencing the [[original sin]] of [[Eve]], stating that because Eve walked with her feet to the [[Tree of knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] and plucked its [[forbidden fruit]] with her palms, the feet and palms of the bride are smeared with henna to cleanse her of Eves original sin. The grandmother then takes the bride to be bathed and changed into a new dress.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=34-35}} Following these ceremonies the bride and groom return to the pandal for the ''Ichappad'' (sweet giving) ceremony, at which the bride and groom are fed white rice pudding with brown sugar by designated elders (paternal elders for the groom, maternal elders for the bride).{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=33-35}}\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Bar Mariam\n| cover    = Knanaya priests chant Bar Maryam.jpg\n| alt      =\n| caption  = Knanaya priests chant the \"Bar Mariam\"\n| type     =\n| artist   =\n| album    =\n| released =\n| format   =\n| recorded =\n| studio   =\n| venue    =\n| genre    = Paraliturgical\n| length   = 4:00-6:00\n| label    =\n| composer =\n| lyricist =\n| producer =\n| misc     = {{External music video|{{YouTube|tod-GfG7LTI|\"Bar Mariam\"}}}}\n}}\nPrior to entering the church for the wedding, the bride and groom greet their parents and elders for ''Sthuthi'' (\"Peace Blessing\"), where they receive blessings from their family. This is believed to be a reference to [[Sarah]] receiving her father's blessings in the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=35}} At the end of the marriage ceremony, the priests and congregation sing the \"[[Bar Mariam]]\" (\"Son of Mary\"), a \"paraliturgical\" Syriac chant referencing events from Jesus' life. After the chant, the priests bless the newlyweds with holy water to conclude the ceremony.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=35}}{{sfn|Palackal and Simon|2015}}\n\nThe [[wedding reception]] features several traditions. After the wedding, the assembly holds a great procession to the reception place, including celebratory music and a distinct ritualistic cheer known as \u201cNada Villi\u201d. In the end, the bride and groom are carried by their uncles up to the door.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}} In the reception pandal, the groom's mother leads the ''Nellum Neerum'' (\"Welcome Blessing\") to solemnly welcome the newlyweds. The groom's sister holds a lighted brass lamp and a bowl of water, paddy, and leaves from [[Palm Sunday]], symbolizing purification and fertility. The mother traces the [[sign of the cross]] on the couples' foreheads with a wet piece of palm leaf.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Special seats called ''manarcolam'' (marriage venue) are prepared for the couple by spreading sheets of wool and white linen, representing the hardships and blessings of married life.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}} The bride's mother then gives the ''Vazhu Pidutham'' (Mother's blessing) while placing her hands crosswise on the couple's heads, and all the women present sing the wedding song \"Vazhvenna Vazvhu\".{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Following the mother's blessing, relatives present gifts in ''Kacha Thazhukal'' (\"Gift Giving\"). The first gift is a new dress given to the bride's family; family members then remove their gold jewelry and place them on the newlyweds.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Afterward is the presentation of milk and fruit, which the couple drinks from the same cup.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}}\n\nAfter the reception is the ''Adachu Thura'' (Bridal Chamber Ceremony), where the bride's mother brings the groom special sweets and foods. The couple and their elders and friends enter the bridal chamber, where the bride's mother promises utensils and ornaments to the groom. They then exit the chamber and the bride and groom are anointed with oil and bathed. They put on new clothes and share a meal with the attendees. Special songs accompany each step.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=38}} Another miscellaneous tradition is the ''Margam Kali'' (\"The Way\", referring to the way of [[Thomas the Apostle]]), a traditional St. Thomas Christian dance. The dance and accompanying songs retell the story of Thomas and his mission to India. {{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\n===Food===\nThe Knanaya make several special foods. ''Pidy'' is a [[rice ball]] dish traditionally made when sending pregnant women home for a delivery, and some other occasions. ''Venpachor'' is a white rice pudding prepared on the eve of a wedding for the ceremonies of ''Chandam Charthal'' and ''Mylanchi Ideel''. Other bread-based foods and snacks favored by the Knanaya but consumed by the entire Kerala community are [[Achappam]], [[Kuzhalappam]], Avalosunda, and Churutt.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=28}}\n\nKnanaya historically ate on two plantain leaves, one placed over the other. According to folk tradition, this was a royal privilege granted to the community. Today, the Knanaya symbolize this by folding the left side of a plantain leaf underneath to make one leaf as two.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=29}} Knanaya eating together would eat from the same plantain leaf as a sign of cordiality. Catholic and Orthodox Knanaya dining together would eat from the left and right side of the leaf to show that despite their different religious affiliations, they were still part of a united ethnic community.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=28-29}}\n\n===Dress and ornaments===\nKnanaya women historically wore gold earrings with balls and small raised heads, one inch in diameter, known as ''Mekkamothiram'' or ''[[Kunukku]]'', the same earrings are also worn by the Northist Saint Thomas Christians. Southist and Northist women alike wear a distinct type of sari known as the ''Chatta Mundu''. This comprises the ''chatta'', a white [[blouse]] embroidered with design, and the ''mundu'' dress. The ''mundu'' is a long white cloth worn from the waist down, and includes 15 to 21 pleats covering the back thigh in a fan shape representing a palm leaf.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\nKnanaya men historically wore white shawls as a headdress and wore a white cloth wrapped around the waist. Both are tied in a special way known as ''Njettum Valum Ittu Kettuka''.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\n===Dance===\n[[File:Knanaya Margam Kali.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Margam Kali]]\nThe Knanaya maintain a distinct round dance, the [[Margamkali]], or \"the way/path\" of Thomas the Apostle. This traditional dance was historically performed among Saint Thomas Christians, but the Knanaya have played a prominent role in preserving and maintaining it since European contact. The Margamkali was traditionally a male dance exhibiting twelve players symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]] dancing in a circle around a lighted brass lamp representing Jesus. It is accompanied by ancient songs about Thomas the Apostle, based on the apocryphal 3rd-century text ''[[Acts of Thomas]]''. The song text consists of 450 lines, divided into 14 sections. These songs contain Syriac and Tamil diction, suggesting an origin before the emergence of the Malayalam language in Malabar between the 9th and 13th century.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}}\n\nThe Margamkali declined considerably after European colonization. In the 17th century, the Knanaya priest [[Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar]] revised the text, which has influenced its current structure. In 1910, scholar P.U. Luke published the text for the first time in his collection of ''Ancient Songs''.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}} In 1924 the European priest and scholar Father Hosten was enamored by the Margamkali he saw danced by the Knanaya in Kottayam. He attempted to present the dance at the 1925 Vatican Mission Exhibition, but it was not performed due to mass disapproval by Northist Saint Thomas Christians.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} In the 1960s the Saint Thomas Christian scholar of folk culture Chummar Choondal led a sociological survey of the Margamkali. He noted that by that time, it was solely practiced and propagated by the Knanaya and could not be found among Northist communities.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} Furthermore, Choondal found that all of the Margam teachers and groups of the time period were Knanaya.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} With Choondal's aid, the Knanaya priests George Karukaparambil and Jacob Vellian spearheaded research on the Margamkali in the 1970s and '80s with the help of 33 Knanaya ''ashans'' (teachers). The team systematized the Margamkali and promoted it among schools and cultural organizations. In 1995, Mar Kuriakose Kunnasserry, the bishop of the Knanaya Diocese of Kottayam, established Hadusa (Syriac for dancing/rejoicing) as an All India Institute of Christian Performing Arts.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}}\n\n===Funeral traditions===\nThe Knanaya hold to a death bed tradition based on Old Testament teachings, wherein a dying man gives a final blessing to his children and grandchildren. The father places his hand on the heads of kneeling recipients while giving the invocation.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}} Other funeral traditions include the ''Thazhukuka'', in which friends and relatives embrace a grieving family at a funeral. The family stands in line at the church as the priest sprinkles holy water on them, and friends embrace them. After the burial, the family holds a ceremony at home where they drink from a single tender coconut to symbolize their unity following the death of their loved one.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=28}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last=Alumkalnal | first=Sunish| year=2013 |title=Pesaha Celebration of Nasranis: A Sociocultural analysis| series= Journal of Indo-Judaic studies |volume=13 |ref={{sfnRef|Alumkalnal|2013}}}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ |ref={{sfnRef|Baum & Winkler|2003}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Coward|first=Harold |title=Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Perspectives and Encounters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eHgNyNimoAC&pg=PA19|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|isbn=978-81-208-1158-4 |ref={{sfnRef|Coward|1993}} }}\n*{{cite book|first=Ernst |last=Fahlbusch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&pg=PR1&dq=Fahlbusch+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity+volume+5&hl=de&sa=X&ei=4PWrUMHZIMSN4AS9joC4CQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Knanaya&f=false |title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity: Volume 5 |page=286 |isbn=9780802824172 |publisher=[[William B.
