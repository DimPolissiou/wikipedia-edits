In the UK, the acronym [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] is widely used. In contrast, in the USA, [[LGBT]] is more commonly used. The terms '[[lesbian]]', '[[gay]]', '[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]', '[[Transgender|trans]]' and '[[queer]]' are not used all around the world and definitions vary.\n\nApart from the terms above, there are other words and phrases that are used to define [[sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. These words and phrases typically come from [[western culture]]s. In contrast, in non-western cultures, the range of sexual and gender identities and practices are labelled and categorized using different languages, which naturally also involve different concepts compared to Western ones.\n\nIt is concerned with the study of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] \u2013 [[Sexual identity|sexual identities]] and [[Sexual behaviour|behaviours]] \u2013 thereby validating their unique identities and experiences. This research focus is affirmative for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as it challenges prejudiced beliefs and attitudes and discriminatory policies and practices towards the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Herek, G.

In raising this awareness, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology aims to be one of the fields in which inclusive, non-heterosexist, non-genderist approaches are applied in psychological research and practice.<ref name=\":0\" /> In line with [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology being an inclusive field of study and practice, it welcomes scholars or professionals from any branch of psychology with an interest in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] research.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Alfred Kinsey (5493900781).jpg|thumb|333px|[[Alfred Kinsey]].]]\n\n=== Sexology ===\n[[Sexology]] is a part of the historical foundation upon which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology was built.<ref name=\":2\" /> The work of early sexologists, in particular those who contributed to the establishment of [[sexology]] as a scientific field of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Androgyny|gender ambiguity]], is highly relevant and seminal to the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology.\n\nAs previously mentioned, [[sexology]] is a scientific field of study focusing on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. In the field of [[sexology]], a broad classification spectrum known as inversion, is used to define [[homosexuality]]. On this spectrum, early sexologists included both '[[Homosexuality|same-sex sexuality]]' and 'cross-gender identification' as belonging to this all-inclusive category. More contemporary sexology researchers conceptualize and categorize [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender diversity]] separately. In terms of [[LGBT|LGB]] sexualities, this would fall under [[sexual diversity]]. As for [[transsexual]]ity, this would be placed under [[gender diversity]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Important figures in this field include [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]].\n\n=== The historical emergence of 'gay affirmative' psychology ===\nGay affirmative psychology was first established in the 1970s. It was founded with the mission of 1) challenging the idea and view of [[homosexuality]] as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and 2) affirming the normal and healthy psychological functioning of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] individuals by dispelling beliefs and attitudes of [[homosexuality]] being associated with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].<ref>Brown, L. S. (1989). New voices, new visions: Toward a lesbian/gay paradigm for psychology. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 13''(4), 445\u2013458.</ref>\n\nFollowing this field's mission, most of the research conducted in this area has naturally looked at the pathologization of homosexuality. In relation to this, much attention has also been placed on [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and non-trans individuals' lived experiences.\n\nBy involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, mainstream psychological research could be more inclusive. With this in mind, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychologists hold the firm belief that psychology can truly be called the 'psychology of people' if it includes an open-minded, accepting attitude towards examining individuals from all backgrounds and their diverse lived experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, the name ''gay affirmative psychology'' changed to [[Lesbian]] and [[Gay]] psychology to denote that this branch of psychology spanned both the lives and experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian women]].<ref>Clarke, V., & Peel, E. (2007). From lesbian and gay psychology to LGBTQ psychologies: A journey into the unknown (or unknownable)? In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Later on, additional terms were included in the name of this field. Variations of LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ or LGBTQI are used to refer to the field of LGBTQ psychology.\n\nDue to the variation in the terminology to define this field, it has led to significant discussion and debate regarding which term is the most inclusive of all individuals. Though there continues to be ongoing debate surrounding the terminology used to define the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology, this in fact highlights the field's concern over the diversity in [[human sexuality]] and gender orientation. Further, the various letters within the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] acronym indicates the diversity and variation in the scope of research that is conducted within the field \u2013 namely the types of research questions and the types of methodological approaches used to address these questions.\n\nTraditionally, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology has largely focused on researching the experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian]] women meeting the following criteria:<ref>Riggs, D. W. (2007). Recognizing race in LGBTQ psychology: Power, privilege and complicity. In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref>\n\n# Young\n# Caucasian\n# Middle-class\n# Healthy\n# Residing in urban areas\n\nThe scope of research within the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology has been somewhat lacking in breadth and diversity, neglecting the experiences of those who do not fit the above stated criteria but who also rightly belong to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]].\n\nOverall, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology is a sub-discipline of psychology that incorporates multiple perspectives and approaches regarding the populations of study, topics of research, as well as the theories and methodologies that inform the ways in which this research is carried out.\n\n=== The historical emergence of critical psychology ===\nThe emergence of the field of [[critical psychology]] has led to the establishment of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] divisions within several key professional psychological associations.\n\nFirstly, within the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA),  Division 44 is known as the Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Issues. Secondly, within the [[Australian Psychological Society]], there is a Gay and Lesbian Issues and Psychology Interest Group. Thirdly, within the [[British Psychological Society]], there is a Psychology of Sexualities Section. Lastly, within the [[Canadian Psychological Association]], there is a Section on Sexual Orientation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAll the above divisions specializing in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology research and research-related issues demonstrate the increasing recognition and status of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology in major psychological organizations covering the English speaking world.\n\n=== Mental health ===\n{{See also|Mental health inequality}}\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experience a significant amount of stigma and [[discrimination]] at various stages of their lives. Often this [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] persists throughout their lifetime. Specific acts of [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals include physical and [[sexual harassment]]. [[Hate crime]]s are also included.<ref name=\":4\">Bohan, J. (1996). ''Psychology and sexual orientation: Coming to terms.'' New York: Routledge.</ref> These negative experiences put [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' physical and emotional well-being at risk. As a result of these experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals typically experience a higher frequency of [[mental health]] issues compared to those who do not belong to the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] population.<ref>Amadio, D. M., & Chung, Y. B. (2004). Internalized homophobia and substance use among lesbina, gay, and bisexual persons. ''Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services: Issues in Practice, Policy and Research, 17''(1), 83\u2013101.</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe following list shows the different mental health issues that LGBTQ individuals may experience:\n* [[Anxiety]]\n* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]\n* [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]\n* [[Phobia|Phobic disorder]]\n* [[Psychological trauma|Trauma]]\n* [[Substance abuse]]\n*[[Self-harm]]ing behaviors\n* Suicidal tendencies and [[suicide]]\nThe list above is by no means complete or exhaustive, rather it shows the range and severity of the issues that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals often experience. These issues usually result from a combination of negative experiences and a perpetual difficulty accepting their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity in an anti-LGBTQ society.<ref>Cochran, S. D. (2001). Emerging issues in research on lesbians' and gay men's mental health: Does sexual orientation really matter? American Psychologist, 56(11), 931\u2013947. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.56.11.931</nowiki></ref>\n\n[[File:Taunting 0001.jpg|thumb]]\nSuicidal tendencies and suicide [[LGBT youth vulnerability|are serious issues for LGBTQ]] youth. Compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth typically engage in a higher rate (around 3 to 4 times higher) of [[Suicide attempt|attempted suicides]]. In school, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth have a higher likelihood of experiencing [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] due to their [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[Gender expression|expression]]. [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth quickly learn from these negative social experiences that they are more likely to receive negative judgment and treatment, and often rejection, from those around them. This becomes a vicious cycle in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youths' self-beliefs and self-perceptions are negatively reinforced by society. Evidently, the high rates of mental health issues among [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] communities has been perpetuated, and continues to be so, by systemic prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals.<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C.; Ream, G. L. (2003). \"Suicide attempts among sexual-minority male youth\". ''Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology''. '''32''' (4): 509\u2013522. doi:10.1207/s15374424jccp3204_3</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals do not necessarily experience the same types of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]], nor do they respond in the same ways to [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]]. What is common are the reasons leading to [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]]. In the context of LGBTQ-targeted [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], it broadly relates to [[sexual orientation]] issues (e.g. LGB) or [[gender identity]] issues (e.g. transgender). Systemic [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] leads to [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experiencing substantial amounts of stress on a long term basis. It also influences [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to internally assimilate all the negativity they receive, emphasizing the differences they have with others. This, in turn, causes [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to experience guilt and shame regarding their identity, feelings and actions.<ref>Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence. Psychological Bulletin, 129(5), 674\u2013697. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674</nowiki></ref>\n\nThe '[[coming out]]' process involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals can also create a lot of added pressure from [[family]], peers and [[society]]. This process is about [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals openly proclaiming their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]] to others.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals also experience other negative outcomes, for example:\n\n[[Sexual orientation]] and/or [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]]\n[[Internalized oppression]] of [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]]\n* Exclusion and ostracization\n* Removed or reduced [[family]] or [[social support]]\n* Facilitating [[mental health]] well-being for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is a highly pertinent matter.\nThe main factors in promoting positive [[mental health]] for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals are as follows:<ref>Monsen, J. J., & Bayley, S. (2007). Educational psychology practice with LGB youth in schools: Individual and institutional interventions. In V. Clarke and E.

Since 2000 the average age of '[[coming out]]' was around 14. This age compared to the average age of 16 recorded between 1996 and 1998, and 20 during the 1970s, shows that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are comfortably recognizing their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] at an earlier age. Based on the large aggregate of research on identity development, in particular [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]], it appears that young people have an awareness of their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity from an early age. This awareness can be observed starting in [[childhood]], specifically the feeling of being different from their peers and non-normative appearances, behaviours and interests.\n\nDuring adolescence, there are gradual shifts in young people's attitudes and behaviours regarding themselves and others. At the beginning of [[adolescence]], young people are more aware of, and concerned about how they and others present against [[Gender norms|gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] norms. In the middle of [[adolescence]], young people tend to hold more biased, stereotypical attitudes and show more negative behaviours towards [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals and topics. It is clear that the early adolescence years make it easy for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth who have '[[Coming out|come out]]' to have negative or unpleasant social experiences. These experiences could involve peers intentionally excluding them from friendship groups, peers engaging in persistent, harmful acts of [[bullying]], and more.<ref>Goldman, L. (2007). Coming out, coming in: Nurturing the well-being and inclusion of gay youth in mainstream society. New York: Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile there appears to be more and more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth '[[coming out]]' about their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] and [[Gender identity|gender identities]], there are also youth who do not \"[[Coming out|come out]]\" and are against the idea of '[[coming out]]'. Thus far, psychological theory surrounding [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity development suggests that individuals who do not '[[Coming out|come out]]', or are against the idea of '[[coming out]]' are either in denial about their identity or wish to '[[Coming out|come out]]' but are unable to. Aside from the fact that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are more vulnerable to experiencing negative social reactions and treatment as a result of '[[coming out]]',<ref name=\":4\" /> there may also be other reasons for this. Firstly, the higher visibility of diverse sexualities and [[Gender identity|gender identities]] could influence young people in becoming more reluctant towards concretely defining their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C. (2005). ''The new gay teenager.'' Cambridge, MA: harvard University Press.</ref>(Savin-Williams, 2005). Young people are turning away from these types of labels in opposition of [[social identity]] labels, demonstrating the importance of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]] within their [[personal identity]].<ref>Cohler, B. J., & Hammack, P. L. (2007). The psychological world of the gay teenager: Social change, narrative, and 'normality'. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36''(1), 47\u201359.</ref> As well, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals from [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[cultural minority]] groups refrain from using [[sexual identity]] labels, which they see as westernized concepts that do not relate to them.<ref>Chan, C. S. (1996). Don't ask, don't tell, don't know: Sexual identity and expression among East Asian-American lesbians. In B. Zimmerman and [[Toni A. H. McNaron]] (Eds.), ''The New Lesbian Studies: Into the Twenty-First Century'' (pp.91\u201397). New York: The Feminist Press.</ref>\n\n== Schools ==\n\nCurrent data regarding [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] and their children show an increasing number of such families, as in the United States of America, and suggests that this number is continuously increasing.<ref>Byard, E., Kosciw, J., & Bartkiewicz, M. (2013). Schools and LGBT-parent families: Creating change through programming and advocacy. In A. Goldberg & K. ALlen (Eds.), ''LGBT-Parent Families''. New York, NY: Springer</ref> Children of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents are at risk of being the targets of [[discrimination]] and [[violence]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals in the education system.<ref name=\":5\">Amato, P. R. (2012). The well-being of children with gay and lesbian parents. ''Social Science Research, 41'', 771\u2013774.</ref> Therefore, this is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure the [[Physical well-being|physical]] and [[psychological well-being]] of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Apart from children of [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] having negative school experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents also face challenges with regards to anti-LGBTQ bias and related negative behaviours that are often a part of the [[school climate]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|310x310px|Gay-Straight Alliance]]\n\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents can refer to the following strategies to facilitate a more safe, positive and welcoming experience in interacting with schools and school personnel: school choice, engagement and advocacy. Many schools are not particularly inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as anti-LGBTQ language is often used and cases of [[harassment]] and [[Victimology|victimization]] with regards to [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] often occur. Therefore, parental choice of the school in which their child enrolls is crucial. As far as parents are able to select a school for their child, selecting a school that is inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is one way to ensure a more positive school experience for themselves and for their children. Parental engagement with schools in terms of volunteering and other forms of involvement, such as being on parent-teacher organizations, allows [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents to be more involved in issues which may concern their child. Parents can access resources that provide information on how parents can facilitate dialogue and collaboration with teachers and schools, enabling them to become proactive advocates of their child's education and school experience.<ref>Kosciw, J.G., & Diaz, E.M. ( 2008). Involved, invisible, ignored: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender parents and their children in our nation's K-12 schools. New, NY York: GLSEN</ref>\n\nSchool-based interventions are also effective in improving the experiences of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Typically, these interventions target [[school climate]], in particular the aspects which pertain to [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Enforcing [[anti-bullying legislation|anti-bullying]]/harassment policies and laws in schools can protect students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] from being victims of [[bullying]] and [[harassment]]. Having these policies in place generally allows students to have fewer negative experiences in school, such as a lower likelihood of mistreatment by teachers and other students. Implementing professional development opportunities for school staff on how to provide appropriate support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] will not only facilitate a more positive school experience for students, but will in turn, lead to a more positive [[school climate]] in general. Using an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum where [[LGBT history|LGBTQ individuals, history and events]] are portrayed in a more positive manner allows students to become more aware and more accepting of LGBTQ-related issues. Specific ways in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] matters can be incorporated into the curriculum include: talking about diverse families (e.g. [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and [[LGBT families|LGBTQ parents]]), discussing [[LGBT history|LGBTQ history]] (e.g. talking about significant historical events and movements related to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]]), using LGBTQ-inclusive texts in class and celebrating [[List of LGBT events|LGBTQ events]] (e.g. [[LGBT History Month|LGBTQ History Month]] in October or [[LGBT Pride Month|LGBTQ Pride Month]] in June). On top of this, organizing [[LGBT student organizations|LGBTQ student clubs]] (e.g. [[Gay\u2013straight alliance|Gay-Straight Alliances]]) are a positive resource and source of support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]].<ref>Hutton, S.

For example, parents had time to think through how they felt about their child's LGB orientation, and be made aware of how their responses towards their child could potentially reflect attitudes of devaluation. Adolescents that took part in this treatment had fewer suicidal thoughts and fewer depression-related thoughts and feelings. What is especially noteworthy is that these positive gains were sustained for many youth.<ref>Jacobs, J., & Freundlich, M. (2006). Achieving permanency for LGBTQ youth.

In addition, the \"Q\" stands for [[Queer]] which includes [[Sexual identity|sexual identities]] and [[Sexual behaviour|behaviours]] that go beyond traditional sex and gender labels, roles and expectations.<ref name=\":2\">Peel, E.

In the UK, the acronym [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] is widely used. In contrast, in the USA, [[LGBT]] is more commonly used. The terms '[[lesbian]]', '[[gay]]', '[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]', '[[Transgender|trans]]' and '[[queer]]' are not used all around the world and definitions vary.\n\nApart from the terms above, there are other words and phrases that are used to define [[sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. These words and phrases typically come from [[western culture]]s. In contrast, in non-western cultures, the range of sexual and gender identities and practices are labelled and categorized using different languages, which naturally also involve different concepts compared to Western ones.\n\nIt is concerned with the study of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] \u2013 [[Sexual identity|sexual identities]] and [[Sexual behaviour|behaviours]] \u2013 thereby validating their unique identities and experiences. This research focus is affirmative for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as it challenges prejudiced beliefs and attitudes and discriminatory policies and practices towards the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Herek, G.

In raising this awareness, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology aims to be one of the fields in which inclusive, non-heterosexist, non-genderist approaches are applied in psychological research and practice.<ref name=\":0\" /> In line with [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology being an inclusive field of study and practice, it welcomes scholars or professionals from any branch of psychology with an interest in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] research.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Alfred Kinsey (5493900781).jpg|thumb|333px|[[Alfred Kinsey]].]]\n\n=== Sexology ===\n[[Sexology]] is a part of the historical foundation upon which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology was built.<ref name=\":2\" /> The work of early sexologists, in particular those who contributed to the establishment of [[sexology]] as a scientific field of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Androgyny|gender ambiguity]], is highly relevant and seminal to the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology.\n\nAs previously mentioned, [[sexology]] is a scientific field of study focusing on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. In the field of [[sexology]], a broad classification spectrum known as inversion, is used to define [[homosexuality]]. On this spectrum, early sexologists included both '[[Homosexuality|same-sex sexuality]]' and 'cross-gender identification' as belonging to this all-inclusive category. More contemporary sexology researchers conceptualize and categorize [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender diversity]] separately. In terms of [[LGBT|LGB]] sexualities, this would fall under [[sexual diversity]]. As for [[transsexual]]ity, this would be placed under [[gender diversity]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Important figures in this field include [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]].\n\n=== The historical emergence of 'gay affirmative' psychology ===\nGay affirmative psychology was first established in the 1970s. It was founded with the mission of 1) challenging the idea and view of [[homosexuality]] as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and 2) affirming the normal and healthy psychological functioning of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] individuals by dispelling beliefs and attitudes of [[homosexuality]] being associated with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].<ref>Brown, L. S. (1989). New voices, new visions: Toward a lesbian/gay paradigm for psychology. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 13''(4), 445\u2013458.</ref>\n\nFollowing this field's mission, most of the research conducted in this area has naturally looked at the pathologization of homosexuality. In relation to this, much attention has also been placed on [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and non-trans individuals' lived experiences.\n\nBy involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, mainstream psychological research could be more inclusive. With this in mind, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychologists hold the firm belief that psychology can truly be called the 'psychology of people' if it includes an open-minded, accepting attitude towards examining individuals from all backgrounds and their diverse lived experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, the name ''gay affirmative psychology'' changed to [[Lesbian]] and [[Gay]] psychology to denote that this branch of psychology spanned both the lives and experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian women]].<ref>Clarke, V., & Peel, E. (2007). From lesbian and gay psychology to LGBTQ psychologies: A journey into the unknown (or unknownable)? In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Later on, additional terms were included in the name of this field. Variations of LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ or LGBTQI are used to refer to the field of LGBTQ psychology.\n\nDue to the variation in the terminology to define this field, it has led to significant discussion and debate regarding which term is the most inclusive of all individuals. Though there continues to be ongoing debate surrounding the terminology used to define the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology, this in fact highlights the field's concern over the diversity in [[human sexuality]] and gender orientation. Further, the various letters within the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] acronym indicates the diversity and variation in the scope of research that is conducted within the field \u2013 namely the types of research questions and the types of methodological approaches used to address these questions.\n\nTraditionally, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology has largely focused on researching the experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian]] women meeting the following criteria:<ref>Riggs, D. W. (2007). Recognizing race in LGBTQ psychology: Power, privilege and complicity. In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref>\n\n# Young\n# Caucasian\n# Middle-class\n# Healthy\n# Residing in urban areas\n\nThe scope of research within the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology has been somewhat lacking in breadth and diversity, neglecting the experiences of those who do not fit the above stated criteria but who also rightly belong to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]].\n\nOverall, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology is a sub-discipline of psychology that incorporates multiple perspectives and approaches regarding the populations of study, topics of research, as well as the theories and methodologies that inform the ways in which this research is carried out.\n\n=== The historical emergence of critical psychology ===\nThe emergence of the field of [[critical psychology]] has led to the establishment of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] divisions within several key professional psychological associations.\n\nFirstly, within the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA),  Division 44 is known as the Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Issues. Secondly, within the [[Australian Psychological Society]], there is a Gay and Lesbian Issues and Psychology Interest Group. Thirdly, within the [[British Psychological Society]], there is a Psychology of Sexualities Section. Lastly, within the [[Canadian Psychological Association]], there is a Section on Sexual Orientation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAll the above divisions specializing in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology research and research-related issues demonstrate the increasing recognition and status of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology in major psychological organizations covering the English speaking world.\n\n=== Mental health ===\n{{See also|Mental health inequality}}\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experience a significant amount of stigma and [[discrimination]] at various stages of their lives. Often this [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] persists throughout their lifetime. Specific acts of [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals include physical and [[sexual harassment]]. [[Hate crime]]s are also included.<ref name=\":4\">Bohan, J. (1996). ''Psychology and sexual orientation: Coming to terms.'' New York: Routledge.</ref> These negative experiences put [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' physical and emotional well-being at risk. As a result of these experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals typically experience a higher frequency of [[mental health]] issues compared to those who do not belong to the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] population.<ref>Amadio, D. M., & Chung, Y. B. (2004). Internalized homophobia and substance use among lesbina, gay, and bisexual persons. ''Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services: Issues in Practice, Policy and Research, 17''(1), 83\u2013101.</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe following list shows the different mental health issues that LGBTQ individuals may experience:\n* [[Anxiety]]\n* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]\n* [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]\n* [[Phobia|Phobic disorder]]\n* [[Psychological trauma|Trauma]]\n* [[Substance abuse]]\n*[[Self-harm]]ing behaviors\n* Suicidal tendencies and [[suicide]]\nThe list above is by no means complete or exhaustive, rather it shows the range and severity of the issues that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals often experience. These issues usually result from a combination of negative experiences and a perpetual difficulty accepting their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity in an anti-LGBTQ society.<ref>Cochran, S. D. (2001). Emerging issues in research on lesbians' and gay men's mental health: Does sexual orientation really matter? American Psychologist, 56(11), 931\u2013947. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.56.11.931</nowiki></ref>\n\n[[File:Taunting 0001.jpg|thumb]]\nSuicidal tendencies and suicide [[LGBT youth vulnerability|are serious issues for LGBTQ]] youth. Compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth typically engage in a higher rate (around 3 to 4 times higher) of [[Suicide attempt|attempted suicides]]. In school, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth have a higher likelihood of experiencing [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] due to their [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[Gender expression|expression]]. [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth quickly learn from these negative social experiences that they are more likely to receive negative judgment and treatment, and often rejection, from those around them. This becomes a vicious cycle in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youths' self-beliefs and self-perceptions are negatively reinforced by society. Evidently, the high rates of mental health issues among [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] communities has been perpetuated, and continues to be so, by systemic prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals.<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C.; Ream, G. L. (2003). \"Suicide attempts among sexual-minority male youth\". ''Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology''. '''32''' (4): 509\u2013522. doi:10.1207/s15374424jccp3204_3</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals do not necessarily experience the same types of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]], nor do they respond in the same ways to [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]]. What is common are the reasons leading to [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]]. In the context of LGBTQ-targeted [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], it broadly relates to [[sexual orientation]] issues (e.g. LGB) or [[gender identity]] issues (e.g. transgender). Systemic [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] leads to [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experiencing substantial amounts of stress on a long term basis. It also influences [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to internally assimilate all the negativity they receive, emphasizing the differences they have with others. This, in turn, causes [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to experience guilt and shame regarding their identity, feelings and actions.<ref>Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence. Psychological Bulletin, 129(5), 674\u2013697. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674</nowiki></ref>\n\nThe '[[coming out]]' process involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals can also create a lot of added pressure from [[family]], peers and [[society]]. This process is about [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals openly proclaiming their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]] to others.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals also experience other negative outcomes, for example:\n\n[[Sexual orientation]] and/or [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]]\n[[Internalized oppression]] of [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]]\n* Exclusion and ostracization\n* Removed or reduced [[family]] or [[social support]]\n* Facilitating [[mental health]] well-being for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is a highly pertinent matter.\nThe main factors in promoting positive [[mental health]] for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals are as follows:<ref>Monsen, J. J., & Bayley, S. (2007). Educational psychology practice with LGB youth in schools: Individual and institutional interventions. In V. Clarke and E.

Since 2000 the average age of '[[coming out]]' was around 14. This age compared to the average age of 16 recorded between 1996 and 1998, and 20 during the 1970s, shows that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are comfortably recognizing their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] at an earlier age. Based on the large aggregate of research on identity development, in particular [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]], it appears that young people have an awareness of their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity from an early age. This awareness can be observed starting in [[childhood]], specifically the feeling of being different from their peers and non-normative appearances, behaviours and interests.\n\nDuring adolescence, there are gradual shifts in young people's attitudes and behaviours regarding themselves and others. At the beginning of [[adolescence]], young people are more aware of, and concerned about how they and others present against [[Gender norms|gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] norms. In the middle of [[adolescence]], young people tend to hold more biased, stereotypical attitudes and show more negative behaviours towards [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals and topics. It is clear that the early adolescence years make it easy for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth who have '[[Coming out|come out]]' to have negative or unpleasant social experiences. These experiences could involve peers intentionally excluding them from friendship groups, peers engaging in persistent, harmful acts of [[bullying]], and more.<ref>Goldman, L. (2007). Coming out, coming in: Nurturing the well-being and inclusion of gay youth in mainstream society. New York: Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile there appears to be more and more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth '[[coming out]]' about their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] and [[Gender identity|gender identities]], there are also youth who do not \"[[Coming out|come out]]\" and are against the idea of '[[coming out]]'. Thus far, psychological theory surrounding [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity development suggests that individuals who do not '[[Coming out|come out]]', or are against the idea of '[[coming out]]' are either in denial about their identity or wish to '[[Coming out|come out]]' but are unable to. Aside from the fact that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are more vulnerable to experiencing negative social reactions and treatment as a result of '[[coming out]]',<ref name=\":4\" /> there may also be other reasons for this. Firstly, the higher visibility of diverse sexualities and [[Gender identity|gender identities]] could influence young people in becoming more reluctant towards concretely defining their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C. (2005). ''The new gay teenager.'' Cambridge, MA: harvard University Press.</ref>(Savin-Williams, 2005). Young people are turning away from these types of labels in opposition of [[social identity]] labels, demonstrating the importance of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]] within their [[personal identity]].<ref>Cohler, B. J., & Hammack, P. L. (2007). The psychological world of the gay teenager: Social change, narrative, and 'normality'. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36''(1), 47\u201359.</ref> As well, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals from [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[cultural minority]] groups refrain from using [[sexual identity]] labels, which they see as westernized concepts that do not relate to them.<ref>Chan, C. S. (1996). Don't ask, don't tell, don't know: Sexual identity and expression among East Asian-American lesbians. In B. Zimmerman and [[Toni A. H. McNaron]] (Eds.), ''The New Lesbian Studies: Into the Twenty-First Century'' (pp.91\u201397). New York: The Feminist Press.</ref>\n\n== Schools ==\n\nCurrent data regarding [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] and their children show an increasing number of such families, as in the United States of America, and suggests that this number is continuously increasing.<ref>Byard, E., Kosciw, J., & Bartkiewicz, M. (2013). Schools and LGBT-parent families: Creating change through programming and advocacy. In A. Goldberg & K. ALlen (Eds.), ''LGBT-Parent Families''. New York, NY: Springer</ref> Children of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents are at risk of being the targets of [[discrimination]] and [[violence]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals in the education system.<ref name=\":5\">Amato, P. R. (2012). The well-being of children with gay and lesbian parents. ''Social Science Research, 41'', 771\u2013774.</ref> Therefore, this is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure the [[Physical well-being|physical]] and [[psychological well-being]] of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Apart from children of [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] having negative school experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents also face challenges with regards to anti-LGBTQ bias and related negative behaviours that are often a part of the [[school climate]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|310x310px|Gay-Straight Alliance]]\n\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents can refer to the following strategies to facilitate a more safe, positive and welcoming experience in interacting with schools and school personnel: school choice, engagement and advocacy. Many schools are not particularly inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as anti-LGBTQ language is often used and cases of [[harassment]] and [[Victimology|victimization]] with regards to [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] often occur. Therefore, parental choice of the school in which their child enrolls is crucial. As far as parents are able to select a school for their child, selecting a school that is inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is one way to ensure a more positive school experience for themselves and for their children. Parental engagement with schools in terms of volunteering and other forms of involvement, such as being on parent-teacher organizations, allows [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents to be more involved in issues which may concern their child. Parents can access resources that provide information on how parents can facilitate dialogue and collaboration with teachers and schools, enabling them to become proactive advocates of their child's education and school experience.<ref>Kosciw, J.G., & Diaz, E.M. ( 2008). Involved, invisible, ignored: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender parents and their children in our nation's K-12 schools. New, NY York: GLSEN</ref>\n\nSchool-based interventions are also effective in improving the experiences of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Typically, these interventions target [[school climate]], in particular the aspects which pertain to [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Enforcing [[anti-bullying legislation|anti-bullying]]/harassment policies and laws in schools can protect students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] from being victims of [[bullying]] and [[harassment]]. Having these policies in place generally allows students to have fewer negative experiences in school, such as a lower likelihood of mistreatment by teachers and other students. Implementing professional development opportunities for school staff on how to provide appropriate support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] will not only facilitate a more positive school experience for students, but will in turn, lead to a more positive [[school climate]] in general. Using an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum where [[LGBT history|LGBTQ individuals, history and events]] are portrayed in a more positive manner allows students to become more aware and more accepting of LGBTQ-related issues. Specific ways in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] matters can be incorporated into the curriculum include: talking about diverse families (e.g. [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and [[LGBT families|LGBTQ parents]]), discussing [[LGBT history|LGBTQ history]] (e.g. talking about significant historical events and movements related to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]]), using LGBTQ-inclusive texts in class and celebrating [[List of LGBT events|LGBTQ events]] (e.g. [[LGBT History Month|LGBTQ History Month]] in October or [[LGBT Pride Month|LGBTQ Pride Month]] in June). On top of this, organizing [[LGBT student organizations|LGBTQ student clubs]] (e.g. [[Gay\u2013straight alliance|Gay-Straight Alliances]]) are a positive resource and source of support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]].<ref>Hutton, S.

For example, parents had time to think through how they felt about their child's LGB orientation, and be made aware of how their responses towards their child could potentially reflect attitudes of devaluation. Adolescents that took part in this treatment had fewer suicidal thoughts and fewer depression-related thoughts and feelings. What is especially noteworthy is that these positive gains were sustained for many youth.<ref>Jacobs, J., & Freundlich, M. (2006). Achieving permanency for LGBTQ youth.

The small group of owners still faced sluggish sales, and the tower and its restaurant continued to struggle, despite features such as a [[petting zoo]] in its plaza, and a [[pay phone]] at the top billed as the \"highest pay phone in Florida.\"{{r|crow|redux}} The last owner who operated the tower as a tourist attraction was Lake Placid Tower Group owned by Mark Cambell since 1992.{{r|LPdeed|owners}} He sold it to CHL Tower Group on {{nowrap|November 6, 2003}} which has operated it as a [[Cell site|cell phone tower]] ever since.{{r|Williams|CHLdeed|Tower1|Tower2|monopole}} Even though the tower closed about 2003, it still has two red \"OPEN\" signs at its top, facing north and south.{{r|crow}} Originally, the tower above the balcony had the same basic design scheme as that below it. But after the tower closed, the portion of the tower from the balcony up was redesigned with a white and [[cyan]] (blue-green) color scheme. The limestone tile of the outer thirds of the walls was covered with white [[stucco]], and the middle thirds were covered with thin cyan-colored panels which blocked the bird's eye view.{{r|HuntImages|May2018|covers}} These panels covered the two opposing triangular openings (top and bottom) in the middle third of each wall and the breeze or fence blocks{{r|fence}} between them. The roof tracery above and the balcony below them were also painted cyan. The Tower View restaurant at the base of the tower closed in 2015.{{r|Williams|crow}} The tower is among 35 designated Lake Placid historic structures.{{r|Comprehensive}} It is one of three towers in Central Florida, including the [[Florida Citrus Tower|Citrus Tower]], built in 1956, {{convert|100|mi|km|round=5}} to the north in [[Clermont, Florida|Clermont]], and [[Bok Tower Gardens|Bok Tower]],{{r|Bok}} built in 1929, {{convert|50|mi|km|round=5}} to the north in [[Lake Wales, Florida|Lake Wales]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |refs=\n<ref name=240on27>[http://my.htn.net/lplacid/history/postcard/tower08.htm HTN archival postcard 8], \"Placid Tower ...

The monthly daily mean temperature in January, the coldest month, is {{convert|\u221220.5|\u00b0C|1}}, and in July, the warmest month, {{convert|21.4|\u00b0C|1}}, with the annual mean at {{convert|1.93|\u00b0C|1}}.
