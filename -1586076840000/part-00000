{"title_page": "H2AFX", "text_new": "{{Infobox gene}}\n'''H2A histone family member X''' (usually abbreviated as '''H2AX''') is a type of [[histone]] protein from the [[histone H2A|H2A family]] encoded by the ''H2AFX'' gene. An important phosphorylated form is \u03b3H2AX (140S), which forms when double-strand breaks appear.\n\nIn humans and other [[eukaryotes]], the [[DNA]] is wrapped around [[histone]] octamers, consisting of [[core histones]] H2A, [[Histone H2B|H2B]], [[Histone H3|H3]] and [[Histone H4|H4]], to form [[chromatin]]. H2AX contributes to [[nucleosome]]-formation, chromatin-remodeling and [[DNA repair]], and is also used ''in vitro'' as an assay for double-strand breaks in [[dsDNA]].\n\n==Formation of \u03b3H2AX==\n\nH2AX becomes phosphorylated on serine 139, then called \u03b3H2AX, as a reaction on [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)]]. The kinases of the PI3-family ([[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated]], [[Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related|ATR]] and DNA-PKcs) are responsible for this phosphorylation, especially ATM. The modification can happen accidentally during replication fork collapse or in the response to ionizing radiation but also during controlled physiological processes such as V(D)J recombination. \u03b3H2AX is a sensitive target for looking at DSBs in cells. The presence of \u03b3H2AX by itself, however, is not the evidence of the DSBs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cleaver JE, Feeney L, Revet I | year = 2011 | title = Phosphorylated H2Ax is not an unambiguous marker for DNA double strand breaks | url = | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 10 | issue = 19| pages = 3223\u20134 | pmid = 21921674 | doi = 10.4161/cc.10.19.17448 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rybak P, Hoang A, Bujnowicz L, Bernas T, Berniak K, Zar\u0119bski M, Darzynkiewicz Z, Dobrucki J | year = 2016 | title = Low level phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 (\u03b3H2AX) is not associated with DNA double-strand breaks | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 7 | issue = 31| pages = 49574\u201349587 | pmid = 27391338 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.10411 | pmc = 5226530 }}</ref> The role of the phosphorylated form of the histone in DNA repair is under discussion but it is known that because of the modification the DNA becomes less condensed, potentially allowing space for the recruitment of proteins necessary during repair of DSBs.

An important phosphorylated form is \u03b3H2AX (140S), which forms when double-strand breaks appear.\n\nIn humans and other [[eukaryotes]], the [[DNA]] is wrapped around [[histone]] octamers, consisting of [[core histones]] H2A, [[Histone H2B|H2B]], [[Histone H3|H3]] and [[Histone H4|H4]], to form [[chromatin]]. H2AX contributes to [[nucleosome]]-formation, chromatin-remodeling and [[DNA repair]], and is also used ''in vitro'' as an assay for double-strand breaks in [[dsDNA]].\n\n==Formation of \u03b3H2AX==\n\nH2AX becomes phosphorylated on serine 139, then called \u03b3H2AX, as a reaction on [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)]]. The kinases of the PI3-family ([[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated]], [[Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related|ATR]] and DNA-PKcs) are responsible for this phosphorylation, especially ATM. The modification can happen accidentally during replication fork collapse or in the response to ionizing radiation but also during controlled physiological processes such as V(D)J recombination. \u03b3H2AX is a sensitive target for looking at DSBs in cells. The presence of \u03b3H2AX by itself, however, is not the evidence of the DSBs. <ref>\nCleaver JE, Feeney L, Revet I. Phosphorylated H2Ax is not an unambiguous marker for DNA double strand breaks.

The immediate issue was Chinese official seizure of opium stocks at Canton to stop the banned [[History of opium in China|opium trade]], and threatening the death penalty for future offenders. The British government insisted on the principles of [[free trade]] and equality among nations and backed the merchants' demands. The [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] defeated the Chinese using technologically superior ships and weapons, and the British then imposed a treaty that granted territory to Western powers and opened trade with China.\n\nThe conflict had been building for decades. In the 18th century the demand for Chinese luxury goods (particularly silk, porcelain, and tea) created a trade imbalance between China and Britain. [[Global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries|European silver flowed into China]] through the [[Canton System]], which confined incoming foreign trade to the southern port city of [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. To counter this imbalance, the [[British East India Company]] began to grow [[opium]] in [[Bengal]], in present-day [[Bangladesh]], and allowed private British merchants to sell opium to Chinese smugglers for illegal sale in China. The influx of narcotics reversed the Chinese [[trade surplus]], drained the economy of silver, and increased the numbers of opium addicts inside the country, outcomes that seriously worried Chinese officials.\n\nIn 1839, the [[Daoguang Emperor]], rejecting proposals to legalise and tax opium, appointed [[Viceroy of Huguang|viceroy]] [[Lin Zexu]] to go to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] to halt the opium trade completely.<ref name=\":55\">Fay (2000) p.&nbsp;73</ref> Lin wrote to [[Queen Victoria]] an open letter in an appeal to her moral responsibility to stop the opium trade, but it was never delivered.{{sfn|Teng|Fairbank|1979|p=23}} When he failed to get a response, Lin attempted to get foreign companies to forfeit their opium stores in exchange for tea, but this failed too. Then Lin resorted to using force in the western merchants' enclave. He confiscated all supplies and ordered a blockade of foreign ships to get them to surrender their opium supply. Lin confiscated 20,283 chests of opium (approximately 1210&nbsp;tons or 2.66&nbsp;million&nbsp;pounds).<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book |title = Smuggling as Subversion: Colonialism, Indian Merchants, and the Politics of Opium, 1790\u20131843 |last=Farooqui |first=Amar |date=March 2005 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn = 0-7391-0886-7 }}</ref> The British government responded by dispatching a military force to China and in the ensuing conflict, the [[Royal Navy]] used its naval and gunnery power to inflict a series of decisive defeats on the Chinese Empire,<ref>Steve Tsang, ''A modern history of Hong Kong'' (2007) p. 3-13\"</ref> a tactic later referred to as [[gunboat diplomacy]].

The system was highly regulated by the Qing government. Foreign traders were only permitted to do business through a body of Chinese merchants known as the [[Cohong]] and were forbidden to learn Chinese. Foreigners could only live in one of the [[Thirteen Factories]] and were not allowed to enter or trade in any other part of China. Only low level government officials could be dealt with, and the imperial court could not be lobbied for any reason excepting official diplomatic missions.<ref>Hucker, Charles O.

From the mid-17th century onward around 28&nbsp;million kilograms of silver were received by China, principally from European powers, in exchange for Chinese products.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A21388322 Early American Trade], BBC</ref>\n\n=== European trade deficits ===\nA brisk trade between China and European powers continued for over a century. While this trading heavily favoured the Chinese and resulted in European nations sustaining large trade deficits, the demand for Chinese goods continued to drive commerce. In addition, the colonisation and conquest of the Americas resulted in European nations (namely Spain, Great Britain, and France) gaining access to a cheap supply of silver, resulting in European economies remaining relatively stable despite the trade deficit with China. This silver was also shipped across the Pacific Ocean to China directly, notably through the Spanish-controlled Philippines. In stark contrast to the European situation, Qing China sustained a trade surplus. Foreign silver flooded into China in exchange for Chinese goods, expanding the Chinese economy but also causing inflation and forming a Chinese reliance on European silver.<ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":48\" />\n\nThe continued economic expansion of European economies in 17th and 18th centuries gradually increased the European demand for precious metals, which were used to mint new coins; this increasing need for hard currency to remain in circulation in Europe reduced the supply of bullion available for trade in China, driving up costs and leading to competition between merchants in Europe and European merchants who traded with the Chinese.<ref name=\":45\" /> This market force resulted in a chronic trade deficit for European governments, who were forced to risk silver shortages in their domestic economies to supply the needs of their merchants in Asia (who as private enterprises still turned a profit by selling valuable Chinese goods to consumers in Europe).<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"Peyrefitte 1993, p487-503\">Peyrefitte 1993, pp. 487\u2013503</ref>  This gradual effect was greatly exacerbated by a series of large-scale colonial wars between Great Britain and Spain in the mid 18th century; these conflicts disrupted the international silver market and eventually resulted in the independence of powerful new nations, namely the United States and Mexico.<ref name=\"China: The First Opium War\" /><ref name=\":44\" /> Without cheap silver from the colonies to sustain their trade, European merchants who traded with China began to take silver directly out of circulation in the already-weakened economies of Europe to pay for goods in China.<ref name=\":45\" /> This angered governments, who saw their economies shrink as a result, and fostered a great deal of animosity towards the Chinese for their restriction of European trade.<ref name=\"Peyrefitte 1993, p487-503\" /><ref name=\"Hanes 2002\">{{cite book|title=The Opium Wars|url=https://archive.org/details/opiumwarsaddicti00hane|url-access=registration|last1=Hanes III|first1=W.

As with India, opium (then limited by distance to a dried powder, often drunk with tea or water) was introduced to China and Southeast Asia by Arab merchants.<ref name=\":47\">Fay (2000) pp. 38</ref> The [[Ming dynasty]] banned [[tobacco]] as a decadent good in 1640, and opium was seen as a similarly minor issue. The first restrictions on opium were passed by the Qing in 1729 when [[Madak]] (a substance made from powdered opium blended with tobacco) was banned.<ref name=\":55\" /> At the time, Madak production used up most of the opium being imported into China, as pure opium was difficult to preserve. Consumption of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] opium rose in the 18th century, and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] resulted in the British occupying [[Java]], British merchants became the primary traders in opium.<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 74, 75</ref> The British realised they could reduce their trade deficit with Chinese manufactories by counter-trading in narcotic opium, and as such efforts were made to produce more opium in [[Company rule in India|the Indian colonies]]. Limited British sales of Indian opium began in 1781, with exports to China increasing as the East India Company solidified its control over India.<ref name=\":49\" /><ref name=\"Hanes 2002\" />\n\nThe British opium was produced in [[Bengal]] and the [[Ganges River Plain]]. Rather than develop the Indian opium industry themselves, the British were able to inherit an existing opium industry from the declining [[Mughal Empire]], which had for centuries profited by selling unrefined opium inside the empire. However, unlike the Mughals the British saw opium as a potentially valuable export.<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 42</ref> The East India Company itself neither produced nor shipped opium, but did set the horticultural laws allowing for opium cultivation and actively facilitated the transport of the drug to company-controlled ports.<ref name=\":45\">Fay (2000) pp. 75\u201381</ref> From [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], the company's Board of Customs, Salt, and Opium concerned itself with [[quality control]] by managing the way opium was packaged and shipped. No poppies could be cultivated without the company's permission, and the company banned private businesses from refining opium. All opium in India was sold to the company at a fixed rate, and the company hosted a series of public opium auctions every year from November to March. The difference of the company-set price of raw opium and the sale price of refined opium at auction (minus expenses) was profit made by the East India Company.<ref name=\":44\" /> In addition to securing poppies cultivated on lands under its direct control, the company's board issued licences to the independent [[princely states]] of [[Malwa]], where significant quantities of poppies were grown.<ref name=\":45\" />\n[[File:William John Huggins - The opium ships at Lintin, China, 1824.jpg|thumb|Opium ships at [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin]], China, 1824]]\n\nBy the late 18th century, company and Malwan farmlands (which were traditionally dependent on cotton growing) had been hard hit by the introduction of factory-produced cotton cloth, which used cotton grown in [[Egypt]] or the [[American South]]. Opium was considered a lucrative replacement, and was soon being auctioned in ever larger amounts in Calcutta.<ref name=\":44\" /> Private merchants who possessed a company charter (to comply with the British royal charter for Asiatic trade) bid on and acquired goods at the Calcutta auction before sailing to Southern China. British ships brought their cargoes to islands off the coast, especially [[Lintin Island]], where Chinese traders with fast and well-armed small boats took the goods inland for distribution, paying for the opium with silver.<ref name=\":44\" /> The Qing administration initially tolerated opium importation because it created an indirect tax on Chinese subjects, as increasing the silver supply available to foreign merchants through the sale of opium encouraged Europeans to spend more money on Chinese goods. This policy provided the funds British merchants needed to then greatly increase tea exports from China to England, delivering further profits to the Qing monopoly on tea exports held by the imperial treasury and its agents in Canton.<ref>Peyrefitte, 1993 p. 520</ref><ref name=\":45\" />\n[[File:A busy stacking room in the opium factory at Patna, India. L Wellcome V0019154.jpg|thumb|Storage of opium at a British East India Company warehouse, c.\u20091850]]\n\nHowever, opium usage continued to grow in China, adversely affecting societal stability. From Canton, the habit spread outwards to the North and West, affecting members from every class of Chinese society.<ref name=\":46\" /> This spread led to the Qing government issuing an edict against the drug in 1780, followed by an outright ban in 1796, and an order from the governor of Canton to stop the trade in 1799.<ref name=\":46\">Fay (2000) pp. 73, 74</ref> To circumnavigate the increasingly stringent regulations in Canton, foreign merchants bought older ships and converted them into floating warehouses. These ships were anchored off of the Chinese coast at the mouth of the Pearl River in case the Chinese authorities moved against the opium trade, as the ships of the Chinese navy had difficulty operating in open water.<ref name=\":52\">Fay (2000) pp. 41\u201362</ref> Inbound opium ships would unload a portion of their cargo onto these floating warehouses, where the narcotic was eventually purchased by Chinese opium dealers. By implementing this system of smuggling, foreign merchants could avoid inspection by Chinese officials and prevent retaliation against the trade in legal goods, in which many smugglers also participated.<ref name=\":46\" /><ref name=\":45\" />\n\nIn the early 19th century [[Old China Trade|American merchants joined the trade]] and began to introduce [[Turkey merchant|opium from Turkey]] into the Chinese market\u2014this supply was of lesser quality but cheaper, and the resulting [[price war|competition]] among British and American merchants drove down the price of opium, leading to an increase in the availability of the drug for Chinese consumers.<ref name=\"China: The First Opium War\" /> The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable in China that Chinese opium dealers (who, unlike European merchants, could legally travel to and sell goods in the Chinese interior) began to seek out more suppliers of the drug. The resulting shortage in supply drew more European merchants into the increasingly lucrative opium trade to meet the Chinese demand.

The Thirteen Factories district of Canton continued to expand, and was labelled the \"foreign quarter.\"<ref name=\":44\" /> A small population of merchants began to stay in Canton year round (most merchants lived in Macau for the summer months, then moved to Canton in the winter),<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 72\u201375</ref> and a local chamber of commerce was formed. In the first two decades of the 19th century, the increasingly sophisticated (and profitable) trade between Europe and China allowed for a clique of European merchants to rise to positions of great importance in China.<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 72\u201381</ref> The most notable of these figures were [[William Jardine (merchant)|William Jardine]] and [[James Matheson]] (who went on to found [[Jardine Matheson]]), British merchants who operated a consignment and shipping business in Canton and Macau. While the pair dealt in legal goods, they also profited greatly from selling opium. Jardine in particular was effective in navigating the political environment of Canton to allow for more narcotics to be smuggled into China.<ref name=\":45\" /> He was also contemptuous of the Chinese legal system, and often used his economic influence to subvert Chinese authorities.<ref name=\":45\" /> This included his (with Matheson's support) petitioning for the British government to attempt to gain trading rights and political recognition from Imperial China, by force if necessary. In addition to trade, some western missionaries arrived and began to proselytise Christianity to the Chinese. While some officials tolerated this (Macau-based Jesuits had been active in China since the early 17th century), some officials clashed with Chinese Christians, raising tensions between western merchants and Qing officials.<ref name=\":50\" /><ref name=\":51\">Fay (2000) pp. 110\u2013113</ref>\n\nWhile the foreign community in Canton grew in influence, the local government began to suffer from civil discord inside China. The [[White Lotus Rebellion]] (1796\u20131804) drained the Qing dynasty's treasury of silver, forcing the government to levy increasingly heavy taxes on merchants. These taxes did not abate after the rebellion was crushed, as the Chinese government began a massive project to repair state-owned properties on the [[Yellow River]], referred to as the \"Yellow River Conservancy\".<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 57, 58, 60</ref> The merchants of Canton were further expected to make contributions to fight banditry. These taxes weighed heavily on the profits made by the Cohong merchants; by the 1830s, the once-prosperous Cohong had seen their wealth greatly reduced. In addition, the declining value of China's domestic currency resulted in many people in Canton using foreign silver coins (Spanish coins were the most valued, followed by American coins)<ref>Fay (2000) p. 68</ref> as they contained higher amounts of silver. Using western coins allowed Cantonese coiners to make many Chinese coins from melted-down western coins, greatly increasing the city's wealth, and tax revenue while tying much of the economy of the city to the foreign merchants.<ref name=\":50\" /><ref>Fay (2000) pp. 62\u201371</ref>\n\nA significant development came in 1834 when reformers (some of whom were financially backed by Jardine)<ref name=\":51\" /> in Britain, advocating for free trade, succeeded in ending the monopoly of the British East India Company under the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Charter Act]] of the previous year. This shift in trade policy ended the need for merchants to comply with the royal charter for trade in the far east; with this centuries-old restriction lifted, the British China trade was opened to private entrepreneurs, many of whom joined the highly profitable opium trade.<ref>[http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob36.html \"China: The First Opium War\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201214224/http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob36.html |date=1 December 2010 }}.

Napier was instructed to obey Chinese regulations, communicate directly with Chinese authorities, superintend trade pertaining to the contraband trade of opium, and to survey China's coastline. Upon his arrival in China, Napier tried to circumvent the restrictive system that forbade direct contact with Chinese officials by sending a letter directly to the Viceroy of Canton. The Viceroy refused to accept it, and on 2 September of that year an edict was issued that temporarily closed British trade. In response, Napier ordered two Royal Navy vessels to bombard Chinese forts on the Pearl River in a show of force. This command was followed through, but war was avoided due to Napier falling ill with typhus and ordering a retreat.

The British were allowed through and basic necessities were provided to the British by Chinese sailors, but the Chinese commander inside Kowloon fort refused to allow the locals to trade with the British and confined the townspeople inside the settlement. The situation grew more intense as the day went on, and in the afternoon Elliot issued an ultimatum that, if the Chinese refused to allow the British to purchase supplies, they would be fired upon. A 3:00 pm deadline set by Elliot passed and the British ships opened fire on the Chinese vessels. The junks returned fire, and Chinese gunners on land began to fire at the British ships. Nightfall ended the battle, and the Chinese junks withdrew, ending what would be known as the [[Battle of Kowloon]]. Many British officers wanted to launch a land attack on Kowloon fort the next day, but Elliot decided against it, stating that such an action would cause \"great injury and irritation\" to the town's inhabitants.<ref>''Correspondence Relating to China'' 1840, p. 447</ref> After the skirmish, Elliot circulated a paper in Kowloon, reading;\n\n{{quote|The men of the English nation desire nothing but peace; but they cannot submit to be poisoned and starved.

Elliot asked [[Adri\u00e3o Ac\u00e1cio da Silveira Pinto]], the Portuguese governor of Macau, to let British ships load and unload their goods there in exchange for paying rents and any duties.

However, a great deal of anger was expressed over the treatment of British diplomats and towards the protectionist trading policies of Qing China.

It barely survived a motion of non-confidence on 31 January 1840 by a majority of 21. The Tories saw the China Question as an opportunity to beat the Government, and James Graham moved a motion on 7 April 1840 in the House of Commons, censuring the Government's \"want of foresight and precaution\" and \"their neglect to furnish the superintendent at Canton with powers and instructions\" to deal with the opium trade.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bursey|title=Captain Elliot |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcOIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP192|year=2018|pages=192\u201394|isbn=9781526722577 }}</ref> This was a deliberate move of the Tories to avoid the sensitive issues of war and opium trade and to obtain maximum support for the motion within the party.<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 202</ref>  Calls for military action were met with mixed responses when the matter went before Parliament. Foreign Secretary [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]], a politician known for his aggressive foreign policy and advocacy for free trade, led the pro war camp. Palmerston strongly believed that the destroyed opium should be considered property, not contraband, and as such reparations had to be made for its destruction. He justified military action by saying that no one could \"say that he honestly believed the motive of the Chinese Government to have been the promotion of moral habits\" and that the war was being fought to stem China's balance of payments deficit.<ref name=\":33\" /> After consulting with William Jardine, the foreign secretary drafted a letter to Prime Minister [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Melbourne]] calling for a military response. Other merchants called for an opening of free trade with China, and it was commonly cited that the Chinese consumers were the driving factor of the opium trade. The periodic expulsion of British merchants from Canton and the refusal of the Qing government to treat Britain as a diplomatic equal were seen as a slight to national pride.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite web|title=Justifiers of the British Opium Trade: Arguments by Parliament, Traders, and the Times Leading Up to the Opium War|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/journal/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Su_SocSci_2008.pdf|access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref>\nFew Tory or liberal politicians supported the war.

One letter was addressed to the Elliots, the other to the Daoguang Emperor and the Qing government. The letter to the Emperor informed China that Great Britain had sent a military expeditionary force to the Chinese coast.<ref name=\"PalmerstonA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaforeignrelations.net/node/247|title=Palmerston to Emperor \u2013 Feb, 1840 {{!}} china's external relations \u2013 a history|website=www.chinaforeignrelations.net|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}</ref> In the letter, Palmerston stated that,\n\n<blockquote>These measures of hostility on the part of Great Britain against China are not only justified, but even rendered absolutely necessary, by the outrages which have been committed by the Chinese Authorities against British officers and Subjects, and these hostilities will not cease, until a satisfactory arrangement shall have been made by the Chinese Government.<ref name=\"PalmerstonA\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn his letter to the Elliots, Palmerston instructed the commanders to set up a blockade of the Pearl River and forward to a Chinese official the letter from Palmerston addressing the Chinese Emperor.

The fleet, led by [[James Scott (Royal Navy officer)|Captain James Scott]] and Superintendent Elliot, was composed of the frigate {{HMS|Samarang|1822|6}} and the steamships ''HMS Nemesis'' and {{HMS|Atalanta| 1836|6}}.<ref>Bernard, Hall (1847) p. 138</ref> Although the waterway was in places only 6 feet deep, the shallow [[Draft (hull)|drafts]] of the steamships allowed the British to approach Canton from a direction the Qing believed to be impossible.<ref>Bernard, Hall (1844) pp. 378</ref> In a series of engagements along the river from 13\u201315 March, the British captured or destroyed Chinese ships, guns, and military equipment. 9 junks, 6 fortresses, and 105 guns were destroyed or captured in what was known as the [[Broadway expedition]].<ref name=\":12\">Bernard, Hall (1847) pp. 138\u2013148</ref>\n\n[[File:Canton River and adjacent islands.jpg|thumb|left|British map of the Pearl River.]]\nWith the Pearl River cleared of Chinese defences, the British debated advancing on Canton. Although the truce had ended on 6 March, Superintendent Elliot believed that the British should negotiate with the Qing authorities from their current position of strength rather than risk a battle in Canton. The Qing army made no aggressive moves against the British and instead began to fortify the city. Chinese military engineers began to establish a number of mud earthworks on the riverbank, sank junks to create [[Blockship|riverblocks]], and started constructing [[Fire ship|fire rafts]] and gunboats. Chinese merchants were ordered to remove all of the silk and tea from Canton to impede trade, and the local populace was barred from selling food to the British ships on the river.<ref>Bernard, Hall (1844) pp. 369</ref> On 16 March a British ship approaching a Chinese fort under a flag of truce was fired upon, leading to the British setting the fort on fire with rockets. These actions convinced Elliot that the Chinese were preparing to fight, and following the return of the ships of the Broadway expedition to the fleet, the British [[Battle of Canton (March 1841)|attacked Canton]] on 18 March, taking the Thirteen Factories with very few casualties and raising the [[Union Jack]] above the British factory.<ref name=\":9\" /> The city was partially occupied by the British and trade was reopened after negotiation with the ''Cohong'' merchants. After several days of further military successes, British forces commanded the high ground around Canton. Another truce was declared on 20 March. Against the advice of some of his captains, Elliot withdrew most of the Royal Navy warships downriver to the Bocca Tigris.<ref name=\":53\" /><ref name=\":51\" />\n\n[[File:Canton from the Heights.jpg|thumb|Sketch of British soldiers occupying the high ground above Canton in 1841.]]\nIn mid April [[Yishan (official)|Yishan]] (Qishan's replacement as [[Viceroy of Liangguang]] and the Daoguang Emperor's cousin) arrived in Canton. He declared that trade should continue to remain open, sent emissaries to Elliot, and began to gather military assets outside Canton. The Qing army camped outside of the city soon numbered 50,000, and the money earned from the reopened trade was spent repairing and expanding Canton's defences. Concealed artillery batteries were built along the Pearl River, Chinese soldiers were deployed in Whampoa and the Bocca Tigris, and hundreds of small river craft were armed for war. A bulletin sent from the Daoguang Emperor commanded the Qing forces to \"Exterminate the rebels at all points,\" and orders were given to drive the British from the Pearl River before reclaiming Hong Kong and driving the invaders out of China altogether.<ref>McPherson, Carruthers (2013) p. 59</ref> This order was leaked and became widely circulated in Canton among foreign merchants, who were already suspicious of Chinese intentions after learning of the Qing military buildup. In May many ''Cohong'' merchants and their families left the city, raising further concerns about a renewal of hostilities. Rumors spread that Chinese divers were being trained to drill holes in the hulls of British ships, and that fleets of fire rafts were being prepared for deployment against the Royal Navy.<ref>Bernard, Hall (1844) p. 435</ref> During the buildup the Qing army was weakened by infighting between units and lack of confidence in Yishan, who openly distrusted Cantonese civilians and soldiers, instead choosing to rely on forces drawn from other Chinese provinces.<ref name=\":13\">Lovell, Julia (2015).&nbsp;''The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams, and the Making of Modern China''. The Overlook Press.&nbsp;{{ISBN|1468311735}}.</ref> On 20 May Yishan issued a statement, asking the \"people of Canton, and all foreign merchants who are respectfully obedient, not to tremble with alarm and be frightened out of their wits at the military hosts that are gathering around, there being no probability of hostilities.\" The next day Elliot requested that all British merchants evacuate the city by sundown, and several warships were recalled to their positions in front of Canton.<ref>McPherson, Carruthers (2013) p. 60</ref>\n\nOn the night of 21 May the Qing launched a coordinated night attack on the British army and navy.<ref name=\":8\" /> Artillery batteries hidden in Canton and on the Pearl River (many of which the British believed they had disabled earlier) opened fire, and Qing soldiers retook the British Factory. A large formation of 200 fire rafts connected by a chain was sent drifting towards the British ships at Canton, and fishing boats armed with [[Matchlock|matchlock guns]] began to engage the Royal Navy. The British warships were able to evade the attack, and stray rafts set Canton's waterfront on fire, illuminating the river and foiling the night attack. Downriver at Whampoa the Chinese attacked the British vessels at anchor there and attempted to prevent ships from reaching Canton. Having suspected an attack, (and as a consequence delaying his own offensive) Major General Gough consolidated the British forces at Hong Kong and ordered a rapid advance upriver to Canton. These reinforcements arrived on 25 May, and the British counter-attacked, taking the last four Qing forts above Canton and bombarding the city.<ref name=\":8\" /> The Qing army fled in panic when the city heights were taken, and the British pursued them into the countryside. On 29 May a crowd of around 20,000 Cantonese villagers and townspeople attacked and defeated a company of 60 Indian [[sepoy]]s in what became known as the [[Sanyuanli Incident]], and Gough ordered a retreat back to the river. The fighting subsided on 30 May 1841 and Canton came fully under British occupation.<ref name=\":30\">Wakeman, p. 14</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=J9Q1AAAAMAAJ B''ulletins and Other State Intelligence'']. 1841 p. 686</ref><ref name=\":9\" /> Following the capture of Canton the British command and the governor-general of Canton agreed to a cease-fire in the region. Under the terms of the limited peace (later widely referred to as \"The Ransom of Canton\"), the British were paid to withdraw beyond the Bogue forts, an action they completed by 31 May.<ref name=\":30\" /> The peace treaty was signed by Elliot without consulting the British army or Navy, an act which displeased General Gough.<ref>Rait (1903) p. 193</ref>\n\nThe defence of Canton was declared a diplomatic success by Yishan. In a letter to the Emperor, he wrote that the barbarians had begged \"the chief general that he would implore the great Emperor in their behalf, that he would have mercy upon them, and cause their debts to be repaid them, and graciously permit them to carry on their commerce, when they would immediately withdraw their ships from the Bocca Tigris, and never dare again to raise any disturbance.\"<ref>Rait (1903) p. 203</ref> However, General Yang Fang was reprimanded by the Emperor for his agreeing to a truce rather than forcefully resisting the British.<ref>Dillion (2010) p. 156</ref> The Emperor was not informed the British expedition had not been defeated and was very much intact.

Just as with the Chinese commanders, the British leaders debated how the war should be continued. Elliot wanted to cease military operations and reopen trade, while Major General Gough wanted to capture the city of Amoy and blockade the Yangtze River.<ref>Rait (1903) p. 204</ref> In July a typhoon struck Hong Kong, damaging British ships in the harbour and destroying some of the facilities the expedition was building on the island.<ref>Rait (1903) p. 202</ref> The situation changed when on 29 July Elliot was informed that he had been replaced as Superintendent by [[Henry Pottinger]], who arrived in Hong Kong on 10 August to begin his administration. Pottinger wanted to negotiate terms with the Qing for the entire country of China, rather than just the Pearl River, and so he turned away Chinese envoys from Canton and gave permission for the expeditionary force to proceed with its war plans. [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Shenstone|Admiral Sir William Parker]] also arrived in Hong Kong to replace [[Humphrey Fleming Senhouse]] (who had died of a fever on 29 June) as the commander of the British naval forces in China. It was agreed by the British commanders that combat operations should be moved north to put pressure on Peking, and on 21 August the fleet sailed for Amoy.<ref>Rait (1903) 203\u2013208</ref> [[File:18th Royal Irish at Amoy.jpg|thumb|left|British troops at the [[Battle of Amoy]], 1841]]On 25 August the British fleet entered the [[Jiulong River]] estuary and arrived at Amoy. The city was prepared for a naval assault, as Qing military engineers had built several artillery batteries into the granite cliffs overlooking the river. A purely naval assault was considered too risky by Parker, prompting Gough to order a combined naval and ground attack on the defences. On 26 August British marines and regular infantry (under the [[Suppressive fire|covering fire]] of the Royal Navy) flanked and destroyed the Chinese defences guarding the river. Several large British ships failed to destroy the largest of the Chinese batteries (which withstood over 12,000 cannonballs being fired at it),<ref>Rait (1903) p. 212</ref> so the position was scaled and [[Battle of Amoy|captured by the British infantry]]. The city of Amoy was abandoned on 27 August, and British soldiers entered the inner town where they blew up the [[Citadel|citadel's]] powder magazine. 26 Chinese junks and 128 cannons were captured, with the captured guns being thrown into the river by the British. As Lord Palmerston wanted Amoy to become an international trade port at the end of the war, Gough ordered that no looting be tolerated and had officers enforce the death penalty for anyone found to be plundering. However, many Chinese merchants refused to ask for British protection out of fear of being branded as traitors to the Qing dynasty. The British withdrew to an island on the river, where they established a small garrison and blockaded the Jiulong River. With the city empty of any army, peasants, criminals, and deserters looted the town. The Qing army retook the city and restored order several days later, after which the city governor declared that a victory had been won and 5 British ships sunk.<ref>''Frontier and Overseas Expeditions From India'', vol. 6, p. 382</ref><ref name=\":12\" /><ref>Rait (1903) pp. 208\u2013218</ref>\n\nIn Britain, changes in Parliament resulted in Lord Palmerston being removed from his post as Foreign Minister on 30 August.

The survivors of both ships were captured and marched to southern Taiwan, where they were imprisoned. 197 were executed by Qing authorities on 10 August 1842, while an additional 87 died from ill-treatment in captivity.

Chusan had been exchanged for Hong Kong on the authority of Qishan in January 1841, after which the island had been re-garrisoned by the Qing. Fearing that the Chinese would improve the island's defences, the British began a military invasion. The British attacked the Qing on 1 October. The battle of the [[Capture of Chusan (1841)|Second Capture of Chusan]] ensued. The British forces killed 1500 Qing soldiers and captured Chusan. Resulting in a reestablished British control over Dinghai's important harbour.<ref>MacPherson 1843, pp. 216, 359.</ref>\n\nOn 10 October a British naval force [[Battle of Chinhai|bombarded and captured]] a fort on the outskirts of [[Ningbo]] in central China. A battle broke out between the British army and a Chinese force of 1500 men on the road between the town of Chinhai and Ningbo, during which the Chinese were routed. Following the defeat, Chinese authorities evacuated Ningbo and the empty city was taken by the British on 13 October. An imperial cannon manufactory in the city was captured by the British, reducing the ability of the Qing to replace their lost equipment, and the fall of the city threatened the nearby [[Qiantang River]].<ref>MacPherson 1843, pp. 381\u2013385</ref><ref>Hall & Bernard 1846, p. 260</ref> The capture of Ningbo forced the British command to examine their policy towards occupied Chinese territory and [[Prize of war|prizes of war]].

British policy eventual settled that 10% of all property captured by the British expeditionary forces would be seized as war loot in retaliation for injustices done to British merchants.

In late 1841 the Daoguang Emperor discovered that his officials in Canton and Amoy had been sending him embellished reports. He ordered the governor of [[Guangxi]], [[Liang Chang-ch\u00fc]], to send him clear accounts of the events in Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts.

Chinese war junks were intended for use against pirates or equivalent types of vessels, and were most effective in close range river engagements. Due to their ships' slow speeds, Qing captains consistently found themselves sailing towards much more manoeuvrable British ships, and as a consequence the Chinese could only use their bow guns.<ref>Bingham 1843, p. 399</ref> The size of the British ships made traditional boarding tactics useless, and the junks carried smaller numbers of inferior weaponry.<ref name=\":21\" /> In addition, the Chinese ships were poorly armoured; in several battles, British shells and rockets penetrated Chinese magazines and detonated gunpowder stores. Highly manoeuvrable steamships such HMS ''Nemesis'' could decimate small fleets of junks, as the junks had little chance of catching up to and engaging the faster British steamers.<ref name=\":14\" /> The only western-style warship in the Qing Navy, the converted [[East Indiaman]] [[Porcher (1799 ship)|''Cambridge'']], was destroyed in the Battle of First Bar.<ref>Bingham (1843), p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe defensive nature of the conflict resulted in the Chinese relying heavily an extensive network of fortifications. The [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1654\u20131722) began the construction of river defences to combat pirates, and encouraged the use of western style cannons. By the time of the First Opium War, multiple forts defended most major Chinese cities and waterways. Although the forts were well armed and strategically positioned, the Qing defeat exposed major flaws in their design. The cannons used in the Qing defensive fortifications were a collection of Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, and British pieces.<ref>McPherson, Carruthers (2013) pp. 53</ref> The domestically produced Chinese cannon were crafted using sub-par forging methods, limiting their effectiveness in combat and causing excessive gun barrel wear.

The ease with which the British forces defeated the numerically superior Chinese armies damaged the Qing dynasty's prestige. The Treaty of Nanking was a step to opening the lucrative Chinese market to global commerce and the opium trade. The interpretation of the war, which was long the standard in the People's Republic of China, was summarised in 1976: The Opium War, \"in which the Chinese people fought against British aggression, marked the beginning of modern Chinese history and the start of the Chinese people's bourgeois-democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism.\"<ref name=\":26\">''The History of Modern China'' (Beijing, 1976) quoted in Janin, Hunt (1999).

The terms of these treaties undermined China's traditional mechanisms of foreign relations and methods of controlled trade. Five ports were opened for trade, gunboats, and foreign residence: Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai. Hong Kong was seized by the British to become a free and open port. Tariffs were abolished thus preventing the Chinese from raising future duties to protect domestic industries and extraterritorial practices exempted Westerners from Chinese law. This made them subject to their own civil and criminal laws of their home country. Most importantly, the opium problem was never addressed and after the treaty was signed opium addiction doubled. China was forced to pay 21 million silver [[tael]]s as an indemnity, which was used to pay compensation for the traders' opium destroyed by Commissioner Lin. A couple of years after the treaties were signed internal rebellion began to threaten foreign trade. Due to the Qing government's inability to control collection of taxes on imported goods, the British government convinced the Manchu court to allow Westerners to partake in government official affairs. By the 1850s the [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]], one of the most important bureaucracies in the Manchu Government, was partially staffed and managed by Western Foreigners.<ref name=\"Sharpe\"/> In 1858, opium was legalised, and would remain a problem.<ref>Miron, Jeffrey A. and Feige, Chris.

However, there is a revisionist interpretation, set out by the American historian [[John K.

It was an accident of history that the dynamic British commercial interests in the China trade was centered not only on tea but also on opium. If the main Chinese demand had continued to be for Indian raw cotton, or at any rate if there had been no market for opium in late-Ch\u2019ing China, as there had been none earlier, then there would have been no \u201copium war\u201d.

The Qianlong Emperor granted Lord Macartney a golden scepter, an important symbol of peace and wealth, but this was dismissed by the British as worthless. In 1806, Chinese officials compromised with the British on the murder of a Chinese man by British seamen, as Westerners refused to be punished under Chinese law, and local citizens vigorously protested what they considered a miscarriage of justice. In 1816, the Jiaqing Emperor dismissed a British embassy for their refusal to kowtow, but he sent them an apologetic letter with gifts (the British simply discarded them in a storeroom without reading). The British, on the other hand, ignored Chinese laws and warnings not to deploy military forces in Chinese waters. The British landed troops in Macao despite a Chinese and Portuguese agreement to bar foreign forces from Macao, and then in the [[War of 1812]] attacked American ships deep in the inner harbour of Canton (the Americans had previously robbed British ships in Chinese waters as well). These, in combination with the British support to Nepal during [[Sino-Nepalese War|their invasion of Tibet]] and later the [[Anglo-Nepalese War|British invasion of Nepal]] after it became Chinese tributary state, led the Chinese authorities to become highly suspicious of British intentions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Waley-Cohen |first1=Joanna |title=The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History |date=2000 |publisher=W.

The immediate issue was Chinese official seizure of opium stocks at Canton to stop the banned [[History of opium in China|opium trade]], and threatening the death penalty for future offenders. The British government insisted on the principles of [[free trade]] and equality among nations and backed the merchants' demands. The [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] defeated the Chinese using technologically superior ships and weapons, and the British then imposed a treaty that granted territory to Western powers and opened trade with China.\n\nThe conflict had been building for decades. In the 18th century the demand for Chinese luxury goods (particularly silk, porcelain, and tea) created a trade imbalance between China and Britain. [[Global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries|European silver flowed into China]] through the [[Canton System]], which confined incoming foreign trade to the southern port city of [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. To counter this imbalance, the [[British East India Company]] began to grow [[opium]] in [[Bengal]], in present-day [[Bangladesh]], and allowed private British merchants to sell opium to Chinese smugglers for illegal sale in China. The influx of narcotics reversed the Chinese [[trade surplus]], drained the economy of silver, and increased the numbers of opium addicts inside the country, outcomes that seriously worried Chinese officials.\n\nIn 1839, the [[Daoguang Emperor]], rejecting proposals to legalize and tax opium, appointed [[Viceroy of Huguang|viceroy]] [[Lin Zexu]] to go to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] to halt the opium trade completely.<ref name=\":55\">Fay (2000) p.&nbsp;73</ref> Lin wrote to [[Queen Victoria]] an open letter in an appeal to her moral responsibility to stop the opium trade, but it was never delivered.{{sfn|Teng|Fairbank|1979|p=23}} When he failed to get a response, Lin attempted to get foreign companies to forfeit their opium stores in exchange for tea, but this failed too. Then Lin resorted to using force in the western merchants' enclave. He confiscated all supplies and ordered a blockade of foreign ships to get them to surrender their opium supply. Lin confiscated 20,283 chests of opium (approximately 1210&nbsp;tons or 2.66&nbsp;million&nbsp;pounds).<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book |title = Smuggling as Subversion: Colonialism, Indian Merchants, and the Politics of Opium, 1790\u20131843 |last=Farooqui |first=Amar |date=March 2005 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn = 0-7391-0886-7 }}</ref> The British government responded by dispatching a military force to China and in the ensuing conflict, the [[Royal Navy]] used its naval and gunnery power to inflict a series of decisive defeats on the Chinese Empire,<ref>Steve Tsang, ''A modern history of Hong Kong'' (2007) p. 3-13\"</ref> a tactic later referred to as [[gunboat diplomacy]].

The system was highly regulated by the Qing government. Foreign traders were only permitted to do business through a body of Chinese merchants known as the [[Cohong]] and were forbidden to learn Chinese. Foreigners could only live in one of the [[Thirteen Factories]] and were not allowed to enter or trade in any other part of China.

From the mid-17th century onward around 28&nbsp;million kilograms of silver were received by China, principally from European powers, in exchange for Chinese products.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A21388322 Early American Trade], BBC</ref>\n\n=== European trade deficits ===\nA brisk trade between China and European powers continued for over a century. While this trading heavily favored the Chinese and resulted in European nations sustaining large trade deficits, the demand for Chinese goods continued to drive commerce. In addition, the colonization and conquest of the Americas resulted in European nations (namely Spain, Great Britain, and France) gaining access to a cheap supply of silver, resulting in European economies remaining relatively stable despite the trade deficit with China. This silver was also shipped across the Pacific Ocean to China directly, notably through the Spanish-controlled Philippines. In stark contrast to the European situation, Qing China sustained a trade surplus. Foreign silver flooded into China in exchange for Chinese goods, expanding the Chinese economy but also causing inflation and forming a Chinese reliance on European silver.<ref name=\":45\" /><ref name=\":48\" />\n\nThe continued economic expansion of European economies in 17th and 18th centuries gradually increased the European demand for precious metals, which were used to mint new coins; this increasing need for hard currency to remain in circulation in Europe reduced the supply of bullion available for trade in China, driving up costs and leading to competition between merchants in Europe and European merchants who traded with the Chinese.<ref name=\":45\" /> This market force resulted in a chronic trade deficit for European governments, who were forced to risk silver shortages in their domestic economies to supply the needs of their merchants in Asia (who as private enterprises still turned a profit by selling valuable Chinese goods to consumers in Europe).<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"Peyrefitte 1993, p487-503\">Peyrefitte 1993, pp. 487\u2013503</ref>  This gradual effect was greatly exacerbated by a series of large-scale colonial wars between Great Britain and Spain in the mid 18th century; these conflicts disrupted the international silver market and eventually resulted in the independence of powerful new nations, namely the United States and Mexico.<ref name=\"China: The First Opium War\" /><ref name=\":44\" /> Without cheap silver from the colonies to sustain their trade, European merchants who traded with China began to take silver directly out of circulation in the already-weakened economies of Europe to pay for goods in China.<ref name=\":45\" /> This angered governments, who saw their economies shrink as a result, and fostered a great deal of animosity towards the Chinese for their restriction of European trade.<ref name=\"Peyrefitte 1993, p487-503\" /><ref name=\"Hanes 2002\">{{cite book|title=The Opium Wars|url=https://archive.org/details/opiumwarsaddicti00hane|url-access=registration|last1=Hanes III|first1=W.

As with India, opium (then limited by distance to a dried powder, often drunk with tea or water) was introduced to China and Southeast Asia by Arab merchants.<ref name=\":47\">Fay (2000) pp. 38</ref> The [[Ming dynasty]] banned [[tobacco]] as a decadent good in 1640, and opium was seen as a similarly minor issue. The first restrictions on opium were passed by the Qing in 1729 when [[Madak]] (a substance made from powdered opium blended with tobacco) was banned.<ref name=\":55\" /> At the time, Madak production used up most of the opium being imported into China, as pure opium was difficult to preserve. Consumption of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] opium rose in the 18th century, and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] resulted in the British occupying [[Java]], British merchants became the primary traders in opium.<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 74, 75</ref> The British realized they could reduce their trade deficit with Chinese manufactories by counter-trading in narcotic opium, and as such efforts were made to produce more opium in [[Company rule in India|the Indian colonies]]. Limited British sales of Indian opium began in 1781, with exports to China increasing as the East India Company solidified its control over India.<ref name=\":49\" /><ref name=\"Hanes 2002\" />\n\nThe British opium was produced in [[Bengal]] and the [[Ganges River Plain]]. Rather than develop the Indian opium industry themselves, the British were able to inherit an existing opium industry from the declining [[Mughal Empire]], which had for centuries profited by selling unrefined opium inside the empire. However, unlike the Mughals the British saw opium as a potentially valuable export.<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 42</ref> The East India Company itself neither produced nor shipped opium, but did set the horticultural laws allowing for opium cultivation and actively facilitated the transport of the drug to company-controlled ports.<ref name=\":45\">Fay (2000) pp. 75\u201381</ref> From [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], the company's Board of Customs, Salt, and Opium concerned itself with [[quality control]] by managing the way opium was packaged and shipped. No poppies could be cultivated without the company's permission, and the company banned private businesses from refining opium. All opium in India was sold to the company at a fixed rate, and the company hosted a series of public opium auctions every year from November to March. The difference of the company-set price of raw opium and the sale price of refined opium at auction (minus expenses) was profit made by the East India Company.<ref name=\":44\" /> In addition to securing poppies cultivated on lands under its direct control, the company's board issued licences to the independent [[princely states]] of [[Malwa]], where significant quantities of poppies were grown.<ref name=\":45\" />\n[[File:William John Huggins - The opium ships at Lintin, China, 1824.jpg|thumb|Opium ships at [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin]], China, 1824]]\n\nBy the late 18th century, company and Malwan farmlands (which were traditionally dependent on cotton growing) had been hard hit by the introduction of factory-produced cotton cloth, which used cotton grown in [[Egypt]] or the [[American South]]. Opium was considered a lucrative replacement, and was soon being auctioned in ever larger amounts in Calcutta.<ref name=\":44\" /> Private merchants who possessed a company charter (to comply with the British royal charter for Asiatic trade) bid on and acquired goods at the Calcutta auction before sailing to Southern China. British ships brought their cargoes to islands off the coast, especially [[Lintin Island]], where Chinese traders with fast and well-armed small boats took the goods inland for distribution, paying for the opium with silver.<ref name=\":44\" /> The Qing administration initially tolerated opium importation because it created an indirect tax on Chinese subjects, as increasing the silver supply available to foreign merchants through the sale of opium encouraged Europeans to spend more money on Chinese goods. This policy provided the funds British merchants needed to then greatly increase tea exports from China to England, delivering further profits to the Qing monopoly on tea exports held by the imperial treasury and its agents in Canton.<ref>Peyrefitte, 1993 p. 520</ref><ref name=\":45\" />\n[[File:A busy stacking room in the opium factory at Patna, India. L Wellcome V0019154.jpg|thumb|Storage of opium at a British East India Company warehouse, c.\u20091850]]\n\nHowever, opium usage continued to grow in China, adversely affecting societal stability. From Canton, the habit spread outwards to the North and West, affecting members from every class of Chinese society.<ref name=\":46\" /> This spread led to the Qing government issuing an edict against the drug in 1780, followed by an outright ban in 1796, and an order from the governor of Canton to stop the trade in 1799.<ref name=\":46\">Fay (2000) pp. 73, 74</ref> To circumnavigate the increasingly stringent regulations in Canton, foreign merchants bought older ships and converted them into floating warehouses. These ships were anchored off of the Chinese coast at the mouth of the Pearl River in case the Chinese authorities moved against the opium trade, as the ships of the Chinese navy had difficulty operating in open water.<ref name=\":52\">Fay (2000) pp. 41\u201362</ref> Inbound opium ships would unload a portion of their cargo onto these floating warehouses, where the narcotic was eventually purchased by Chinese opium dealers. By implementing this system of smuggling, foreign merchants could avoid inspection by Chinese officials and prevent retaliation against the trade in legal goods, in which many smugglers also participated.<ref name=\":46\" /><ref name=\":45\" />\n\nIn the early 19th century [[Old China Trade|American merchants joined the trade]] and began to introduce [[Turkey merchant|opium from Turkey]] into the Chinese market\u2014this supply was of lesser quality but cheaper, and the resulting [[price war|competition]] among British and American merchants drove down the price of opium, leading to an increase in the availability of the drug for Chinese consumers.<ref name=\"China: The First Opium War\" /> The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable in China that Chinese opium dealers (who, unlike European merchants, could legally travel to and sell goods in the Chinese interior) began to seek out more suppliers of the drug. The resulting shortage in supply drew more European merchants into the increasingly lucrative opium trade to meet the Chinese demand.

If we confine our search for opium to the seaports, we fear the search will not be sufficiently thorough. We should also order the general commandant of the police and police- censors at the five gates to prohibit opium and to search for it at all gates. If they capture any violators, they should immediately punish them and should destroy the opium at once. As to Kwangtung [Guangdong] and Fukien [Fujian], the provinces from which opium comes, we order their viceroys, governors, and superintendents of the maritime customs to conduct a thorough search for opium, and cut off its supply.

The Thirteen Factories district of Canton continued to expand, and was labeled the \"foreign quarter.\"<ref name=\":44\" /> A small population of merchants began to stay in Canton year round (most merchants lived in Macau for the summer months, then moved to Canton in the winter),<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 72\u201375</ref> and a local chamber of commerce was formed. In the first two decades of the 19th century, the increasingly sophisticated (and profitable) trade between Europe and China allowed for a clique of European merchants to rise to positions of great importance in China.<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 72\u201381</ref> The most notable of these figures were [[William Jardine (merchant)|William Jardine]] and [[James Matheson]] (who went on to found [[Jardine Matheson]]), British merchants who operated a consignment and shipping business in Canton and Macau. While the pair dealt in legal goods, they also profited greatly from selling opium. Jardine in particular was effective in navigating the political environment of Canton to allow for more narcotics to be smuggled into China.<ref name=\":45\" /> He was also contemptuous of the Chinese legal system, and often used his economic influence to subvert Chinese authorities.<ref name=\":45\" /> This included his (with Matheson's support) petitioning for the British government to attempt to gain trading rights and political recognition from Imperial China, by force if necessary. In addition to trade, some western missionaries arrived and began to proselytize Christianity to the Chinese. While some officials tolerated this (Macau-based Jesuits had been active in China since the early 17th century), some officials clashed with Chinese Christians, raising tensions between western merchants and Qing officials.<ref name=\":50\" /><ref name=\":51\">Fay (2000) pp. 110\u2013113</ref>\n\nWhile the foreign community in Canton grew in influence, the local government began to suffer from civil discord inside China. The [[White Lotus Rebellion]] (1796\u20131804) drained the Qing dynasty's treasury of silver, forcing the government to levy increasingly heavy taxes on merchants. These taxes did not abate after the rebellion was crushed, as the Chinese government began a massive project to repair state-owned properties on the [[Yellow River]], referred to as the \"Yellow River Conservancy\".<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 57, 58, 60</ref> The merchants of Canton were further expected to make contributions to fight banditry. These taxes weighed heavily on the profits made by the Cohong merchants; by the 1830s, the once-prosperous Cohong had seen their wealth greatly reduced. In addition, the declining value of China's domestic currency resulted in many people in Canton using foreign silver coins (Spanish coins were the most valued, followed by American coins)<ref>Fay (2000) p. 68</ref> as they contained higher amounts of silver. Using western coins allowed Cantonese coiners to make many Chinese coins from melted-down western coins, greatly increasing the city's wealth, and tax revenue while tying much of the economy of the city to the foreign merchants.<ref name=\":50\" /><ref>Fay (2000) pp. 62\u201371</ref>\n\nA significant development came in 1834 when reformers (some of whom were financially backed by Jardine)<ref name=\":51\" /> in Britain, advocating for free trade, succeeded in ending the monopoly of the British East India Company under the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Charter Act]] of the previous year. This shift in trade policy ended the need for merchants to comply with the royal charter for trade in the far east; with this centuries-old restriction lifted, the British China trade was opened to private entrepreneurs, many of whom joined the highly profitable opium trade.<ref>[http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob36.html \"China: The First Opium War\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201214224/http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob36.html |date=1 December 2010 }}.

Napier was instructed to obey Chinese regulations, communicate directly with Chinese authorities, superintend trade pertaining to the contraband trade of opium, and to survey China's coastline. Upon his arrival in China, Napier tried to circumvent the restrictive system that forbade direct contact with Chinese officials by sending a letter directly to the Viceroy of Canton. The Viceroy refused to accept it, and on 2 September of that year an edict was issued that temporarily closed British trade. In response, Napier ordered two Royal Navy vessels to bombard Chinese forts on the Pearl River in a show of force. This command was followed through, but war was avoided due to Napier falling ill with typhus and ordering a retreat.

The two ships approached three Chinese war junks in the harbor and requested permission to land men in order to procure supplies. The British were allowed through and basic necessities were provided to the British by Chinese sailors, but the Chinese commander inside Kowloon fort refused to allow the locals to trade with the British and confined the townspeople inside the settlement. The situation grew more intense as the day went on, and in the afternoon Elliot issued an ultimatum that, if the Chinese refused to allow the British to purchase supplies, they would be fired upon. A 3:00 pm deadline set by Elliot passed and the British ships opened fire on the Chinese vessels. The junks returned fire, and Chinese gunners on land began to fire at the British ships. Nightfall ended the battle, and the Chinese junks withdrew, ending what would be known as the [[Battle of Kowloon]]. Many British officers wanted to launch a land attack on Kowloon fort the next day, but Elliot decided against it, stating that such an action would cause \"great injury and irritation\" to the town's inhabitants.<ref>''Correspondence Relating to China'' 1840, p. 447</ref> After the skirmish, Elliot circulated a paper in Kowloon, reading;\n\n{{quote|The men of the English nation desire nothing but peace; but they cannot submit to be poisoned and starved.

It barely survived a motion of non-confidence on 31 January 1840 by a majority of 21. The Tories saw the China Question as an opportunity to beat the Government, and James Graham moved a motion on 7 April 1840 in the House of Commons, censuring the Government's \"want of foresight and precaution\" and \"their neglect to furnish the superintendent at Canton with powers and instructions\" to deal with the opium trade.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bursey|title=Captain Elliot |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcOIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP192|year=2018|pages=192\u201394|isbn=9781526722577 }}</ref> This was a deliberate move of the Tories to avoid the sensitive issues of war and opium trade and to obtain maximum support for the motion within the party.<ref>Fay (2000) pp. 202</ref>  Calls for military action were met with mixed responses when the matter went before Parliament. Foreign Secretary [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]], a politician known for his aggressive foreign policy and advocacy for free trade, led the pro war camp. Palmerston strongly believed that the destroyed opium should be considered property, not contraband, and as such reparations had to be made for its destruction. He justified military action by saying that no one could \"say that he honestly believed the motive of the Chinese Government to have been the promotion of moral habits\" and that the war was being fought to stem China's balance of payments deficit.<ref name=\":33\" /> After consulting with William Jardine, the foreign secretary drafted a letter to Prime Minister [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Melbourne]] calling for a military response. Other merchants called for an opening of free trade with China, and it was commonly cited that the Chinese consumers were the driving factor of the opium trade. The periodic expulsion of British merchants from Canton and the refusal of the Qing government to treat Britain as a diplomatic equal were seen as a slight to national pride.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite web|title=Justifiers of the British Opium Trade: Arguments by Parliament, Traders, and the Times Leading Up to the Opium War|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/journal/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Su_SocSci_2008.pdf|access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref>\nFew Tory or liberal politicians supported the war.

One letter was addressed to the Elliots, the other to the Daoguang Emperor and the Qing government. The letter to the Emperor informed China that Great Britain had sent a military expeditionary force to the Chinese coast.<ref name=\"PalmerstonA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaforeignrelations.net/node/247|title=Palmerston to Emperor \u2013 Feb, 1840 {{!}} china's external relations \u2013 a history|website=www.chinaforeignrelations.net|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}</ref> In the letter, Palmerston stated that,\n\n<blockquote>These measures of hostility on the part of Great Britain against China are not only justified, but even rendered absolutely necessary, by the outrages which have been committed by the Chinese Authorities against British officers and Subjects, and these hostilities will not cease, until a satisfactory arrangement shall have been made by the Chinese Government.<ref name=\"PalmerstonA\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn his letter to the Elliots, Palmerston instructed the commanders to set up a blockade of the Pearl River and forward to a Chinese official the letter from Palmerston addressing the Chinese Emperor.

Although the truce had ended on 6 March, Superintendent Elliot believed that the British should negotiate with the Qing authorities from their current position of strength rather than risk a battle in Canton. The Qing army made no aggressive moves against the British and instead began to fortify the city. Chinese military engineers began to establish a number of mud earthworks on the riverbank, sank junks to create [[Blockship|riverblocks]], and started constructing [[Fire ship|fire rafts]] and gunboats. Chinese merchants were ordered to remove all of the silk and tea from Canton to impede trade, and the local populace was barred from selling food to the British ships on the river.<ref>Bernard, Hall (1844) pp. 369</ref> On 16 March a British ship approaching a Chinese fort under a flag of truce was fired upon, leading to the British setting the fort on fire with rockets.

He declared that trade should continue to remain open, sent emissaries to Elliot, and began to gather military assets outside Canton. The Qing army camped outside of the city soon numbered 50,000, and the money earned from the reopened trade was spent repairing and expanding Canton's defenses. Concealed artillery batteries were built along the Pearl River, Chinese soldiers were deployed in Whampoa and the Bocca Tigris, and hundreds of small river craft were armed for war. A bulletin sent from the Daoguang Emperor commanded the Qing forces to \"Exterminate the rebels at all points,\" and orders were given to drive the British from the Pearl River before reclaiming Hong Kong and driving the invaders out of China altogether.<ref>McPherson, Carruthers (2013) p. 59</ref> This order was leaked and became widely circulated in Canton among foreign merchants, who were already suspicious of Chinese intentions after learning of the Qing military buildup. In May many ''Cohong'' merchants and their families left the city, raising further concerns about a renewal of hostilities. Rumors spread that Chinese divers were being trained to drill holes in the hulls of British ships, and that fleets of fire rafts were being prepared for deployment against the Royal Navy.<ref>Bernard, Hall (1844) p. 435</ref> During the buildup the Qing army was weakened by infighting between units and lack of confidence in Yishan, who openly distrusted Cantonese civilians and soldiers, instead choosing to rely on forces drawn from other Chinese provinces.<ref name=\":13\">Lovell, Julia (2015).&nbsp;''The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams, and the Making of Modern China''.

A large formation of 200 fire rafts connected by a chain was sent drifting towards the British ships at Canton, and fishing boats armed with [[Matchlock|matchlock guns]] began to engage the Royal Navy. The British warships were able to evade the attack, and stray rafts set Canton's waterfront on fire, illuminating the river and foiling the night attack. Downriver at Whampoa the Chinese attacked the British vessels at anchor there and attempted to prevent ships from reaching Canton. Having suspected an attack, (and as a consequence delaying his own offensive) Major General Gough consolidated the British forces at Hong Kong and ordered a rapid advance upriver to Canton. These reinforcements arrived on 25 May, and the British counter-attacked, taking the last four Qing forts above Canton and bombarding the city.<ref name=\":8\" /> The Qing army fled in panic when the city heights were taken, and the British pursued them into the countryside. On 29 May a crowd of around 20,000 Cantonese villagers and townspeople attacked and defeated a company of 60 Indian [[sepoy]]s in what became known as the [[Sanyuanli Incident]], and Gough ordered a retreat back to the river. The fighting subsided on 30 May 1841 and Canton came fully under British occupation.<ref name=\":30\">Wakeman, p. 14</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=J9Q1AAAAMAAJ B''ulletins and Other State Intelligence'']. 1841 p. 686</ref><ref name=\":9\" /> Following the capture of Canton the British command and the governor-general of Canton agreed to a cease-fire in the region.

In a letter to the Emperor, he wrote that the barbarians had begged \"the chief general that he would implore the great Emperor in their behalf, that he would have mercy upon them, and cause their debts to be repaid them, and graciously permit them to carry on their commerce, when they would immediately withdraw their ships from the Bocca Tigris, and never dare again to raise any disturbance.\"<ref>Rait (1903) p. 203</ref> However, General Yang Fang was reprimanded by the Emperor for his agreeing to a truce rather than forcefully resisting the British.<ref>Dillion (2010) p. 156</ref> The Emperor was not informed the British expedition had not been defeated and was very much intact.

Just as with the Chinese commanders, the British leaders debated how the war should be continued. Elliot wanted to cease military operations and reopen trade, while Major General Gough wanted to capture the city of Amoy and blockade the Yangtze River.<ref>Rait (1903) p. 204</ref> In July a typhoon struck Hong Kong, damaging British ships in the harbor and destroying some of the facilities the expedition was building on the island.<ref>Rait (1903) p. 202</ref> The situation changed when on 29 July Elliot was informed that he had been replaced as Superintendent by [[Henry Pottinger]], who arrived in Hong Kong on 10 August to begin his administration. Pottinger wanted to negotiate terms with the Qing for the entire country of China, rather than just the Pearl River, and so he turned away Chinese envoys from Canton and gave permission for the expeditionary force to proceed with its war plans. [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Shenstone|Admiral Sir William Parker]] also arrived in Hong Kong to replace [[Humphrey Fleming Senhouse]] (who had died of a fever on 29 June) as the commander of the British naval forces in China. It was agreed by the British commanders that combat operations should be moved north to put pressure on Peking, and on 21 August the fleet sailed for Amoy.<ref>Rait (1903) 203\u2013208</ref> [[File:18th Royal Irish at Amoy.jpg|thumb|left|British troops at the [[Battle of Amoy]], 1841]]On 25 August the British fleet entered the [[Jiulong River]] estuary and arrived at Amoy. The city was prepared for a naval assault, as Qing military engineers had built several artillery batteries into the granite cliffs overlooking the river. A purely naval assault was considered too risky by Parker, prompting Gough to order a combined naval and ground attack on the defenses. On 26 August British marines and regular infantry (under the [[Suppressive fire|covering fire]] of the Royal Navy) flanked and destroyed the Chinese defenses guarding the river. Several large British ships failed to destroy the largest of the Chinese batteries (which withstood over 12,000 cannonballs being fired at it),<ref>Rait (1903) p. 212</ref> so the position was scaled and [[Battle of Amoy|captured by the British infantry]]. The city of Amoy was abandoned on 27 August, and British soldiers entered the inner town where they blew up the [[Citadel|citadel's]] powder magazine. 26 Chinese junks and 128 cannons were captured, with the captured guns being thrown into the river by the British. As Lord Palmerston wanted Amoy to become an international trade port at the end of the war, Gough ordered that no looting be tolerated and had officers enforce the death penalty for anyone found to be plundering. However, many Chinese merchants refused to ask for British protection out of fear of being branded as traitors to the Qing dynasty. The British withdrew to an island on the river, where they established a small garrison and blockaded the Jiulong River. With the city empty of any army, peasants, criminals, and deserters looted the town. The Qing army retook the city and restored order several days later, after which the city governor declared that a victory had been won and 5 British ships sunk.<ref>''Frontier and Overseas Expeditions From India'', vol. 6, p. 382</ref><ref name=\":12\" /><ref>Rait (1903) pp. 208\u2013218</ref>\n\nIn Britain, changes in Parliament resulted in Lord Palmerston being removed from his post as Foreign Minister on 30 August.

In late 1841 the Daoguang Emperor discovered that his officials in Canton and Amoy had been sending him embellished reports. He ordered the governor of [[Guangxi]], [[Liang Chang-ch\u00fc]], to send him clear accounts of the events in Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighboring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts.

Chinese war junks were intended for use against pirates or equivalent types of vessels, and were most effective in close range river engagements.

The cannons used in the Qing defensive fortifications were a collection of Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, and British pieces.<ref>McPherson, Carruthers (2013) pp. 53</ref> The domestically produced Chinese cannon were crafted using sub-par forging methods, limiting their effectiveness in combat and causing excessive gun barrel wear.

The ease with which the British forces defeated the numerically superior Chinese armies damaged the Qing dynasty's prestige. The Treaty of Nanking was a step to opening the lucrative Chinese market to global commerce and the opium trade. The interpretation of the war, which was long the standard in the People's Republic of China, was summarized in 1976: The Opium War, \"in which the Chinese people fought against British aggression, marked the beginning of modern Chinese history and the start of the Chinese people's bourgeois-democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism.\"<ref name=\":26\">''The History of Modern China'' (Beijing, 1976) quoted in Janin, Hunt (1999).

The terms of these treaties undermined China's traditional mechanisms of foreign relations and methods of controlled trade. Five ports were opened for trade, gunboats, and foreign residence: Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai. Hong Kong was seized by the British to become a free and open port. Tariffs were abolished thus preventing the Chinese from raising future duties to protect domestic industries and extraterritorial practices exempted Westerners from Chinese law. This made them subject to their own civil and criminal laws of their home country. Most importantly, the opium problem was never addressed and after the treaty was signed opium addiction doubled. China was forced to pay 21 million silver [[tael]]s as an indemnity, which was used to pay compensation for the traders' opium destroyed by Commissioner Lin. A couple of years after the treaties were signed internal rebellion began to threaten foreign trade. Due to the Qing government's inability to control collection of taxes on imported goods, the British government convinced the Manchu court to allow Westerners to partake in government official affairs. By the 1850s the [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]], one of the most important bureaucracies in the Manchu Government, was partially staffed and managed by Western Foreigners.<ref name=\"Sharpe\"/> In 1858, opium was legalised, and would remain a problem.<ref>Miron, Jeffrey A. and Feige, Chris.

However, there is a revisionist interpretation, set out by the American historian [[John K. Fairbank]]:\n:In demanding diplomatic equality and commercial opportunity, Britain represented all the Western states, which would sooner or later have demanded the same things if Britain had not. It was an accident of history that the dynamic British commercial interests in the China trade was centered not only on tea but also on opium. If the main Chinese demand had continued to be for Indian raw cotton, or at any rate if there had been no market for opium in late-Ch\u2019ing China, as there had been none earlier, then there would have been no \u201copium war\u201d.

China was pressing Britain just when the British faced serious pressures in the Near East, on the Indian frontier, and in Latin America. In the end, says Melancon, the government's need to maintain its honour in Britain and prestige abroad forced the decision to go to war.<ref name=\"Glenn Melancon 1840, pp 854-874\">Glenn Melancon, \"Honor in Opium?

The Qianlong Emperor granted Lord Macartney a golden scepter, an important symbol of peace and wealth, but this was dismissed by the British as worthless. In 1806, Chinese officials compromised with the British on the murder of a Chinese man by British seamen, as Westerners refused to be punished under Chinese law, and local citizens vigorously protested what they considered a miscarriage of justice. In 1816, the Jiaqing Emperor dismissed a British embassy for their refusal to kowtow, but he sent them an apologetic letter with gifts (the British simply discarded them in a storeroom without reading). The British, on the other hand, ignored Chinese laws and warnings not to deploy military forces in Chinese waters. The British landed troops in Macao despite a Chinese and Portuguese agreement to bar foreign forces from Macao, and then in the [[War of 1812]] attacked American ships deep in the inner harbour of Canton (the Americans had previously robbed British ships in Chinese waters as well). These, in combination with the British support to Nepal during [[Sino-Nepalese War|their invasion of Tibet]] and later the [[Anglo-Nepalese War|British invasion of Nepal]] after it became Chinese tributary state, led the Chinese authorities to become highly suspicious of British intentions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Waley-Cohen |first1=Joanna |title=The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History |date=2000 |publisher=W.

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare.

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble.

The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/30720498 |title=Sustainable Saffron (''Crocus sativus'' Kashmirianus) Production: Technological and Policy Interventions for Kashmir |author1=Amjad Masood Husaini |author2=Azra N.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

Varieties (not varieties in the botanical sense) from Spain, including the tradenames \"Spanish Superior\" and \"Creme\", are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish. Greek saffron produced in the town of [[Krokos]] is [[Protected designation of origin|PDO]] protected due to its particularly high-quality colour and strong flavour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety-and-quality/certification/quality-labels/eu-quality-food-and-drink/krokos-kozanis|title=Krokos Kozanis PDO |last=Bishop |first=Stephen|date=2018-04-26|website=European Commission|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> Various \"boutique\" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries\u2014some of them organically grown.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices.

Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Hausknechtii') in [[Derbent]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles,{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}} ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=17\u201318}} Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy.

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=3\u20134}} All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=4}} Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n===Harvesting===\nThe high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some 200,000 saffron stigmas to be hand-picked from 70,000 crocus flowers for each {{convert|1|lb}} of saffron product.<ref name=hooker/><ref name=cnn/>{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}}{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lak |first=Daniel |date=11 November 1998 |title=Kashmiris pin hopes on saffron |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/212491.stm |accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne freshly picked crocus flower yields an average {{Convert|30|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron or {{Convert|7|mg|oz|abbr=on}} dried; roughly 150 flowers yield {{Convert|1|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dry saffron threads; to produce {{Convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dried saffron, {{Convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of flowers are needed; {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron yields {{Convert|0.2|oz|g|abbr=on}} of dried spice.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}}\n\n=== Saffron And Its Various Parts ===\n[[File:Saffron parts.png|thumb|Saffron And Its Various Parts]]\nThe Saffron Plant, Known As Crodus Stativus, Has A Spherical Onion With A Brown Skin.

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is [[esterification|esterified]] with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are [[carbohydrate|sugars]], a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/30720498 |title=Sustainable Saffron (''Crocus sativus'' Kashmirianus) Production: Technological and Policy Interventions for Kashmir |author1=Amjad Masood Husaini |author2=Azra N.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices.

With this fall, European saffron cultivation plummeted. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century AD Moors or with the [[Avignon]] papacy in the 14th century AD.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=63}} Similarly, the spread of Islamic civilisation may have helped reintroduce the crop to Spain and Italy.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=70}}\n\nThe 14th-century [[Black Death]] caused demand for saffron-based [[medicament]]s to peak, and Europe imported large quantities of threads via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes. The theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen-week-long ''[[Saffron War]]''.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=99}} The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred corm cultivation in [[Basel]]; it thereby grew prosperous.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=101}} The crop then spread to [[Nuremberg]], where endemic and insalubrious adulteration brought on the ''Safranschou'' code\u2014whereby culprits were variously fined, imprisoned, and executed.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=103\u2013104}} Meanwhile, cultivation continued in southern France, Italy, and Spain.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=133}}\n\nThe [[Essex]] town of [[Saffron Walden]], named for its new specialty crop, emerged as a prime saffron growing and trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries but cultivation there was abandoned; saffron was re-introduced around 2013 as well as other parts of the UK (Cheshire).<ref name=BBCessex2014>{{cite news|last1=Granleese|first1=Bob|title=Interview: Meet the saffron producer: 'It seemed ridiculous that the UK didn't grow it' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/16/meet-the-saffron-producer-uk |work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Saffron spice returns to Essex after 200 years |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-29943720 |work=BBC News|date=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\nEuropeans introduced saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the [[Schwenkfelder Church]] left Europe with a trunk containing its corms. Church members had grown it widely in Europe.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}} By 1730, the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] cultivated saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was equal to gold.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=138}} Trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when many saffron-bearing merchant vessels were destroyed.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=138\u2013139}} Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=142\u2013146}} American saffron cultivation survives into modern times, mainly in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Books'''\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Celsus|first=Aulus Cornelius|translator-last=Spencer|translator-first=W.

HIV sequences obtained from these two patients using modern sequencing technologies showed that HIV genes were inactivated by replacement of tryptophan codons by stop codons, which is probably due to the action of a cellular enzyme, APOBEC. This work is a paradigm shift in HIV research that considered eradication of any HIV DNA from patients cells as a necessary step towards a possible cure. It provides opportunities for assessment of the chances for patients of a spontaneously favorable course of HIV infection, and for treatment through the use of APOBEC.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1469-0691.12807 |pmid=25366539 |pmc=4360783 |title=HIV infection en route to endogenization: Two cases |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1280\u20138 |year=2014 |last1=Colson |first1=P |last2=Ravaux |first2=I |last3=Tamalet |first3=C |last4=Glazunova |first4=O |last5=Baptiste |first5=E |last6=Chabriere |first6=E |last7=Wiedemann |first7=A |last8=Lacabaratz |first8=C |last9=Chefrour |first9=M |last10=Picard |first10=C |last11=Stein |first11=A |last12=Levy |first12=Y |last13=Raoult |first13=D }}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n=== Ban from publishing in the American Society for Microbiology ===\nIn 2006, Raoult and four other co-authors were banned for one year from publishing in the journals of the [[American Society for Microbiology]], after a reviewer for ''[[Infection and Immunity]]'' discovered that two images in a figure from the revised manuscript of a paper about mouse modelling for [[typhus]] were identical to figures from the originally submitted manuscript, even though they were supposed to represent a different experiment.

In 1852 he received expenses for a visit to Paris for the sole purpose of spotting suitable plays for adaptation, for example ''Old Joe and Young Joe''. According to ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', the dramatic and music hall newspaper of the time:\n\n<blockquote>\nhe was originally intended for a commercial life, but his love for the Drama speedily changed the directions of his pursuits. For some years he was a light comedian at the Birmingham and other country Theatres, and in 1840 he was engaged by Mr Rouse at the Grecian Saloon. Though he never entirely gave up the Stage as a profession, having been a member of the Haymarket company up to the time of his decease, it will as an industrious playwright for the minor Theatres that his name will be most familiar to the public. For the Surrey and Victoria Theatres he wrote a considerable number of pieces, and his very interesting and original drama of ''Time Tries All'', produced at the Olympic Theatre in 1849, remains one of the most popular products of his industrious pen. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHe died at Camberwell and is buried at [[Camberwell Cemeteries#Camberwell Old Cemetery|Camberwell Old Cemetery]], London.<ref>Camberwell Old Cemetery, ''London's Forgotten Valhalla'' by Ron Woollacott p 35</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nCourtney married Elizabeth Ann Norman (b. 1821), with whom he had several children: John Fuller Courtney (b. 1847), Albert Fuller Courtney (1851-1907), Rose Helena Courtney (b. 1857), Louise Marian Courtney (b. 1859), Emily Courtney (b. 1860), Clara Courtney (b. 1862), and Alice Courtney (b. 1863).\n\n== Stage performances<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">British Library Historical Collection.

In 1848 Courtney wrote a stage adaptation of ''Jane Eyre'' titled ''Jane Eyre or The Secrets of Thornfield Manor'', which was shown at the Victoria Theatre. In 1850 he was employed as a \"stock author\" for \u00a32 per week by Mr Shepherd of the [[Surrey Theatre]].  In 1852 he received expenses for a visit to Paris for the sole purpose of spotting suitable plays for adaptation, for example ''Old Joe and Young Joe''. According to ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', the dramatic and music hall newspaper of the time:\n\n<blockquote>\nhe was originally intended for a commercial life, but his love for the Drama speedily changed the directions of his pursuits. For some years he was a light comedian at the Birmingham and other country Theatres, and in 1840 he was engaged by Mr Rouse at the Grecian Saloon. Though he never entirely gave up the Stage as a profession, having been a member of the Haymarket company up to the time of his decease, it will as an industrious playwright for the minor Theatres that his name will be most familiar to the public. For the Surrey and Victoria Theatres he wrote a considerable number of pieces, and his very interesting and original drama of ''Time Tries All'', produced at the Olympic Theatre in 1849, remains one of the most popular products of his industrious pen. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHe died at Camberwell and is buried at [[Camberwell Cemeteries#Camberwell Old Cemetery|Camberwell Old Cemetery]], London.<ref>Camberwell Old Cemetery, ''London's Forgotten Valhalla'' by Ron Woollacott p 35</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nCourtney married Elizabeth Ann Norman (b. 1821), with whom he had several children: John Fuller Courtney (b. 1847), Albert Fuller Courtney (1851-1907), Rose Helena Courtney (b. 1857), Louise Marian Courtney (b. 1859), Emily Courtney (b. 1860), Clara Courtney (b. 1862), and Alice Courtney (b. 1863).\n\n== Stage performances<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">British Library Historical Collection.

incomplete. The number of infected is considered to be higher than the confirmed tally due to lack of testing; only those with severe symptoms are offered tests and this likely lags symptom onset by as much as a week. The total number of infected could be ten times higher than confirmed cases, or even more than that. Deaths are also underestimated, because some people are not tested before they die due to health system failure and many elderly people are dying at home or in nursing homes without being diagnosed with the virus. A report from [[Carlos III Health Institute]] found significant [[excess mortality]] that was not captured in official coronavirus death statistics.<ref name=\"elpais_20200403\"/> Some communities had only been able to identify half of their coronavirus deaths while others had managed to eliminate this problem after 16 March.<ref name=\":2\" /> Therefore, the number of deaths attributable to the

incomplete. The number of infected is considered to be higher than the confirmed tally due to lack of testing; only those with severe symptoms are offered tests and this likely lags symptom onset by as much as a week. The total number of infected could be ten times higher than confirmed cases, or even more than that. Deaths are also underestimated, because some people are not tested before they die due to health system failure and many elderly people are dying at home or in nursing homes without being diagnosed with the virus. A report from [[Carlos III Health Institute]] found significant [[excess mortality]] that was not captured in official coronavirus death statistics.<ref name=\"elpais_20200403\"/> Some communities had only been able to identify half of their coronavirus deaths while others had managed to eliminate this problem after 16 March.<ref name=\":2\" /> Therefore, the number of deaths attributable to the

It is situated in the southern part of the [[Bosanska Krajina]] region. As of 2013, it has a population of 10,293 inhabitants, while the town of \u0160ipovo has a population of 4,052 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality covers an area of {{convert|510|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, much of which is [[forested]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Manastir Glogovac 2.jpg|thumb|alt=|368x368px|Glogovac monastery]]\nThe [[Glogovac monastery]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] is near the town. [http://www.eparhijabihackopetrovacka.org/index.php?akcija=menu&id=manastiri] \n\n==Geography==\nIt is located between municipalities of [[Mrkonji\u0107 Grad]] in the west, [[Jezero, Republika Srpska|Jezero]] in the north, [[Jajce]] and [[Donji Vakuf]] in the east, and [[Kupres, Republika Srpska|Kupres]] (Republike Srpske) and [[Glamo\u010d]] in the south.\n\nIn the broader geographical sense, the town of \u0160ipovo is located at 44 17\u2019 north and 170 06\u2019 east, in the zone of temperately continental climate.\n\nIn the narrower geographical sense, \u0160ipovo is located in south-eastern part of Republika Srpska, with the total area of {{convert|510|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, and with population of 11,000. The population consists of 95% of Serbs and 5% of Bosniacs.\n\n\u0160ipovo is a mountain area, intersected in the west\u2013east direction by the Pliva River, whose length is about 30 kilometres of the air line, and in the south\u2013north direction by the Janj River, whose length is about 35 kilometres of the air line. Besides these two rivers, the \u0160ipovo area is also intersected by three small rivers \u2013 Soko\u010dnica, Lubovica and Volarica. The area around the mouth of the Janj River to the Pliva River is both plain and hilly, with the height of around 440 metres above sea level. It gradually slopes up to become the mountain area whose highest mountains are Vitorog (1906 m) in the south, Lisina (1335 m) in the north, Gorica (1267 m) in the east, and \u010cardak (1452 m) in the west.\n\nThe urban area lies in the northern part of the town, in the basin of the aforementioned rivers. The 60% of the population of \u0160ipovo lives in this urban area. In terms of traffic, two important roads stretch across \u0160ipovo along the valleys of the rivers Pliva and Janj: Banjaluka-\u0160ipovo-Kupres and Jezero-\u0160ipovo-Glamo\u010d. The relief of the area of \u0160ipovo consists of the following relief constituents:\n\n#the mountain massifs (Vitorog, Plazenica, Ravna Gora, Gorica, Lisina, and \u010cardak);\n#plateaus (natpoljsko-\u010dukli\u0107ka, podobzirsko-pribelja\u010dka, and stroji\u010dko-podovska);\n#the valleys of the rivers Pliva and Janj\n\n===Geological formation===\nThe forming of ground (the pedologic composition of it) and its physical and chemical characteristics are dominantly influenced by relief, geologic base, climate, and vegetation. Given aforementioned facts, there are three typical types of grounds in the area: valley ground, hill ground, and mountain ground. In the region of \u0160ipovo, there are the following types of soil: podzoli, smedja, and to some extent muck (\u010dernozem), and flotsam in the valleys of the rivers the Pliva and the Janj. The diversity of soil and other elements (like climatic regime and height above sea level) have influenced the diversity of flora and fauna in the region. In the lowest parts, there are deciduous trees (beech and hornbeam), and in the higher parts, there are evergreen trees (spruce, fir, and pine).\n\n===Vaganj cave and valley===\nThe relief of the \u0160ipovo region is mostly formed from sediment lime rocks and dolomite. The areas of lime are intersected by numerous tectonic fissures on which many forms of relief are formed valleys like Vaganj, depressions, inlets, pits, and caves. The most famous cave being Vaganj Cave ({{lang-bs|Vaganjska pe\u0107ina}}, {{lang-sr|\u0412\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u045b\u0438\u043d\u0430}}), 990 metres above sea level, decorated with countless stalactites and stalagmites.\n\n===Climate===\nIn the geomorphologic sense, \u0160ipovo is a mountain region whose average height is 800 metres above sea level. In the global climatic sense, \u0160ipovo lies in temperately continental zone, with certain differences the reason for which being variations in height above sea level, as well as topographic and vegetational elements. The air temperature is the basic climatic element. The average annual temperature is 10\u02daC, the average summer temperature is 20\u02daC, and the average winter temperature is around 0\u02daC. The average annual insolation is 1800 hours, which makes five hours per day. The average annual humidity is around 85%. Precipitations are very important climatic element. The average value of annual precipitations is 990&nbsp;mm. The average number of snowy days is 120, whereas the vegetational period lasts for about 250 days. There are a lot of foggy days in \u0160ipovo. Winds are very often in the southern part of the area (Janjska visoravan) due to intermixing of the Mediterranean and continental air masses over Janj.\n\n===Forestry and agriculture===\nOwing to all these diversities, the inhabitants of the area are given the possibility of going in for various fields of agriculture (farming, fruit growing, cattle breeding, fishing, and apiculture), tourism and so forth. Forty-eight percent (223.99&nbsp;km\u00b2) of the \u0160ipovo region is covered with forests, thirty-three percent (154.8&nbsp;km\u00b2) with meadows and pastures, fourteen percent (66.03&nbsp;km\u00b2) with fields and orchards, and four percent (17.38&nbsp;km\u00b2) with unproductive land.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Population of settlements \u2013 \u0160ipovo municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|18,035\n|16,154\n|15,751\n|10,293\n|-\n|1\n|\u010cifluk\n|\n|\n|680\n|682\n|-\n|2\n|Donji Mujd\u017ei\u0107i\n|\n|\n|169\n|200\n|-\n|3\n|Lu\u017eine\n|\n|\n|458\n|336\n|-\n|4\n|Pribeljci\n|\n|\n|617\n|202\n|-\n|5\n|Sari\u0107i\n|\n|\n|675\n|1,321\n|-\n|6\n|'''\u0160ipovo'''\n|1,333\n|3,539\n|5,170\n|4,052\n|-\n|7\n|Todori\u0107i\n|\n|\n|323\n|217\n|-\n|8\n|Volari\n|\n|\n|576\n|240\n|-\n|9\n|Vra\u017ei\u0107\n|\n|\n|340\n|282\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 \u0160ipovo town\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|4,052 (100,0%)\n|5,170 (100,0%)\n|3,539 (100,0%)\n|1,333 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|3,828 (74,04%)\n|2,211 (62,48%)\n|659 (49,44%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|1,155 (22,34%)\n|1,026 (28,99%)\n|621 (46,59%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|117 (2,263%)\n|239 (6,753%)\n|3 (0,225%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|56 (1,083%)\n|10 (0,283%)\n|1 (0,075%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|14 (0,271%)\n|16 (0,452%)\n|24 (1,800%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|15 (0,424%)\n|11 (0,825%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|14 (0,396%)\n|13 (0,975%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|6 (0,170%)\n|\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|1 (0,028%)\n|1 (0,075%)\n|-\n|Hungarians\n|\n|\n|1 (0,028%)\n|\n|}\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 \u0160ipovo municipality\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|10 ,293 (100,0%)\n|15,579 (100,0%)\n|16,154 (100,0%)\n|18,035 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|9,576 (93,03%)\n|12,333 (79,16%)\n|12,844 (79,51%)\n|14,970 (83,01%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|628 (6,101%)\n|2,965 (19,03%)\n|2,831 (17,53%)\n|2,952 (16,37%)\n|-\n|Others\n|63 (0,612%)\n|95 (0,610%)\n|68 (0,421%)\n|37 (0,205%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|26 (0,253%)\n|31 (0,199%)\n|25 (0,155%)\n|35 (0,194%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|155 (0,995%)\n|339 (2,099%)\n|9 (0,050%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|23 (0,142%)\n|17 (0,094%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|15 (0,093%)\n|13 (0,072%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|6 (0,037%)\n|1 (0,006%)\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|2 (0,012%)\n|1 (0,006%)\n|-\n|Hungarians\n|\n|\n|1 (0,006%)\n|\n|}\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Nedeljko Baji\u0107 Baja]], singer\n\n==See also==\n*[[Municipalities of Republika Srpska]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|\u0160ipovo}}\nhttps://turizamrs.org/en/sipovo/\nhttp://sipovo-tourism.com/V2/turisticki-programi/?lang=en\n\n{{Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sipovo}}\n[[Category:Populated places in \u0160ipovo]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Republika Srpska]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Republika Srpska]]\n[[Category:\u0160ipovo| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n| native_name   = \u0428\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\n| official_name = \u0160ipovo\n| other_name    = \n| settlement_type = [[List of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Town]] and [[Municipalities of Republika Srpska|municipality]]\n| subdivision_type       = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name       = [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n| subdivision_type1      = [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Entity]]\n| subdivision_name1      = [[Republika Srpska]]\n| subdivision_type2      = \n| subdivision_name2      = \n| timezone=[[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset=+1\n| timezone_DST = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST = +2\n| unit_pref = Metric\n| map_caption =Location of \u0160ipovo within Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n| image_skyline           = SIPOVO3.jpg\n| image_caption           = View on \u0160ipovo from new Municipality building\n| population_as_of= 2013 census\n| image_shield = \u0160ipovo (grb).svg\n| image_map = \u0160ipovo municipality.svg\n| area_total_km2 = 553.41\n| population_total = 10293\n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| coordinates  = {{coord|44|28|N|17|08|E|region:BA|display=inline, title}}\n| area_code    = 50\n| website      = \n| footnotes    = \n| leader_title = [[Mayor]]|\n| leader_name  = Milan Kova\u010d\n| leader_party = [[Savez nezavisnih socijaldemokrata |SNSD]]\n}}\n[[Image:\u0160ipovo.jpg|thumb|250px|\u0160ipovo panorama]]\n'''\u0160ipovo''' ({{lang-sr-cyrl|\u0428\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e}}) is a town and municipality located in [[Republika Srpska]], an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

The population consists of 95% of Serbs and 5% of Bosniacs.\n\n\u0160ipovo is a mountain area, intersected in the west\u2013east direction by the Pliva River, whose length is about 30 kilometres of the air line, and in the south\u2013north direction by the Janj River, whose length is about 35 kilometres of the air line. Besides these two rivers, the \u0160ipovo area is also intersected by three small rivers \u2013 Soko\u010dnica, Lubovica and Volarica. The area around the mouth of the Janj River to the Pliva River is both plain and hilly, with the height of around 440 metres above sea level. It gradually slopes up to become the mountain area whose highest mountains are Vitorog (1906 m) in the south, Lisina (1335 m) in the north, Gorica (1267 m) in the east, and \u010cardak (1452 m) in the west.\n\nThe urban area lies in the northern part of the town, in the basin of the aforementioned rivers. The 60% of the population of \u0160ipovo lives in this urban area. In terms of traffic, two important roads stretch across \u0160ipovo along the valleys of the rivers Pliva and Janj: Banjaluka-\u0160ipovo-Kupres and Jezero-\u0160ipovo-Glamo\u010d. The relief of the area of \u0160ipovo consists of the following relief constituents:\n\n#the mountain massifs (Vitorog, Plazenica, Ravna Gora, Gorica, Lisina, and \u010cardak);\n#plateaus (natpoljsko-\u010dukli\u0107ka, podobzirsko-pribelja\u010dka, and stroji\u010dko-podovska);\n#the valleys of the rivers Pliva and Janj\n\n===Geological formation===\nThe forming of ground (the pedologic composition of it) and its physical and chemical characteristics are dominantly influenced by relief, geologic base, climate, and vegetation. Given aforementioned facts, there are three typical types of grounds in the area: valley ground, hill ground, and mountain ground. In the region of \u0160ipovo, there are the following types of soil: podzoli, smedja, and to some extent muck (\u010dernozem), and flotsam in the valleys of the rivers the Pliva and the Janj. The diversity of soil and other elements (like climatic regime and height above sea level) have influenced the diversity of flora and fauna in the region. In the lowest parts, there are deciduous trees (beech and hornbeam), and in the higher parts, there are evergreen trees (spruce, fir, and pine).\n\n===Vaganj cave and valley===\nThe relief of the \u0160ipovo region is mostly formed from sediment lime rocks and dolomite. The areas of lime are intersected by numerous tectonic fissures on which many forms of relief are formed valleys like Vaganj, depressions, inlets, pits, and caves. The most famous cave being Vaganj Cave ({{lang-bs|Vaganjska pe\u0107ina}}, {{lang-sr|\u0412\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u045b\u0438\u043d\u0430}}), 990 metres above sea level, decorated with countless stalactites and stalagmites.\n\n===Climate===\nIn the geomorphologic sense, \u0160ipovo is a mountain region whose average height is 800 metres above sea level. In the global climatic sense, \u0160ipovo lies in temperately continental zone, with certain differences the reason for which being variations in height above sea level, as well as topographic and vegetational elements. The air temperature is the basic climatic element. The average annual temperature is 10\u02daC, the average summer temperature is 20\u02daC, and the average winter temperature is around 0\u02daC. The average annual insolation is 1800 hours, which makes five hours per day. The average annual humidity is around 85%. Precipitations are very important climatic element. The average value of annual precipitations is 990&nbsp;mm. The average number of snowy days is 120, whereas the vegetational period lasts for about 250 days. There are a lot of foggy days in \u0160ipovo. Winds are very often in the southern part of the area (Janjska visoravan) due to intermixing of the Mediterranean and continental air masses over Janj.\n\n===Forestry and agriculture===\nOwing to all these diversities, the inhabitants of the area are given the possibility of going in for various fields of agriculture (farming, fruit growing, cattle breeding, fishing, and apiculture), tourism and so forth. Forty-eight percent (223.99&nbsp;km\u00b2) of the \u0160ipovo region is covered with forests, thirty-three percent (154.8&nbsp;km\u00b2) with meadows and pastures, fourteen percent (66.03&nbsp;km\u00b2) with fields and orchards, and four percent (17.38&nbsp;km\u00b2) with unproductive land.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Population of settlements \u2013 \u0160ipovo municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|18,035\n|16,154\n|15,751\n|10,293\n|-\n|1\n|\u010cifluk\n|\n|\n|680\n|682\n|-\n|2\n|Donji Mujd\u017ei\u0107i\n|\n|\n|169\n|200\n|-\n|3\n|Lu\u017eine\n|\n|\n|458\n|336\n|-\n|4\n|Pribeljci\n|\n|\n|617\n|202\n|-\n|5\n|Sari\u0107i\n|\n|\n|675\n|1,321\n|-\n|6\n|'''\u0160ipovo'''\n|1,333\n|3,539\n|5,170\n|3,749\n|-\n|7\n|Todori\u0107i\n|\n|\n|323\n|217\n|-\n|8\n|Volari\n|\n|\n|576\n|240\n|-\n|9\n|Vra\u017ei\u0107\n|\n|\n|340\n|282\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 \u0160ipovo town\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|4,052 (100,0%)\n|5,170 (100,0%)\n|3,539 (100,0%)\n|1,333 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|3,828 (74,04%)\n|2,211 (62,48%)\n|659 (49,44%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|1,155 (22,34%)\n|1,026 (28,99%)\n|621 (46,59%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|117 (2,263%)\n|239 (6,753%)\n|3 (0,225%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|56 (1,083%)\n|10 (0,283%)\n|1 (0,075%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|14 (0,271%)\n|16 (0,452%)\n|24 (1,800%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|15 (0,424%)\n|11 (0,825%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|14 (0,396%)\n|13 (0,975%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|6 (0,170%)\n|\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|1 (0,028%)\n|1 (0,075%)\n|-\n|Hungarians\n|\n|\n|1 (0,028%)\n|\n|}\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 \u0160ipovo municipality\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|10 ,293 (100,0%)\n|15,579 (100,0%)\n|16,154 (100,0%)\n|18,035 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|9,576 (93,03%)\n|12,333 (79,16%)\n|12,844 (79,51%)\n|14,970 (83,01%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|628 (6,101%)\n|2,965 (19,03%)\n|2,831 (17,53%)\n|2,952 (16,37%)\n|-\n|Others\n|63 (0,612%)\n|95 (0,610%)\n|68 (0,421%)\n|37 (0,205%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|26 (0,253%)\n|31 (0,199%)\n|25 (0,155%)\n|35 (0,194%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|155 (0,995%)\n|339 (2,099%)\n|9 (0,050%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|23 (0,142%)\n|17 (0,094%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|15 (0,093%)\n|13 (0,072%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|6 (0,037%)\n|1 (0,006%)\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|2 (0,012%)\n|1 (0,006%)\n|-\n|Hungarians\n|\n|\n|1 (0,006%)\n|\n|}\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Nedeljko Baji\u0107 Baja]], singer\n\n==See also==\n*[[Municipalities of Republika Srpska]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|\u0160ipovo}}\nhttps://turizamrs.org/en/sipovo/\nhttp://sipovo-tourism.com/V2/turisticki-programi/?lang=en\n\n{{Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sipovo}}\n[[Category:Populated places in \u0160ipovo]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Republika Srpska]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Republika Srpska]]\n[[Category:\u0160ipovo| ]]\n", "name_user": "EcLiPsE285", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ipovo"}
