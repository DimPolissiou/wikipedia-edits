Despite not being part of the original Arabic text, it is one of the best known tales in [[One Thousand and One Nights|''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (The Arabian Nights)'']]. It was added to the collection in the 18th century by the Frenchman [[Antoine Galland]], who acquired the tale from [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronites|Maronite]] storyteller [[Hanna Diyab]],<ref name=\"razzaque\">Razzaque (2017)</ref> and has since been regarded as one of the best known and most retold of all fairy tales.\n\n==Sources==\nKnown along with [[Ali Baba]] as one of the \"orphan tales\", the story was not part of the original ''Nights'' collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book ''[[Les mille et une nuits]]'' by its [[French language|French]] translator, [[Antoine Galland]].<ref>Allen (2005) pp.280\u2013</ref>\n\n[[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] quotes passages from Galland's unpublished diary: recording Galland's encounter with a [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronite]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\"/> According to Galland's diary, he met with Hanna, who had travelled from Aleppo to [[Paris]] with celebrated French traveller [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], on March 25, 1709. Galland's diary further reports that his transcription of \"Aladdin\" for publication occurred in the winter of 1709\u201310. It was included in his volumes ix and x of the ''Nights'', published in 1710, without any mention or published acknowledgment of Hanna's contribution. Paulo Lemos Horta, in the introduction to his translation of ''Aladdin'', speculates that Diyab might be the original author of at least some of the \"orphan\" tales, including Aladdin.<ref name=\"Horta\">Horta (2018) pp. 8-10</ref>\n\nTo return to Payne, he also records the discovery in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] in Paris of two [[Arabic language|Arabic manuscripts]] containing ''Aladdin'' (with two more of the \"interpolated\" tales). One was written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named [[Dionysios Shawish]], alias Dom Denis Chavis. The other is supposed to be a copy Mikhail Sabbagh made of a manuscript written in [[Baghdad]] in 1703. It was purchased by the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name=Payne1>Payne (1901) pp. 13-15</ref> As part of his work on the first critical edition of the ''Nights'', [[Iraq]]'s [[Muhsin Mahdi]] has shown<ref>Irwin (1994) pp. 57-58</ref> that both these manuscripts are \"back-translations\" of Galland's text into Arabic.<ref name=Mahdi1>Mahdi (1994) pp. 51-71 </ref><ref>Dobie (2008) p.36</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Robida - Aladin illustration page1.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|The Sorcerer traps Aladdin in the magic cave.]]\nThe story is often \"re-told\" with variations. The following is a pr\u00e9cis of the Burton translation of 1885.''<ref name=Burtony1>Burton (2009) pp. 1 ff</ref>\n\nAladdin is an impoverished young ne'er-do-well, dwelling in \"one of the cities of China\". He is recruited by a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] from the [[Maghreb]], who passes himself off as the brother of Aladdin's late father, ''Mustapha the [[tailor]]'', convincing Aladdin and his mother of his good will by pretending to set up the lad as a wealthy merchant. The sorcerer's real motive is to persuade young Aladdin to retrieve a wonderful [[oil lamp]] from a [[Booby trap|booby-trapped]] magic cave. After the sorcerer attempts to double-cross him, Aladdin finds himself trapped in the cave. Aladdin is still wearing a [[magic ring]] the sorcerer has lent him. When he rubs his hands in despair, he inadvertently rubs the ring and a [[jinn]]\u012b (or \"genie\") appears who releases him from the cave, allowing him to return to his mother while in possession of the lamp. When his mother tries to clean the lamp, so they can sell it to buy food for their supper, a second far more powerful genie appears who is bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp.\n\nWith the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess [[Badroulbadour]], the [[sultan]]'s daughter (after magically foiling her marriage to the [[vizier]]'s son). The genie builds Aladdin and his bride a wonderful palace, far more magnificent than the sultan's.\n\nThe sorcerer hears of Aladdin's good fortune, and returns; he gets his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin's wife (who is unaware of the lamp's importance) by offering to exchange \"new lamps for old\". He orders the genie of the lamp to take the palace, along with all its contents, to his home in the Maghreb. Aladdin still has the magic ring and is able to summon the lesser genie. The genie of the ring cannot directly undo any of the magic of the genie of the lamp, but he is able to transport Aladdin to the Maghreb where, with the help of the \"woman's wiles\" of the princess, he recovers the lamp and slays the sorcerer, returning the palace to its proper place.\n\nThe sorcerer's more powerful and evil brother plots to destroy Aladdin for killing his brother by disguising himself as an old woman known for her healing powers. Badroulbadour falls for his disguise and commands the \"woman\" to stay in her palace in case of any illnesses. Aladdin is warned of this danger by the genie of the lamp and slays the impostor.\n\nAladdin eventually succeeds to his father-in-law's throne.\n\n==Setting==\nThe opening sentences of the story, in both the Galland and the Burton versions, set it in \"one of the cities of China\".<ref name=Plotz1>Plotz (2001) p. 148\u2013149</ref> On the other hand, there is practically nothing in the rest of the story that is inconsistent with a Middle Eastern setting. For instance, the ruler is referred to as \"[[Sultan]]\" rather than being called the \"[[Emperor of China|Emperor]]\", as in some re-tellings, and the people in the story are Muslims and their conversation is larded with [[Muslims|devout Muslim]] platitudes. A [[Jews|Jewish]] merchant buys Aladdin's wares (and incidentally cheats him), but there is no mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] or [[Confucianism|Confucians]] (or other distinctively [[Chinese people]]).\n\nNotably, [[ethnic groups in Chinese history]] have long included [[Chinese Muslims|Muslim groups]], including large populations of [[Uighurs]], and the [[Hui people]] whose origins go back to [[Silk Road]] travelers. Islamic communities have been known to exist in the region since the [[History of Islam in China#Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]. Some have suggested that the intended setting may be [[Turkestan]] (encompassing [[Central Asia]] and the modern Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] in [[Western China]]).<ref name=Moon1>Moon (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\nFor all this, speculation about a \"real\" Chinese setting depends on a knowledge of China that the teller of a folk tale (as opposed to a geographic expert) might well not possess.<ref name=honor1>Honour (1973) - Section I \"The Imaginary Continent\"</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{See also|Aladdin (franchise)}}\n\nAdaptations vary in their faithfulness to the original story. In particular, difficulties with the Chinese setting are sometimes resolved by giving the story a more typical ''Arabian Nights'' background.\n\n===Books===\n* One of the many literary retellings of the tale appears in ''A Book of Wizards'' (1966) and ''[[A Choice of Magic]]'' (1971), by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].\n* \"The Nobility of Faith\" by [[Jonathan Clements]] in the anthology ''[[Doctor Who]] Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas ''(2007) is a retelling of the Aladdin story in the style of the Arabian Nights, but featuring the Doctor in the role of the genie.\n\n===Pantomimes===\n[[File:He's behind you.jpg|thumb|120px|right| An 1886 theatre poster advertising a production of the pantomime Aladdin.]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the story of Aladdin was dramatised in 1788 by [[John O'Keeffe (writer)|John O'Keefe]] for the [[The Royal Opera|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]].<ref name=\"Witchard1\">Witchard (2017)</ref> It has been a popular subject for [[pantomime]] for over 200 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html |title=Aladdin |website=www.its-behind-you.com |accessdate=2008-01-22 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031442/http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html| archivedate= 5 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Aladdin pantomime is the source of the well-known pantomime character [[Widow Twankey]] (Aladdin's mother). In pantomime versions, changes in the setting and story are often made to fit it better into \"China\" (albeit a China situated in the [[East End of London]] rather than Medieval [[Baghdad]]), and elements of other Arabian Nights tales (in particular [[Ali Baba]]) are often introduced into the plot. One version of the \"pantomime Aladdin\" is [[Sandy Wilson]]'s [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Aladdin (1979 musical)|Aladdin]]'', from 1979.\n\nSince the early 1990s Aladdin pantomimes have tended to be influenced by [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|the Disney animation]]. For instance, the 2007/8 production at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] starring [[John Barrowman]] featured songs from the Disney movies ''Aladdin'' and ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\n=== Other musical theatre ===\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''New Crowns for Old'', a 19th-century British cartoon based on the Aladdin story ([[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] as Abanazer from the [[pantomime]] version of Aladdin offering [[Queen Victoria]] an Imperial crown (of India) in exchange for a Royal one)]]\n* ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' was a successful [[Edwardian musical comedy]] in 1906.\n*[[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] wrote his verse drama ''Aladdin'' in 1805.

In this version the princess Aladdin pursues is Achmed's sister and the sorcerer is his rival for her hand. The sorcerer steals the castle and the princess through his own magic and then sets a monster to attack Aladdin, from which Achmed rescues him. Achmed then informs Aladdin he requires the lamp to rescue his own intended wife, Princess Pari Banou, from the demons of the Island of Wak Wak. They convince the Witch of the Fiery Mountain to defeat the sorcerer, and then all three heroes join forces to battle the demons.\n* The 1938 animated film ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'', Aladdin makes a brief appearance asking for help but gets punched by one of the Three Musketeers.\n* ''[[Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp]]'' is a 1939 ''[[Popeye|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoon.\n* The 1959 animated film ''[[1001 Arabian Nights (1959 film)|1001 Arabian Nights]]'' starring [[Mr. Magoo]] as Aladdin's uncle and produced by [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]]''.\n* The animated feature ''[[Aladdin and His Magic Lamp (1970 film)|Aladdin et la lampe merveilleuse]]'' by Film Jean Image was released in 1970 in France. The story contains many of the original elements of the story as compared to the Disney version.\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1982 film)|Aladdin and the Magic Lamp]]'' was a rendition in Japanese directed by Yoshikatsu Kasai, produced in Japan by [[Toei Animation]] and released in United States by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] in 1982.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', the 1992 [[animated feature]] by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] (possibly currently the best known re-telling of the story). In this version several characters are renamed or amalgamated. For instance the Sorcerer and the Sultan's vizier become one character named [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]] while the Princess is re-named [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]]. They have new motivations for their actions. The [[Genie (Disney)|Genie of the Lamp]] only grants three wishes and desires freedom from his role. A sentient [[magic carpet]] replaces the ring's genie while Jafar uses a royal magic ring to find Aladdin. The names \"Jafar\" and \"Abu\", the Sultan's delight in toys, and their physical appearances are borrowed from the 1940 film, ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''. The setting is moved from China to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah and the structure of the plot is simplified.\n**''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), [[direct-to-video]] sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n**''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), direct-to-video second and final sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Golden Films film)|Aladdin]]'' by [[Golden Films]] was released directly on video in 1992.\n\n====Live action====\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1917 film)|Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' (1917), directed by [[Chester M.

The genie of the lamp is the main antagonist, known in the game as the Erazor Djinn, and the genie of the ring, known in the game as Shahra, appears as Sonic's sidekick and guide through the game. Furthermore, the ring genie is notably lesser than the lamp genie in the story.\n* The Disney version of Aladdin appears throughout the Disney/[[Square Enix]] crossover series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', with Agrabah being a visitable world.\n* In 2010, [[Anuman]] Interactive launched ''Aladin and the Enchanted Lamp'', a [[Puzzle video game|hidden object game]] on PC and Mac.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aladin et la Lampe Merveilleuse PC, Mac {{!}} 2010 |url=http://www.planete-jeu.fr/Aladin-Et-La-Lampe-Merveilleuse/ |website=Planete Jeu |accessdate=11 January 2019 |language=fr}}</ref>\n* In 2016 [http://www.saturnanimation.com/ Saturn Animation Studio] has produced an interactive adaptation of [http://www.saturnanimation.com/the-magical-lamp-of-aladdin/ The Magical Lamp of Aladdin] for mobile devices.\n\n===Pachinko===\n[[Sega Sammy]] have released a line of [[pachinko]] machines based on ''Aladdin'' since 1989.

Despite not being part of the original Arabic text, it is one of the best known tales in [[One Thousand and One Nights|''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (The Arabian Nights)'']]. It was added to the collection in the 18th century by the Frenchman [[Antoine Galland]], who acquired the tale from [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronites|Maronite]] storyteller [[Hanna Diyab]],<ref name=\"razzaque\">Razzaque (2017)</ref> and has since been one of the best known and most retold of all fairy tales.\n\n==Sources==\nKnown along with [[Ali Baba]] as one of the \"orphan tales\", the story was not part of the original ''Nights'' collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book ''[[Les mille et une nuits]]'' by its [[French language|French]] translator, [[Antoine Galland]].<ref>Allen (2005) pp.280\u2013</ref>\n\n[[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] quotes passages from Galland's unpublished diary: recording Galland's encounter with a [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronite]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\"/> According to Galland's diary, he met with Hanna, who had travelled from Aleppo to [[Paris]] with celebrated French traveller [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], on March 25, 1709. Galland's diary further reports that his transcription of \"Aladdin\" for publication occurred in the winter of 1709\u201310. It was included in his volumes ix and x of the ''Nights'', published in 1710, without any mention or published acknowledgment of Hanna's contribution. Paulo Lemos Horta, in the introduction to his translation of ''Aladdin'', speculates that Diyab might be the original author of at least some of the \"orphan\" tales, including Aladdin.<ref name=\"Horta\">Horta (2018) pp. 8-10</ref>\n\nTo return to Payne, he also records the discovery in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] in Paris of two [[Arabic language|Arabic manuscripts]] containing ''Aladdin'' (with two more of the \"interpolated\" tales). One was written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named [[Dionysios Shawish]], alias Dom Denis Chavis. The other is supposed to be a copy Mikhail Sabbagh made of a manuscript written in [[Baghdad]] in 1703. It was purchased by the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name=Payne1>Payne (1901) pp. 13-15</ref> As part of his work on the first critical edition of the ''Nights'', [[Iraq]]'s [[Muhsin Mahdi]] has shown<ref>Irwin (1994) pp. 57-58</ref> that both these manuscripts are \"back-translations\" of Galland's text into Arabic.<ref name=Mahdi1>Mahdi (1994) pp. 51-71 </ref><ref>Dobie (2008) p.36</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Robida - Aladin illustration page1.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|The Sorcerer traps Aladdin in the magic cave.]]\nThe story is often \"re-told\" with variations. The following is a pr\u00e9cis of the Burton translation of 1885.''<ref name=Burtony1>Burton (2009) pp. 1 ff</ref>\n\nAladdin is an impoverished young ne'er-do-well, dwelling in \"one of the cities of China\". He is recruited by a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] from the [[Maghreb]], who passes himself off as the brother of Aladdin's late father, ''Mustapha the [[tailor]]'', convincing Aladdin and his mother of his good will by pretending to set up the lad as a wealthy merchant. The sorcerer's real motive is to persuade young Aladdin to retrieve a wonderful [[oil lamp]] from a [[Booby trap|booby-trapped]] magic cave. After the sorcerer attempts to double-cross him, Aladdin finds himself trapped in the cave. Aladdin is still wearing a [[magic ring]] the sorcerer has lent him. When he rubs his hands in despair, he inadvertently rubs the ring and a [[jinn]]\u012b (or \"genie\") appears who releases him from the cave, allowing him to return to his mother while in possession of the lamp. When his mother tries to clean the lamp, so they can sell it to buy food for their supper, a second far more powerful genie appears who is bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp.\n\nWith the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess [[Badroulbadour]], the [[sultan]]'s daughter (after magically foiling her marriage to the [[vizier]]'s son). The genie builds Aladdin and his bride a wonderful palace, far more magnificent than the sultan's.\n\nThe sorcerer hears of Aladdin's good fortune, and returns; he gets his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin's wife (who is unaware of the lamp's importance) by offering to exchange \"new lamps for old\". He orders the genie of the lamp to take the palace, along with all its contents, to his home in the Maghreb. Aladdin still has the magic ring and is able to summon the lesser genie. The genie of the ring cannot directly undo any of the magic of the genie of the lamp, but he is able to transport Aladdin to the Maghreb where, with the help of the \"woman's wiles\" of the princess, he recovers the lamp and slays the sorcerer, returning the palace to its proper place.\n\nThe sorcerer's more powerful and evil brother plots to destroy Aladdin for killing his brother by disguising himself as an old woman known for her healing powers. Badroulbadour falls for his disguise and commands the \"woman\" to stay in her palace in case of any illnesses. Aladdin is warned of this danger by the genie of the lamp and slays the impostor.\n\nAladdin eventually succeeds to his father-in-law's throne.\n\n==Setting==\nThe opening sentences of the story, in both the Galland and the Burton versions, set it in \"one of the cities of China\".<ref name=Plotz1>Plotz (2001) p. 148\u2013149</ref> On the other hand, there is practically nothing in the rest of the story that is inconsistent with a Middle Eastern setting. For instance, the ruler is referred to as \"[[Sultan]]\" rather than being called the \"[[Emperor of China|Emperor]]\", as in some re-tellings, and the people in the story are Muslims and their conversation is larded with [[Muslims|devout Muslim]] platitudes. A [[Jews|Jewish]] merchant buys Aladdin's wares (and incidentally cheats him), but there is no mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] or [[Confucianism|Confucians]] (or other distinctively [[Chinese people]]).\n\nNotably, [[ethnic groups in Chinese history]] have long included [[Chinese Muslims|Muslim groups]], including large populations of [[Uighurs]], and the [[Hui people]] whose origins go back to [[Silk Road]] travelers. Islamic communities have been known to exist in the region since the [[History of Islam in China#Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]. Some have suggested that the intended setting may be [[Turkestan]] (encompassing [[Central Asia]] and the modern Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] in [[Western China]]).<ref name=Moon1>Moon (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\nFor all this, speculation about a \"real\" Chinese setting depends on a knowledge of China that the teller of a folk tale (as opposed to a geographic expert) might well not possess.<ref name=honor1>Honour (1973) - Section I \"The Imaginary Continent\"</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{See also|Aladdin (franchise)}}\n\nAdaptations vary in their faithfulness to the original story. In particular, difficulties with the Chinese setting are sometimes resolved by giving the story a more typical ''Arabian Nights'' background.\n\n===Books===\n* One of the many literary retellings of the tale appears in ''A Book of Wizards'' (1966) and ''[[A Choice of Magic]]'' (1971), by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].\n* \"The Nobility of Faith\" by [[Jonathan Clements]] in the anthology ''[[Doctor Who]] Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas ''(2007) is a retelling of the Aladdin story in the style of the Arabian Nights, but featuring the Doctor in the role of the genie.\n\n===Pantomimes===\n[[File:He's behind you.jpg|thumb|120px|right| An 1886 theatre poster advertising a production of the pantomime Aladdin.]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the story of Aladdin was dramatised in 1788 by [[John O'Keeffe (writer)|John O'Keefe]] for the [[The Royal Opera|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]].<ref name=\"Witchard1\">Witchard (2017)</ref> It has been a popular subject for [[pantomime]] for over 200 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html |title=Aladdin |website=www.its-behind-you.com |accessdate=2008-01-22 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031442/http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html| archivedate= 5 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Aladdin pantomime is the source of the well-known pantomime character [[Widow Twankey]] (Aladdin's mother). In pantomime versions, changes in the setting and story are often made to fit it better into \"China\" (albeit a China situated in the [[East End of London]] rather than Medieval [[Baghdad]]), and elements of other Arabian Nights tales (in particular [[Ali Baba]]) are often introduced into the plot. One version of the \"pantomime Aladdin\" is [[Sandy Wilson]]'s [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Aladdin (1979 musical)|Aladdin]]'', from 1979.\n\nSince the early 1990s Aladdin pantomimes have tended to be influenced by [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|the Disney animation]]. For instance, the 2007/8 production at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] starring [[John Barrowman]] featured songs from the Disney movies ''Aladdin'' and ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\n=== Other musical theatre ===\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''New Crowns for Old'', a 19th-century British cartoon based on the Aladdin story ([[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] as Abanazer from the [[pantomime]] version of Aladdin offering [[Queen Victoria]] an Imperial crown (of India) in exchange for a Royal one)]]\n* ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' was a successful [[Edwardian musical comedy]] in 1906.\n*[[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] wrote his verse drama ''Aladdin'' in 1805.

In this version the princess Aladdin pursues is Achmed's sister and the sorcerer is his rival for her hand. The sorcerer steals the castle and the princess through his own magic and then sets a monster to attack Aladdin, from which Achmed rescues him. Achmed then informs Aladdin he requires the lamp to rescue his own intended wife, Princess Pari Banou, from the demons of the Island of Wak Wak. They convince the Witch of the Fiery Mountain to defeat the sorcerer, and then all three heroes join forces to battle the demons.\n* The 1938 animated film ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'', Aladdin makes a brief appearance asking for help but gets punched by one of the Three Musketeers.\n* ''[[Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp]]'' is a 1939 ''[[Popeye|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoon.\n* The 1959 animated film ''[[1001 Arabian Nights (1959 film)|1001 Arabian Nights]]'' starring [[Mr. Magoo]] as Aladdin's uncle and produced by [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]]''.\n* The animated feature ''[[Aladdin and His Magic Lamp (1970 film)|Aladdin et la lampe merveilleuse]]'' by Film Jean Image was released in 1970 in France. The story contains many of the original elements of the story as compared to the Disney version.\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1982 film)|Aladdin and the Magic Lamp]]'' was a rendition in Japanese directed by Yoshikatsu Kasai, produced in Japan by [[Toei Animation]] and released in United States by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] in 1982.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', the 1992 [[animated feature]] by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] (possibly currently the best known re-telling of the story). In this version several characters are renamed or amalgamated. For instance the Sorcerer and the Sultan's vizier become one character named [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]] while the Princess is re-named [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]].

During two combat tours, he shot down nine enemy aircraft to become a [[flying ace]].\n\nHe was an early member of the [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration squadron and flew the lead \"solo\" position. His work as a [[test pilot]] included aircraft, electronic systems, and operational tactics such as developing techniques for delivering nuclear weapons from small fighter aircraft. He commanded increasingly larger air units including [[VFA-11|VF-11]] and Carrier Air Group Ten as well as training organizations that helped the Navy transition from propeller to jet aircraft. He commanded two Navy ships, served as the head of Navy Fighter Design, and was a key contributor to fighter studies that resulted in the development of jet aircraft that {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are still in active service.\n\nFeightner was the only pilot to land the dash-1 variant of the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] aboard a carrier. He led VF-11 to become the first Atlantic fleet unit in which every pilot received the coveted \"E\" award in a single exercise. After retiring from the Navy, Feightner continued to promote aviation and share his experiences with others.\n\n==Early life==\nFeightner was born on October 14, 1919 in [[Lima, Ohio]], a small town in the northwest part of the state, to Amos and Mary Feightner.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}} He attended [[Findlay College]] in Findlay, Ohio{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} and learned to fly in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP).

During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=82}} On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier USS ''Midway''.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme nose-up attitude that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the [[Landing Signal Officer]] (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly [[ramp strike|struck the ramp]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=83}} Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did not live up to its potential and remained in service less than four years.{{sfnp|Grossnick|1995|p=481}}\n\n===Blue Angels===\nIn January 1952, Feightner received orders to the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron&mdash;the Blue Angels. The squadron had been directed to add the Cutlass to their performance although neither Feightner nor Blue Angels commander [[Roy Marlin Voris|\"Butch\" Voris]] believed the aircraft was ready for formation flying.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}} The F7U was the Navy's first operational aircraft fitted with a hydraulic [[flight control system]] and reliability was still poor.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=46}} In the event of failure, the mechanical backup system required eleven seconds before control was restored.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=47}} The solution was to fly the F7Us separately from the rest of the team thereby creating the diamond and solo roles that remain to the present day. Feightner recruited former Blue Angel Lt. Harding C. \"Mac\" Macknight to fly the second Cutlass.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}}\n\n[[File:F7U-1 Blue Angels 1952.jpg|right|thumb|Blue Angels F7U-1 Cutlass in 1952]]\nAt the start of the 1952 show season, fuel control problems grounded the team's [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=50}} During a show at [[Saufley Field]] in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=49}} Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and light [[afterburner]]s. In Feightner's opinion, \"There just is not an airplane like it anywhere.\"{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=51}}\n\nMaintenance issues and additional near-fatal accidents put an end to Blue Angel Cutlass performances.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=52}} While traveling to an airshow at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], both F7Us experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engines failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=53}} With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after Feightner's former VF-3 commander. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=86}} After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]], the F7Us were given to the station's training center.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=56}}\n\n===Return to testing===\nIn September 1952, Feightner returned to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three ([[VX-3 (Squadron)|VX-3]]).<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6/> VX-3 was located at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base|NAS Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], and was responsible for testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions.{{sfnp|Lurie|2004|p=48}} In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than the airplanes themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6>{{cite book |last = Eanett |title=Interview Transcript |year=2005 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Feightner participated in the first public demonstration of the [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|steam catapult]] chosen  to launch heavy jet aircraft from the short decks of aircraft carriers.

During two combat tours, he shot down nine enemy aircraft to become a [[flying ace]].\n\nHe was an early member of the [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration squadron and flew the lead \"solo\" position. His work as a [[test pilot]] included aircraft, electronic systems, and operational tactics such as developing techniques for delivering nuclear weapons from small fighter aircraft. He commanded increasingly larger air units including [[VFA-11|VF-11]] and Carrier Air Group Ten as well as training organizations that helped the Navy transition from propeller to jet aircraft. He commanded two Navy ships, served as the head of Navy Fighter Design, and was a key contributor to fighter studies that resulted in the development of jet aircraft that {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are still in active service.\n\nFeightner was the only pilot to land the dash-1 variant of the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] aboard a carrier. He led VF-11 to become the first Atlantic fleet unit in which every pilot received the coveted \"E\" award in a single exercise. Since retiring from the Navy, Feightner has continued to promote aviation and share his experiences with others.\n\n==Early life==\nFeightner was born on October 14, 1919 in [[Lima, Ohio]], a small town in the northwest part of the state, to Amos and Mary Feightner.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}} He attended [[Findlay College]] in Findlay, Ohio{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} and learned to fly in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP). The CPTP was a flight training program sponsored by the United States government to increase the number of civilian pilots and thereby create a pool of trained aviators from which the military could draw.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p2>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |page=2}}</ref> By 1940, Feightner received his [[private pilot license]].{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} He graduated from Findlay College in 1941.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}}\n\n==World War II service==\nWith war approaching and because of his strong desire to fly, Feightner attempted to sign up with the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. But he faced an eight-month delay before acceptance since the Army flight program could not cope with the large influx of people. When Feightner found that the Navy would accept him immediately, he made up his mind to pursue naval aviation.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p3>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |page=3}}</ref> On June 16, 1941, Feightner enlisted in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] and entered the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN)|Naval Aviation Cadet Training Program]]. He completed flight training at [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]], Texas on April 3, 1942 thereby earning his [[Commission (document)|commission]] as an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] and designation as a [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]].{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}}<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Summary>{{cite book |last= Eanett |year=2005 |title = Interview Summary}}</ref> He finished advanced carrier training at [[Naval Air Station Norfolk]] and received orders to [[VF-5]] aboard {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5}}.{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=128}} ''Yorktown'', however, was sunk by the Japanese at the [[Battle of Midway]] before Feightner could arrive.{{sfnp|Tillman|1995|p=15}} Feightner was reassigned to [[VF-3]] at [[Naval Air Station Pu'unene]] on Maui, Hawaii.

Two more of the \"Bettys\" were dispatched by the pursuing VF-10 Wildcats as they passed the ring of destroyers that had been protecting the cruiser.

Feightner also tested the [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]], the [[Vought F4U Corsair]], and the [[Grumman F7F Tigercat]].<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p12>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |page=12}}</ref> When Colonel [[Charles Lindbergh]] came to evaluate the Tigercat, Feightner, as F7F project pilot, provided the pre-flight instruction.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_pp_14_15>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |pages=14&ndash;15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:F7U-1 CVB-41 landing 1951.jpg|left|thumb|Feightner landing F7U-1, No. 415, on the USS Midway in 1951]]\nFeightner was assigned as the Navy's project pilot for the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]], a carrier-based jet [[fighter-bomber]] with [[swept wing]]s and an unusual [[Tailless aircraft|tailless]] design.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} From July 23 to August 14, 1951, he performed carrier suitability tests of the Cutlass on board the {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}}.{{sfnp|Gardner|2010|p=72}} Feightner survived a number of near-fatal incidents in the Cutlass. During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=82}} On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier USS ''Midway''.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme nose-up attitude that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the [[Landing Signal Officer]] (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly [[ramp strike|struck the ramp]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=83}} Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did not live up to its potential and remained in service less than four years.{{sfnp|Grossnick|1995|p=481}}\n\n===Blue Angels===\nIn January 1952, Feightner received orders to the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron&mdash;the Blue Angels. The squadron had been directed to add the Cutlass to their performance although neither Feightner nor Blue Angels commander [[Roy Marlin Voris|\"Butch\" Voris]] believed the aircraft was ready for formation flying.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}} The F7U was the Navy's first operational aircraft fitted with a hydraulic [[flight control system]] and reliability was still poor.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=46}} In the event of failure, the mechanical backup system required eleven seconds before control was restored.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=47}} The solution was to fly the F7Us separately from the rest of the team thereby creating the diamond and solo roles that remain to the present day. Feightner recruited former Blue Angel Lt. Harding C. \"Mac\" Macknight to fly the second Cutlass.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}}\n\n[[File:F7U-1 Blue Angels 1952.jpg|right|thumb|Blue Angels F7U-1 Cutlass in 1952]]\nAt the start of the 1952 show season, fuel control problems grounded the team's [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=50}} During a show at [[Saufley Field]] in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=49}} Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and light [[afterburner]]s. In Feightner's opinion, \"There just is not an airplane like it anywhere.\"{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=51}}\n\nMaintenance issues and additional near-fatal accidents put an end to Blue Angel Cutlass performances.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=52}} While traveling to an airshow at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], both F7Us experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engines failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=53}} With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after Feightner's former VF-3 commander. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=86}} After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]], the F7Us were given to the station's training center.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=56}}\n\n===Return to testing===\nIn September 1952, Feightner returned to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three ([[VX-3 (Squadron)|VX-3]]).<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6/> VX-3 was located at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base|NAS Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], and was responsible for testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions.{{sfnp|Lurie|2004|p=48}} In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than the airplanes themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6>{{cite book |last = Eanett |title=Interview Transcript |year=2005 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Feightner participated in the first public demonstration of the [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|steam catapult]] chosen  to launch heavy jet aircraft from the short decks of aircraft carriers. Flying a propeller-driven [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD Skyraider]] at the [[Naval Air Material Center]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Feightner described the steam-powered launch as \"much better for the pilot\" due to the relatively gentle start that eliminated the shock of other catapult techniques.<ref name=NAN_Feb_54>{{cite journal |last= |first=|date=February 1954 |title=From David to Brown |journal=Naval Aviation News |volume= |issue= |pages=1&ndash;2 |publisher=United States Navy |location=Washington, D.C. |doi= |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201231458/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archivedate=December 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFeightner contributed to the development of weapon delivery tactics for the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=98}} The F2H-2B was modified for the attack role and had strengthened wings and pylons to accommodate a heavy weapon such as the  [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb|Mark 7]] or [[Mark 8 nuclear bomb]].{{sfnp|Francillon|1990|p=81}} The F2H-2B testing on which Feightner worked included the longest non-stop, round trip flight from a carrier&mdash;more than 2,800 miles. He also participated in an 18-hour, low-level, non-stop, round-trip flight from a carrier with weapon delivery in a Douglas AD-3 Skyraider.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=98}}\n\n==Aviation commands==\n\n===VF-11 Red Rippers===\n[[File:VF11 Rippers Aerial Bombing 1956.png|left|thumb|VF-11 pilots receive \"E\" award for aerial bombing.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 3 April, there have been 114 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 2 people have died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 3 April, there have been 114 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 2 people have died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel.

When not studying, the close friends are obsessed with their Bey tops, creating a school bey club and challenging each other to battles at their Bey Stadium. The friends eventually become friendly rivals as they compete against each other in a competition to claim the title of Japan\u2019s top Blader and to beat the undefeated Lui Shirosagi and his Beyblade, Lost Luinor.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Evolution'' (2017\u201318)===\nIn season two of Beyblade Burst, Valt Aoi, who hails from Japan was a top competitor in the Japanese Championship. In Season Two, ''Evolution'', Valt is scouted for the prestigious Spanish team \"BC Sol\" and heads out to Spain. When he arrives in Spain, he runs into some old friends and meets some new ones who end up accompanying him along his journey. Valt\u2019s first battle in Spain leaves his bey, Valtryek, with an opportunity to evolve, making it stronger. Valt and his friends set their sights on becoming the World Champion; however, in order to qualify, they must first take the European League by winning team battles against other teams from around the globe. Valt is able to rank his way up. However, his old friend Shu has been tricked into becoming evil and has broken every bey he battles. Shu AKA Red Eye and Valt battle and Valtryek`s tip Reboot gets broken in half. He gets an evolved tip (Ultimate Reboot) and makes his way up again and then is able to stop Red Eye (Shu's Identity when controlled by Spryzen Requiem), bringing Shu back to normal. Valt is now the world champion.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Turbo'' (2018\u201319)===\nTwo years after the International Blader's Cup, the story focuses on Aiger Akabane, a \"wild child\" that grew up in nature. After battling Valt Aoi, he became inspired to become the No.1 Blader in the world, along with his beyblade, Z Achilles. He aims to fight strong opponents in an effort to become stronger himself. To defeat Valt Aoi and become the World Champion, Aiger begins his journey. \n\n===''Beyblade Burst Rise'' (2019\u201320)===\nLegendary Blader Valt Aoi has been training the next generation of elite Bladers at Spain\u2019s BC Sol. One day, rookie Bladers Dante Koryu and Delta Zakuro witness Valt unleashing his newly-evolved Gamma Bey, Sword Valtryek. To their surprise, Valtryek radiates a golden light as it rockets around the stadium. Inspired by the limitless possibilities of this \u201cHyper-Flux\u201d state, both Dante and Delta seek the same bond with their Beys.\n\nDante and his partner, Ace Dragon, set off for Japan, the birthplace of Beyblade. But the path to glory won\u2019t be easy; plenty of tough competitors and Gamma Beys stand in their way, among them some of the best to ever let it rip. Dante soon realizes he\u2019ll have to do whatever it takes to deepen his bond with Dragon.\n\nDo Dante and Dragon have what it takes to overcome these challenges? and will they ever achieve Hyper-Flux?.

One day, rookie Bladers Dante Koryu and Delta Zakuro witness Valt unleashing his newly-evolved Gamma Bey, Sword Valtryek. To their surprise, Valtryek radiates a golden light as it rockets around the stadium. Inspired by the limitless possibilities of this \u201cHyper-Flux\u201d state, both Dante and Delta seek the same bond with their Beys.\n\nDante and his partner, Ace Dragon, set off for Japan, the birthplace of Beyblade. But the path to glory won\u2019t be easy; plenty of tough competitors and Gamma Beys stand in their way, among them some of the best to ever let it rip. Dante soon realizes he\u2019ll have to do whatever it takes to deepen his bond with Dragon.\n\nDo Dante and Dragon have what it takes to overcome these challenges? and will they ever achieve Hyper-Flux?. Here begins the story of Dante and Dragon's rise to the peak of the Blading world.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Sparking'' (2020-21)===\n{{expand-section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Official characters==\n{{section split|List of Beyblade Burst characters|date=November 2017}}\n===Main characters===\n;Valt Aoi / {{nihongo|Baruto Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95 \u30d0\u30eb\u30c8|Aoi Baruto}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Marina Inoue]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]] (seasons 1 and 2), [[Kimlinh Tran]] (season 3)}}\nValt is an energetic 11-year-old boy who dreams on being world champion.\n\n;Rantaro Kiyama / {{nihongo|\u9ec4\u5c71 \u4e71\u592a\u90ce|Kiyama Rantar\u014d}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Fumihiro Okabayashi]]|[[Matt Hill]] (seasons 1 and 2)}}\n:Also known as '''{{nihongo|Honcho|\u30af\u30df\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc|Kumicho}}'''\n\n;Ranjiro Kiyama / {{nihongo|\u9ec4\u5c71 \u4e71\u6b21\u90ce|Kiyama Ranjiro)}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Fumihiro Okabayashi]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n:Also known as '''{{nihongo|Cap'n|\u30bd\u30fc\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc|Socho}}'''\n\n;Ken Midori / {{nihongo|Kensuke Midorikawa|\u7dd1\u5ddd \u30b1\u30f3\u30b9\u30b1|Midorikawa Kensuke}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Tsubasa Yonaga]]|[[Gabe Khouth]]}}\n\n;Daigo Kurogami / {{nihongo|Daina Kurogami|\u9ed2\u795e \u30c0\u30a4\u30ca|Kurogami Daina}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ayahi Takagaki]]|[[Antony Kim]] (first half of season one), [[Zach LeBlanc]] (from second half of season one to season two)}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Hoji Konda|\u7d3a\u7530\u30db\u30a6\u30b8/\u7d3a\u7530\u6cd5\u4e8b|Konda Houji}}\n:{{animevoices|[[T\u014dru Nara]]|[[Brett Bauer]]}}\n\n;Wakiya Murasaki / {{nihongo|Wakiya Komurasaki|\u5c0f\u7d2b \u30ef\u30ad\u30e4|Komurasaki Wakiya}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]|[[Cole Howard (voice actor)|Cole Howard]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Shu Kurenai|\u7d05 \u30b7\u30e5\u30a6|Kurenai Sh\u016b}}/ {{nihongo|Red Eye|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30a4|Reddo Ai}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Junya Enoki]]|[[Adrian Petriw]] (seasons 1 and 2), [[Alan Lee]] (season 3)}}\n\n;Toko Aoi / {{nihongo|Tokonatsu Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u5e38\u590f|Aoi Tokonatsu}}\n:{{animevoices|[[You Taichi]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Nika Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u65e5\u590f|Aoi Nika}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Inase]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiharu Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u5343\u6625|Aoi Chiharu}}\n\n;Kit Lopez / {{nihongo|Kitto Ropesu|\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30ed\u30da\u30b9|Ropesu Kitto}}\n\n;Silas Karlisle (Sisco Karlisle) / {{nihongo|Shisuko K\u0101rairu|\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u30ab\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30eb|K\u0101rairu Shisuko}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takuma Terashima]]|[[Connor Parnall]]}}\n\n;Free De La Hoya / {{nihongo|Fur\u012b Derah\u014dya|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30c7\u30e9\u30db\u30fc\u30e4|Derah\u014dya Fur\u012b}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ryoko Shiraishi]]|Sean Thomas}}\n\n;Cuza Ackerman / {{nihongo|K\u016bza Akk\u0101man\u30af\u30fc\u30b6\u30a2\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30f3&\u30ab\u30fc\u30eb |Akk\u0101man K\u016bza}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Junko Takeuchi]]|Valin Shinyei}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Rickson Clay|\u30ea\u30af\u30bd\u30f3\u30af\u30ec\u30a4|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Shasa Guten (Sasha Guten)|\u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30fb\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3/|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Honey Guten|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3|}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Koga]]|[[Caitlyn Bairstow]]}}\n\n;Kristina Kuroda / {{nihongo|Kurisut\u012bna Kuroda|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30ca \u30af\u30ed\u30c0|Kuroda Kurisut\u012bna}}\n\n;Raul Comas / {{nihongo|Zoro|\u30be\u30ed|Zoro}}\n\n;Trad Vazquez / {{nihongo|Toraddo Basukesu|\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u30b1\u30b9|Basukesu Toraddo}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Orochi Ginba|\u9280\u5203\u30aa\u30ed\u30c1/ \u9280\u5203\u5927\u86c7|Ginba Orochi}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takahiro Mizushima]]|[[Daniel Bacon]]}} \n\n;Alexander 'Xander' Shakadera / {{nihongo|Kaiza Shakuenji|\u707c\u708e\u5bfa \u30ab\u30a4\u30b6|Shakuenji Kaiza}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Rikiya Koyama]]|[[Andrew Francis]]}}\n:Also known as '''Xander / {{nihongo4|Xhaka|\u30b7\u30e3\u30ab|Kshaka}}'''.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yugo Nansui|\u5357\u7fe0\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4|Nansui Yugo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Daichi Hayashi]]|[[Nick Wolfhard]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Ukyo Ibuki|\u96ea\u5439\u53f3\u4eac|Ibuki Ukyo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Natsumi Fujiwara]]|[[Vincent Tong]]}}\n\n;Zac Kaneguro / {{nihongo|Zenkuro Kurogane|\u9ed2\u9280\u5584\u4e5d\u90ce|Kurogane Zenkuro}}\n:Also known as '''Zac the Sunrise / Zac the Sunshine'''.\n\n;Quon Limon / {{nihongo|Quon Kimidori|\u9ec4\u7dd1\u30af\u30aa\u30f3|Kimidori Quon}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Yuka Nishigaki]]|[[Jonathan Whitesell]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Ben Azuki|\u5c0f\u8c46\u30d9\u30f3|Azuki Ben}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Mariko Higashiuchi]]|[[David A.

The southernmost stop in Bayonne, 8th Street station serves as the southern terminus of the Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail. Located on an elevated track next to [[New Jersey Route 440|Route&nbsp;440]], the station is accessible at the intersection of Avenue C and West 8th Street. The station, unlike the rest of the line, has a full station depot that doubles as accessibility to tracks per the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. The depot, two stories high, contains elevators and the platform, which is an [[island platform]] with two tracks. East of the station, the tracks merge into one to reach [[22nd Street station (Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail)|22nd Street station]]. The station serves tracks for the local service to [[Hoboken Terminal]] along with an express train known as the ''[[Bayonne Flyer]]''. The station opened on January 31, 2011 as an extension of service from 22nd Street.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Frassinelli |first1=Mike |title=NJ Transit opens Bayonne 8th Street Station, extending Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service |url=https://www.nj.com/news/2011/01/nj_transit_opens_bayonne_8th_s.html |accessdate=November 1, 2019 |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |publisher=New Jersey Advanced Media |date=January 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the 8th Street station depot is a similar design to the former [[West 8th Street station (Central Railroad of New Jersey)|West&nbsp;8th Street station]] on the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] that served Bayonne from August&nbsp;1, 1864&ndash;August&nbsp;6, 1978, when [[Conrail]] discontinued service.{{sfn|Historical Society of Hudson County|1908|p=18&ndash;19}}<ref name=\"August1978\">{{cite news |title=DOT Gives Farewell Toots to Underused 'Bayonne Scoots' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/36650237/bayonne_scoot_august_7_1978/ |accessdate=November 1, 2019 |work=The Home News |date=August 7, 1978 |location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] |page=13|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HBLR 8th Street Viaduct.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A single track viaduct was constructed to connect the station to the ROW.]]\n[[File:Bayonne Bridge from HBLR 8th St.agr.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bayonne Bridge]] viewed from the 8th Street platform]]\nThe station is located in the [[Bergen Point|Bergen Point neighborhood]] of Bayonne.

[[Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail]] (HBLR) in the city of [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]], [[New Jersey]]. The southernmost stop in Bayonne, 8th Street station serves as the southern terminus of the Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail. Located on an elevated track next to [[New Jersey Route 440|Route&nbsp;440]], the station is accessible at the intersection of Avenue C and West 8th Street. The station, unlike the rest of the line, has a full station depot that doubles as accessibility to tracks per the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. The depot, two stories high, contains elevators and the platform, which is an [[island platform]] with two tracks. East of the station, the tracks merge into one to reach [[22nd Street station (Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail)|22nd Street station]]. The station serves tracks for the local service to [[Hoboken Terminal]] along with an express train known as the ''[[Bayonne Flyer]]''. The station opened on January 31, 2011 as an extension of service from 22nd Street.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Frassinelli |first1=Mike |title=NJ Transit opens Bayonne 8th Street Station, extending Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service |url=https://www.nj.com/news/2011/01/nj_transit_opens_bayonne_8th_s.html |accessdate=November 1, 2019 |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |publisher=New Jersey Advanced Media |date=January 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the 8th Street station depot is a similar design to the former [[West 8th Street station (Central Railroad of New Jersey)|West&nbsp;8th Street station]] on the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] that served Bayonne from August&nbsp;1, 1864&ndash;August&nbsp;6, 1978, when [[Conrail]] discontinued service.{{sfn|Historical Society of Hudson County|1908|p=18&ndash;19}}<ref name=\"August1978\">{{cite news |title=DOT Gives Farewell Toots to Underused 'Bayonne Scoots' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/36650237/bayonne_scoot_august_7_1978/ |accessdate=November 1, 2019 |work=The Home News |date=August 7, 1978 |location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] |page=13|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HBLR 8th Street Viaduct.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A single track viaduct was constructed to connect the station to the ROW.]]\n[[File:Bayonne Bridge from HBLR 8th St.agr.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bayonne Bridge]] viewed from the 8th Street platform]]\nThe station is located in the [[Bergen Point|Bergen Point neighborhood]] of Bayonne.
