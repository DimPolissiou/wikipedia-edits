After being ridiculed by his teacher and classmates for believing that Shaktimaan is real, Sakthi tries to prove it by falling off the terrace of his school, injuring himself in the process. His father ([[Azhagam Perumal]]) tries to convince Sakthi that Shaktimaan is fictional by showing the disclaimer of actor [[Mukesh Khanna]] advising viewers that the events depicted in the show are purely fictitious, causing Sakthi to abandon his hopes of becoming a superhero.\n \nYears later, Sakthi ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) and Inbaraj \"Ink\" ([[Robo Shankar]]) are friends who earn their livelihood as educational brokers and run a xerox shop in their neighbourhood that houses a certificate [[forgery]] unit to help the needy secure their desired jobs at the expense of huge commissions. Sakthi bumps across Meera ([[Kalyani Priyadarshan]]), a social worker at an educational fair. and falls in love with her. Meera happens to be the inspiration of Mathi ([[Ivana (actress)|Ivana]]), a brilliant girl who aspires to become an [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]. Mathi devises an engine that runs on saltwater as a measure to help her father ([[Elango Kumaravel]]) and many other thwart the problem of rising petrol prices. Meera soon learns of Sakthi's true profession and advises him to help Mathi secure an admission in an engineering college without any payment. Sakthi tries to secure an admission for Mathi, but to no avail. He learns that the only way to help Mathi secure a seat is to demonstrate the practical applications of her engine, which is rejected by Sathyamoorthy ([[Arjun Sarja|Arjun]]), Mathi's teacher who runs a school for the academically weak but brilliant children. Sakthi bypasses his warnings and demonstrates the engine at an educational fair by attaching it to an autorickshaw. This attracts the attention of the henchman of Mahadev ([[Abhay Deol]]). In turn, he promises a seat for Mathi with full scholarship. The next day, the autorickshaw is seized by the police, and Mathi is arrested on grounds of patent violation. The court convicts her guilty of the charges, which distraughts her. She attempts suicide by falling off a running train. Sakthi takes her to the hospital, only for the doctors to delay her treatment, and she eventually succumbs to her injuries. Sakthi and Ink are also convicted guilty and are placed on the wanted list for aiding Madhi. \n\nSakthi, on the run, decides that the only way to avenge Mathi's death and prove her innocence is to confront the company issuing the patents. Due to his experience in forging certificates, he easily fishes out the fact that the patent was forged by the company under Mahadev's orders but is attacked in the process, when he is rescued by Sathyamoorthy wearing a mask. Sathyamoorthy explains to him that Mahadev is a corrupt business tycoon whose aim is to wipe out innovation in work culture. He also subdues brilliant students and subjects them to [[lobotomy]], rendering their [[frontal cortex]] unusable, therefore reducing them to his \"puppets\". He uses their innovations to sell them to foreign companies and earn profits. Sathyamoorthy, being an advocate of innovation, secretly nurtures such children away from Mahadev in his school. Sakthi decides to fight the system along with Sathyamoorthy and the children, donning the mantle of the \"Mask.\"\n\nUsing the gadgets developed by the children and Sathyamoorthy's training, Sakthi fights through Mahadev's henchmen and eventually learns the truth. Sathyamoorthy sacrifices himself in the struggle, prompting Sakthi to telecast the innovative inventions of students and explaining to the audience that children should be given freedom to follow their passion and not be just mere bookworms. In the final fight, Mahadev's plans are foiled and Sakthi subjects him to lobotomy, disabling him permanently. Six months later, Sakthi, while still on the wanted list, runs the school along with Meera on the outskirts of the city. A police officer ([[Prem (actor)|Prem]]) approaches him and takes him in his jeep around the city, where Sakthi finds major developments in the city due to the innovations of Mathi and other brilliant students. The officer tosses away the documents relating to Sakthi's charges as he had opened his eyes about his child's dreams, and requests Sakthi to continue on with the mantle of the Mask.\nIn the post credits scene, it is also revealed that Sathyamoorthy is alive and is helping Sakthi in his missions.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Sakthivel \"Sakthi\" / Hero (Mask)\n** Master Raghavan as young Sakthivel\n* [[Arjun Sarja|Arjun]] as Sathyamoorthy \"Moorthy\" (Sakthi\u2019s mentor) / Mask\n* [[Abhay Deol]] as Mahadev\n* [[Kalyani Priyadarshan]] as Meera\n* [[Ivana (actress)|Ivana]] as Mathi\n* Shyam Krishnan as Mahadev's assistant\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Inbaraj \"Ink\"\n* [[Elango Kumaravel]] as Mathi's father\n* [[Azhagam Perumal]] as Sakthi's father\n* [[Prem (actor)|Prem]] as police officer \n* Ray Paul as Sathyamoorthy's student\n* Nithyaraj as Sathyamoorthy's student\n* Raja Rani Pandiyan as a TV viewer\n* Robo Chandru as a TV viewer\n* Shrawan as a TV viewer\n* Priya Rajkumar as a TV viewer\n* Douglas Kumaramoorthy as a private university HR manager\n* Supergood Subramani as the head master of Shakthi's childhood school\n* Mullai as Mullai, a resident of Sakthivel's area\n* Kothandam as a resident of Sakthivel's area\n* \"Black Sheep\" Ayaz as a helpline caller and in a special appearance in the song \"Overa Feel Pannuren\"\n* \"Unakennappa\" Vivek as a helpline caller and in a special appearance in the song \"Overa Feel Pannuren\"\n* P.

After being ridiculed by his teacher and classmates for believing that Shaktimaan is real, Sakthi tries to prove it by falling off the terrace of his school, injuring himself in the process. His father ([[Azhagam Perumal]]) tries to convince Sakthi that Shaktimaan is fictional by showing the disclaimer of actor [[Mukesh Khanna]] advising viewers that the events depicted in the show are purely fictitious, causing Sakthi to abandon his hopes of becoming a superhero.\n \nYears later, Sakthi ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) and Inbaraj \"Ink\" ([[Robo Shankar]]) are friends who earn their livelihood as educational brokers and run a xerox shop in their neighbourhood that houses a certificate [[forgery]] unit to help the needy secure their desired jobs at the expense of huge commissions. Sakthi bumps across Meera ([[Kalyani Priyadarshan]]), a social worker at an educational fair. and falls in love with her. Meera happens to be the inspiration of Mathi ([[Ivana (actress)|Ivana]]), a brilliant girl who aspires to become an [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]. Mathi devises an engine that runs on saltwater as a measure to help her father ([[Elango Kumaravel]]) and many other thwart the problem of rising petrol prices. Meera soon learns of Sakthi's true profession and advises him to help Mathi secure an admission in an engineering college without any payment. Sakthi tries to secure an admission for Mathi, but to no avail. He learns that the only way to help Mathi secure a seat is to demonstrate the practical applications of her engine, which is rejected by Sathyamoorthy ([[Arjun Sarja|Arjun]]), Mathi's teacher who runs a school for the academically weak but brilliant children. Sakthi bypasses his warnings and demonstrates the engine at an educational fair by attaching it to an autorickshaw. This attracts the attention of the henchman of Mahadev ([[Abhay Deol]]). In turn, he promises a seat for Mathi with full scholarship. The next day, the autorickshaw is seized by the police, and Mathi is arrested on grounds of patent violation. The court convicts her guilty of the charges, which distraughts her. She attempts suicide by falling off a running train. Sakthi takes her to the hospital, only for the doctors to delay her treatment, and she eventually succumbs to her injuries. Sakthi and Ink are also convicted guilty and are placed on the wanted list for aiding Madhi. \n\nSakthi, on the run, decides that the only way to avenge Mathi's death and prove her innocence is to confront the company issuing the patents. Due to his experience in forging certificates, he easily fishes out the fact that the patent was forged by the company under Mahadev's orders but is attacked in the process, when he is rescued by Sathyamoorthy wearing a mask. Sathyamoorthy explains to him that Mahadev is a corrupt business tycoon whose aim is to wipe out innovation in work culture. He also subdues brilliant students and subjects them to [[lobotomy]], rendering their [[frontal cortex]] unusable, therefore reducing them to his \"puppets\". He uses their innovations to sell them to foreign companies and earn profits. Sathyamoorthy, being an advocate of innovation, secretly nurtures such children away from Mahadev in his school. Sakthi decides to fight the system along with Sathyamoorthy and the children, donning the mantle of the \"Mask.\"\n\nUsing the gadgets developed by the children and Sathyamoorthy's training, Sakthi fights through Mahadev's henchmen and eventually learns the truth. Sathyamoorthy sacrifices himself in the struggle, prompting Sakthi to telecast the innovative inventions of students and explaining to the audience that children should be given freedom to follow their passion and not be just mere bookworms. In the final fight, Mahadev's plans are foiled and Sakthi subjects him to lobotomy, disabling him permanently. Six months later, Sakthi, while still on the wanted list, runs the school along with Meera on the outskirts of the city. A police officer ([[Prem (actor)|Prem]]) approaches him and takes him in his jeep around the city, where Sakthi finds major developments in the city due to the innovations of Mathi and other brilliant students. The officer tosses away the documents relating to Sakthi's charges as he had opened his eyes about his child's dreams, and requests Sakthi to continue on with the mantle of the Mask.\nIn the post credits scene, it is also revealed that Sathyamoorthy is alive and is helping Sakthi in his missions.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Sakthivel \"Sakthi\" / Hero (Mask)\n** Master Raghavan as young Sakthivel\n* [[Arjun Sarja|Arjun]] as Sathyamoorthy \"Moorthy\" (Sakthi\u2019s mentor) / Mask\n* [[Abhay Deol]] as Mahadev\n* [[Kalyani Priyadarshan]] as Meera\n* [[Ivana (actress)|Ivana]] as Mathi\n* Shyam Krishnan as Mahadev's assistant\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Inbaraj \"Ink\"\n* [[Elango Kumaravel]] as Mathi's father\n* [[Azhagam Perumal]] as Sakthi's father\n* [[Prem (actor)|Prem]] as police officer \n* Ray Paul as Sathyamoorthy's student\n* Nithyaraj as Sathyamoorthy's student\n* Raja Rani Pandiyan as a TV viewer\n* Robo Chandru as a TV viewer\n* Shrawan as a TV viewer\n* Priya Rajkumar as a TV viewer\n* Douglas Kumaramoorthy as a private university HR manager\n* Supergood Subramani as the head master of Shakthi's childhood school\n* Mullai as Mullai, a resident of Sakthivel's area\n* Kothandam as a resident of Sakthivel's area\n* \"Black Sheep\" Ayaz as a helpline caller and in a special appearance in the song \"Overa Feel Pannuren\"\n* \"Unakennappa\" Vivek as a helpline caller and in a special appearance in the song \"Overa Feel Pannuren\"\n* P.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

When the city was younger and smaller, the June 1853 edition of the ''West American Review'', \"Article III\u2014Cincinnati: Its Relations to the West and South\" described and named seven specific hills.  The hills form a crescent around the city: [[Mount Adams, Ohio|Mount Adams]], [[Walnut Hills, Cincinnati|Walnut Hills]], [[Mount Auburn, Cincinnati, Ohio|Mount Auburn]], Vine Street Hill, College Hill, Fairmont (now rendered Fairmount), and Mount Harrison (now known as Price Hill). The name refers to ancient Rome, reputed to be built on seven hills.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: \"This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.\n\nGiven its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: \"This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.\n\nGiven its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829.

It is the primary city of the [[Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 20,859, and the metropolitan area had a population of 103,299. Located on the [[Potomac River]], Cumberland is a regional business and commercial center for Western Maryland and the [[Potomac Highlands of West Virginia]].\n\nHistorically Cumberland was known as the \"Queen City\", as it was once the second largest in the state. Because of its strategic location on what became known as the Cumberland Road through the Appalachians, after the American Revolution it served as a historical outfitting and staging point for westward [[emigrant trail]] [[Human migration|migration]]s throughout the first half of the 1800s. In this role, it supported the settlement of the [[Ohio Country]] and the lands in that latitude of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. It also became an industrial center, served by major roads, railroads, and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]], which connected Cumberland to [[Washington, D.C.]] and is now [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park|a national park]]. Today, [[Interstate 68]] bisects the town.\n\nIndustry declined after World War II. Much of the later urban, business and technological development in the state has been concentrated in eastern coastal cities. Today the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area is one of the poorest in the United States, ranking 305th out of 318 metropolitan areas in per capita income.<ref name=\"Dataplace: Cumberland, MD-WV MAS\">[http://www.dataplace.org/area_overview/?place=p26.69511 Dataplace: Cumberland, MD-WV MAS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011425/http://www.dataplace.org/area_overview/?place=p26.69511 |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Cumberland, Maryland}}\nCumberland was named by English colonists after the son of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Prince William, the Duke of Cumberland]]. It is built on the site of the mid-18th century [[Fort Cumberland (Maryland)|Fort Cumberland]], the starting point for British General [[Edward Braddock]]'s ill-fated attack on the French stronghold of [[Fort Duquesne]] (present-day Pittsburgh) during the [[French and Indian War]], the North American front of the Seven Years' War between the French and the British. (See [[Braddock expedition]].) This area had long been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. The fort was developed along the [[Great Indian Warpath]] which tribes used to travel the backcountry.\n\nCumberland also served as an outpost of Colonel [[George Washington]] during the French and Indian War, and his first military headquarters was built here. Washington returned as President of the United States in 1794 to Cumberland to review troops assembled to thwart the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].\n[[File:Cumberland md braddock road.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Braddock's Military Road]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, Cumberland was a key road, railroad and canal junction. It became the second-largest city in Maryland after the port city of Baltimore. It was nicknamed \"The Queen City\".<ref name=\"WDL\"/> Cumberland was the terminus, and namesake, of the [[Cumberland Road]] (begun in 1811) that extended westward to the [[Ohio River]] at [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. This was the first portion of what would be constructed as the [[National Road]], which eventually reached [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"WDL\"/> In the 1850s, many black fugitives reached their final stop on the [[underground railroad]] beneath the floor of the Emmanuel Episcopal Church. A maze of tunnels beneath and an abolitionist pastor above provided refuge before the final five mile trip to freedom in Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Emmanuel\">{{cite news |title=For many, path to freedom ran here |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/feb/10/20020210-035626-4242r/ |accessdate=23 January 2019 |date=February 10, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe surrounding hillsides were mined for coal and iron ore, and harvested for timber that helped supply the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] had its western terminus here; it was built to improve the movement of goods between the Midwest and Washington, DC, the eastern terminus. Construction of railroads superseded use of the canal, as trains were faster and could carry more freight. The city developed as a major manufacturing center, with industries in glass, breweries, fabrics, tires, and tinplate.\n\nWith the restructuring of heavy industry in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states following World War II, the city lost many jobs. As a result, its population has declined by nearly half, from 39,483 in the 1940 census to fewer than 20,000 today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nR/travel/cumberland/history.htm |title=Cumberland History|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=nps>Parts of this article are copied from the [http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/cumberland/history.htm, Cumberland History], a [[National Park Service]] website whose contents are in the public domain.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCumberland is in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge and Valley]] [[physiographic province]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] at {{Coord|39.647687|-78.762869|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (39.647687, &minus;78.762869),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at the junction of the [[North Branch Potomac River|North Branch]] of the [[Potomac River]] and [[Wills Creek (North Branch Potomac River)|Wills Creek]].

The easy crossing of the rugged Wills Mountain Anticline through this water gap is used by the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad (left), the Old National Road (Alternate U.S. 40) (center, left of the creek), and the CSX Railroad (right).]]\nCumberland is at the eastern entrance to the Cumberland Narrows (or \"The Narrows\"), a [[water gap]] along [[Wills Creek (North Branch Potomac River)|Wills Creek]] that crosses the central ridge of the [[Wills Mountain Anticline]] at a low elevation between Wills Mountain to the north and Haystack Mountain to the south.  Cliffs and [[Scree|talus]] of the two mountains' [[Tuscarora Formation|Tuscarora]] [[quartzite]] [[caprock]] are prominent within the Narrows.  These geological features provide Cumberland a western backdrop of the two mountains and the narrow gap between them.\n\nThe Cumberland Narrows acts as a western gateway from Cumberland to the [[Appalachian Plateau]] and the [[Ohio River|Ohio River Valley]] beyond.  The [[Old National Road]], now [[U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Keysers Ridge \u2013 Cumberland, Maryland)|Alternate U.S. 40]], passes through the Narrows. The former [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]'s main line between [[Baltimore]]/[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], now part of the [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] system, and a former line of the [[Western Maryland Railroad]], now used by the steam- and diesel-powered [[excursion train]]s of the [[Western Maryland Scenic Railroad]], also use this route.\n\nA prominent rocky outcropping at the south end of Wills Mountain in the Cumberland Narrows is known as [[Lover's Leap]].\n\n===Climate===\nCumberland lies at the beginning of the transition from a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa'') to a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), although bearing far more characteristics of the former, with a range of temperatures significantly lower than those in the central and eastern part of Maryland, mostly in the form of depressed nighttime lows. Cumberland is the only major city in Maryland to fall within the humid continental (Dfa) climate. Hagerstown lies in the middle of the transition zone.\n\nThe region has four distinct seasons, with hot, humid summers, and moderate winters (compared to surrounding communities, Cumberland receives milder winters and less snow). Monthly daily mean temperatures range from {{convert|31.9|\u00b0F|1}} in January to {{convert|76.8|\u00b0F|1}} in July, with temperatures exceeding {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} on 34.5 days of the year and dipping to {{convert|10|\u00b0F}} or below on 7 nights per winter. Average seasonal snowfall totals {{convert|30.3|in|cm}}. The record high is {{convert|109|\u00b0F}} set in July 1936 and August 1918, both of which are state record highs, while the record low is {{convert|\u221217|\u00b0F}} set in February 1899.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n{{Clear}}{{Weather box \n|location = Cumberland, Maryland (1981\u22122010 normals, extremes 1974\u2212present)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 41.4\n|Feb high F = 45.6\n|Mar high F = 55.8\n|Apr high F = 68.0\n|May high F = 76.5\n|Jun high F = 84.7\n|Jul high F = 88.7\n|Aug high F = 87.5\n|Sep high F = 80.0\n|Oct high F = 69.0\n|Nov high F = 56.6\n|Dec high F = 44.7\n|year high F= 66.6\n|Jan low F = 22.4\n|Feb low F = 23.9\n|Mar low F = 31.6\n|Apr low F = 41.1\n|May low F = 51.1\n|Jun low F = 60.4\n|Jul low F = 64.8\n|Aug low F = 63.3\n|Sep low F = 54.8\n|Oct low F = 43.0\n|Nov low F = 34.2\n|Dec low F = 26.5\n|year low F= 43.2\n|Jan record high F = 75\n|Feb record high F = 79\n|Mar record high F = 90\n|Apr record high F = 96\n|May record high F = 98\n|Jun record high F =103\n|Jul record high F =105\n|Aug record high F =105 \n|Sep record high F =102\n|Oct record high F = 93\n|Nov record high F = 87\n|Dec record high F = 80\n\n|Jan record low F = \u221214\n|Feb record low F =  \u22123\n|Mar record low F =   3\n|Apr record low F =  20\n|May record low F =  25\n|Jun record low F =  39\n|Jul record low F =  46\n|Aug record low F =  38 \n|Sep record low F =  31\n|Oct record low F =  20\n|Nov record low F =  10\n|Dec record low F =  \u22128\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.66\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.37\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.30\n|May precipitation inch = 4.02\n|Jun precipitation inch = 3.28\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.56\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.17\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.23\n|Oct precipitation inch = 2.57\n|Nov precipitation inch = 2.98\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.85\n\n|Jul snow inch =   0\n|Aug snow inch =   0\n|Sep snow inch =   0\n|Oct snow inch =   0\n|Nov snow inch = 0.6\n|Dec snow inch = 5.6\n|Jan snow inch = 8.7\n|Feb snow inch = 7.8\n|Mar snow inch = 6.0\n|Apr snow inch = 0.2\n|May snow inch =   0\n|Jun snow inch =   0\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|Jan precipitation days = 11.6\n|Feb precipitation days =  9.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 11.2\n|Apr precipitation days = 11.6\n|May precipitation days = 13.3\n|Jun precipitation days = 11.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 10.6\n|Aug precipitation days =  9.5\n|Sep precipitation days =  9.2\n|Oct precipitation days =  8.6\n|Nov precipitation days =  9.6\n|Dec precipitation days = 10.6\n|unit snow days = 0.1 in\n|Jul snow days =   0\n|Aug snow days =   0\n|Sep snow days =   0\n|Oct snow days =   0\n|Nov snow days = 0.4\n|Dec snow days = 1.9\n|Jan snow days = 3.7\n|Feb snow days = 3.1\n|Mar snow days = 2.0\n|Apr snow days = 0.1\n|May snow days =   0\n|Jun snow days =   0\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref>{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USC00182282.normals.txt |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |title=Station Name: MD CUMBERLAND 2 |accessdate=2015-05-11}}</ref><ref name= NOAA>\n  {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=lwx\n  |title = NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = 2015-05-11}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 2428\n|1850= 6073\n|1860= 4078\n|1870= 8056\n|1880= 10693\n|1890= 12729\n|1900= 17128\n|1910= 21839\n|1920= 29837\n|1930= 37747\n|1940= 39483\n|1950= 37679\n|1960= 33415\n|1970= 29724\n|1980= 25933\n|1990= 23706\n|2000= 21518\n|2010= 20859\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=19480\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Population in Cumberland.png|thumb|left|A graph showing the population in Cumberland and Allegany County]]\nThe [[median household income]] $25,142, and the median family income was $34,500.

Plants such as [[Pittsburgh Plate Glass]], Allegany Munitions and [[Celanese]] closed down and relocated as part of widespread industrial restructuring after WWII. The 1987 closure of the [[The Kelly Springfield Tire Company|Kelly Springfield Tire Plant]] marked a turning point, as it was the last major manufacturing plant in the city limits to close its doors.\n\nThe population of the city has continued to decline since 1990, with the 2010 census population of 20,859 the lowest since the 1900 census.\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 20,859 people, 9,223 households, and 4,982 families residing in the city.

The heart of the downtown area is Baltimore Street.  Formerly the main thoroughfare through the city, Baltimore Street is now a brick pedestrian mall. The street is lined with large multi-story commercial buildings, most of which were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings, which were formerly banks, hotels, and department stores, are relics of the city's former wealth and importance during the industrial age.  They now contain more tourist oriented businesses such as sidewalk cafes, antique stores, boutiques and art galleries. Baltimore Street hosts some of the city's biggest sidewalk festivals and block parties.\n\n=== Western Maryland Railway Station ===\n\nA block west of the downtown pedestrian mall is the [[Western Maryland Railway Station (Cumberland, Maryland)|Western Maryland Railway Station]]. This early 20th-century train station is home to the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, known regionally as \"Mountain Thunder\". The [[Western Maryland Scenic Railroad]] offers three hour round trip tours from Cumberland to Frostburg using restored 1916 [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin Steam Locomotive]] Number 734 or \"Mountain Thunder\" (Currently out of service). The Western Maryland Railway Station is part of the.<ref>[http://www.canalplace.org/ Canal Place]</ref> Canal Place Heritage Area, the first in the state of Maryland.\n\n=== Arts & Entertainment District ===\nDowntown Cumberland's Arts & Entertainment District is home to the Allegany Arts Council and its Saville Gallery, the Allegany Museum, the Cumberland Theatre, the Arts at Canal Place Cooperative Gallery, the New Embassy Theatre, the Cumberland Music Academy, MettleArts Studio & Foundry, the Arteco Gallery and Institute for Creative Enterprise, Windsor Hall (a multi-purpose performance venue), the Gilchrist Museum of the Arts, the Gordon-Roberts House, the Graphicus Atelier print-making studio, and a variety of retail and specialty stores.

A national park has been created in the city center at the intersection of the railroad, C&O Canal, and [[Allegheny Highlands Trail of Maryland]] at Canal Place.  While at the Heritage Area, visitors can ride the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, tour a full-scale replica canal boat, visit the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park|C&O Canal National Historical Park]] Cumberland Visitor Center, get information about attractions and events in Allegany County, hike or bike ride on the canal towpath, or attend unique festivals and events like C&O CanalFest. A re-watering project is underway which when completed will allow visitors to ride in replica canal boats through a portion of the old canal.\n\nThe Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park is {{convert|184.5|mi|km}} following the Potomac River from Georgetown in Washington, D.C. to Cumberland. Its towpath is popular with runners, hikers, and bicyclists. There are campsites approximately every five miles along the trail.\n\n=== The Great Allegheny Passage ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:cumberland maryland great allegany map.jpg|thumb|[[Great Allegheny Passage]]]] -->\n\nThe C&O Canal has its Western Terminus at Canal Place, and it is possible to travel by foot or bicycle from here to Washington, D.C. along the canal towpath - a distance of roughly {{convert|185|mi|km}}. The [[Great Allegheny Passage]] is a {{convert|148|mi|km|adj=on}} hiking/biking trail starting in Pittsburgh and ending in Cumberland where it connects with the C&O Canal towpath.\n\n===Rocky Gap Casino Resort and State Park ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:cumberland maryland rocky gap resort.jpg|thumb|right]] -->\nJust outside Cumberland, the Rocky Gap Lodge and Golf Resort sits in the valley between Evitt's Mountain and Martin's Mountain.

On the northeast side of Wills Mountain, sits a rocky outcropping known as [[Lover's Leap]].  The name comes from a Native American Romeo and Juliet legend.  The tale tells how a jilted lover met his end by jumping off this ledge.  Today, the rocks high above the water provide extensive views of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].  Lover's Leap has been frequently romanticized by postcard pictures of this valley, including those taken by George Steward in 1950 and published in the 1953 book ''U.S. 40''.\n\nLover's Leap is {{convert|1652|ft|m}} above sea level and made up of oddly squared projectories of rock, from its top, all the way down to the National Highway (U.S. Rte. 40) below.

The first public school for African-Americans in Cumberland operated in a colored YMCA on Independence Street, and was named the Mary Hoye school. In 1923 a new school for blacks was built on Frederick Street. In 1941 an election was held of students and faculty, and the school was renamed '''[[George Washington Carver High School (Cumberland, Maryland)|George Washington Carver School]]'''.

To the west, I-68 and US 40 separate in [[Keysers Ridge, Maryland|Keysers Ridge]], with I-68 continuing west to [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]] and a junction with [[Interstate 79 in West Virginia|Interstate 79]]. US 40 heads northwestward into southern [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 220 in Maryland|U.S. Route 220]] also passes through Cumberland, mostly concurrent with I-68 and US 40. However, near the city limits on either end of its route through the city, US 220 diverges north and south from I-68 and US 40. To the north, US 220 heads for [[Bedford, Pennsylvania|Bedford]], Pennsylvania, while southwards, it reaches [[Keyser, West Virginia|Keyser]].\n\nOther significant roads serving Cumberland include [[U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Keysers Ridge\u2013Cumberland, Maryland)|U.S. Route 40 Alternate]], [[Maryland Route 51]], [[Maryland Route 61]], [[Maryland Route 639]] and [[Maryland Route 807]].\n\n===Public transportation===\nThe primary public transportation in the City of Cumberland is bus service provided by [[Allegany County Transit]]. This service consists of five scheduled routes that reach most areas of the City and provide access to most public facilities. [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides intercity service to Cumberland via the ''[[Capitol Limited (Amtrak)|Capitol Limited]]'', which runs between [[Union Station (Washington)|Washington, D.C.]], and [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago, Illinois]]. The [[Cumberland station (Maryland)|Cumberland Amtrak Station]] is located downtown at Queen City Drive and East Harrison Street. The Western Maryland Scenic Railroad operates steam and diesel excursion trains from Cumberland to [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]] and back. [[CSX]] had a large hump yard for full service to Pittsburgh over Sand patch grade to the west, the [[Grafton, West Virginia]], line to the south, & the [[Baltimore, Maryland]], line to the east.\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Cumberland, Maryland}}\nCumberland has several media outlets; most carry some form of satellite programming. WCBC-AM and WFRB-FM have some local news content, but do not have reporters collecting it. The closest public radio station is WFWM, at Frostburg, Maryland. ''[[Allegany Magazine]]'' is a recent media addition. The ''Cumberland Times-News'' is the area's daily newspaper.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main|List of people from Cumberland, Maryland}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe webcomic ''[[The Adventures of Dr. McNinja]]'' by [[Christopher Hastings]] is set in part in a fictionalized version of Cumberland.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dr. McNinja | work=Cumberland Times-News | date=June 30, 2008 | url=http://www.times-news.com/article_91f88c68-f2cf-5658-85e4-c042c7dd6ebf.html | accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>\n\n==Sister cities==\n* [[File:Flag of Estonia.svg|25px]] [[Tapa, Estonia|Tapa]], [[L\u00e4\u00e4ne-Viru County]], [[Estonia]]\n* [[File:Flag of Estonia.svg|25px]] [[Viljandi]], [[Estonia]]<ref name=\"ctn20130620\">{{cite web | title=Cumberland Establishes Sister City In Estonia | work=Cumberland Times-News | date=June 20, 2013 | url=http://times-news.com/local/x493356794/Cumberland-establishes-sister-city-in-Estonia | accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Tourism in Cumberland, Maryland]]\n*[[List of festivals and events in Cumberland, MD-WV]]\n*[[Federal Correctional Institution, Cumberland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* [[William Harrison Lowdermilk|Will H.

It is the primary city of the [[Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 20,859, and the metropolitan area had a population of 103,299. Located on the [[Potomac River]], Cumberland is a regional business and commercial center for Western Maryland and the [[Potomac Highlands of West Virginia]].\n\nHistorically Cumberland was known as the \"Queen City\", as it was once the second largest in the state. Because of its strategic location on what became known as the Cumberland Road through the Appalachians, after the American Revolution it served as a historical outfitting and staging point for westward [[emigrant trail]] [[Human migration|migration]]s throughout the first half of the 1800s. In this role, it supported the settlement of the [[Ohio Country]] and the lands in that latitude of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. It also became an industrial center, served by major roads, railroads, and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]], which connected Cumberland to [[Washington, D.C.]] and is now [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park|a national park]]. Today, [[Interstate 68]] bisects the town.\n\nIndustry declined after World War II. Much of the later urban, business and technological development in the state has been concentrated in eastern coastal cities. Today the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area is one of the poorest in the United States, ranking 305th out of 318 metropolitan areas in per capita income.<ref name=\"Dataplace: Cumberland, MD-WV MAS\">[http://www.dataplace.org/area_overview/?place=p26.69511 Dataplace: Cumberland, MD-WV MAS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011425/http://www.dataplace.org/area_overview/?place=p26.69511 |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Cumberland, Maryland}}\nCumberland was named by English colonists after the son of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Prince William, the Duke of Cumberland]]. It is built on the site of the mid-18th century [[Fort Cumberland (Maryland)|Fort Cumberland]], the starting point for British General [[Edward Braddock]]'s ill-fated attack on the French stronghold of [[Fort Duquesne]] (present-day Pittsburgh) during the [[French and Indian War]], the North American front of the Seven Years' War between the French and the British. (See [[Braddock expedition]].) This area had long been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. The fort was developed along the [[Great Indian Warpath]] which tribes used to travel the backcountry.\n\nCumberland also served as an outpost of Colonel [[George Washington]] during the French and Indian War, and his first military headquarters was built here. Washington returned as President of the United States in 1794 to Cumberland to review troops assembled to thwart the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].\n[[File:Cumberland md braddock road.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Braddock's Military Road]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, Cumberland was a key road, railroad and canal junction. It became the second-largest city in Maryland after the port city of Baltimore. It was nicknamed \"The Queen City\".<ref name=\"WDL\"/> Cumberland was the terminus, and namesake, of the [[Cumberland Road]] (begun in 1811) that extended westward to the [[Ohio River]] at [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. This was the first portion of what would be constructed as the [[National Road]], which eventually reached [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"WDL\"/> In the 1850s, many black fugitives reached their final stop on the [[underground railroad]] beneath the floor of the Emmanuel Episcopal Church. A maze of tunnels beneath and an abolitionist pastor above provided refuge before the final five mile trip to freedom in Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Emmanuel\">{{cite news |title=For many, path to freedom ran here |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/feb/10/20020210-035626-4242r/ |accessdate=23 January 2019 |date=February 10, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe surrounding hillsides were mined for coal and iron ore, and harvested for timber that helped supply the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] had its western terminus here; it was built to improve the movement of goods between the Midwest and Washington, DC, the eastern terminus. Construction of railroads superseded use of the canal, as trains were faster and could carry more freight. The city developed as a major manufacturing center, with industries in glass, breweries, fabrics, tires, and tinplate.\n\nWith the restructuring of heavy industry in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states following World War II, the city lost many jobs. As a result, its population has declined by nearly half, from 39,483 in the 1940 census to fewer than 20,000 today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nR/travel/cumberland/history.htm |title=Cumberland History|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=nps>Parts of this article are copied from the [http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/cumberland/history.htm, Cumberland History], a [[National Park Service]] website whose contents are in the public domain.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCumberland is in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge and Valley]] [[physiographic province]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] at {{Coord|39.647687|-78.762869|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (39.647687, &minus;78.762869),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at the junction of the [[North Branch Potomac River|North Branch]] of the [[Potomac River]] and [[Wills Creek (North Branch Potomac River)|Wills Creek]].

Cliffs and [[Scree|talus]] of the two mountains' [[Tuscarora Formation|Tuscarora]] [[quartzite]] [[caprock]] are prominent within the Narrows.  These geological features provide Cumberland a western backdrop of the two mountains and the narrow gap between them.\n\nThe Cumberland Narrows acts as a western gateway from Cumberland to the [[Appalachian Plateau]] and the [[Ohio River|Ohio River Valley]] beyond.  The [[Old National Road]], now [[U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Keysers Ridge \u2013 Cumberland, Maryland)|Alternate U.S. 40]], passes through the Narrows. The former [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]'s main line between [[Baltimore]]/[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], now part of the [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] system, and a former line of the [[Western Maryland Railroad]], now used by the steam- and diesel-powered [[excursion train]]s of the [[Western Maryland Scenic Railroad]], also use this route.\n\nA prominent rocky outcropping at the south end of Wills Mountain in the Cumberland Narrows is known as [[Lover's Leap]].\n\n===Climate===\nCumberland lies at the beginning of the transition from a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa'') to a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), although bearing far more characteristics of the former, with a range of temperatures significantly lower than those in the central and eastern part of Maryland, mostly in the form of depressed nighttime lows. Cumberland is the only major city in Maryland to fall within the humid continental (Dfa) climate. Hagerstown lies in the middle of the transition zone.\n\nThe region has four distinct seasons, with hot, humid summers, and moderate winters (compared to surrounding communities, Cumberland receives milder winters and less snow).

Plants such as [[Pittsburgh Plate Glass]], Allegany Munitions and [[Celanese]] closed down and relocated as part of widespread industrial restructuring after WWII. The 1987 closure of the [[The Kelly Springfield Tire Company|Kelly Springfield Tire Plant]] marked a turning point, as it was the last major manufacturing plant in the city limits to close its doors.\n\nThe population of the city has continued to decline since 1990, with the 2010 census population of 20,859 the lowest since the 1900 census.\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 20,859 people, 9,223 households, and 4,982 families residing in the city.

The heart of the downtown area is Baltimore Street.  Formerly the main thoroughfare through the city, Baltimore Street is now a brick pedestrian mall. The street is lined with large multi-story commercial buildings, most of which were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings, which were formerly banks, hotels, and department stores, are relics of the city's former wealth and importance during the industrial age.  They now contain more tourist oriented businesses such as sidewalk cafes, antique stores, boutiques and art galleries. Baltimore Street hosts some of the city's biggest sidewalk festivals and block parties.\n\n=== Western Maryland Railway Station ===\n\nA block west of the downtown pedestrian mall is the [[Western Maryland Railway Station (Cumberland, Maryland)|Western Maryland Railway Station]]. This early 20th-century train station is home to the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, known regionally as \"Mountain Thunder\". The [[Western Maryland Scenic Railroad]] offers three hour round trip tours from Cumberland to Frostburg using restored 1916 [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin Steam Locomotive]] Number 734 or \"Mountain Thunder\" (Currently out of service). The Western Maryland Railway Station is part of the.<ref>[http://www.canalplace.org/ Canal Place]</ref> Canal Place Heritage Area, the first in the state of Maryland.\n\n=== Arts & Entertainment District ===\nDowntown Cumberland's Arts & Entertainment District is home to the Allegany Arts Council and its Saville Gallery, the Allegany Museum, the Cumberland Theatre, the Arts at Canal Place Cooperative Gallery, the New Embassy Theatre, the Cumberland Music Academy, MettleArts Studio & Foundry, the Arteco Gallery and Institute for Creative Enterprise, Windsor Hall (a multi-purpose performance venue), the Gilchrist Museum of the Arts, the Gordon-Roberts House, the Graphicus Atelier print-making studio, and a variety of retail and specialty stores.

A national park has been created in the city center at the intersection of the railroad, C&O Canal, and [[Allegheny Highlands Trail of Maryland]] at Canal Place.  While at the Heritage Area, visitors can ride the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, tour a full-scale replica canal boat, visit the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park|C&O Canal National Historical Park]] Cumberland Visitor Center, get information about attractions and events in Allegany County, hike or bike ride on the canal towpath, or attend unique festivals and events like C&O CanalFest. A re-watering project is underway which when completed will allow visitors to ride in replica canal boats through a portion of the old canal.\n\nThe Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park is {{convert|184.5|mi|km}} following the Potomac River from Georgetown in Washington, D.C. to Cumberland. Its towpath is popular with runners, hikers, and bicyclists. There are campsites approximately every five miles along the trail.\n\n=== The Great Allegheny Passage ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:cumberland maryland great allegany map.jpg|thumb|[[Great Allegheny Passage]]]] -->\n\nThe C&O Canal has its Western Terminus at Canal Place, and it is possible to travel by foot or bicycle from here to Washington, D.C. along the canal towpath - a distance of roughly {{convert|185|mi|km}}. The [[Great Allegheny Passage]] is a {{convert|148|mi|km|adj=on}} hiking/biking trail starting in Pittsburgh and ending in Cumberland where it connects with the C&O Canal towpath.\n\n===Rocky Gap Casino Resort and State Park ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:cumberland maryland rocky gap resort.jpg|thumb|right]] -->\nJust outside Cumberland, the Rocky Gap Lodge and Golf Resort sits in the valley between Evitt's Mountain and Martin's Mountain. The resort is located on the shore of the {{convert|243|acre|km2|adj=on}} Lake Habeeb in [[Rocky Gap State Park]], and boasts Maryland's only [[Jack Nicklaus]] Signature Golf Course.\n\n===Allegany Museum===\nAllegany Museum is located at 3 Pershing St, Cumberland. The Museum serves the Allegany area, which is part of the Appalachia region, and includes Allegany and Garrett Counties in Maryland, Mineral County in West Virginia, and Bedford and Somerset Counties in Pennsylvania. The Museum exhibits include local prehistoric life, the Cumberland glassware industry, Kelly Springfield Tire Company, MeadWestvaco, the Cumberland brewing industry, and folk art on the building\u2019s second floor. Work is currently underway on the Crossroads of America exhibition, which will trace the history of human movement through the area and will occupy most of the first floor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alleganymuseum.org|title=Allegany Museum \u2013 At the Crossroads of American History|author=|date=|website=www.alleganymuseum.org}}</ref>{{nonspecific|date=June 2017}}\n\n===The Narrows and Lovers Leap===\nThe Narrows is a compact notched valley that [[Wills Creek (North Branch Potomac River)|Wills Creek]] has carved into [[Wills Mountain]].  Inventor [[Frederick John Bahr]] bought Wills Mountain and built his log cabin on top.\n\nThe [[National Road]] ([[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]]) and a number of railroad lines pass through this steep, narrow, and rocky river valley on the edge of Cumberland.  On the northeast side of Wills Mountain, sits a rocky outcropping known as [[Lover's Leap]].  The name comes from a Native American Romeo and Juliet legend.  The tale tells how a jilted lover met his end by jumping off this ledge.  Today, the rocks high above the water provide extensive views of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].  Lover's Leap has been frequently romanticized by postcard pictures of this valley, including those taken by George Steward in 1950 and published in the 1953 book ''U.S. 40''.\n\nLover's Leap is {{convert|1652|ft|m}} above sea level and made up of oddly squared projectories of rock, from its top, all the way down to the National Highway (U.S. Rte. 40) below.  The City of Cumberland and the neighboring states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia may be seen from this point.\n\n===Other attractions ===\n* [[Constitution Park (Maryland)|Constitution Park]] \n* [[Cumberland Theatre|Cumberland Theatre Company]], located on N.

Housed in a renovated warehouse opposite the steam train depot in Frostburg, this museum houses an extensive collection of late 19th- and early 20th-century horse-drawn carriages, featuring more than 50 vehicles from the collection of the late James R. Thrasher. Highlights include the inaugural coach used by Teddy Roosevelt, several Vanderbilt sleighs, elaborately decorated funeral wagons, formal closed vehicles, surreys, and open sleighs.\n* The [[Paw Paw Tunnel]] is one of the world's longest canal tunnels and was one of the greatest engineering feats of its day.\n* The [[Sideling Hill]] road cut is a {{convert|340|ft|m|adj=on}} deep road cut where [[Interstate 68]] cuts through Sideling Hill. It is notable as an impressive man-made mountain pass, visible from miles away and one of the best rock exposures in Maryland and indeed in the entire northeastern United States. Almost {{convert|810|ft|m}} of strata in a tightly folded syncline are exposed in this road cut.\n*[[Dan's Mountain State Park]]\n\n==Notable landmarks==\n[[File:Cumberland maryland courthouse.jpg|thumb|right|Allegany County Courthouse]]\n[[File:Wills Creek Cumberland.jpg|thumb|Wills Creek]]\n[[File:Downtown Cumberland.jpg|thumb|Downtown Cumberland]]\nSome of Cumberland's most architecturally significant homes are located in the [[Washington Street Historic District (Cumberland, Maryland)|Washington Street Historic District]].

The first public school for African-Americans in Cumberland operated in a colored YMCA on Independence Street, and was named the Mary Hoye school. In 1923 a new school for blacks was built on Frederick Street. In 1941 an election was held of students and faculty, and the school was renamed '''[[George Washington Carver High School (Cumberland, Maryland)|George Washington Carver School]]'''. In addition to serving the local population, many black people from surrounding areas in West Virginia sent their children to Carver because of the inadequate local facilities.<ref name=\"WMHL\">{{cite web |last1=Mudge |first1=Michael Allen |title=Carver High School - relic of an era |url=http://64.26.76.146/itemdetail.aspx?idEntry=3306 |website=Western Maryland's Historical Library |publisher=Western Maryland's Historical Library |accessdate=23 January 2019}}</ref> The schools were integrated in 1955, when 54 negro children attended the white schools.

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.
