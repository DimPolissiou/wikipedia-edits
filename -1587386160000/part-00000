In order to activate an inline bot, user needs to type in the message field a bot's username and query. The bot then will offer its content. User can choose from that content and send it within a chat.<ref name=\"Inline Bots\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots|publisher=Telegram|title=Introducing Inline Bots|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Channels ===\nIn September 2015, Telegram added channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/channels|title=Channels: Broadcasting Done Right|date=2015-09-22|website=Telegram|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> Channels are a form of one-way messaging where admins are able to post messages but other users are not. Any user is able to create and subscribe to channels. Channels can be created for broadcasting messages to an unlimited number of subscribers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lobao|first1=Martim|title=Telegram v3.2 Brings Channels For Broadcasting Your Messages To The World|url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/09/22/telegram-v3-2-brings-channels-broadcasting-messages-world/|work=Android Police|date=22 September 2015}}</ref> Channels can be publicly available with an alias and a permanent URL so anyone can join. Users who join a channel can see the entire message history. Users can join and leave channels at any time. Depending on a channel's settings, messages may be signed with the channel's name or with the username of the admin who posted them. Non-admin users are unable to see other users who've subscribed to the channel. Furthermore, users can mute a channel, meaning that the user will still receive messages, but won't be notified. Admins can give permission to post comments on the Telegram channel with help of bots. The admin of the channel can obtain general data about the channel. Each message has its own view counter, showing how many users have seen this message, this includes views from forwarded messages. As of May 2019, the creator of a channel can add a discussion group, a separate group where messages in the channel are automatically posted for subscribers to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots|title=Focused Privacy, Discussion Groups, Seamless Web Bots and More|date=2019-05-31|website=Telegram|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] moved their messenger-based newsletter service from [[WhatsApp]] to Telegram after the former banned bulk and automated messaging.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/how-to-follow-bloomberg-on-telegram|title=How to Follow Bloomberg on Telegram|last=Hess|first=Megan|date=December 3, 2019|website=Bloomberg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Jan 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://digiday.com/media/bloomberg-news-using-telegram/|title=How Bloomberg News is using Telegram|last=Ting|first=Deanna|date=2020-01-10|website=Digiday|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> The news service is attempting to grow its audience outside the U.S.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n=== Stickers ===\n\nStickers are cloud-based, high-definition images intended to provide more expressive [[emoji]]. When typing in an emoji, the user is offered to send the respective sticker instead. Stickers come in collections called \"sets\", and multiple stickers can be offered for one emoji. Telegram comes with one default sticker set,<ref name=\"Telegram Stickers\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/stickers-meet-art-and-history|publisher=Telegram|title=Telegram Stickers|date=2 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref> but users can install additional sticker sets provided by third-party contributors. Sticker sets installed from one client become automatically available to all other clients. Sticker images use [[WebP]] file format, which is better optimized to be transmitted over internet.\n\n=== Drafts ===\n\nDrafts are unfinished messages synced across user devices. One can start typing a message on one device and continue on another. The draft will persist in editing area on any device until it is sent or removed.<ref name=\"Drafts\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/drafts|publisher=Telegram|title=Drafts, Picture-in-Picture, and More|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Secret chats ===\n[[File:Telegram secret chat - en.png|thumb|200px|A \"secret chat\" confirmation notice - screenshot from [[Android Marshmallow]].]]\nMessages can also be sent with client-to-client encryption in so-called secret chats. These messages are encrypted with the service's [[MTProto]] protocol.<ref name=\"techfaq\" /> Unlike Telegram's cloud-based messages, messages sent within a secret chat can be accessed only on the device upon which the secret chat was initiated and the device upon which the secret chat was accepted; they cannot be accessed on other devices.<ref name=\"TechCrunch\" /><ref name=\"how-secure\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-secure-is-telegram|publisher=Telegram|work=FAQ|title=How secure is Telegram?}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|publisher=Telegram|url=https://core.telegram.org/mtproto|title=Description of MTProto Mobile Protocol}}</ref> Messages sent within secret chats can, in principle, be deleted at any time and can optionally self-destruct.<ref>{{harvnb|Rottermanner|Kieseberg|Huber|Schmiedecker|2015|p=2}}</ref>\n\nSecret chats have to be initiated and accepted by an invitation, upon which the encryption keys for the session are exchanged.

The calls are built upon the end-to-end encryption of Secret Chats. Connection is established as [[peer-to-peer]] whenever possible, otherwise the closest server to the client is used. According to Telegram, there is a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] working to learn various technical parameters about a call to provide better quality of the service for future uses. After a brief initial trial in Western Europe, voice calls are now available for use in most countries.<ref name=\"Telegram Voice Calls\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/calls|publisher=Telegram|title=Voice Calls: Secure, Crystal-Clear, AI-Powered|date=30 March 2017|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Telescope (video messages) ===\nSince version 4.1, released in May 2017, Telegram offers a dedicated video hosting platform called Telescope.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/video-messages-and-telescope|title=Video Messages and Telescope|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> The round videos can be up to one minute long and autoplay. When posted in a public channel on Telegram, the videos are also uploaded to and viewable without an account. However, Telegram video messages and \"Telescope\" videos sent within non-public chats or groups are not published.\n\n=== Live locations ===\nFor either 15 minutes, one hour, or eight hours, Telegram users can share their live location in a chat since version 4.4 released in October 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/live-locations|title=Live Locations, Media Player and Languages|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> If multiple users share their live location within a group, they are shown on an interactive map. Sharing the 'live location' can be stopped at any time.\n\n=== Social login ===\nIn February 2018, Telegram launched their [[social login]] feature to its users, named as Telegram Login.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/login|title=Telegram Login for Websites|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref> It features a website widget that could be embedded into websites, allowing users to sign into a third party website with their Telegram account. The gateway sends users' Telegram name, username, and profile picture to the website owner, while users' phone number remains hidden. The gateway is integrated with a bot, which is linked with the developer's specific website domain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.neowin.net/news/telegram-48-arrives-with-telegram-login-and-streaming|title=Telegram 4.8 arrives with Telegram Login and streaming|work=Neowin|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Passport ===\nIn July 2018, Telegram introduced their [[online authorisation]] and [[identity management system]], Telegram Passport, for platforms that require real-life identification.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/passport|title=Introducing Telegram Passport|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref> It asks users to upload their own official documents such as passport, identity card, driver license, etc. When an online service requires such identification documents and verification, it forwards the information to the platform with the user's permission. Telegram stated that it does not have access to the data, while the platform will only share the information to the authorised recipient.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/27/telegram-passport/|title=Telegram Passport stores your real-world IDs in the cloud|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-US}}</ref> However, the service was criticised for being vulnerable to online [[Brute-force attack|brute force attacks]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/08/02/telegram-passport-passwords-crack/|title=Telegram Passport is already drawing fire for not being secure enough|last=Canellis|first=David|date=2018-08-02|work=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Polls ===\nPolls are a feature of Telegram that are currently available on Android, iOS and the desktop applications Polls have the option to be anonymous or visible. A user can enter multiple options into the poll. Quiz mode can also be enabled where a user can select the right answer for their poll and leave it to the group to guess.

The protocol was developed by [[Nikolai Durov]] and other developers at Telegram and is based on 256-bit symmetric [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] encryption, 2048-bit [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] encryption and [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange]].<ref name=\"techfaq\">{{cite web|url = https://core.telegram.org/techfaq|title = FAQ for the Technically Inclined|website = Telegram|accessdate = 9 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Servers ===\nTelegram Messenger LLP has servers in a number of countries throughout the world to improve the response time of their service.<ref>{{cite web|trans-title=Telegram, the chat that competes with WhatsApp|place=[[Uruguay|UY]]|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/vida-actual/que-telegram-chat-que-compite.html|work=El Pa\u00eds|title=Telegram, el chat que compite con Whatsapp|language=es|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref> Telegram's server-side software is closed-source and proprietary.

Users can share photos, videos, audio messages and other files (up to 1.5 [[gigabyte]] in size per file). Users can send messages to other users individually or to groups of up to 200,000 members.<ref name=\"Venture-5k\">{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/telegram/status/922426780316774401|title=Group chats on Telegram can now have up to 1,00,000 members.

This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data\".<ref>{{cite web|title = Telegram Privacy Policy|url = https://telegram.org/privacy|website = Telegram|access-date = 17 January 2016}}</ref> This makes the messages' security roughly comparable to that of e-mail. Here, most providers employ client-server encryption as well, however usually with the standardized protocol [[Transport Layer Security]]. E-mails may or may not be encrypted on the servers. Telegram cloud messages and media remain on the servers at least until deleted by all participants.\n\n=== Bots ===\nIn June 2015, Telegram launched a platform for third-party developers to create [[IM bot|bots]].<ref name=\"Telegram Bot Platform\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution|publisher=Telegram|title=Telegram Bot Platform|date=24 June 2015|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> Bots are Telegram accounts operated by programs.

In order to activate an inline bot, user needs to type in the message field a bot's username and query. The bot then will offer its content. User can choose from that content and send it within a chat.<ref name=\"Inline Bots\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots|publisher=Telegram|title=Introducing Inline Bots|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Channels ===\nIn September 2015, Telegram added channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/channels|title=Channels: Broadcasting Done Right|date=2015-09-22|website=Telegram|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> Channels are a form of one-way messaging where admins are able to post messages but other users are not. Any user is able to create and subscribe to channels. Channels can be created for broadcasting messages to an unlimited number of subscribers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lobao|first1=Martim|title=Telegram v3.2 Brings Channels For Broadcasting Your Messages To The World|url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/09/22/telegram-v3-2-brings-channels-broadcasting-messages-world/|work=Android Police|date=22 September 2015}}</ref> Channels can be publicly available with an alias and a permanent URL so anyone can join. Users who join a channel can see the entire message history. Users can join and leave channels at any time. Depending on a channel's settings, messages may be signed with the channel's name or with the username of the admin who posted them. Non-admin users are unable to see other users who've subscribed to the channel. Furthermore, users can mute a channel, meaning that the user will still receive messages, but won't be notified. Admins can give permission to post comments on the Telegram channel with help of bots. The admin of the channel can obtain general data about the channel. Each message has its own view counter, showing how many users have seen this message, this includes views from forwarded messages. As of May 2019, the creator of a channel can add a discussion group, a separate group where messages in the channel are automatically posted for subscribers to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots|title=Focused Privacy, Discussion Groups, Seamless Web Bots and More|date=2019-05-31|website=Telegram|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] moved their messenger-based newsletter service from [[WhatsApp]] to Telegram after the former banned bulk and automated messaging.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/how-to-follow-bloomberg-on-telegram|title=How to Follow Bloomberg on Telegram|last=Hess|first=Megan|date=December 3, 2019|website=Bloomberg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Jan 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://digiday.com/media/bloomberg-news-using-telegram/|title=How Bloomberg News is using Telegram|last=Ting|first=Deanna|date=2020-01-10|website=Digiday|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> The news service is attempting to grow its audience outside the U.S.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n=== Stickers ===\n\nStickers are cloud-based, high-definition images intended to provide more expressive [[emoji]]. When typing in an emoji, the user is offered to send the respective sticker instead. Stickers come in collections called \"sets\", and multiple stickers can be offered for one emoji. Telegram comes with one default sticker set,<ref name=\"Telegram Stickers\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/stickers-meet-art-and-history|publisher=Telegram|title=Telegram Stickers|date=2 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref> but users can install additional sticker sets provided by third-party contributors. Sticker sets installed from one client become automatically available to all other clients. Sticker images use [[WebP]] file format, which is better optimized to be transmitted over internet.\n\n=== Drafts ===\n\nDrafts are unfinished messages synced across user devices. One can start typing a message on one device and continue on another.

The calls are built upon the end-to-end encryption of Secret Chats. Connection is established as [[peer-to-peer]] whenever possible, otherwise the closest server to the client is used. According to Telegram, there is a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] working to learn various technical parameters about a call to provide better quality of the service for future uses.

When posted in a public channel on Telegram, the videos are also uploaded to and viewable without an account. However, Telegram video messages and \"Telescope\" videos sent within non-public chats or groups are not published.\n\n=== Live locations ===\nFor either 15 minutes, one hour, or eight hours, Telegram users can share their live location in a chat since version 4.4 released in October 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/live-locations|title=Live Locations, Media Player and Languages|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> If multiple users share their live location within a group, they are shown on an interactive map.

The organization was favorable to Telegram's secure chats and partially open source code, but criticized the mandatory transfer of contact data to Telegram's servers and the lack of an imprint or address on the service's website. It noted that while the message data is encrypted on the device, it could not analyse the transmission due to a lack of source code.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.test.de/WhatsApp-und-Alternativen-Datenschutz-im-Test-4675013-0/|title=WhatsApp und Alternativen: Datenschutz im Test|date=26 February 2014|website=[[Stiftung Warentest]]|language=de|trans-title=WhatsApp and alternatives: data protection tested|access-date=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) listed Telegram on its \"Secure Messaging Scorecard\" in February 2015.

Telegram's default chat function missed points because the communications were not encrypted with keys the provider didn't have access to, users could not verify contacts' identities, and past messages were not secure if the encryption keys were stolen.

The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|Congress (O)]], The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly.

The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|Congress (O)]], The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly.

He created the character [[Sherlock Holmes]] in 1887 when he published ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', the first of four novels and more than fifty short stories about Holmes and [[Dr. Watson]]. The Sherlock Holmes stories are generally considered milestones in the field of [[crime fiction]].\n\nDoyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about [[Professor Challenger]] and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier [[Brigadier Gerard]], as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.\n\n== Name ==\nDoyle is often referred to as \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" or \"Conan Doyle\", implying that \"Conan\" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Cathedral]], Edinburgh, gives \"Arthur Ignatius Conan\" as his given names and \"Doyle\" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of \"Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 20\u201321). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as \"A. Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 70).</ref> The catalogues of the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] treat \"Doyle\" alone as his surname.<ref>Redmond, Christopher (2009).

Doyle found it too difficult to understand the German medical terms at the classes in Vienna and quickly quit his studies there.

The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named [[George Edalji]] who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals in [[Great Wyrley]]. Police were set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect was jailed.<ref>''International Commentary on Evidence'', Volume 4, Issue 2 2006 Article 3, Boxes in Boxes: Julian Bardes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case, D.

In Nicholas Meyer's pastiche ''[[The West End Horror]]'' (1976), Holmes manages to help clear the name of a shy [[Parsi]] Indian character wronged by the English justice system.

These included attending around 20 [[seance]]s, experiments in [[telepathy]] and sittings with mediums.

''The New Revelation'' was the title of his first Spiritualist work, published two years later. In the intervening years, he wrote to ''Light'' magazine about his faith and lectured frequently on the truth of Spiritualism.\n\nWar-related deaths close to him certainly strengthened his long-held belief in life after death and spirit communication, though it is wrong to claim that the death of his son, Kingsley, turned him to Spiritualism, as is often stated. Doyle came out as a Spiritualist to the public in 1916, a full two years before his son's death.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It was on 28 October 1918 that Kingsley died from pneumonia contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded in the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]].

His second book on Spiritualism, ''[[The Vital Message]]'', appeared in 1919.\n\nDoyle found solace supporting spiritualism and its attempts to find proof of [[Afterlife|existence beyond the grave]]. In particular, according to some,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Did Conan Doyle Go Too Far? |journal=Psychic News|first=Leslie|last=Price|issue=4037|year=2010}}</ref> he favoured [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualism]] and encouraged the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] to accept an eighth precept \u2013 that of following the teachings and example of Jesus of Nazareth.

Initially suspected of being falsified, the photos were decades later determined to be faked (along with admissions from the photographers).\n\nDoyle was friends for a time with [[Harry Houdini]], the American magician who himself became a prominent opponent of the Spiritualist movement in the 1920s following the death of his beloved mother. Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently exposed them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers\u2014a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''. Houdini was apparently unable to convince Doyle that his feats were simply illusions, leading to a bitter public falling out between the two.<ref>[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2003).

He was initially not considered the perpetrator of the hoax because it was seen as too elaborate for him. DNA evidence, however, showed that the tooth discovered in 1915 by Charles Dawson at an entirely different site came from the same jaw as the original skull and jawbone of the Piltdown Man, suggesting he had planted them both. The tooth discovered in 1915 has also since been proven to be a hoax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/research/projects/piltdown-man|title=Piltdown Man|website=www.bournemouth.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nDr Chris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: \u201cConan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition. He wanted to be a member of the Royal Society and he was after an MBE.

He created the character [[Sherlock Holmes]] in 1887 when he published ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', the first of four novels and more than fifty short stories about Holmes and [[Dr. Watson]]. The Sherlock Holmes stories are generally considered milestones in the field of [[crime fiction]].\n\nDoyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about [[Professor Challenger]] and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier [[Brigadier Gerard]], as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.\n\n== Name ==\nDoyle is often referred to as \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" or \"Conan Doyle\", implying that \"Conan\" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Cathedral]], Edinburgh, gives \"Arthur Ignatius Conan\" as his given names and \"Doyle\" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of \"Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 20\u201321). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as \"A. Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 70).</ref> The catalogues of the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] treat \"Doyle\" alone as his surname.<ref>Redmond, Christopher (2009).

He had previously studied at the Portsmouth Eye Hospital to qualify to perform eye tests and prescribe glasses. Vienna was suggested by his friend Vernon Morris as a place to spend six months and train to be an eye surgeon. Doyle found it too difficult to understand the German medical terms at the classes in Vienna and quickly quit his studies there. For the rest of his two-month stay in Vienna, he pursued other activities, such as [[ice skating]] with his wife Louisa and drinking with Brinsley Richards of the London ''Times''. He also wrote ''The Doings of Raffles Haw''.\n\nAfter visiting [[Venice]] and [[Milan]], he spent a few days in Paris observing Edmund Landolt, an expert on diseases of the eye. Within three months of his departure for Vienna, Doyle returned to London. He opened a small office and consulting room at 2 Upper Wimpole Street, or 2 Devonshire Place as it was then.

''The New Revelation'' was the title of his first Spiritualist work, published two years later. In the intervening years, he wrote to ''Light'' magazine about his faith and lectured frequently on the truth of Spiritualism.\n\nWar-related deaths close to him certainly strengthened his long-held belief in life after death and spirit communication, though it is wrong to claim that the death of his son, Kingsley, turned him to Spiritualism, as is often stated. Doyle came out as a Spiritualist to the public in 1916, a full two years before his son's death.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It was on 28 October 1918 that Kingsley died from pneumonia contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded in the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]].

His second book on Spiritualism, ''[[The Vital Message]]'', appeared in 1919.\n\nDoyle found solace supporting spiritualism and its attempts to find proof of [[Afterlife|existence beyond the grave]].

Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently exposed them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers\u2014a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''.

DNA evidence, however, showed that the tooth discovered in 1915 by Charles Dawson at an entirely different site came from the same jaw as the original skull and jawbone of the Piltdown Man, suggesting he had planted them both. The tooth discovered in 1915 has also since been proven to be a hoax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/research/projects/piltdown-man|title=Piltdown Man|website=www.bournemouth.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nDr Chris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: \u201cConan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition.

He edited the 20th edition of ''[[Banister Fletcher|Sir Banister Fletcher]]'s History of Architecture'' and ''Timeless Architecture: a study of key buildings in architectural history'' and is a contributing editor to ''Architects' Journal'', ''The Architectural Review'' and ''Perspectives on Architecture''.\n\n===Television work===\nCruickshank began his career with the BBC as consultant, writer and presenter on the architectural programmes ''[[One Foot in the Past]]'' and ''The House Detectives''. He also contributed films to the ''[[Timewatch]]'' and ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' strands.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2001 he wrote and presented the series ''[[Invasion (TV documentary)|Invasion]]'' in which he examined attempts and plans to invade [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] over the years by exploring coastal [[fortress]]es and [[defense (military)|defensive]] structures around the coast of the country to discover their military heritage.\n\nFurther series included ''[[Britain's Best Buildings]]'' examining architecturally \u2013 or culturally-significant buildings in Great Britain, ''[[Under Fire (TV series)|Under Fire]]'' visiting museums and buildings in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Israel]] to see how recent warfare has affected the country's historic artefacts, and ''[[What the Industrial Revolution Did for Us]]'' focusing on the scientific, technological and political changes of the 19th century.\n\nIn 2003, Cruickshank presented a documentary entitled ''[[Towering Ambitions: Dan Cruickshank at Ground Zero]]'' following the debate and discussion that led to the selection of [[Daniel Libeskind|Daniel Libeskind's]] design for the [[World Trade Center site]] in [[New York City]]; while in 2005 he presented a documentary on the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection \u2013 rolls of [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrocellulose film|nitrate film]] shot in the early 20th century, depicting everyday life in [[Great Britain|Britain]], which were discovered in 1994 in [[Blackburn]].\n\nIn 2004, Cruickshank was at the centre of a controversy when historian [[Marc Morris]] pointed out that a documentary about [[Harlech Castle]] shown on BBC4 and billed as \"written and presented by Dan Cruickshank\" contained obvious borrowings from Morris's earlier [[Channel 4]] series, ''Castle''. The BBC subsequently stated that Cruickshank was not responsible and that it was an error by researchers.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/28/broadcasting.bbc \"Broadcaster gets apology from BBC as history repeats itself\", ''The Guardian'', 28 May 2004].

The BBC subsequently made a \"goodwill payment\" to Morris in recognition of the error.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nPerhaps his greatest success to date came with ''[[Around the World in 80 Treasures]]'', charting Cruickshank's five-month trip around the world to visit eighty man-made artefacts or buildings that he had selected, in order to chart the history of mankind's [[civilization|civilisation]].\n\nIn 2006, Cruickshank presented ''[[Marvels of the Modern Age]]'', a series focusing on the development of [[modernism]] in [[design]], from [[Greek Architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture]], to [[Bauhaus]] and the present.\n\n''[[Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture]]'', a 2008 series in which he travelled around the world visiting what he considered to be the world's most unusual and interesting buildings.\n\nIn 2010, he embarked on a 3 part series on the history of the railways in Britain for [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] TV channel, including visits to [[Chester]] to examine the events surrounding the [[Dee bridge disaster]] of 1847, and [[Manchester]] for the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] which opened in 1830. The series was entitled \"Great Railway Adventures\" and first appeared on UK television in the spring of 2010. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n===Personal life===\nCruickshank lives in a Georgian house in [[Spitalfields]], London, which he shares with his

He edited the 20th edition of ''[[Banister Fletcher|Sir Banister Fletcher]]'s History of Architecture'' and ''Timeless Architecture: a study of key buildings in architectural history'' and is a contributing editor to ''Architects' Journal'', ''The Architectural Review'' and ''Perspectives on Architecture''.\n\n===Television work===\nCruickshank began his career with the BBC as consultant, writer and presenter on the architectural programmes ''[[One Foot in the Past]]'' and ''The House Detectives''. He also contributed films to the ''[[Timewatch]]'' and ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' strands.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2001 he wrote and presented the series ''[[Invasion (TV documentary)|Invasion]]'' in which he examined attempts and plans to invade [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] over the years by exploring coastal [[fortress]]es and [[defense (military)|defensive]] structures around the coast of the country to discover their military heritage.\n\nFurther series included ''[[Britain's Best Buildings]]'' examining architecturally \u2013 or culturally-significant buildings in Great Britain, ''[[Under Fire (TV series)|Under Fire]]'' visiting museums and buildings in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Israel]] to see how recent warfare has affected the country's historic artefacts, and ''[[What the Industrial Revolution Did for Us]]'' focusing on the scientific, technological and political changes of the 19th century.\n\nIn 2003, Cruickshank presented a documentary entitled ''[[Towering Ambitions: Dan Cruickshank at Ground Zero]]'' following the debate and discussion that led to the selection of [[Daniel Libeskind|Daniel Libeskind's]] design for the [[World Trade Center site]] in [[New York City]]; while in 2005 he presented a documentary on the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection \u2013 rolls of [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrocellulose film|nitrate film]] shot in the early 20th century, depicting everyday life in [[Great Britain|Britain]], which were discovered in 1994 in [[Blackburn]].\n\nIn 2004, Cruickshank was at the centre of a controversy when historian [[Marc Morris]] pointed out that a documentary about [[Harlech Castle]] shown on BBC4 and billed as \"written and presented by Dan Cruickshank\" contained obvious borrowings from Morris's earlier [[Channel 4]] series, ''Castle''. The BBC subsequently stated that Cruickshank was not responsible and that it was an error by researchers.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/28/broadcasting.bbc \"Broadcaster gets apology from BBC as history repeats itself\", ''The Guardian'', 28 May 2004]. Accessed 16 January 2014</ref> Channel 4's head of history programming, Hamish Mykura, commented that \"When a programme claims to have an author's voice, it should be that author's voice and no one else's\".  The BBC subsequently made a \"goodwill payment\" to Morris in recognition of the error.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nPerhaps his greatest success to date came with ''[[Around the World in 80 Treasures]]'', charting Cruickshank's five-month trip around the world to visit eighty man-made artefacts or buildings that he had selected, in order to chart the history of mankind's [[civilization|civilisation]].\n\nIn 2006, Cruickshank presented ''[[Marvels of the Modern Age]]'', a series focusing on the development of [[modernism]] in [[design]], from [[Greek Architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture]], to [[Bauhaus]] and the present.\n\n''[[Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture]]'', a 2008 series in which he travelled around the world visiting what he considered to be the world's most unusual and interesting buildings.\n\nIn 2010, he embarked on a 3 part series on the history of the railways in Britain for [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] TV channel, including visits to [[Chester]] to examine the events surrounding the [[Dee bridge disaster]] of 1847, and [[Manchester]] for the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] which opened in 1830. The series was entitled \"Great Railway Adventures\" and first appeared on UK television in the spring of 2010. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n===Personal life===\nCruickshank lives in a Georgian house in [[Spitalfields]], London, which he shares with his partner, the painter Marenka Gabeler, their son, and his daughter from a previous marriage.<ref name=\"obs1\">{{cite news |

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from [[space debris|micrometeoroid and orbital debris]], and were further improved after RCC damage caused of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].  Beginning with [[STS-114]], the orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system to alert the crew to any potential damage. The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with high-temperature reusable surface insulation.

The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=etuse>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf NASA-CR-195281, \"Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system\"].

Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]]. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], Spacelab, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the&nbsp;ocean.<ref name=ssbsterg>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a-9VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DuEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5161%2C3581553 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle booster stage to be solid-fuel, reusable vehicle |date=March 15, 1972 |page=3A}}</ref> In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle,<ref name=odsp>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tNhVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3326%2C897997|work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=President okays spacecraft plan|date=January 5, 1972 |page=1A}}</ref><ref name=bsspgpa>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2u9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xe0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4846%2C1764562 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Big Space Shuttle proposal gets presidential approval |date=January 6, 1972 |page=1}}</ref> and NASA decided on its final design in&nbsp;March.<ref name=ssbsterg/> That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test,<ref name=sfgapovr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=361VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6429%2C2842712 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Shuttle's first glide a 'pushover' |date=August 12, 1977 |page=1A}}</ref> where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned. ''Discovery'' was the first of NASA's three remaining operational Space Shuttles to be retired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA\u2014NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Launch Schedule |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe final Space Shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010, but the program was later extended to July 2011 when Michael Suffredini of the ISS program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the International Space Station.<ref>{{cite web |first=John|last= Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2010/space-100506-rianovosti01.htm |title=Space Shuttle may continue through next year\u2014Roscosmos |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> [[STS-135]] launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/index.html |title= Launch and Landing |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiters on display===\nNASA announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the [[Space Shuttle program]].
