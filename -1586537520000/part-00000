Rison was selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] five times, from 1990\u20131993 and once again in 1997.\n\nRison won a [[Super Bowl]] championship with the Packers in 1996 over the [[New England Patriots]], scoring the first points of the game on a 54-yard touchdown catch from quarterback [[Brett Favre]].  He also won a [[Grey Cup]] championship with the [[Toronto Argonauts]] in 2004. He is one of the few players to win professional football championships in both the [[United States]] of America and [[Canada]]. He was released by the Argonauts during the [[2005 CFL season]]. He holds an NFL record for scoring a touchdown with 7 teams.\n\nHe was a star player at [[Flint Northwestern High School]] and in college at [[Michigan State University]]. As a senior at Michigan State, Rison had 30 receptions for 709 yards and 5 touchdowns; he was a prominent contributor to the 1987 Michigan State squad that won the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1988.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Indianapolis Colts===\nThe [[1992 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] selected Rison in the first round (22nd overall) of the [[1989 NFL Draft]]. In his rookie season, he caught 52 passes for 820 yards with four touchdown receptions.\n\n===Atlanta Falcons===\nOn April 20, 1990, the [[1993 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] traded Rison, [[Chris Hinton]], a fifth round pick in the 1990 NFL Draft, and their first round pick on the [[1991 NFL Draft]] to the [[1993 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] for their first overall pick and their fourth round pick in the 1990 NFL Draft. The Indianapolis Colts used the trade to move up to select [[Jeff George]] first overall in the [[1990 NFL Draft]]. His next season marked the first of five very productive campaigns with the Falcons. During these years, Rison finished near the top of most receiving categories, and led all NFL players with 15 receiving touchdowns in 1993. Andre Rison was only the 5th Receiver in NFL history to score 60 touchdowns in his first six seasons. Rison led the NFL in most receptions in his first four and first five seasons. Rison was second in the NFL for most receptions in six seasons. During his final season in Atlanta, on June 9, 1994, his girlfriend at the time [[Lisa Left Eye Lopes]] from [[TLC (group)|TLC]] burned Rison's house down.\n\n===Cleveland Browns===\nAfter the 1994 season, Rison signed a lucrative free agent contract with Cleveland, where he was expected to become the featured receiving threat for the Browns, who had made the playoffs the year before.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/brownshistory/plaindealer/index.ssf?/browns/more/history/19951217BROWNS.html |title=Affair To Remember Emotional Browns Pound The Bengals |newspaper=[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]] |last=Cabot |first=Mary Kay |date=December 17, 1995 |accessdate=December 31, 2008}}</ref>  Rison, who had been named to the Pro Bowl in four of his previous six seasons, had career lows in receptions (47), yards (701), touchdowns (3), receptions per game (2.9), and yards per game (43.8). Rison also developed a feud with the Cleveland fans, who were angered over the announcement that the team would be relocating to Baltimore. After a home loss to the Packers, Rison, who had been booed by the fans throughout the game, lashed out, stating, \"We didn't make the fucking move. So, for all the booers, fuck you too. I'll be glad when we get to Baltimore, if that's the case. We don't have any home-field advantage. I've never been booed at home. Baltimore's our home.

She would flirt on-and-off for years with [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]). At the start of the series, Elsie worked in the department store \"Miami Modes\"\u2019, and had two adult children, [[Linda Cheveski|Linda]] (Anne Cunningham) and [[Dennis Tanner|Dennis]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]), from her marriage to [[Arnold Tanner]] (Frank Crawshaw).\n\n==Dennis Tanner==\n{{Main|Dennis Tanner}}\n\nDennis  ([[Philip Lowrie]]) was the teenage tearaway son of [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]), and newly released from jail when the series opens. He works at a seedy club, where he has showbusiness ambitions of which his mother is sceptical. After failing as a singer, he moves to London as a talent scout. At this point he was written out of the story because of a strike by the actor's union Equity, but made many re-appearances in the series.\n\n==Linda Cheveski==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n| name = Linda Cheveski\n| portrayer =[[Anne Cunningham]]\n| first = 9 December 1960\n| last = 20 June 1984\n| years = 1960\u20131963, 1966\u20131968, 1984\n| books = ''Coronation Street:<br>The Complete Saga''<br>''Coronation Street:<br>The War Years''\n| spinoffs = ''The Life and Loves of Elsie Tanner'' (1987)\n| born = 10 January 1940\n| home = [[Toronto]]\n| father = [[Arnold Tanner]]\n| mother = [[Elsie Tanner]]\n| stepfather = [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street)|Steve Tanner]] (1967)<br>[[Alan Howard (Coronation Street)|Alan Howard]] (1970-78)<br>[[Bill Gregory]] (1984-2004)\n| stepmother = [[Norah Tanner]]\n| aunts = Phyllis Bailey<br>Fay Butler\n| uncles = Albert Tanner\n| brothers = [[Dennis Tanner]]\n| grandfathers = Arthur Grimshaw<br>Wally Tanner\n| grandmothers = Alice Grimshaw<br>Amy Tanner\n| sons = [[Paul Cheveski]]<br>[[List of Coronation Street characters (1980)#Martin Cheveski|Martin Cheveski]]\n| cousins = [[List of Coronation Street characters (1968)#Gary Bailey|Gary Bailey]]<br>[[Bernard Butler (Coronation Street)|Bernard Butler]]<br>[[Sandra Butler]]\n| husband = [[Ivan Cheveski]] (until 1984)\n| relatives = Arnley Grimshaw<br/>[[Colin Grimshaw]]<br/>[[Eileen Grimshaw]]<br/>[[Julie Carp]]<br/>[[Jason Grimshaw]]<br/>[[Todd Grimshaw]]\n| creator     = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = [[Stuart Latham]]\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#C|Former; recurring]]\n}}\n'''Linda Cheveski''' (also '''Tanner''') is played by actress Anne Cunningham between 1960 and 1984. The character was created by series creator [[Tony Warren]] as part of the original cast, and she appears in the first episode along with family members including her mother, aging 'good-time girl' [[Elsie Tanner]] and her 'lovable rogue' brother [[Dennis Tanner|Dennis]]. She is later joined by her Polish husband [[Ivan Cheveski|Ivan]], and the young couple are central to early storylines as they cope with Linda's pregnancy affecting their marriage. Cunningham was written out after a year due to a strike at the actor's union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] preventing new contracts being signed,<ref name=kershaw>{{cite book|last=Kershaw|first=H.V.|title=The Street Where I Live|year=1981|publisher=Granada Publishing|isbn=0-246-11734-6|pages=51\u201358}}</ref> and the actress chose not to return when the strike ended. This has thus far proved to be Cunningham's last appearance as a member of the regular cast, but she has returned for several short stints since, most recently in 1984.\n\nLinda was the daughter of Arnold and Elsie Tanner. She was born in [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]'s living room at [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]] on 8 January 1940, being delivered by [[Ena Sharples]]. Linda grew up in the Street, presumably attending Bessie Street School.\n\nLike her mother Elsie, Linda was interested in men and eager to marry. At thirteen, she fought off her mother's boyfriend Chuck Nelson when he tried to rape her. She took a job at Elliston's Raincoat Factory and briefly dated [[#David Barlow|David Barlow]] before falling for Roy Newman, an American GI stationed at Burtonwood. The pair became engaged but the whirlwind romance didn't last.\n\nIn 1957, she met Ivan Cheveski, a Polish immigrant, and they married in 1958. Their lives together began happily with a move to Warrington, but Linda quickly grew dissatisfied with the marriage as Ivan wanted to support her and didn't want her go off to work or to begin a family until they were financially secure. When she fell pregnant in late 1960, she fled to Weatherfield and moved back in with Elsie and younger brother Dennis. Ivan tracked her down but she was surprised when he liked the idea of having a baby, so they reconciled.\n\nDeciding to stay in Weatherfield for the time being, the Cheveskis bought 9 Coronation Street and moved in. Linda gave birth to a baby boy on 14 June 1961 after two days in labour. Although Linda settled into motherhood well in Weatherfield, Ivan became interested in a job at his friend's firm in Canada. Linda was less keen on emigrating and ripped up the forms. Eventually she agreed, but didn't tell Elsie - eventually Ena Sharples told her. The Cheveskis left the country as planned a week later.\n\nLinda, Ivan and Paul returned to the UK for Christmas 1962, and Linda admitted to Elsie she wasn't happy in Canada. Although Ivan was offered his old job back, they returned to Montreal. During her brief visit, Linda became suspicious that Elsie was having an affair with Len Fairclough.\n\nLinda and Ivan had a second son, Martin Cheveski, born in 1964.\n\nThe family returned again in 1966, but although Linda wanted to stay in Weatherfield, Ivan had his heart set on Birmingham. Linda had been having an affair with a Canadian called Mike, and didn't know whether or not to return to Ivan.\n\nAs Linda was about to follow her husband to Birmingham, Paul went missing - he later turned up, having been rescued from the canal by a mystery man. The incident brought Ivan back to Weatherfield, and the Cheveskis reconciled again, and moved to Birmingham.\n\nAside from a brief return for Elsie's wedding to Steve Tanner in 1967, Christmas that year and Dennis' wedding the following year, Linda was not seen on the Street again until 1984, when she was entrusted by Elsie to take care of the sale of No.11 after she had left to live in Portugal. By this time, Linda was estranged from Ivan and hoped to stay in Weatherfield, but Elsie was adamant that the house be sold. Linda sold up to [[Bill Webster]] for \u00a311,500 and left the Street again.\n\nFollowing Dennis' death in 2020, Ken Barlow mentions to Dennis' ex-wife [[Rita Tanner]] that Linda is still alive and now lives in [[Toronto]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Frank Barlow==\n{{Main|Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)}}\n\nFrank Barlow ([[Frank Pemberton]]) is a postman, devoted to his family, but uneasy about his son [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]) starting on a university career and acquiring sophisticated ideas. The premature death of his wife [[Ida Barlow|Ida]] ([[Noel Dyson]]) brings the two of them together.\n\n==Ida Barlow==\n{{Main|Ida Barlow}}\n\nIda Barlow ([[Noel Dyson]]) is the wife of [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank Barlow]] (Frank Pemberton) and mother to [[Ken Barlow|Kenneth]] ([[William Roache]] and [[David Barlow (Coronation Street)|David]] ([[Alan Rothwell]]). She is a dedicated home-maker, who dotes on her family. Her friendship with next-door neighbour [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]) sometimes causes friction with Albert\u2019s daughter [[Beattie Pearson]] ([[Gabrielle Daye]]). Ida was the first regular character to be killed off.\n\n==Ken Barlow==\n{{Main|Ken Barlow}}\n\nKen ([[William Roache]]) is the elder son of [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank Barlow]] ([[Frank Pemberton]]) and [[Ida Barlow]] ([[Noel Dyson]]). His clash with his postman father as the first university student in a traditional working-class family forms the opening situation of the series. Although he becomes a political activist with a complex love-life, some critics found the character boring. But Ken went on to become the longest-running character in any soap opera.\n\n==David Barlow==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = [[Coronation Street]]\n| image =\n| caption =\n| name = David Barlow\n| portrayer = [[Alan Rothwell]]\n| creator = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Stuart Latham (1960)<br>Margaret Morris (1963)<br>[[H.V.

The Barlow family at 3 Coronation Street consisted of David, his academic older brother [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]), his mother [[Ida Barlow|Ida]] ([[Noel Dyson]]) and his absent father [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank]] (Frank Pemberton), who was away fighting in World War II until 1945.\n\nIn 1961, David was an apprentice engineer but he wanted to pursue a career in football. He signed for Weatherfield County FC and in his first match he scored the only goal. He was one of the team's best players and in June a second division London team wanted to transfer David and offered \u00a31,000 to sign him. David left Weatherfield to play for the team and didn't return until 1963, except for a brief trip up for Ida's funeral which he watched from afar. By 1963, he was quite well off financially and didn't fit in with the locals.\n\nHe next visited over Christmas 1964 and stayed with Ken and his wife, [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie]] ([[Anne Reid]]). He didn't tell them that he was suspended from playing for accepting a bribe, but by February was cleared. He was off the field again in April after tearing a ligament, and stayed with the Barlows so he could date [[Irma Ogden]] ([[Sandra Gough]]), who he started seeing during his previous visit. By now, Frank had moved away, and Ken was David's only family in the area. David announced he was retiring from football but took a job as player coach for Weatherfield Athletics. He was also contracted to write for a football gossip column in Weatherfield Advertiser.\n\nFun-loving Irma was flattered by David's interest in her and was receptive to his advances. He wanted to move the relationship to the next level and asked her to marry him when the street residents went a trip to the Blue John Mines. Irma accepted.\n\nDavid had big plans for them to move to Cheshire and Irma's parents, [[Stan Ogden|Stan]] ([[Bernard Youens]]) and [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]), were keen for her to have a well-off lifestyle as the Ogdens had always struggled with money. Irma's parents were an old-fashioned couple and Stan hit Irma when he found David in Irma's bedroom. David convinced Irma they should marry quietly and without telling their families, but everybody found out anyway and surprised them by showing up for a reception.\n\nWhile playing at a charity football match, David was injured and rushed to hospital, where he was told by the Doctor that he wouldn't be able to play football again. The newlyweds had to cancel their plans to buy a house as he couldn't continue at the club. His football career over, he considered a factory job but hesitated as it was such a step down. Irma convinced him it might be a better idea to buy the Corner Shop in Coronation Street as owner Lionel Petty was selling. At first he was too proud to accept living in Coronation Street, which caused a brief split between him and Irma. Valerie talked David round, telling him marriage is sometimes difficult and he has to put the effort in.\n\nDavid had trouble getting to know the Ogdens. In 1966, Irma left the shop to work in the PVC factory across the street as shop work bored her, and David was lumbered with free-loading Hilda as shop assistant. David was never happy in the shop as it was typically where the women of the Street went to share gossip. Irma soon returned to work in the shop.\n\nIn 1967, David considered standing for Council elections, but Irma hated the idea and he eventually decided not to go through with it.\n\nIrma told David she wanted to have a baby. She got pregnant the same year, but suffered a [[miscarriage]]. David reminded Irma that they could try again but Irma was devastated and was convinced this meant she couldn't have children. David was fraught about how to make Irma happy, and went to an adoption agency to see if that was an option for them. David still hoped Irma would change her mind but at Christmas the couple fostered Jill Morris for a few days.\n\nIn 1968, David was rapidly growing tired of the shop, and aspired to return to football, still being young enough to have a good career ahead of him. Despite his earlier injury, he played a game, and his leg was fine. He took this as a sign that he might just be able to return to the sport full-time, for a team in Australia, but Irma was dead against it - the prospect of living somewhere where they didn't know anyone appealed to David much more than it did to Irma. However, when David was offered the position he wanted he took it and set about selling the shop. To interest potential buyers, he had an article published in the Gazette but the article made it seem as though David and Irma were emigrating because streets like Coronation Street were beneath them. Maggie Clegg eventually bought the shop.\n\nIn 1970, the Barlows and their son Darren were involved in a car accident. David and Darren were both killed, but Irma survived and returned to Weatherfield shortly after the crash.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Elsie Lappin==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = [[Coronation Street]]\n| name = Elsie Lappin\n| first = 9 December 1960<br/>Episode 1\n| last = 14 December 1960<br/>Episode 2\n| portrayer = [[Maudie Edwards]]\n| creator = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#L|Former; guest]]\n| husband = Tommy Foyle (1930\u201345)<br>Les Lappin (1947\u201352)\n| daughters = Hilda Foyle<br>Shelagh Foyle\n| date of birth = 1906\n| date of death = 1991\n}}\n'''Elsie Castleway''' (also '''Foyle''' and '''Lappin''') was the owner of the Corner Shop on Coronation Street from 1945 to 1960.

Once Elsie hands over the lease to the shop to Florrie, she leaves the Street.<ref name=\"40years\">{{cite book |last=Little|first= Daran|authorlink= Daran Little|title= 40 Years of Coronation Street |year=2000|publisher=Granada Media|isbn=0-233-99806-3}}</ref>\n\nA variety singer in her youth, Elsie's singing days ended when she injured her vocal chords at twenty-three. In 1930, she married widower Tommy Foyle and ran the Corner Shop in Coronation Street with him until his death in 1945. They had two children together, Hilda and Shelagh. Elsie enjoyed working behind the counter and took over the running of the shop when Tommy was confined to bed after a stroke.\n\nWhen [[rationing|rationing laws]], were in place during [[World War II]], Elsie helped her neighbours by buying [[black market|black market goods]] to supplement their allotments. Elsie's scheme was rumbled by the police and she was fined.\n\nThe war ended on 8 May 1945, but as the other Street residents celebrated, the Foyles mourned the passing of Tommy who died from a heart attack. An invalid in his later years, Tommy had urged Elsie to remarry so she wouldn't have to run the shop alone after his death, and although she could cope perfectly well at the shop Elsie did get married again, to Les Lappin in 1947. Elsie was a widow again in 1952 when Les died from a heart attack.\n\nHilda and Shelagh remained at the shop until 1957 and in 1960 Elsie decided to retire. Buying a bungalow at Knott End, she sold the shop to Florrie Lindley. After the sale, Elsie remained for a few days to show Florrie the tricks of the trade and warn her about the neighbours.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Florrie Lindley==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n|name =Florrie Lindley\n|portrayer =[[Betty Alberge]]\n|born = 12 June 1922\n|died = Circa 1991\n|years = 1960\u20131965\n|first = 9 December 1960<br>Episode 1\n|last = 2 June 1965<br>Episode 467\n|husband = [[Norman Lindley]]\n|cousins = [[List of Coronation Street characters (1963)|Alan Mather]]\n|creator = [[Tony Warren]]\n|introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#L|Former; regular]]\n}}\n\n'''Florence Lena 'Florrie' Lindley''' is one of the original characters of [[Coronation Street]].\n\nShy, retiring Florrie was a barmaid at the Farrier's Arms on Collier Street before moving from Esmerelda Street to Coronation Street in 1960, buying the Corner Shop from Elsie Lappin and renaming it \"Lindley's Provisions\". She was worried about moving to a place where she didn't know anyone, and told the neighbours that she was a widow when in fact she was separated from Norman Lindley who had left for engineering work in India.\n\nHer first few days in the shop were marred when she was caught by the police selling firelighters after closing time. She was fined \u00a31 in court, but she was mainly worried about the local newspaper carrying the story and sullying her reputation.\n\nFlorrie settled in well, making a few friends such as Elsie Tanner and Albert Tatlock, and she hoped romance would be on the horizon with widower Harry Hewitt, but he was largely oblivious to her interest and ended up marrying barmaid Concepta Riley shortly after her arrival. She had no close friends in the street and usually went to bingo when she was lonely.\n\nSometimes Florrie had trouble paying her suppliers, so to generate a regular source of income, Florrie rented out the flat above the shop, while she lived in the accommodation behind the shop. The first tenants were Phil Braithwaite and Norman Dobson, and they were followed by Sheila Birtles and Doreen Lostock.\n\nIn 1962, Florrie and Elsie went on a few blind dates together. Elsie was more experienced at dating than Florrie, and still acted youthful, when actually both were the same age. Florrie ended up seeing Frank Barlow when they were both stood up, but they kept their meetings secret at first as Frank was also recently widowed. His intentions were never more than honourable and it soon dawned on Florrie that Frank wanted them to be just close friends. Florrie poured her heart out to him but he still wouldn't open up to her and he later admitted that he wasn't interested in her romantically. To save face, Florrie said she felt the same. They remained friends.\n\nAfter one trip to the bingo with Emily Nugent in 1963, Florrie won \u00a3100 but was mugged. She was relieved when Jerry Booth got her handbag back.\n\nIn 1964, Florrie decided to make some changes to the shop, and opened a sub post office, and moving the door to stop the draughts. She took on Dennis Tanner as assistant, but he wasn't up to the job and was replaced by Irma Ogden. However, she was trying to distract herself from the loneliness she felt and occasionally she lashed out at Irma. One particularly bad day saw Florrie have a breakdown in the shop and throw a tin through the shop window, and collapse in a sobbing heap.\n\nShortly afterwards things picked up as Florrie returned to the shop against her Doctor's orders and she started seeing Irishman Tickler Murphy. Tickler was interested in the shop, and kept up the relationship until Florrie started talking about marriage, too soon apparently as he was afraid of commitment and fled back to Ireland.\n\nIn 1965, Florrie's estranged husband Norman Lindley tracked her down and appeared at the shop, seeking a reconciliation. The neighbours were stunned that Florrie wasn't a widow as she had always claimed. Florrie wasn't sure how to react to him, as he said if she didn't go to Canada with him they might as well get a divorce.\n\nNorman's head was turned by Elsie Tanner, and they went out while Norman laboured under the impression that Florrie was going to turn him down. Florrie deliberated over it but eventually went to Canada with Norman after all.\n\n==Ena Sharples==\n{{Main|Ena Sharples}}\n\nEna ([[Violet Carson]]) is the widowed caretaker of the Mission Hall, and also the local gossip, casting judgment on what she sees as the immoral behaviour of her neighbours in the street, notably [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]), with whom she feuds regularly. But as she spends her evenings drinking with her old schoolfriends [[Martha Longhurst]] ([[Lynne Carol]]) and Minnie Caldwell ([[Margot Bryant]]), she in turn comes under criticism from lay-preacher [[Leonard Swindley]] ([[Arthur Lowe]]).\n\n==Annie Walker==\n{{Main|Annie Walker (Coronation Street)}}\n\nAnnie ([[Doris Speed]]) was the manager of the Rovers Return Inn  - immaculately kept, regarded as snobbish and condescending, yet still liked and respected by the other characters, who seemed to need a queenly figure on the scene. She and her mild-mannered husband [[Jack Walker (Coronation Street)|Jack]] ([[Arthur Leslie]]) remained a popular double-act for years; their two children were [[Billy Walker (Coronation Street)|Billy]] ([[Ken Farrington]]) and [[Joan Davies|Joan]] (June Barry).\n\n==Albert Tatlock==\n{{Main|Albert Tatlock}}\n\nAlbert ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]) is a grumpy retired widower with nothing to do, except work on his allotment and talk about his service in World War I.

She appears in the very first episode of ''Coronation Street'' and makes her last appearance in early 1961.\n\nSusan Cunningham was a contemporary of Ken Barlow at Manchester University who unwittingly caused trouble at home for Ken. Ken arranged to meet her for drinks at the Imperial Hotel, where his mother was employed as a kitchen hand. Frank Barlow objected to Ken spending money in the same place his mum worked hard to earn it and forbade Ken from meeting Susan. When Ken didn't show, Susan drove to Coronation Street to see if he was alright. Ken's university education had turned him into \"a proper stuck-up little snob\", as Albert Tatlock put it - \"snooty\" was the simple way in which Ken's father, Frank, defined Ken's change in attitude. Thus, Ken gradually became embarrassed about his surroundings; his contemporaries lived in more affluent areas and he was put out when Susan arrived at No.3, the family home. Susan realised this but soon put his mind at rest: she liked Ken for himself and was not bothered by his home. Ken and Susan split up in 1961, shortly after they took part in a \"Ban the Bomb\" protest, as they felt that their backgrounds were too different.\n\nSome time later, Susan discovered that she was pregnant and wrote to him, asking if he wanted to try again with their relationship, but the letter was misplaced and Ken did not read it or become aware of its existence. Her son, [[Lawrence Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Lawrence Cunningham]] ([[Linus Roache]]), was born later that year. Lawrence went on to become an English lecturer and had two children of his own, [[James Cunningham (Coronation Street)|James Cunningham]] ([[James Roache]]) and Chloe, with Ken none the wiser until August 2010 when Susan's letter was found behind a skirting board at No.3. By this time, Susan had been dead for several years but the discovery of the letter prompted Ken to contact Lawrence and on meeting him, it became obvious to Ken that Lawrence was his son. Ken began to bond with his son but after discovering that Lawrence was homophobic and disapproved of his son, James, being homosexual, Ken cut all contact with him, angry that he would disown his own son for being different.\n\n==Ivan Cheveski==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n| name = Ivan Cheveski\n| portrayer = Ernst Walder\n| first = 14 December 1960<br>Episode 2\n| last = 27 December 1967<br>Episode 734\n| years = 1960\u20131963, 1966\u20131967\n| books = Coronation Street: The Complete Saga\n| father = Kazimierz Cheveski\n| mother = Biasia Cheveski\n| sons = [[Paul Cheveski]]<br>[[List of Coronation Street characters (1980)#Martin Cheveski|Martin Cheveski]]\n| wife = [[Linda Cheveski|Linda Tanner]] (until 1984)\n| uncles = Rizard Cheveski\n| date of birth = 1936\n| creator     = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#C|Former; recurring]]\n}}\n'''Ivan Cheveski''' played by actor Ernst Walder until 1967. He is a Coronation Street resident in the early 1960s, and the husband of Elsie Tanner's daughter Linda. He and Linda originally move to Warrington but buy a house in Coronation Street when Linda wants to be closer to her family. Ivan, Linda and their newborn son Paul move to Canada in 1961, making the occasional visit to Weatherfield on their return to the UK in 1966.\n\nBorn in Poland, Ivan and his family left their home during the war as Ivan's grandparents' shop was burned down by the Nazis when they were found to be harbouring a Jewish doctor. After the war, Ivan emigrated to the UK, and found a home in Warrington with his uncle Rizhard.\n\nOn 1 April 1958, Ivan married eighteen-year-old Linda Tanner and the pair settled in Warrington. Hard-working Ivan saw it as his duty to provide for his wife and preferred that Linda didn't work. Linda fled to her home town Weatherfield to stay with her mum Elsie Tanner, telling her she wasn't returning to Ivan, but when he followed her to get her back, she admitted she was pregnant. Ivan was thrilled and agreed to stay in Coronation Street - the couple moved into 9 Coronation Street, and Ivan bought it.\n\nWhile Linda and Elsie prepared the house for the baby, Ivan concentrated on money. He worked in Warrington, and kept up the job while living in Weatherfield. For extra money, he took an evening job as potman at the Rovers Return Inn. Linda convinced Ivan to take a day job in Weatherfield, at an ironworks.\n\nIn June 1961, Linda gave birth to a baby boy - Ivan wanted to name him Rizhard after his uncle, but they settled on Paul.\n\nThe new parents were worried when Paul developed a lingering chesty cough, and it made them realise how unhealthy living in the inner city was. When Ivan received a letter from one of his workmates in Canada, he became taken with the standard of living his friend had and when offered a job that would see him earn just as much as his friend, Ivan convinced Linda that they should emigrate. Linda agreed, for better or worse, and the family moved.\n\nThe Cheveskis made several return visits to Weatherfield, including once for Christmas in 1962 and again in 1966 when Ivan had set his mind on moving to Birmingham. The marriage was in crisis as Linda had had an affair with a Canadian and returned to Weatherfield. Ivan got a job in Birmingham and waited for Linda to come to her senses. It took an accident in which Paul fell into a canal to bring Ivan up to Weatherfield, and the Cheveskis got back together after all. Ivan was furious when he found out that councillor Len Fairclough had voted against the erection of a fence by the canal, and hit him when drunk, blaming him for what could easily have killed his son.\n\nIvan and Linda had a second son, Martin, in 1964 and stayed in Birmingham, next visiting for Elsie's wedding to Steve Tanner in 1967.\n\nIn 1984, Ivan and Linda split up, apparently for good.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Harry Hewitt==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n| name = Harry Hewitt\n| portrayer = Ivan Beavis\n| first = 14 December 1960<br>Episode 2\n| last = 6 September 1967<br>Episode 702\n| years = 1960\u20131965, 1967\n| birth = 24 February 1925\n| death = 6 September 1967\n| books = Coronation Street: The Complete Saga\n| father = Thomas Hewitt\n| mother = Mary Hewitt\n| sisters = [[Alice Burgess]]<br>Frances Hewitt\n| sons = [[Christopher Hewitt]]\n| daughters = [[Lucille Hewitt]]\n| wife = Lizzie Harding (1948\u201359)<br>[[Concepta Riley]] (1961\u201367)\n| grandfathers = Samuel Hewitt<br>Alfred Makepiece\n| grandmothers = Dolly Hewitt<br>Ivy Makepiece\n| creator     = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#H|Former; regular]]\n}}\n'''Harry Hewitt''' is played by actor Ivan Beavis.\n\nHarry Hewitt was the second of Thomas and Mary Hewitt's children, born on 24 February 1921. Like his older sister Alice, he was educated at Hardcastle's Factory School, which later became Bessie Street School, before going out to work at fifteen and landing a job as a clippie on the newly established Weatherfield Bus Service.\n\nHarry and Alice both suffered from Mary's mental problems. During the Depression, Thomas had been so desperate for work that he joined a raid on Elliston's Raincoat Factory, only to be caught by the police and imprisoned. By the time he returned home, Mary had changed into resentful and angry woman, but her problems went ignored until the night Harry returned home from a pub crawl after receiving his first wage from the buses. As he stumbled into the house blind drunk, Mary came charging down the stairs in her nightgown, a carving knife in her hand, and started slashing at her son in a psychotic episode. While the neighbours held her down, the doctor was called and Mary was carted off in a van. She spent the rest of her life in a mental asylum, passing away in 1936. Harry, who had sustained cuts to his arms in the attack, didn't attend the funeral.\n\nThomas Hewitt was not particularly close to either of his children, and after war broke out, was ashamed of Harry not being accepted into service (due to foot problems). In June 1940, Alice's husband Sam Burgess was killed in battle, and Thomas shamed his son into enlisting. Harry rarely visited Weatherfield during his leave from service, preferring to stay with his sister, but returned briefly for his favourite cousin Sally Todd's wedding.\n\nLiving with his father after the war, Harry returned to the buses, where he was promoted to conductor. One of the new clippies was Nellie Briggs, with whom Harry arranged a double date, with his mate Len Fairclough and her friend Lizzie Harding making up the numbers. Harry and Len quickly realised they were both after Nellie and Harry ended up going for Len when he made a play for Nellie first, only to be knocked to the floor by Len. It was only when Lizzie leaned down to nurse his bloody nose that Harry noticed that she wasn't bad either, and arranged a date!\n\nHarry and Lizzie were married in 1948, and in 1949 their daughter Lucille was born. With Thomas's passing in 1947, the Hewitts stayed on at 7 Coronation Street, now the third generation of their family to inhabit Coronation Street.\n\nThe Hewitts led a peaceful life in the Street until the cold winter of 1959, when Lizzie was hit by an out-of-control bus which had skidded on the ice. Harry latterly comforted the driver, before being informed by Ena Sharples that it was his own wife who had been hit in the crash. Harry tried for some months to look after Lucille on his own but, despite help from his neighbours, he realised he was unable to properly support her alone and so he applied to the council to take her into care. When the day arrived for Lucille to go to the children's home, Harry was almost as distressed as Lucille, feeling the sense of loss from his daughter's departure almost as much as he had with Lizzie.\n\nLucille, unwilling to spend Christmas in the orphanage, walked all the way to Coronation Street in late December 1960, convincing Harry to let her stay at least until after Christmas. Harry arranged for his neighbour Esther Hayes to look after Lucille when he was away at work. For a short while the following year Harry's sister Alice moved into his home to help look after Lucille, but neither party enjoyed the arrangement and shortly afterwards Alice left to take a housekeeping job elsewhere. Harry was not short of female attention though, as local shopkeeper Florrie Lindley and one of his colleagues Eileen Hughes fought over his attentions. Harry was not romantically attracted to either lady.\n\nThe barmaid of the Rovers Return, Concepta Riley, also returned to Weatherfield from her native Ireland in 1960. A flirtation sprang up between Concepta and Harry, with Harry taking Concepta to the Bus Depot Dance. While on a coach trip to Blackpool Harry proposed to Concepta, who accepted. Despite her family's initial reservations due to Harry being a Protesant, Harry and Concepta were married on 1 October 1961 in a Catholic ceremony, with Concepta's parents' blessing. The couple honeymooned on the Isle of Man.\n\nHarry did not settle down easily into his second marriage. Arguments over furniture and Harry's tendency to spend the evenings drinking with Len Fairclough followed.\n\nConcepta found she was pregnant and Harry found himself father to a son, Christopher. During a party to celebrate the first wedding anniversary of Harry and Concepta, Christopher went missing while in Lucille's care. His disappearance sparked a police search, and the empty pram was discovered on waste ground. After being questioned by the police, Lucille admitted to Harry that she'd left Christopher with a girl from her class, Brenda Cowan, while she was in Gamma Garments. Elsie Tanner eventually found Christopher alive and well with Joan Akers, whose own baby had died, and convinced her to return the baby to the Hewitts herself. Throughout the crisis, Harry remained a tower of strength and supported Concepta and Lucille.\n\nIn 1963, when Harry became ill with a chesty cough, Concepta began considering a move to the Irish countryside, making a living by buying her father's garage-cum-grocers. Harry was immediately won over and handed in his resignation at work, but when faced with Lucille's refusal to move, he changed his mind. Concepta threatened to move on her own, but after a row with Harry and Lucille, she backed down and resigned herself to a life in Weatherfield. After a month on the dole, Harry got a new job as a chauffeur for Amalgamated Steel.\n\nThe following August, Concepta's father's failing health forced him into retirement, and Concepta once again pushed Harry to move to Ireland to take over the business. History repeated itself as Harry was caught between two women, with Concepta and Lucille equally stubborn in their opposing positions. However, Harry realised that Concepta wasn't going to let the matter drop a second time, and made preparations to emigrate. Annie Walker, Concepta's former employer at the Rovers, offered to take Lucille in as the Walkers' ward so that she could finish her schooling in Weatherfield, an offer graciously accepted by the Hewitts. Although Harry was unsure about leaving Lucille behind, Lucille's acceptance of her new situation did much to allay his fears.\n\nHarry returned to Weatherfield the following year to escort Lucille to her new family home only to find that his daughter, now a young, independent woman, had a job and no intentions of leaving Lancashire. Harry decided to respect her wishes and for the time being she remained with the Walkers.\n\nThe Hewitts returned to Weatherfield one last time in September 1967, to attend the wedding of Elsie Tanner to Steve Tanner. After the wedding, Harry and Len went to visit an old mate in Len's van. En route, the van broke down, and Harry tried to repair it himself, jacking up the van with bricks. While underneath, the bricks slipped and Harry was crushed. He died in hospital.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Esther Hayes==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n|years= 1960\u20131963, 1971\u20131972\n|name=Esther Hayes\n|born=10 May 1924\n|father = Sidney Hayes\n|mother = Alice Hayes\n|brothers = [[List of Coronation Street characters (1961)#Tom Hayes|Tom Hayes]]<br>Fred Hayes\n|sisters = Ada Harvey\n|portrayer=[[Daphne Oxenford]]\n|first=14 December 1960<br>Episode 2\n|last=5 April 1972<br>Episode 1171\n| creator     = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#H|Former; regular]]\n}}\n\n'''Esther Hayes''' is played by [[Daphne Oxenford]].

Jack was born on 26 April 1900 in [[Accrington]], [[Lancashire]]. He was born to parents Joan and Amos, who was a veterinarian. Jack married the love of his life [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Beaumont]] in 1937, and shortly afterward the couple bought the [[Rovers Return Inn]]. They ran it together and Annie gave birth to a son, Billy, in 1938 and later a daughter Joan, the apple of Jack's eye. Jack soon had to go and fight for his country in the Second World War and Annie was left to run the pub until Jack returned. Jack was a long-suffering husband as Annie was a snob and saw herself as a more educated person than the rest of the people on Coronation Street, Jack had to put up with Annie's antics and enjoyed watching his daughter Joan marry in 1961.\n\nJack and Annie were also offered the Royal Oak by the brewery but they decided that their heart belonged in the Rovers Return. In 1964, Annie left Jack after she suspected him of cheating on her. Jack remained calm as he knew that her accusations were untrue and he had not been having an affair. Annie soon realized this and returned to the Rovers. Three years later, Annie again suspected that Jack was having an affair, this time with [[Elsie Tanner]] in 1967, but Annie had incorrectly interpreted the situation as Jack wanted Elsie to make some clothing for Annie. Jack also helped his good friend [[Ena Sharples]] recover from the death of her daughter in 1967.\n\nIn 1969, the residents of Coronation Street arranged a trip but the coach crashed and Jack was left in a bad way, which left Annie in tears but Jack recovered in time to serve behind the bar again. Jack and Annie had run the Rovers for 33 years when Jack fell ill and went to stay with his daughter Joan in Derby. Jack died of a [[heart attack]] while at Joan's house. His death was the result of actor Arthur Leslie dying from the same cause. He was the first main character on Coronation Street to be written out due to the death of the actor who played them, so it was a huge shock at the time. Out of respect for Leslie's family, Jack's funeral took place off-screen, and his death (unlike those of future characters who were written out for the same reason) was presented as a known fact to the main characters from the beginning of Episode 987 (broadcast 8 July 1970), and did not dominate the storyline. Jack left a devastated street of residents and a heartbroken wife, but as he would have wanted, the Rovers remained open and Annie continued to be landlady for another 13 years.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Martha Longhurst==\n{{Main|Martha Longhurst}}\n\nMartha (Lynne Carol) was one of the three gossips of the Snug Bar, along with the aggressive [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]) and the self-effacing Minnie Caldwell ([[Margot Bryant]]).

Minnie was known to be very indecisive, which often led Ena to label her as slow-witted or \"daft\".\n\nFrom 1960-62, Minnie lived with her bossy mother, Amy Carlton (1868-1962). When Amy died aged 94, Minnie moved from 15 Jubilee Terrace to No. 5 Coronation Street, where she lived with her cat, Bobby. Bobby, an orange tabby, was played by many cats over the years, and a storyline was created to explain the obvious differences in appearance: Bobby went missing in 1968, and so Minnie adopted a new cat which she named Bobby.\n\nMinnie considered marrying Albert Tatlock in 1974 but realised that she would be financially burdened by Albert, as Ena told her erroneously that she would receive just \u00a31,250 for a married couple while she already received \u00a3775 in pensions as a single occupant. She also found that Albert annoyed her considerably. It was the usually indecisive Minnie who called off their engagement, ending what became one of the Street's best-remembered early storylines.\n\nAn old flame, Handel Gartside (Harry Markham), came back to woo her in 1970 after he had made a bit of money in an overseas business venture in [[Quebec]]. She flirted with him for a while but he was eventually driven off by crooked business with Billy Walker (son of [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]). In 1970, Minnie's old lodger, [[Joe Donnelli]], came back to the Street and held her at gunpoint, as he became nervous about being prosecuted for the murder of [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street character)|Steve Tanner]]. [[Stan Ogden]] came to Minnie's house, ready to fight with Joe as he had had a dalliance with his daughter [[Irma Ogden|Irma]]. Joe made Stan sing Christmas carols at gunpoint, and eventually Joe shot and killed himself.\n\nIn 1976, Minnie went to stay with Handel Gartside, and later accepted his offer to live with him in [[Whaley Bridge]]. She left her friend Ena and was never seen on-screen again. Minnie died in 1988 and was buried in her hometown of Weatherfield beside her husband Armistead.\n\nIn 2008, former lodger [[Jed Stone]] reappeared after an absence of over 42 years, clutching a cat, as Minnie often had, and with a framed photo of her in his home. He and [[Emily Bishop]] reminisced about her briefly, where Jed mentioned that he had regretted getting arrested on Minnie's birthday in 1966. Jed also had a box containing photos of him and Minnie.

The character was created by series creator [[Tony Warren]] as part of the original cast, and she appears in the first episode along with family members including her mother, aging 'good-time girl' [[Elsie Tanner]] and her 'lovable rogue' brother [[Dennis Tanner|Dennis]]. She is later joined by her Polish husband [[Ivan Cheveski|Ivan]], and the young couple are central to early storylines as they cope with Linda's pregnancy affecting their marriage. Cunningham was written out after a year due to a strike at the actor's union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] preventing new contracts being signed,<ref name=kershaw>{{cite book|last=Kershaw|first=H.V.|title=The Street Where I Live|year=1981|publisher=Granada Publishing|isbn=0-246-11734-6|pages=51\u201358}}</ref> and the actress chose not to return when the strike ended. This has thus far proved to be Cunningham's last appearance as a member of the regular cast, but she has returned for several short stints since, most recently in 1984.\n\nLinda was the daughter of Arnold and Elsie Tanner. She was born in [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]'s living room at [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]] on 8 January 1940, being delivered by [[Ena Sharples]]. Linda grew up in the Street, presumably attending Bessie Street School.\n\nLike her mother Elsie, Linda was interested in men and eager to marry. At thirteen, she fought off her mother's boyfriend Chuck Nelson when he tried to rape her. She took a job at Elliston's Raincoat Factory and briefly dated [[#David Barlow|David Barlow]] before falling for Roy Newman, an American GI stationed at Burtonwood. The pair became engaged but the whirlwind romance didn't last.\n\nIn 1957, she met Ivan Cheveski, a Polish immigrant, and they married in 1958. Their lives together began happily with a move to Warrington, but Linda quickly grew dissatisfied with the marriage as Ivan wanted to support her and didn't want her go off to work or to begin a family until they were financially secure. When she fell pregnant in late 1960, she fled to Weatherfield and moved back in with Elsie and younger brother Dennis. Ivan tracked her down but she was surprised when he liked the idea of having a baby, so they reconciled.\n\nDeciding to stay in Weatherfield for the time being, the Cheveskis bought 9 Coronation Street and moved in. Linda gave birth to a baby boy on 14 June 1961 after two days in labour. Although Linda settled into motherhood well in Weatherfield, Ivan became interested in a job at his friend's firm in Canada. Linda was less keen on emigrating and ripped up the forms. Eventually she agreed, but didn't tell Elsie - eventually Ena Sharples told her. The Cheveskis left the country as planned a week later.\n\nLinda, Ivan and Paul returned to the UK for Christmas 1962, and Linda admitted to Elsie she wasn't happy in Canada. Although Ivan was offered his old job back, they returned to Montreal. During her brief visit, Linda became suspicious that Elsie was having an affair with Len Fairclough.\n\nLinda and Ivan had a second son, Martin Cheveski, born in 1964.\n\nThe family returned again in 1966, but although Linda wanted to stay in Weatherfield, Ivan had his heart set on Birmingham. Linda had been having an affair with a Canadian called Mike, and didn't know whether or not to return to Ivan.\n\nAs Linda was about to follow her husband to Birmingham, Paul went missing - he later turned up, having been rescued from the canal by a mystery man. The incident brought Ivan back to Weatherfield, and the Cheveskis reconciled again, and moved to Birmingham.\n\nAside from a brief return for Elsie's wedding to Steve Tanner in 1967, Christmas that year and Dennis' wedding the following year, Linda was not seen on the Street again until 1984, when she was entrusted by Elsie to take care of the sale of No.11 after she had left to live in Portugal. By this time, Linda was estranged from Ivan and hoped to stay in Weatherfield, but Elsie was adamant that the house be sold. Linda sold up to [[Bill Webster]] for \u00a311,500 and left the Street again.\n\nFollowing Dennis' death in 2020, Ken Barlow mentions to Dennis' ex-wife [[Rita Tanner]] that Linda is still alive and now lives in [[Toronto]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Frank Barlow==\n{{Main|Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)}}\n\nFrank Barlow ([[Frank Pemberton]]) is a postman, devoted to his family, but uneasy about his son [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]) starting on a university career and acquiring sophisticated ideas. The premature death of his wife [[Ida Barlow|Ida]] ([[Noel Dyson]]) brings the two of them together.\n\n==Ida Barlow==\n{{Main|Ida Barlow}}\n\nIda Barlow ([[Noel Dyson]]) is the wife of [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank Barlow]] (Frank Pemberton) and mother to [[Ken Barlow|Kenneth]] ([[William Roache]] and [[David Barlow (Coronation Street)|David]] ([[Alan Rothwell]]). She is a dedicated home-maker, who dotes on her family. Her friendship with next-door neighbour [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]) sometimes causes friction with Albert\u2019s daughter [[Beattie Pearson]] ([[Gabrielle Daye]]).

The Barlow family at 3 Coronation Street consisted of David, his academic older brother [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]), his mother [[Ida Barlow|Ida]] ([[Noel Dyson]]) and his absent father [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank]] (Frank Pemberton), who was away fighting in World War II until 1945.\n\nIn 1961, David was an apprentice engineer but he wanted to pursue a career in football. He signed for Weatherfield County FC and in his first match he scored the only goal. He was one of the team's best players and in June a second division London team wanted to transfer David and offered \u00a31,000 to sign him. David left Weatherfield to play for the team and didn't return until 1963, except for a brief trip up for Ida's funeral which he watched from afar. By 1963, he was quite well off financially and didn't fit in with the locals.\n\nHe next visited over Christmas 1964 and stayed with Ken and his wife, [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie]] ([[Anne Reid]]). He didn't tell them that he was suspended from playing for accepting a bribe, but by February was cleared. He was off the field again in April after tearing a ligament, and stayed with the Barlows so he could date [[Irma Ogden]] ([[Sandra Gough]]), who he started seeing during his previous visit. By now, Frank had moved away, and Ken was David's only family in the area. David announced he was retiring from football but took a job as player coach for Weatherfield Athletics. He was also contracted to write for a football gossip column in Weatherfield Advertiser.\n\nFun-loving Irma was flattered by David's interest in her and was receptive to his advances. He wanted to move the relationship to the next level and asked her to marry him when the street residents went a trip to the Blue John Mines. Irma accepted.\n\nDavid had big plans for them to move to Cheshire and Irma's parents, [[Stan Ogden|Stan]] ([[Bernard Youens]]) and [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]), were keen for her to have a well-off lifestyle as the Ogdens had always struggled with money. Irma's parents were an old-fashioned couple and Stan hit Irma when he found David in Irma's bedroom. David convinced Irma they should marry quietly and without telling their families, but everybody found out anyway and surprised them by showing up for a reception.\n\nWhile playing at a charity football match, David was injured and rushed to hospital, where he was told by the Doctor that he wouldn't be able to play football again. The newlyweds had to cancel their plans to buy a house as he couldn't continue at the club. His football career over, he considered a factory job but hesitated as it was such a step down. Irma convinced him it might be a better idea to buy the Corner Shop in Coronation Street as owner Lionel Petty was selling. At first he was too proud to accept living in Coronation Street, which caused a brief split between him and Irma. Valerie talked David round, telling him marriage is sometimes difficult and he has to put the effort in.\n\nDavid had trouble getting to know the Ogdens. In 1966, Irma left the shop to work in the PVC factory across the street as shop work bored her, and David was lumbered with free-loading Hilda as shop assistant. David was never happy in the shop as it was typically where the women of the Street went to share gossip. Irma soon returned to work in the shop.\n\nIn 1967, David considered standing for Council elections, but Irma hated the idea and he eventually decided not to go through with it.\n\nIrma told David she wanted to have a baby. She got pregnant the same year, but suffered a [[miscarriage]]. David reminded Irma that they could try again but Irma was devastated and was convinced this meant she couldn't have children. David was fraught about how to make Irma happy, and went to an adoption agency to see if that was an option for them. David still hoped Irma would change her mind but at Christmas the couple fostered Jill Morris for a few days.\n\nIn 1968, David was rapidly growing tired of the shop, and aspired to return to football, still being young enough to have a good career ahead of him. Despite his earlier injury, he played a game, and his leg was fine. He took this as a sign that he might just be able to return to the sport full-time, for a team in Australia, but Irma was dead against it - the prospect of living somewhere where they didn't know anyone appealed to David much more than it did to Irma. However, when David was offered the position he wanted he took it and set about selling the shop. To interest potential buyers, he had an article published in the Gazette but the article made it seem as though David and Irma were emigrating because streets like Coronation Street were beneath them. Maggie Clegg eventually bought the shop.\n\nIn 1970, the Barlows and their son Darren were involved in a car accident. David and Darren were both killed, but Irma survived and returned to Weatherfield shortly after the crash.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Elsie Lappin==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = [[Coronation Street]]\n| name = Elsie Lappin\n| first = 9 December 1960<br/>Episode 1\n| last = 14 December 1960<br/>Episode 2\n| portrayer = [[Maudie Edwards]]\n| creator = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#L|Former; guest]]\n| husband = Tommy Foyle (1930\u201345)<br>Les Lappin (1947\u201352)\n| daughters = Hilda Foyle<br>Shelagh Foyle\n| date of birth = 1906\n| date of death = 1991\n}}\n'''Elsie Castleway''' (also '''Foyle''' and '''Lappin''') was the owner of the Corner Shop on Coronation Street from 1945 to 1960.

An invalid in his later years, Tommy had urged Elsie to remarry so she wouldn't have to run the shop alone after his death, and although she could cope perfectly well at the shop Elsie did get married again, to Les Lappin in 1947. Elsie was a widow again in 1952 when Les died from a heart attack.\n\nHilda and Shelagh remained at the shop until 1957 and in 1960 Elsie decided to retire. Buying a bungalow at Knott End, she sold the shop to Florrie Lindley. After the sale, Elsie remained for a few days to show Florrie the tricks of the trade and warn her about the neighbours.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Florrie Lindley==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n|name =Florrie Lindley\n|portrayer =[[Betty Alberge]]\n|born = 12 June 1922\n|died = Circa 1991\n|years = 1960\u20131965\n|first = 9 December 1960<br>Episode 1\n|last = 2 June 1965<br>Episode 467\n|husband = [[Norman Lindley]]\n|cousins = [[List of Coronation Street characters (1963)|Alan Mather]]\n|creator = [[Tony Warren]]\n|introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#L|Former; regular]]\n}}\n\n'''Florence Lena 'Florrie' Lindley''' is one of the original characters of [[Coronation Street]].\n\nShy, retiring Florrie was a barmaid at the Farrier's Arms on Collier Street before moving from Esmerelda Street to Coronation Street in 1960, buying the Corner Shop from Elsie Lappin and renaming it \"Lindley's Provisions\". She was worried about moving to a place where she didn't know anyone, and told the neighbours that she was a widow when in fact she was separated from Norman Lindley who had left for engineering work in India.\n\nHer first few days in the shop were marred when she was caught by the police selling firelighters after closing time. She was fined \u00a31 in court, but she was mainly worried about the local newspaper carrying the story and sullying her reputation.\n\nFlorrie settled in well, making a few friends such as Elsie Tanner and Albert Tatlock, and she hoped romance would be on the horizon with widower Harry Hewitt, but he was largely oblivious to her interest and ended up marrying barmaid Concepta Riley shortly after her arrival. She had no close friends in the street and usually went to bingo when she was lonely.\n\nSometimes Florrie had trouble paying her suppliers, so to generate a regular source of income, Florrie rented out the flat above the shop, while she lived in the accommodation behind the shop. The first tenants were Phil Braithwaite and Norman Dobson, and they were followed by Sheila Birtles and Doreen Lostock.\n\nIn 1962, Florrie and Elsie went on a few blind dates together. Elsie was more experienced at dating than Florrie, and still acted youthful, when actually both were the same age. Florrie ended up seeing Frank Barlow when they were both stood up, but they kept their meetings secret at first as Frank was also recently widowed. His intentions were never more than honourable and it soon dawned on Florrie that Frank wanted them to be just close friends. Florrie poured her heart out to him but he still wouldn't open up to her and he later admitted that he wasn't interested in her romantically. To save face, Florrie said she felt the same. They remained friends.\n\nAfter one trip to the bingo with Emily Nugent in 1963, Florrie won \u00a3100 but was mugged. She was relieved when Jerry Booth got her handbag back.\n\nIn 1964, Florrie decided to make some changes to the shop, and opened a sub post office, and moving the door to stop the draughts. She took on Dennis Tanner as assistant, but he wasn't up to the job and was replaced by Irma Ogden. However, she was trying to distract herself from the loneliness she felt and occasionally she lashed out at Irma. One particularly bad day saw Florrie have a breakdown in the shop and throw a tin through the shop window, and collapse in a sobbing heap.\n\nShortly afterwards things picked up as Florrie returned to the shop against her Doctor's orders and she started seeing Irishman Tickler Murphy. Tickler was interested in the shop, and kept up the relationship until Florrie started talking about marriage, too soon apparently as he was afraid of commitment and fled back to Ireland.\n\nIn 1965, Florrie's estranged husband Norman Lindley tracked her down and appeared at the shop, seeking a reconciliation. The neighbours were stunned that Florrie wasn't a widow as she had always claimed. Florrie wasn't sure how to react to him, as he said if she didn't go to Canada with him they might as well get a divorce.\n\nNorman's head was turned by Elsie Tanner, and they went out while Norman laboured under the impression that Florrie was going to turn him down. Florrie deliberated over it but eventually went to Canada with Norman after all.\n\n==Ena Sharples==\n{{Main|Ena Sharples}}\n\nEna ([[Violet Carson]]) is the widowed caretaker of the Mission Hall, and also the local gossip, casting judgment on what she sees as the immoral behaviour of her neighbours in the street, notably [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]), with whom she feuds regularly.

She appears in the very first episode of ''Coronation Street'' and makes her last appearance in early 1961.\n\nSusan Cunningham was a contemporary of Ken Barlow at Manchester University who unwittingly caused trouble at home for Ken. Ken arranged to meet her for drinks at the Imperial Hotel, where his mother was employed as a kitchen hand. Frank Barlow objected to Ken spending money in the same place his mum worked hard to earn it and forbade Ken from meeting Susan. When Ken didn't show, Susan drove to Coronation Street to see if he was alright. Ken's university education had turned him into \"a proper stuck-up little snob\", as Albert Tatlock put it - \"snooty\" was the simple way in which Ken's father, Frank, defined Ken's change in attitude. Thus, Ken gradually became embarrassed about his surroundings; his contemporaries lived in more affluent areas and he was put out when Susan arrived at No.3, the family home. Susan realised this but soon put his mind at rest: she liked Ken for himself and was not bothered by his home. Ken and Susan split up in 1961, shortly after they took part in a \"Ban the Bomb\" protest, as they felt that their backgrounds were too different.\n\nSome time later, Susan discovered that she was pregnant and wrote to him, asking if he wanted to try again with their relationship, but the letter was misplaced and Ken did not read it or become aware of its existence. Her son, [[Lawrence Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Lawrence Cunningham]] ([[Linus Roache]]), was born later that year. Lawrence went on to become an English lecturer and had two children of his own, [[James Cunningham (Coronation Street)|James Cunningham]] ([[James Roache]]) and Chloe, with Ken none the wiser until August 2010 when Susan's letter was found behind a skirting board at No.3. By this time, Susan had been dead for several years but the discovery of the letter prompted Ken to contact Lawrence and on meeting him, it became obvious to Ken that Lawrence was his son. Ken began to bond with his son but after discovering that Lawrence was homophobic and disapproved of his son, James, being homosexual, Ken cut all contact with him, angry that he would disown his own son for being different.\n\n==Ivan Cheveski==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n| name = Ivan Cheveski\n| portrayer = Ernst Walder\n| first = 14 December 1960<br>Episode 2\n| last = 27 December 1967<br>Episode 734\n| years = 1960\u20131963, 1966\u20131967\n| books = Coronation Street: The Complete Saga\n| father = Kazimierz Cheveski\n| mother = Biasia Cheveski\n| sons = [[Paul Cheveski]]<br>[[List of Coronation Street characters (1980)#Martin Cheveski|Martin Cheveski]]\n| wife = [[Linda Cheveski|Linda Tanner]] (until 1984)\n| uncles = Rizard Cheveski\n| date of birth = 1936\n| creator     = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#C|Former; recurring]]\n}}\n'''Ivan Cheveski''' played by actor Ernst Walder until 1967. He is a Coronation Street resident in the early 1960s, and the husband of Elsie Tanner's daughter Linda. He and Linda originally move to Warrington but buy a house in Coronation Street when Linda wants to be closer to her family. Ivan, Linda and their newborn son Paul move to Canada in 1961, making the occasional visit to Weatherfield on their return to the UK in 1966.\n\nBorn in Poland, Ivan and his family left their home during the war as Ivan's grandparents' shop was burned down by the Nazis when they were found to be harbouring a Jewish doctor. After the war, Ivan emigrated to the UK, and found a home in Warrington with his uncle Rizhard.\n\nOn 1 April 1958, Ivan married eighteen-year-old Linda Tanner and the pair settled in Warrington. Hard-working Ivan saw it as his duty to provide for his wife and preferred that Linda didn't work. Linda fled to her home town Weatherfield to stay with her mum Elsie Tanner, telling her she wasn't returning to Ivan, but when he followed her to get her back, she admitted she was pregnant. Ivan was thrilled and agreed to stay in Coronation Street - the couple moved into 9 Coronation Street, and Ivan bought it.\n\nWhile Linda and Elsie prepared the house for the baby, Ivan concentrated on money. He worked in Warrington, and kept up the job while living in Weatherfield. For extra money, he took an evening job as potman at the Rovers Return Inn. Linda convinced Ivan to take a day job in Weatherfield, at an ironworks.\n\nIn June 1961, Linda gave birth to a baby boy - Ivan wanted to name him Rizhard after his uncle, but they settled on Paul.\n\nThe new parents were worried when Paul developed a lingering chesty cough, and it made them realise how unhealthy living in the inner city was. When Ivan received a letter from one of his workmates in Canada, he became taken with the standard of living his friend had and when offered a job that would see him earn just as much as his friend, Ivan convinced Linda that they should emigrate. Linda agreed, for better or worse, and the family moved.\n\nThe Cheveskis made several return visits to Weatherfield, including once for Christmas in 1962 and again in 1966 when Ivan had set his mind on moving to Birmingham. The marriage was in crisis as Linda had had an affair with a Canadian and returned to Weatherfield. Ivan got a job in Birmingham and waited for Linda to come to her senses. It took an accident in which Paul fell into a canal to bring Ivan up to Weatherfield, and the Cheveskis got back together after all. Ivan was furious when he found out that councillor Len Fairclough had voted against the erection of a fence by the canal, and hit him when drunk, blaming him for what could easily have killed his son.\n\nIvan and Linda had a second son, Martin, in 1964 and stayed in Birmingham, next visiting for Elsie's wedding to Steve Tanner in 1967.\n\nIn 1984, Ivan and Linda split up, apparently for good.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Harry Hewitt==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n| name = Harry Hewitt\n| portrayer = Ivan Beavis\n| first = 14 December 1960<br>Episode 2\n| last = 6 September 1967<br>Episode 702\n| years = 1960\u20131965, 1967\n| birth = 24 February 1925\n| death = 6 September 1967\n| books = Coronation Street: The Complete Saga\n| father = Thomas Hewitt\n| mother = Mary Hewitt\n| sisters = [[Alice Burgess]]<br>Frances Hewitt\n| sons = [[Christopher Hewitt]]\n| daughters = [[Lucille Hewitt]]\n| wife = Lizzie Harding (1948\u201359)<br>[[Concepta Riley]] (1961\u201367)\n| grandfathers = Samuel Hewitt<br>Alfred Makepiece\n| grandmothers = Dolly Hewitt<br>Ivy Makepiece\n| creator     = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#H|Former; regular]]\n}}\n'''Harry Hewitt''' is played by actor Ivan Beavis.\n\nHarry Hewitt was the second of Thomas and Mary Hewitt's children, born on 24 February 1921. Like his older sister Alice, he was educated at Hardcastle's Factory School, which later became Bessie Street School, before going out to work at fifteen and landing a job as a clippie on the newly established Weatherfield Bus Service.\n\nHarry and Alice both suffered from Mary's mental problems. During the Depression, Thomas had been so desperate for work that he joined a raid on Elliston's Raincoat Factory, only to be caught by the police and imprisoned. By the time he returned home, Mary had changed into resentful and angry woman, but her problems went ignored until the night Harry returned home from a pub crawl after receiving his first wage from the buses. As he stumbled into the house blind drunk, Mary came charging down the stairs in her nightgown, a carving knife in her hand, and started slashing at her son in a psychotic episode. While the neighbours held her down, the doctor was called and Mary was carted off in a van. She spent the rest of her life in a mental asylum, passing away in 1936. Harry, who had sustained cuts to his arms in the attack, didn't attend the funeral.\n\nThomas Hewitt was not particularly close to either of his children, and after war broke out, was ashamed of Harry not being accepted into service (due to foot problems). In June 1940, Alice's husband Sam Burgess was killed in battle, and Thomas shamed his son into enlisting. Harry rarely visited Weatherfield during his leave from service, preferring to stay with his sister, but returned briefly for his favourite cousin Sally Todd's wedding.\n\nLiving with his father after the war, Harry returned to the buses, where he was promoted to conductor. One of the new clippies was Nellie Briggs, with whom Harry arranged a double date, with his mate Len Fairclough and her friend Lizzie Harding making up the numbers. Harry and Len quickly realised they were both after Nellie and Harry ended up going for Len when he made a play for Nellie first, only to be knocked to the floor by Len. It was only when Lizzie leaned down to nurse his bloody nose that Harry noticed that she wasn't bad either, and arranged a date!\n\nHarry and Lizzie were married in 1948, and in 1949 their daughter Lucille was born. With Thomas's passing in 1947, the Hewitts stayed on at 7 Coronation Street, now the third generation of their family to inhabit Coronation Street.\n\nThe Hewitts led a peaceful life in the Street until the cold winter of 1959, when Lizzie was hit by an out-of-control bus which had skidded on the ice. Harry latterly comforted the driver, before being informed by Ena Sharples that it was his own wife who had been hit in the crash. Harry tried for some months to look after Lucille on his own but, despite help from his neighbours, he realised he was unable to properly support her alone and so he applied to the council to take her into care. When the day arrived for Lucille to go to the children's home, Harry was almost as distressed as Lucille, feeling the sense of loss from his daughter's departure almost as much as he had with Lizzie.\n\nLucille, unwilling to spend Christmas in the orphanage, walked all the way to Coronation Street in late December 1960, convincing Harry to let her stay at least until after Christmas. Harry arranged for his neighbour Esther Hayes to look after Lucille when he was away at work. For a short while the following year Harry's sister Alice moved into his home to help look after Lucille, but neither party enjoyed the arrangement and shortly afterwards Alice left to take a housekeeping job elsewhere. Harry was not short of female attention though, as local shopkeeper Florrie Lindley and one of his colleagues Eileen Hughes fought over his attentions. Harry was not romantically attracted to either lady.\n\nThe barmaid of the Rovers Return, Concepta Riley, also returned to Weatherfield from her native Ireland in 1960. A flirtation sprang up between Concepta and Harry, with Harry taking Concepta to the Bus Depot Dance. While on a coach trip to Blackpool Harry proposed to Concepta, who accepted. Despite her family's initial reservations due to Harry being a Protesant, Harry and Concepta were married on 1 October 1961 in a Catholic ceremony, with Concepta's parents' blessing. The couple honeymooned on the Isle of Man.\n\nHarry did not settle down easily into his second marriage. Arguments over furniture and Harry's tendency to spend the evenings drinking with Len Fairclough followed.\n\nConcepta found she was pregnant and Harry found himself father to a son, Christopher. During a party to celebrate the first wedding anniversary of Harry and Concepta, Christopher went missing while in Lucille's care. His disappearance sparked a police search, and the empty pram was discovered on waste ground. After being questioned by the police, Lucille admitted to Harry that she'd left Christopher with a girl from her class, Brenda Cowan, while she was in Gamma Garments. Elsie Tanner eventually found Christopher alive and well with Joan Akers, whose own baby had died, and convinced her to return the baby to the Hewitts herself. Throughout the crisis, Harry remained a tower of strength and supported Concepta and Lucille.\n\nIn 1963, when Harry became ill with a chesty cough, Concepta began considering a move to the Irish countryside, making a living by buying her father's garage-cum-grocers. Harry was immediately won over and handed in his resignation at work, but when faced with Lucille's refusal to move, he changed his mind. Concepta threatened to move on her own, but after a row with Harry and Lucille, she backed down and resigned herself to a life in Weatherfield. After a month on the dole, Harry got a new job as a chauffeur for Amalgamated Steel.\n\nThe following August, Concepta's father's failing health forced him into retirement, and Concepta once again pushed Harry to move to Ireland to take over the business. History repeated itself as Harry was caught between two women, with Concepta and Lucille equally stubborn in their opposing positions. However, Harry realised that Concepta wasn't going to let the matter drop a second time, and made preparations to emigrate. Annie Walker, Concepta's former employer at the Rovers, offered to take Lucille in as the Walkers' ward so that she could finish her schooling in Weatherfield, an offer graciously accepted by the Hewitts. Although Harry was unsure about leaving Lucille behind, Lucille's acceptance of her new situation did much to allay his fears.\n\nHarry returned to Weatherfield the following year to escort Lucille to her new family home only to find that his daughter, now a young, independent woman, had a job and no intentions of leaving Lancashire. Harry decided to respect her wishes and for the time being she remained with the Walkers.\n\nThe Hewitts returned to Weatherfield one last time in September 1967, to attend the wedding of Elsie Tanner to Steve Tanner. After the wedding, Harry and Len went to visit an old mate in Len's van. En route, the van broke down, and Harry tried to repair it himself, jacking up the van with bricks. While underneath, the bricks slipped and Harry was crushed. He died in hospital.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Esther Hayes==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n|years= 1960\u20131963, 1971\u20131972\n|name=Esther Hayes\n|born=10 May 1924\n|father = Sidney Hayes\n|mother = Alice Hayes\n|brothers = [[List of Coronation Street characters (1961)#Tom Hayes|Tom Hayes]]<br>Fred Hayes\n|sisters = Ada Harvey\n|portrayer=[[Daphne Oxenford]]\n|first=14 December 1960<br>Episode 2\n|last=5 April 1972<br>Episode 1171\n| creator     = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = Tony Warren\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#H|Former; regular]]\n}}\n\n'''Esther Hayes''' is played by [[Daphne Oxenford]].

Jack was born on 26 April 1900 in [[Accrington]], [[Lancashire]]. He was born to parents Joan and Amos, who was a veterinarian. Jack married the love of his life [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Beaumont]] in 1937, and shortly afterward the couple bought the [[Rovers Return Inn]]. They ran it together and Annie gave birth to a son, Billy, in 1938 and later a daughter Joan, the apple of Jack's eye. Jack soon had to go and fight for his country in the Second World War and Annie was left to run the pub until Jack returned. Jack was a long-suffering husband as Annie was a snob and saw herself as a more educated person than the rest of the people on Coronation Street, Jack had to put up with Annie's antics and enjoyed watching his daughter Joan marry in 1961.\n\nJack and Annie were also offered the Royal Oak by the brewery but they decided that their heart belonged in the Rovers Return. In 1964, Annie left Jack after she suspected him of cheating on her. Jack remained calm as he knew that her accusations were untrue and he had not been having an affair. Annie soon realized this and returned to the Rovers. Three years later, Annie again suspected that Jack was having an affair, this time with [[Elsie Tanner]] in 1967, but Annie had incorrectly interpreted the situation as Jack wanted Elsie to make some clothing for Annie. Jack also helped his good friend [[Ena Sharples]] recover from the death of her daughter in 1967.\n\nIn 1969, the residents of Coronation Street arranged a trip but the coach crashed and Jack was left in a bad way, which left Annie in tears but Jack recovered in time to serve behind the bar again. Jack and Annie had run the Rovers for 33 years when Jack fell ill and went to stay with his daughter Joan in Derby. Jack died of a [[heart attack]] while at Joan's house. His death was the result of actor Arthur Leslie dying from the same cause. He was the first main character on Coronation Street to be written out due to the death of the actor who played them, so it was a huge shock at the time. Out of respect for Leslie's family, Jack's funeral took place off-screen, and his death (unlike those of future characters who were written out for the same reason) was presented as a known fact to the main characters from the beginning of Episode 987 (broadcast 8 July 1970), and did not dominate the storyline. Jack left a devastated street of residents and a heartbroken wife, but as he would have wanted, the Rovers remained open and Annie continued to be landlady for another 13 years.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Martha Longhurst==\n{{Main|Martha Longhurst}}\n\nMartha (Lynne Carol) was one of the three gossips of the Snug Bar, along with the aggressive [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]) and the self-effacing Minnie Caldwell ([[Margot Bryant]]).

Minnie was known to be very indecisive, which often led Ena to label her as slow-witted or \"daft\".\n\nFrom 1960-62, Minnie lived with her bossy mother, Amy Carlton (1868-1962). When Amy died aged 94, Minnie moved from 15 Jubilee Terrace to No. 5 Coronation Street, where she lived with her cat, Bobby. Bobby, an orange tabby, was played by many cats over the years, and a storyline was created to explain the obvious differences in appearance: Bobby went missing in 1968, and so Minnie adopted a new cat which she named Bobby.\n\nMinnie considered marrying Albert Tatlock in 1974 but realised that she would be financially burdened by Albert, as Ena told her erroneously that she would receive just \u00a31,250 for a married couple while she already received \u00a3775 in pensions as a single occupant. She also found that Albert annoyed her considerably. It was the usually indecisive Minnie who called off their engagement, ending what became one of the Street's best-remembered early storylines.\n\nAn old flame, Handel Gartside (Harry Markham), came back to woo her in 1970 after he had made a bit of money in an overseas business venture in [[Quebec]]. She flirted with him for a while but he was eventually driven off by crooked business with Billy Walker (son of [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]). In 1970, Minnie's old lodger, [[Joe Donnelli]], came back to the Street and held her at gunpoint, as he became nervous about being prosecuted for the murder of [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street character)|Steve Tanner]]. [[Stan Ogden]] came to Minnie's house, ready to fight with Joe as he had had a dalliance with his daughter [[Irma Ogden|Irma]]. Joe made Stan sing Christmas carols at gunpoint, and eventually Joe shot and killed himself.\n\nIn 1976, Minnie went to stay with Handel Gartside, and later accepted his offer to live with him in [[Whaley Bridge]].

He and [[Emily Bishop]] reminisced about her briefly, where Jed mentioned that he had regretted getting arrested on Minnie's birthday in 1966. Jed also had a box containing photos of him and Minnie.

Thus they created a female sidekick for the Joker; she would become his love interest. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; They used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz| title = Quinn-tessentials.

It was the second \"animated style\" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being \"Holiday Knights.\"\n\nHarleen Quinzel becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a severely injured Joker to Arkham, she dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts, and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he genuinely loves her.\n\n===Expanded role===\nAfter ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[Flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the [[DC animated universe]], appearing alongside the Joker in the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']] episode \"Wild Cards\" and alongside [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode \"Hard as Nails.\"\n\nHarley Quinn appears in [[The Batman/Superman Movie|''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'']] (a compilation movie consisting of three-part ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"World's Finest\") as a rival and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.\n\nThe animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture [[Tim Drake]] until he has become \"Joker Jr.,\" an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with [[Batgirl]]. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them \u2014 to which they answer: \"Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!\" Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future [[Batcave]].\n\n==Characterization==\n===Harleen Quinzel===\nDr. Harleen Frances Quinzel is depicted as having been a [[psychiatrist]]<ref name=Eury>Michael Eury (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id= ''Back Issue'' #99], TwoMorrows Publishing, 2017, p. 69, \"Before she was Harley Quinn, she was the Joker's psychiatrist. ...

Art by Otto Schmidt.]]\nHarley Quinn was first introduced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' appearing in the style of a [[jester]]. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece black-and-red [[motley]] outfit with a cowl.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears glasses, a skirt, high-heeled shoes, and a white lab coat.<ref name=\"auto3\">''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #1. DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black-and-red costume from the animated series. In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black-and-red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\">''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics</ref>\n\nFollowing 2016's ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad''. Her hair color is now blonde with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, a ripped tee-shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, [[fishnet]] stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like [[Margot Robbie]]'s depiction of the character in the 2016 [[Suicide Squad (film)|''Suicide Squad'']] film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. She has also been known to wear both red-and-black colored nail polishes on both her fingernails and toenails in an alternating fashion.\n\nHarley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the [[DC Extended Universe]], both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.\n\n==Transition to comic books and publication history==\nAfter the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] comic book [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=Batman: Harley Quinn Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2005/05/25/batman-harley-quinn-review|website=IGN|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 May 2005}}</ref> She first appeared in the Batman adventures comic then original graphic novel ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Batman: Thrillkiller]]'' and ''Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.\n\nA ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Alan|last=Cowsill|editor-first=Hannah|editor-last=Dolan|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|chapter= 2000s|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London, England|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself into Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski, whose suicide foreshadowed her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series [[Batman: Hush|''Hush'']]. She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).\n\nIn the \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823 (November 2006).\n\nHarley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the \"punch line\" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.\n\nHarley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole.\n\n[[Birds of Prey (comics)|''Birds of Prey'']] #105 (June 2007) reveals Harley Quinn as the 6th member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, \"Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?\" thus leaving the team.\n\nIn [[Countdown (DC Comics)|''Countdown'']] #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by \"Athena\" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveals Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].\n\n===''Gotham City Sirens''===\nHarley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley) and [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tries to take down Selina Kyle named the Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker was not the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.\n\n[[File:Harleen Quinzel.jpg|thumb|200px|Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Art by [[Clay Mann]] and Seth Mann.]]\nIn ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff.\" The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nFollowing a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20\u201323. DC Comics</ref>\n\nHarley and the Joker are eventually defeated by the Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011). DC Comics</ref> Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011). DC Comics</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011).

Harley appears in the debut issue as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., with continued appearances throughout the series.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===The New 52/Harley Quinn Rebirth===\nFollowing DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]] of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance were fully revamped. ''The New 52'' shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black, and her bleached white skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAfter a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by the [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide Squad]] by [[Amanda Waller]]. However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already-addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics</ref> Her plan pays off, and she manages to recover the face; though, in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a \"conversation\" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> After the Joker returns to Gotham in the \"[[Death of the Family]]\" storyline, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick the Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. The Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where the Joker is.

In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team, and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.\n\nUnder Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an [[antihero]] who, after being released from the Suicide Squad and having her public files erased, values human life more or less and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood, with mixed results. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]. ''Harley Quinn'' series writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Amanda Conner]] confirmed that the two characters are in a non-monogamous romantic relationship.<ref>{{cite web|first=Evan|last=Narcisse|url=http://kotaku.com/dc-comics-harley-quinn-poison-ivy-are-girlfriends-w-1711038615|title=DC Comics: Harley Quinn & Poison Ivy Are Girlfriends \"Without Monogamy\"|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communication]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref> Between issues #11\u201313, Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac [[Power Girl]] and battled the [[Clock King]] and the [[Sportsmaster]] before Power Girl's memory was restored, and she left Harley at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] as punishment for her deceit.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #11\u201313 (October\u2013December 2014).

Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.<ref>''Harley Quinn## #16-19(June\u2013August 2015)''</ref>\n\n''Harley Quinn'' has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the [[scratch and sniff]]-themed ''Annual'' issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her girlfriend Poison Ivy, as the [[Arkham Asylum]] employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen.<ref>''Harley Quinn Annual'' #1 (October 2014).

She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses the Batman and tells him to get \"lessons\" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which the Batman privately grins.<ref>''Harley Quinn Valentines Day Special'' #1 (Feb 2015).

The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm, and Harley is washed up onto the shores of an island inhabited by an uncontacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].\n\nAfter a fight and reconciliation, Harley learns that the Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and the Joker are to be married. She is initially excited about the pending marriage, until she discovers that the two will be sacrificed to the island's volcano as their wedding ceremony ends.<ref>\"Future's End: Harley Quinn\" (2014).

Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals. She also runs a \"vigilante for hire\" group; she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers, including Red Tool (a parody of Deadpool), Harley Sinn (a former nemesis) and various other allies she has made along the way. The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge, and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return, a Man-Bat was seen around town, and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason, Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langstrom if he was behind it but found him gibbering in his cell. He did, however, mention that there was \"another.\" Meanwhile, Harley went hunting for the Man-Bat and took it down, only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later, they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife Francine was the newest Man-Bat, and she then jabbed Harley with the Man-Bat potion.\n\nAfter that mess, a few of her old criminal buddies, including the Penguin, the Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure, and soon, Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl, Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later, the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand, and they easily beat him up too. This was followed up by a one-shot issue in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up, and retakes control. This leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge, and he heads out with Red Tool to go home. Back in the current time period, she recently went on a one-woman rampage on Apokolips before coming back to Earth with a new friend she rescued from Granny Goodness named Tina to deal with a realtor and a cult run by a skeleton-headed goof calling himself \"Lord Death Man\" whom she heard about on a literal pirate broadcast. It turns out that he set it up himself because he is in love with her and thought it was fun walking into her traps, being apparently unkillable. Harley used the money he paid her to save her building and surrounding businesses from a land developer, whom she then catapulted away. When last seen, Harley was reading one of her own comics and a woman calling herself Jonni DC, Continuity Cop was threatening to stop her, and the preview predicted Harley would destroy the DC Universe. After her mother was temporarily retconned and a series of pointless adventures through multiple continuities, everything was restored to normal, with the exception of an alternate past superhero with no concept of a \"gray area\" being pulled into Harley's world.\n\n====Controversy====\nIn September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, \"Break into comics with Harley Quinn!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>, in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|author=Callie Beusman|work=Jezebel|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Harley's Little Black Book''===\nHarley also teamed up with a lot of major DC characters in ''Harley's Little Black Book'', including Zatanna, Wonder Woman, Superman, Lobo, and a version of herself and some other superheroines in a world in which they were trying to kill [[Hitler]].\n\n===DC Universe===\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' in June 2016. In December 2017, DC opted to rebrand its titles under the \"DC Universe\" name, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rich|title=The End Of DC Rebirth Announced At New York Comic-Con|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/06/end-dc-rebirth-announced-new-york-comic-con|website=bleedingcool|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=October 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bonthuys|first=Darryn|title=The Rebirth era is over, as a new direction begins in DC Universe|url=https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/rebirth-era-new-direction-begins-dc-universe|website=criticalhit|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=December 1, 2017}}</ref> Within the DC Universe, Harley Quinn is featured in a third bi-monthly volume of her eponymous series, starting with ''Harley Quinn'' vol. 3 #1 (October 2016).\n\n====Suicide Squad====\n[[File:Harley Quinn at Belle Reve.png|thumb|Harley Quinn attacks guards at Belle Reve.<ref name=\"auto5\">''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5 #20. DC Comics</ref> Art by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107]].]] Harley Quinn has a recurring role in the comic book title ''[[Suicide Squad]]'', which debuted its fifth volume with ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5 #1 (October 2016). Following the events of ''DC Rebirth'', Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in ''DC Universe''. She wears tight blue-and-red shorts, a ripped white tee shirt, a satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos, and her hair color is blonde hair with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right to match the movie and her new hairstyle in ''52''.\n\nUnlike her counterpart in the ''New 52'' series (who may be a sequel to this series after Harley finishes her time on the Squad, even going so far as to erase her public criminal record despite the fact that both versions got the dip-dyed hairstyle at the same time), she is still fairly dark and resists any attempts at labeling her a hero, no matter how many lives she saves or how many times she steps up to take command of the situation. She tends to swap her carefree joking attitude for the occasional sulk. So far, the events of the Squad do little to affect the DC Universe outside of their immediate mission. She is still officially done with the Joker in a romantic capacity and still Poison Ivy's on-again, off-again girlfriend.\n\nThe ongoing fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at Belle Reve Penitentiary, attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Killer Croc]].\n\n====Harley Quinn DC Black Label====\n\nHarley Quinn is a major character in DC's first [[DC Black Label|''Black Label'']] comic series, an adult-focused imprint, in Sean Murphy's 8-part standalone story ''Batman: White Knight'' (more information provided in other versions section).\n\n''Harleen'', a limited series created by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107|Stjepan Sejic]], due to debut on September 25, will provide new insight into the character's origin story and will be her first solo comic series within the new imprint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2019/06/14/dc-black-label-reimagines-harley-quinn%E2%80%99s-origin-in-harleen-from-writer-and-artist|title=DC BLACK LABEL REIMAGINES HARLEY QUINN'S ORIGIN IN HARLEEN FROM WRITER AND ARTIST STJEPAN \u0160EJI\u0106|date=2019-06-14|website=DC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to her own origin story, Harley Quinn will also feature in Kami Garcia, Mike Mayhew, and Mico Suayan's ''Joker/Harley: Criminal Sanity.''

This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''.

She at one point acts as a stripper (though this may be a ruse) and is never shown speaking.<ref>''Joker'' (2008).

He chased her to the ledge of the building around Crime Alley. Batman drops her off the roof, but is luckily saved by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman '66]]'', a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 1960s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted glasses, a long red dress and red blouse, large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as '''Dr. Holly Quinn''', PhD, a psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]], referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces the Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.<ref name=\":0\">''Batman '66'' #3.

She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin, wearing a [[roller derby]]-inspired version of the classic Harley costume. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of [[Matches Malone]]) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.<ref>''Batman '66'' #24. DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) he becomes devastated, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with the Joker's death, but develops an attachment to the Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath, but is also grief-stricken when he is killed by Superman. She later confronts the Black Canary, but hesitates upon realizing she is pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to the Black Canary that she has a four-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and the Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Brainiac alongside the Black Canary, the Green Arrow and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending that she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed that her daughter thinks her mother is actually her Aunt Harley, though Harley hopes she may one day be able to tell her the truth. \n* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is made into a mutant hyena by the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. She is knocked out by the Batman in the final battle and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the Arkham inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally, causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.<ref>''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #6. DC Comics/IDW</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', it is revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), and she was replaced by another girl, Marian Drews, without the Joker even realizing it. Once the Joker was cured from his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting \"normal\". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the \"fake Harley\" unconscious and reveals to Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) that there were two Harleys all along. While Harleen loved the Joker \"despite his flaws\", Marian loved the Joker by \"his flaws\". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of the Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself \"until the real Joker returns\".<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref>\n*In ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', Harley fell in with the Joker (in this version, a gangster) after leaving Charm School, but left him when he began his journey into the occult. By the time of the events of the story, Harley is drawn to England by a voice she believes is the Joker, but turns out to be the Joker's Daughter. She rejects the Joker's Daughter's attempt to have the Joker resurrected in the body of Poison Ivy, instead beginning a relationship with Ivy herself.\n* In ''[[Batman: Damned]]'' Harley snaps after the Joker's mysterious death following a battle with Batman and performs surgery on herself and dressing herself to make her resemble the Joker. Harley leads the Joker's remaining henchman on a revenge mission, blowing up several buildings and taking over the GCPD building and defacing the Batsignal so that it resembles the Joker's smile. Batman arrives and defeats the henchman before Harley paralyzes him with a toxin, beats him with her baseball bat, and attempts to sexually abuse him. Batman is then possessed by the Enchantress, and strangles Harley against the Batsignal.<ref>''Batman: Damned'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n====Live-action====\n* Harley Quinn was initially set to appear in ''Batman Unchained'', the fifth film planned for the original Batman film series.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kelly|last=Konda|url=https://weminoredinfilm.com/2015/06/15/the-inside-story-on-5-batman-movies-which-almost-got-made-before-batman-begins/|title=The Inside Story on 5 Batman Movies Which Almost Got Made Before Batman Begins|website=We Majored in Film|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Fleming|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121|title = Schumacher trims sails|magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date = November 11, 1997|accessdate =November 11, 2008}}</ref> She was to be featured as the Joker's ([[Jack Nicholson]]) daughter, who allies herself with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] to get revenge on Batman for her father's death.<ref>{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html|title = Rumblings From Gotham|website = [[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|date = July 27, 2000|accessdate =October 17, 2008}}</ref> Due to the critical and commercial failure of [[Batman & Robin (film)|''Batman & Robin'']], however, this film was cancelled.\n* The ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' version of Harley makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 film ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' in The Distracted Globe nightclub sequence.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Begley |url=https://batman-news.com/2017/12/11/joker-harley-quinn-ready-player-one-trailer/ |title=The Joker and Harley Quinn appear in 'Ready Player One' trailer |publisher=Batman News |date= |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margot Robbie]] as Harley Quinn in a publicity still for ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016)]] -->\n[[Margot Robbie]] portrays Dr. Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref name=AdditionalCast>{{cite news|title='Suicide Squad': First Cast Photo Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/suicide-squad-first-cast-photo-revealed-1201468975/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=July 25, 2015}}</ref>\n* The character debuted in the [[2016 in film|2016 film]] ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.

Thus they created a female sidekick for the Joker; she would become his love interest. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; They used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz| title = Quinn-tessentials.

Written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book is told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It describes Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, Ph.D. as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[Psychiatrist|psychologist]] who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise<ref>{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/618/618636p1.html|title=The Batman Adventures: Mad Love Review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 24, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award|Harvey Awards]] for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner94.php |title=Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners|journal=Comic Book Awards Almanac|publisher=The Hahn Library|date=1994}}</ref> ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as an episode of the same name in 1999. It was the second \"animated style\" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being \"Holiday Knights.\"\n\nHarleen Quinzel becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a severely injured Joker to Arkham, she dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts, and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he genuinely loves her.\n\n===Expanded role===\nAfter ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[Flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the [[DC animated universe]], appearing alongside the Joker in the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']] episode \"Wild Cards\" and alongside [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode \"Hard as Nails.\"\n\nHarley Quinn appears in [[The Batman/Superman Movie|''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'']] (a compilation movie consisting of three-part ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"World's Finest\") as a rival and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.\n\nThe animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture [[Tim Drake]] until he has become \"Joker Jr.,\" an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with [[Batgirl]]. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them \u2014 to which they answer: \"Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!\" Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future [[Batcave]].\n\n==Characterization==\n===Harleen Quinzel===\nDr. Harleen Frances Quinzel is depicted as having been a [[psychiatrist]]<ref name=Eury>Michael Eury (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id= ''Back Issue'' #99], TwoMorrows Publishing, 2017, p. 69, \"Before she was Harley Quinn, she was the Joker's psychiatrist. ...

Art by Otto Schmidt.]]\nHarley Quinn was first introduced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' appearing in the style of a [[jester]]. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece black-and-red [[motley]] outfit with a cowl.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears glasses, a skirt, high-heeled shoes, and a white lab coat.<ref name=\"auto3\">''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #1. DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black-and-red costume from the animated series. In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black-and-red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\">''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics</ref>\n\nFollowing 2016's ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad''. Her hair color is now blonde with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, a ripped tee-shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, [[fishnet]] stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like [[Margot Robbie]]'s depiction of the character in the 2016 [[Suicide Squad (film)|''Suicide Squad'']] film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. She has also been known to wear both red-and-black colored nail polishes on both her fingernails and toenails in an alternating fashion.\n\nHarley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the [[DC Extended Universe]], both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.\n\n==Transition to comic books and publication history==\nAfter the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] comic book [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=Batman: Harley Quinn Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2005/05/25/batman-harley-quinn-review|website=IGN|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 May 2005}}</ref> She first appeared in the Batman adventures comic then original graphic novel ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Batman: Thrillkiller]]'' and ''Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.\n\nA ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Alan|last=Cowsill|editor-first=Hannah|editor-last=Dolan|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|chapter= 2000s|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London, England|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself into Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski, whose suicide foreshadowed her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series [[Batman: Hush|''Hush'']]. She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).\n\nIn the \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823 (November 2006).\n\nHarley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the \"punch line\" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.\n\nHarley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole.\n\n[[Birds of Prey (comics)|''Birds of Prey'']] #105 (June 2007) reveals Harley Quinn as the 6th member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, \"Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?\" thus leaving the team.\n\nIn [[Countdown (DC Comics)|''Countdown'']] #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by \"Athena\" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveals Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].\n\n===''Gotham City Sirens''===\nHarley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley) and [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tries to take down Selina Kyle named the Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker was not the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.\n\n[[File:Harleen Quinzel.jpg|thumb|200px|Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Art by [[Clay Mann]] and Seth Mann.]]\nIn ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff.\" The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nFollowing a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20\u201323.

DC Comics</ref> Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011).

''The New 52'' shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black, and her bleached white skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAfter a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by the [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide Squad]] by [[Amanda Waller]]. However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already-addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics</ref> Her plan pays off, and she manages to recover the face; though, in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a \"conversation\" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> After the Joker returns to Gotham in the \"[[Death of the Family]]\" storyline, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick the Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. The Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where the Joker is. However, she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.<ref>''Batman''#13 (October 2012).

In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team, and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.\n\nUnder Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an [[antihero]] who, after being released from the Suicide Squad and having her public files erased, values human life more or less and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood, with mixed results. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]].

She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals.

The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge, and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return, a Man-Bat was seen around town, and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason, Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langstrom if he was behind it but found him gibbering in his cell. He did, however, mention that there was \"another.\" Meanwhile, Harley went hunting for the Man-Bat and took it down, only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later, they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife Francine was the newest Man-Bat, and she then jabbed Harley with the Man-Bat potion.\n\nAfter that mess, a few of her old criminal buddies, including the Penguin, the Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure, and soon, Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl, Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later, the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand, and they easily beat him up too. This was followed up by a one-shot issue in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up, and retakes control. This leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge, and he heads out with Red Tool to go home. Back in the current time period, she recently went on a one-woman rampage on Apokolips before coming back to Earth with a new friend she rescued from Granny Goodness named Tina to deal with a realtor and a cult run by a skeleton-headed goof calling himself \"Lord Death Man\" whom she heard about on a literal pirate broadcast. It turns out that he set it up himself because he is in love with her and thought it was fun walking into her traps, being apparently unkillable. Harley used the money he paid her to save her building and surrounding businesses from a land developer, whom she then catapulted away. When last seen, Harley was reading one of her own comics and a woman calling herself Jonni DC, Continuity Cop was threatening to stop her, and the preview predicted Harley would destroy the DC Universe. After her mother was temporarily retconned and a series of pointless adventures through multiple continuities, everything was restored to normal, with the exception of an alternate past superhero with no concept of a \"gray area\" being pulled into Harley's world.\n\n====Controversy====\nIn September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, \"Break into comics with Harley Quinn!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>, in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|author=Callie Beusman|work=Jezebel|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Harley's Little Black Book''===\nHarley also teamed up with a lot of major DC characters in ''Harley's Little Black Book'', including Zatanna, Wonder Woman, Superman, Lobo, and a version of herself and some other superheroines in a world in which they were trying to kill [[Hitler]].\n\n===DC Universe===\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' in June 2016.

DC Comics</ref> Art by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107]].]] Harley Quinn has a recurring role in the comic book title ''[[Suicide Squad]]'', which debuted its fifth volume with ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5 #1 (October 2016). Following the events of ''DC Rebirth'', Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in ''DC Universe''. She wears tight blue-and-red shorts, a ripped white tee shirt, a satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos, and her hair color is blonde hair with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right to match the movie and her new hairstyle in ''52''.\n\nUnlike her counterpart in the ''New 52'' series (who may be a sequel to this series after Harley finishes her time on the Squad, even going so far as to erase her public criminal record despite the fact that both versions got the dip-dyed hairstyle at the same time), she is still fairly dark and resists any attempts at labeling her a hero, no matter how many lives she saves or how many times she steps up to take command of the situation. She tends to swap her carefree joking attitude for the occasional sulk. So far, the events of the Squad do little to affect the DC Universe outside of their immediate mission. She is still officially done with the Joker in a romantic capacity and still Poison Ivy's on-again, off-again girlfriend.\n\nThe ongoing fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at Belle Reve Penitentiary, attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Killer Croc]].\n\n====Harley Quinn DC Black Label====\n\nHarley Quinn is a major character in DC's first [[DC Black Label|''Black Label'']] comic series, an adult-focused imprint, in Sean Murphy's 8-part standalone story ''Batman: White Knight'' (more information provided in other versions section).\n\n''Harleen'', a limited series created by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107|Stjepan Sejic]], due to debut on September 25, will provide new insight into the character's origin story and will be her first solo comic series within the new imprint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2019/06/14/dc-black-label-reimagines-harley-quinn%E2%80%99s-origin-in-harleen-from-writer-and-artist|title=DC BLACK LABEL REIMAGINES HARLEY QUINN'S ORIGIN IN HARLEEN FROM WRITER AND ARTIST STJEPAN \u0160EJI\u0106|date=2019-06-14|website=DC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to her own origin story, Harley Quinn will also feature in Kami Garcia, Mike Mayhew, and Mico Suayan's ''Joker/Harley: Criminal Sanity.''

This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''. DC Comics</ref>\n* In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, \"[[alternative lifestyle]] [[folk music|folkies]] Ivy and Harley\".<ref>''Elseworlds 80-Page Giant''. DC Comics</ref>\n* On the new [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's business manager and is killed by the [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]].<ref>''Countdown'' #32. DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley appears in ''[[Batman/The Spirit]]''. In this crossover, Harley is one of the many villains who helps try to take down the Batman and the [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]]. She initially appears disguised as a flight attendant.\n* In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a stripper (though this may be a ruse) and is never shown speaking.<ref>''Joker'' (2008). DC Comics</ref>\n* In the [[Ame-Comi Girls]] universe, Harley is partnered with the [[Catwoman]] and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]  as part of a trio of villains.\n* The [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] version of Harley Quinn is named '''Yo-Yo'''. She was a henchwoman of the [[Alternate versions of the Joker#Flashpoint|Joker]], and the [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Batman]] chased her down to find the Joker's location, as she had kidnapped [[Two-Face|Judge Dent]]'s children. He chased her to the ledge of the building around Crime Alley. Batman drops her off the roof, but is luckily saved by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman '66]]'', a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 1960s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted glasses, a long red dress and red blouse, large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as '''Dr. Holly Quinn''', PhD, a psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]], referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces the Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.<ref name=\":0\">''Batman '66'' #3. DC Comics</ref> Dr. Quinn is manipulated by the Catwoman and the Joker to perfect the Joker Wave \u2014 a hysteria-inducing transmitting dish used on Gotham. Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects \u2014 freeing the people of Gotham, but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin, wearing a [[roller derby]]-inspired version of the classic Harley costume. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of [[Matches Malone]]) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.<ref>''Batman '66'' #24. DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) he becomes devastated, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with the Joker's death, but develops an attachment to the Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath, but is also grief-stricken when he is killed by Superman. She later confronts the Black Canary, but hesitates upon realizing she is pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to the Black Canary that she has a four-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and the Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Brainiac alongside the Black Canary, the Green Arrow and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending that she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed that her daughter thinks her mother is actually her Aunt Harley, though Harley hopes she may one day be able to tell her the truth. \n* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is made into a mutant hyena by the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. She is knocked out by the Batman in the final battle and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the Arkham inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally, causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.<ref>''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #6. DC Comics/IDW</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', it is revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), and she was replaced by another girl, Marian Drews, without the Joker even realizing it. Once the Joker was cured from his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting \"normal\". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the \"fake Harley\" unconscious and reveals to Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) that there were two Harleys all along. While Harleen loved the Joker \"despite his flaws\", Marian loved the Joker by \"his flaws\". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of the Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself \"until the real Joker returns\".<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref>\n*In ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', Harley fell in with the Joker (in this version, a gangster) after leaving Charm School, but left him when he began his journey into the occult. By the time of the events of the story, Harley is drawn to England by a voice she believes is the Joker, but turns out to be the Joker's Daughter. She rejects the Joker's Daughter's attempt to have the Joker resurrected in the body of Poison Ivy, instead beginning a relationship with Ivy herself.\n* In ''[[Batman: Damned]]'' Harley snaps after the Joker's mysterious death following a battle with Batman and performs surgery on herself and dressing herself to make her resemble the Joker. Harley leads the Joker's remaining henchman on a revenge mission, blowing up several buildings and taking over the GCPD building and defacing the Batsignal so that it resembles the Joker's smile. Batman arrives and defeats the henchman before Harley paralyzes him with a toxin, beats him with her baseball bat, and attempts to sexually abuse him. Batman is then possessed by the Enchantress, and strangles Harley against the Batsignal.<ref>''Batman: Damned'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n====Live-action====\n* Harley Quinn was initially set to appear in ''Batman Unchained'', the fifth film planned for the original Batman film series.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kelly|last=Konda|url=https://weminoredinfilm.com/2015/06/15/the-inside-story-on-5-batman-movies-which-almost-got-made-before-batman-begins/|title=The Inside Story on 5 Batman Movies Which Almost Got Made Before Batman Begins|website=We Majored in Film|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Fleming|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121|title = Schumacher trims sails|magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date = November 11, 1997|accessdate =November 11, 2008}}</ref> She was to be featured as the Joker's ([[Jack Nicholson]]) daughter, who allies herself with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] to get revenge on Batman for her father's death.<ref>{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html|title = Rumblings From Gotham|website = [[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|date = July 27, 2000|accessdate =October 17, 2008}}</ref> Due to the critical and commercial failure of [[Batman & Robin (film)|''Batman & Robin'']], however, this film was cancelled.\n* The ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' version of Harley makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 film ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' in The Distracted Globe nightclub sequence.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Begley |url=https://batman-news.com/2017/12/11/joker-harley-quinn-ready-player-one-trailer/ |title=The Joker and Harley Quinn appear in 'Ready Player One' trailer |publisher=Batman News |date= |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margot Robbie]] as Harley Quinn in a publicity still for ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016)]] -->\n[[Margot Robbie]] portrays Dr. Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref name=AdditionalCast>{{cite news|title='Suicide Squad': First Cast Photo Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/suicide-squad-first-cast-photo-revealed-1201468975/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=July 25, 2015}}</ref>\n* The character debuted in the [[2016 in film|2016 film]] ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.

As the series progresses, John's confidence will increase and, depending on the player's choices, he will either aid Bruce Wayne in capturing Quinn or transform into the traditional version of the Joker.

At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams from the league phase will play against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match. Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match. The winner of the second Qualifying match will move onto the final to play the winner of the first Qualifying match in the IPL Final match, where the winner will be crowned the Indian Premier League champions.\n\n===Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries===\nA team can acquire players through any of the three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows{{mdash}}two before the auction and one after the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.\n\nSome of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:\n*The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.\n*[[Salary cap]] of the entire squad must not exceed {{INRConvert|850|m}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kolkata to host IPL 2020 auction on December 19|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/kolkata-to-host-ipl-2020-auction-on-december-19/articleshow/71386522.cms|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n*Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] or [[List A cricket|List A]] cricket.\n*A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instances in IPL when team played less than 4 overseas players|url=https://www.crictracker.com/instances-ipl-team-played-less-4-overseas-players/|accessdate=20 February 2019|work=CricTracker|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe term of a player contract is one year, with the franchise having the option to extend the contract by one or two years. Since the 2014 season, the player contracts are denominated in the [[Indian rupee]], before which the contracts were in [[U.S. dollar]]s. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice at the [[exchange rate]] on either the contract due date or the actual date of payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Player regulations for IPL 2014|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/703647.html|date=24 December 2013|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref> Prior to the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool and could be signed up by the franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of {{INRConvert|1|m}} to {{INRConvert|3|m}} would get deducted per signing from the franchise's salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners who complained that richer franchises were \"luring players with under-the-table deals\" following which the IPL decided to include domestic players in the player auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/714115.html|title=IPL longlist features 651 uncapped players|date=30 January 2014|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by Sporting Intelligence and ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'', the average IPL salary when [[pro rata|pro-rated]] is {{USD}}4.33 million per year, the second highest among all sports leagues in the world.

2016}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Tournament format===\nCurrently, with eight teams, each team plays each other twice in a home-and-away [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format in the league phase. At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams from the league phase will play against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match. Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match. The winner of the second Qualifying match will move onto the final to play the winner of the first Qualifying match in the IPL Final match, where the winner will be crowned the Indian Premier League champions.\n\n===Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries===\nA team can acquire players through any of the three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows{{mdash}}two before the auction and one after the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.\n\nSome of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:\n*The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.\n*[[Salary cap]] of the entire squad must not exceed {{INRConvert|850|m}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kolkata to host IPL 2020 auction on December 19|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/kolkata-to-host-ipl-2020-auction-on-december-19/articleshow/71386522.cms|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n*Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] or [[List A cricket|List A]] cricket.\n*A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instances in IPL when team played less than 4 overseas players|url=https://www.crictracker.com/instances-ipl-team-played-less-4-overseas-players/|accessdate=20 February 2019|work=CricTracker|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe term of a player contract is one year, with the franchise having the option to extend the contract by one or two years. Since the 2014 season, the player contracts are denominated in the [[Indian rupee]], before which the contracts were in [[U.S. dollar]]s. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice at the [[exchange rate]] on either the contract due date or the actual date of payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Player regulations for IPL 2014|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/703647.html|date=24 December 2013|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref> Prior to the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool and could be signed up by the franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of {{INRConvert|1|m}} to {{INRConvert|3|m}} would get deducted per signing from the franchise's salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners who complained that richer franchises were \"luring players with under-the-table deals\" following which the IPL decided to include domestic players in the player auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/714115.html|title=IPL longlist features 651 uncapped players|date=30 January 2014|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by Sporting Intelligence and ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'', the average IPL salary when [[pro rata|pro-rated]] is {{USD}}4.33 million per year, the second highest among all sports leagues in the world.
