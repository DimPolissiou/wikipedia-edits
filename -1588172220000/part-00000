But Molly will be waylaid on her journey from Seattle to California, and sidetracked - with dramatic, surprising, hilarious and unexpected results.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Naked Season Kira Cochrane|isbn = 978-0743441032|last1 = Cochrane|first1 = Kira|year=2003}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== ''Escape Routes for Beginners'' (2004) ===\nIn her second novel, Kira explores her narrative through the eyes of 13-year-old Rita Mae.

into fiction in her first novel, ''The Naked Season.''<ref name=\":1\" /> In an [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]] review and summary, they write:\n\n<blockquote>\"An outspoken, outrageous, original and outlandish debut novel from an outstanding new writer. Growing up isn't easy when your mother is a figurehead for feminism and the most famous lesbian in the world. All her life, Molly Flynn has been intrigued, entertained, alarmed and exasperated by her mother Augusta's increasingly bizarre claims about who she is and where she came from. Now, as Molly sets off down America's West Coast to confront her estranged husband and serve him divorce papers, she looks back on her strange and unconventional childhood in a series of entertaining flashbacks. But Molly will be waylaid on her journey from Seattle to California, and sidetracked - with dramatic, surprising, hilarious and unexpected results.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Naked Season Kira Cochrane|isbn = 978-0743441032|last1 = Cochrane|first1 = Kira|year=2003}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== ''Escape Routes for Beginners'' (2004) ===\nIn her second novel, Kira explores her narrative through the eyes of 13-year-old Rita Mae.

[[Bombardier Aerospace]].\n<!--Development-->\nAt the end of 1975, Canadair backed the LearStar 600 concept by [[Bill Lear]], and acquired the large business jet or freighter project in April 1976.<!--ref name=Upton2007--><!--ref name=Flight12aug1978-->\nOn 29 October, the programme was launched, backed by the [[Canadian federal government]], and designed to comply with new [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Part 25|FAR part 25]] standards.<!--ref name=Upton2007--> \n\nIn March 1977, it was renamed the Challenger 600 after Bill Lear was phased out, as the original [[conventional tail]] was changed for a [[T-tail]] among other developments.<!--ref name=Upton2007-->\nThe first prototype was rolled out on 25 May 1978, and performed its maiden flight on 8 November.<!--ref name=Upton2007-->\nThe [[flight test]] program saw a deadly crash on 3 April 1980, but [[Department of Transport (Canada)|Transport Canada]] approved the CL-600 [[type certification]] on 10 August 1980.\n\nIn 1986, Canadair was close to [[bankruptcy]] and was bought by Bombardier.<!--ref name=Flight25Nov2018-->\nThe jet was stretched into the [[Bombardier CRJ100/200|Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliner, introduced on 19 October 1992, and the longer range [[Global Express]], introduced in July 1999.\nThe 500th Challenger was rolled out in May 2000,<!--ref name=Flight10oct2018/--> and the 1000th was delivered to [[NetJets]] in December 2015.\nBy October 2018, 1,066 aircraft have been built.<!--ref name=Flight12oct2018/-->\n\n<!--design-->\nThe Challenger is a low-wing jet powered by two turbofans mounted in aft fuselage pods, it has a [[supercritical wing]] and a stand-up cabin with two seating sections.\n<!--Variants-->\nThe original [[Lycoming ALF 502]] turbofans were replaced by a pair of [[General Electric CF34]]s on the CL-601, which also gained [[winglets]], and first flew on 10 April 1982.<!--ref name=Flight29May1982-->\nSubsequent variants have updated systems,

However, Lear lacked the capabilities to launch such an aircraft, and thus sought out other agencies to collaborate with to both produce and sell it, including the [[Canada|Canadian]] aerospace manufacturer [[Canadair]]. According to authors Ron Picklet and Larry Milberry, Canadair's top management were of the opinion that Lear's concept was sketchy at best.<ref name=\"Pickler and Milberry p. 263\">Pickler, Ron and [[Larry Milberry]]. ''Canadair: The First 50 Years.''

Toronto, Ontario: Macmillan Canada. 1992. {{ISBN|0-77159-145-4}}, p. 55-57.</ref>\n\nFollowing a study, contrasting the proposed Learstar against rivals such as the [[Lockheed Jetstar]], [[Dassault Falcon 50]], and [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], Canadair decided to give its backing to the idea near the end of 1975.<ref name=Upton2007/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> According to aerospace industry publication [[Flight International]], the programme was viewed by many Canadians as a step towards developing a privately driven high-technology aviation industry that would compete at a global level.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Perhaps more importantly, the Canadian government had issued a demand that Canadair become self-sufficient, thus the company wanted to depend less upon [[subcontractor|subcontracting]] arrangements with other firms, such as France's [[Dassault Aviation]] and America's [[Boeing]], or providing support packages for existing aircraft that they had already ended production of, such as the [[Canadair CF-5|CF-5]] fighter. Canadair felt a need to prove its ability to independently develop original high-tech projects at this time.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nCanadair planned to use Lear's name and skills at self-promotion to secure extensive financial guarantees for a business jet project from the Canadian Federal government.<ref name=\"Pickler and Milberry p. 263\"/> This proved an effective choice: future Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] specifically refers to the effect of personal contact with Lear on his decision to direct financial support to Canadair's program.<ref>Low, Stephen.

Due to the use of [[Letter of comfort (contract law)|letters of comfort]], the extent of the Ministry's financial commitments for Canadair could be kept from parliament and the public for several years.<ref>''Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the House of Commons'' for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1982, para. 10.95 to 10.100.</ref> These financial guarantees were later used as an academic example of insufficient monitoring and lax controls in government support of industry.<ref>Borins, Stanford F. and Lee Brown. ''Investments in Failure.'' New York: Raven Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-458-80340-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn April 1976, Canadair acquired the LearStar 600 concept. By this point, it was a {{cvt|63 by 53.3|ft|m}} long and wide aircraft capable of a maximum speed of Mach 0.85 and a range of {{cvt|7,240|km|nmi}}; as an [[executive jet]] it had sufficient capacity for 14 passengers, in a [[cargo aircraft|freighter]] configuration it had a 3,400&nbsp;kg (7,500&nbsp;lbs) payload capacity, loaded and unloaded via a forward door, or as [[commuter airliner]] it could seat up to 30 passengers in a 2\u20131 seating configuration.<ref name=Upton2007/> Canadair developed the design into a large airframe furnished with a new supercritical wing design, new avionics and engines, as well as for compliance with new [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Part 25|FAR part 25]] standards.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> The configuration was frozen in August and a 1/25 model was tested in the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Aeronautical Establishment]] transonic [[wind tunnel]].<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, in excessof 1,800 hours of wind tunnel testing was performed upon the supercritical wing alone.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n===Launch===\nBacked by the Federal Government, the programme was launched on 29 October 1976 with firm orders and deposits for 53 aircraft.<ref name=Upton2007/> Within the next two years, roughly 2,500 employees would be involved in designing the aircraft.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Various changes to the original Learstar configuration had been made on the run up to launch, such as the [[conventional tail|conventional]] tailplane being substituted for a [[T-tail]] counterpart after the former was found to be in the path of the engine's exhaust flow, the relocation of fuel storage to the wings, and multiple increases of the aircraft's gross weight.<ref name=Upton2007/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Following disagreements over the direction of the programme, Bill Lear was phased out of involvement; accordingly, in March 1977, the aircraft was renamed the Challenger 600.<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, following his disassociation with the venture, Lear referred to Canadair's revised design as ''Fat Albert''.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Following Lear's death in May 1978, Canadair paid an estimated $25 million to his estate for his contribution to the programme.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nDue to the expansion of the design, the original powerplant configuration became untenable; thus engine manufacturer [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]] proposed developing a new model, the [[Lycoming ALF 502]]L, which Canadair's design team accepted for the enlarged Challenger and drew up its general arrangement around.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The type's wide cargo door had been designed in response to the needs of [[FedEx]], the type's original launch customer, having placed an order for 25 aircraft.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> Additionally, FedEx had experienced problems with the [[General Electric CF34]] engines, and favoured the [[Lycoming ALF 502]]D instead; those later had delivery troubles and lacked performance.<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, FedEx converted most of its orders into the Challenger's stretched version, intending to carry up to 12,500&nbsp;lb of freight at a time using them.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> However, FedEx ultimately opted to cancel its orders due to the US [[Airline Deregulation Act]], and the specific aircraft that were already in production were sold to other customers instead.<ref name=Upton2007/>\n\nBy the spring of 1977, Canadair had received over 70 firm orders and had begun constructing three [[prototypes]].<ref name=Upton2007/> Furthermore, a $70 million loan was borrowed from [[Europe]]an sources to help finance the programme, which lessened the financial burden on the Canadian government.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> A full-scale fuselage [[mockup]] was displayed at the 1977 [[Paris Air Show]] before a European and North American tour and 106 had been sold by 1977 end.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> During late 1977, in the face of criticism that the project would not be capable of producing an aircraft fulfilling the performance guarantees made, Canadair officials had commented that they expected the first flight to occur during the following year and that initial deliveries had been scheduled to commence during September 1979. Flight International noted that even prior to the prototype's first flight, the type had already made a noticeable impact upon the competition, including the launch of the [[Cessna Citation III]] and [[Grumman Gulfstream III]].<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nAirframe [[structural]] testing began in February 1979 and operational test cycling started in December 1979, simulating 72,638 [[flight hours]] by February 1985 while predicted lifetime was 30,000 hours.<!--ref name=Upton2007/--> By early March 1978, the first prototype was almost finished and the assembly of the two other had debuted;<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> destined to control [[handling qualities]] and test flight performance, it was formally rolled out on 25 May 1978, while 116 orders had been confirmed 19 months after go-ahead.<ref name=Upton2007/> By this point, production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] allowing for a production rate of up to seven Challengers per month had been established, ready for quantity production to proceed.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n===Flight test phase===\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-1A11 Challenger 600, Bombardier AN1006238.jpg|thumb|The third prototype was reused as the {{abbr|ACT|Active Control Technology}} [[fly-by-wire]] demonstrator.<ref name=Upton2007>{{cite web |publisher= Canada aviation museum |title= Canadair CL-600 / 601 / 604 Challenger serial 1003, registration C-GCGT |author= Bill Upton |date= 2007 |url= https://documents.techno-science.ca/documents/CASM-Aircrafthistories-CanadairCL-600Challenger.pdf}}</ref>]]\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype aircraft took off for its [[maiden flight]] from [[Montreal, Quebec]].

The publication also commented that the Challenger family \"appears to have a solid future\", observing a production rate of two aircraft per month throughout 2018.<ref name=Flight25Nov2018/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 605, Bombardier AN1445479.jpg|thumb|The Challenger cabin]]\nThe Challenger is a twin-engined [[business jet]], described by Flight International as being \u2018\u2019miniturised twinjet airliner in every respect\u2019\u2019.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> While the Challenger is generally similar in configuration to previous aircraft of its type, some of its features stand out; for example, the use of a widened fuselage that allows a \"walk-about cabin\". The Challenger was also one of the first business jets to be designed with a [[Supercritical airfoil|supercritical wing]]. The wing was referred by Canadair as being one of the aircraft's most advanced features.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> It is also capable of performing short takeoffs while maintaining the speed and comfort levels normally associated with larger jetliners.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Challengers can be identified visually from their peers by their distinctive [[Flap (aeronautics)#Types of flaps|double slotted hinged flap]] arrangement, where the fairings can be seen below the wings, a configuration that was much more common on commercial airliners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Challenger's wing has been referred to as being a modified [[NACA]] symmetrical aerofoil.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Akin to other supercritical wings, it features a rounded [[leading edge]], an inverted [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]], a blunt [[trailing edge]] and scalloping of the underside. The twin-spar wing box structure spans the entire length of the wing and is compartmentalised to form five internal fuel tanks; these tanks can accommodate up to 14,661&nbsp;lb of fuel, nearly half the aircraft's empty weight.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The skins of the wings are produced via large milling machines, which in 1978 were claimed to be in excess of anything else in [[North America]]. Many elements, such as the flaps, [[aileron]]s and leading edge feature conventional construction; however, several parts, including the wing/fuselage fairing, flap shrouds and wingtips are [[Molding (process)|mold]]ed out of [[Kevlar]], as are other elements of the aircraft.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nThe original CL-600 Challenger was powered by a pair of [[Lycoming ALF 502]]L [[turbojet]] engines, which was developed specifically for the Challenger.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Subsequent models would adopt other powerplants, including the [[General Electric CF34]] engine. The engines are mounted on the rear fuselage close to the aircraft's tail, providing smooth airflow to the engines even when flown at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]], although this was in a lower position than the original Learstar concept had placed them to mitigate against unfavourable pitch control characteristics.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The engines are fitted with [[thrust reverser]]s to decrease landing distances. An [[auxiliary power unit]] is also present for starting the engines and providing [[air conditioning]] within the cabin while on the ground.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nThe fuselage comprises three sections \u2013 the nose, centre, and tail \u2013 which are manufactured separately in their own jigs and joined late on in the production process.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> It has been designed to be [[pressurization|pressurised]] at a maximum differential of 9.3&nbsp;lb per square inch. Various cutouts are present across the fuselage to accommodate various features, such as a large main door on the port side of the aircraft forward of the wing, multiple regulation-compliant [[emergency exit]]s, a baggage hatch on the port side aft of the wing, and numerous windows.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The fuselage's diameter was designed to accommodate an unobstructed cabin floor, a cabin height of 6&nbsp;ft 1inch in the centre section, as well as space for the [[wing box]], underfloor integral fuel tanks, air ducts, and various control cabling. It was also designed to easily accommodate Canadair's early plans to stretch the fuselage, for which equal-length plugs are installed fore and after of the centre section to vastly increase the Challenger's capacity.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nVarious avionics are present upon the Challenger. As standard, the CL-600 is furnished with a dual-channel [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] SPZ-600 [[flight control system|automatic flight control system]], incorporating a [[Flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]] and [[air data computer]]s; more typical to larger commercial aircraft, this system is certifiable for conducting category 3A automatic landings.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The flight control system features significant redundancy, including three individual [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems; even with complete failure and the loss of one [[actuator]], a viable level of assisted control over the key flight surfaces remains present. [[Weather radar]] and [[Marconi]]-built solid-state instrument displays are supplied as standard, as well as a [[Rockwell Collins|Collins]]-built radio set; optional long range radio-based equipment, such as a [[High frequency|HF]] radio set and [[Very high frequency|VHF]] navigational aids can be installed.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nIn a standard executive aircraft configuration, the cabin is divided between the forward galley, and two seating sections, which are typically fitted with a four-chair club section followed by either a conference grouping area or divans, along with a lavatory at the aft end.<ref name=BCA25aug2016/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The chairs are fully reclining and can swivel, while the divans can serve as sleeping accommodation. Early examples feature luxuries such as telephones, lighting controls, and stereo systems; foldaway tables attached to the cabin walls were also installed, along with a pair of wardrobes, one fore and one aft, for storing hand luggage and other small items.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-1A11 Challenger 600 AN1902275.jpg|thumb|Original CL-600s have ALF 502s with full cowlings and do not have winglets, and their tail cones are truncated.]]\n[[File:Untitled Canadair 605 Challenger; VP-BKA@ZRH;10.03.2012 (6976549005).jpg|thumb|Later Challengers have winglets and are powered by CF34s with exposed nozzles, and from the pictured CL-605 have streamlined tail cones.]]\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2A12 Challenger 601 AN2214078.jpg|thumb|The early 601 has small [[Primary flight display|PFDs]].]]\n[[File:VH-URR Bombardier CL-600-2B16 Challenger 604 (6485923771).jpg|thumb|The later 604 has larger screens.]]\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 605, Bombardier AN1426362.jpg|thumb|The 605 modern flight deck]]\n\n===CL-600 (1A11)===\n;CL-600: Original production version, powered by [[Lycoming ALF 502]] turbofans of 7500&nbsp;lbf (33.6&nbsp;kN) thrust each.

airliner, introduced on 19 October 1992, and the longer range [[Global Express]], introduced in July 1999.\nThe 500th Challenger was rolled out in May 2000,<!--ref name=Flight10oct2018/--> and the

by a pair of [[General Electric CF34]]s on the CL-601, which also gained [[winglets]], and first flew on 10 April 1982.<!--ref name=Flight29May1982-->\nSubsequent variants have updated systems,

Canadair felt a need to prove its ability to independently develop original high-tech projects at this time.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nCanadair planned to use Lear's name and skills at self-promotion to secure extensive financial guarantees for a business jet project from the Canadian Federal government.<ref name=\"Pickler and Milberry p. 263\"/> This proved an effective choice: future Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] specifically refers to the effect of personal contact with Lear on his decision to direct financial support to Canadair's program.<ref>Low, Stephen.

By this point, it was a {{cvt|63 by 53.3|ft|m}} long and wide aircraft capable of a maximum speed of Mach 0.85 and a range of {{cvt|7,240|km|nmi}}; as an [[executive jet]] it had sufficient capacity for 14 passengers, in a [[cargo aircraft|freighter]] configuration it had a 3,400&nbsp;kg (7,500&nbsp;lbs) payload capacity, loaded and unloaded via a forward door, or as [[commuter airliner]] it could seat up to 30 passengers in a 2\u20131 seating configuration.<ref name=Upton2007/> Canadair developed the design into a large airframe furnished with a new supercritical wing design, new avionics and engines, as well as for compliance with new [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Part 25|FAR part 25]] standards.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> The configuration was frozen in August and a 1/25 model was tested in the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Aeronautical Establishment]] transonic [[wind tunnel]].<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, in excessof 1,800 hours of wind tunnel testing was performed upon the supercritical wing alone.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n===Launch===\nBacked by the Federal Government, the programme was launched on 29 October 1976 with firm orders and deposits for 53 aircraft.<ref name=Upton2007/> Within the next two years, roughly 2,500 employees would be involved in designing the aircraft.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Various changes to the original Learstar configuration had been made on the run up to launch, such as the [[conventional tail|conventional]] tailplane being substituted for a [[T-tail]] counterpart after the former was found to be in the path of the engine's exhaust flow, the relocation of fuel storage to the wings, and multiple increases of the aircraft's gross weight.<ref name=Upton2007/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Following disagreements over the direction of the programme, Bill Lear was phased out of involvement; accordingly, in March 1977, the aircraft was renamed the Challenger 600.<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, following his disassociation with the venture, Lear referred to Canadair's revised design as ''Fat Albert''.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Following Lear's death in May 1978, Canadair paid an estimated $25 million to his estate for his contribution to the programme.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nDue to the expansion of the design, the original powerplant configuration became untenable; thus engine manufacturer [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]] proposed developing a new model, the [[Lycoming ALF 502]]L, which Canadair's design team accepted for the enlarged Challenger and drew up its general arrangement around.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The type's wide cargo door had been designed in response to the needs of [[FedEx]], the type's original launch customer, having placed an order for 25 aircraft.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> Additionally, FedEx had experienced problems with the [[General Electric CF34]] engines, and favoured the [[Lycoming ALF 502]]D instead; those later had delivery troubles and lacked performance.<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, FedEx converted most of its orders into the Challenger's stretched version, intending to carry up to 12,500&nbsp;lb of freight at a time using them.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> However, FedEx ultimately opted to cancel its orders due to the US [[Airline Deregulation Act]], and the specific aircraft that were already in production were sold to other customers instead.<ref name=Upton2007/>\n\nBy the spring of 1977, Canadair had received over 70 firm orders and had begun constructing three [[prototypes]].<ref name=Upton2007/> Furthermore, a $70 million loan was borrowed from [[Europe]]an sources to help finance the programme, which lessened the financial burden on the Canadian government.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> A full-scale fuselage [[mockup]] was displayed at the 1977 [[Paris Air Show]] before a European and North American tour and 106 had been sold by 1977 end.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> During late 1977, in the face of criticism that the project would not be capable of producing an aircraft fulfilling the performance guarantees made, Canadair officials had commented that they expected the first flight to occur during the following year and that initial deliveries had been scheduled to commence during September 1979. Flight International noted that even prior to the prototype's first flight, the type had already made a noticeable impact upon the competition, including the launch of the [[Cessna Citation III]] and [[Grumman Gulfstream III]].<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nAirframe [[structural]] testing began in February 1979 and operational test cycling started in December 1979, simulating 72,638 [[flight hours]] by February 1985 while predicted lifetime was 30,000 hours.<!--ref name=Upton2007/--> By early March 1978, the first prototype was almost finished and the assembly of the two other had debuted;<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> destined to control [[handling qualities]] and test flight performance, it was formally rolled out on 25 May 1978, while 116 orders had been confirmed 19 months after go-ahead.<ref name=Upton2007/> By this point, production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] allowing for a production rate of up to seven Challengers per month had been established, ready for quantity production to proceed.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n===Flight test phase===\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-1A11 Challenger 600, Bombardier AN1006238.jpg|thumb|The third prototype was reused as the {{abbr|ACT|Active Control Technology}} [[fly-by-wire]] demonstrator.<ref name=Upton2007>{{cite web |publisher= Canada aviation museum |title= Canadair CL-600 / 601 / 604 Challenger serial 1003, registration C-GCGT |author= Bill Upton |date= 2007 |url= https://documents.techno-science.ca/documents/CASM-Aircrafthistories-CanadairCL-600Challenger.pdf}}</ref>]]\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype aircraft took off for its [[maiden flight]] from [[Montreal, Quebec]].

The publication also commented that the Challenger family \"appears to have a solid future\", observing a production rate of two aircraft per month throughout 2018.<ref name=Flight25Nov2018/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 605, Bombardier AN1445479.jpg|thumb|The Challenger cabin]]\nThe Challenger is a twin-engined [[business jet]], described by Flight International as being \u2018\u2019miniturised twinjet airliner in every respect\u2019\u2019.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> While the Challenger is generally similar in configuration to previous aircraft of its type, some of its features stand out; for example, the use of a widened fuselage that allows a \"walk-about cabin\". The Challenger was also one of the first business jets to be designed with a [[Supercritical airfoil|supercritical wing]]. The wing was referred by Canadair as being one of the aircraft's most advanced features.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> It is also capable of performing short takeoffs while maintaining the speed and comfort levels normally associated with larger jetliners.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Challengers can be identified visually from their peers by their distinctive [[Flap (aeronautics)#Types of flaps|double slotted hinged flap]] arrangement, where the fairings can be seen below the wings, a configuration that was much more common on commercial airliners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Challenger's wing has been referred to as being a modified [[NACA]] symmetrical aerofoil.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Akin to other supercritical wings, it features a rounded [[leading edge]], an inverted [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]], a blunt [[trailing edge]] and scalloping of the underside. The twin-spar wing box structure spans the entire length of the wing and is compartmentalised to form five internal fuel tanks; these tanks can accommodate up to 14,661&nbsp;lb of fuel, nearly half the aircraft's empty weight.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The skins of the wings are produced via large milling machines, which in 1978 were claimed to be in excess of anything else in [[North America]]. Many elements, such as the flaps, [[aileron]]s and leading edge feature conventional construction; however, several parts, including the wing/fuselage fairing, flap shrouds and wingtips are [[Molding (process)|mold]]ed out of [[Kevlar]], as are other elements of the aircraft.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nThe original CL-600 Challenger was powered by a pair of [[Lycoming ALF 502]]L [[turbojet]] engines, which was developed specifically for the Challenger.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Subsequent models would adopt other powerplants, including the [[General Electric CF34]] engine. The engines are mounted on the rear fuselage close to the aircraft's tail, providing smooth airflow to the engines even when flown at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]], although this was in a lower position than the original Learstar concept had placed them to mitigate against unfavourable pitch control characteristics.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The engines are fitted with [[thrust reverser]]s to decrease landing distances. An [[auxiliary power unit]] is also present for starting the engines and providing [[air conditioning]] within the cabin while on the ground.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nThe fuselage comprises three sections \u2013 the nose, centre, and tail \u2013 which are manufactured separately in their own jigs and joined late on in the production process.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> It has been designed to be [[pressurization|pressurised]] at a maximum differential of 9.3&nbsp;lb per square inch. Various cutouts are present across the fuselage to accommodate various features, such as a large main door on the port side of the aircraft forward of the wing, multiple regulation-compliant [[emergency exit]]s, a baggage hatch on the port side aft of the wing, and numerous windows.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The fuselage's diameter was designed to accommodate an unobstructed cabin floor, a cabin height of 6&nbsp;ft 1inch in the centre section, as well as space for the [[wing box]], underfloor integral fuel tanks, air ducts, and various control cabling. It was also designed to easily accommodate Canadair's early plans to stretch the fuselage, for which equal-length plugs are installed fore and after of the centre section to vastly increase the Challenger's capacity.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nVarious avionics are present upon the Challenger. As standard, the CL-600 is furnished with a dual-channel [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] SPZ-600 [[flight control system|automatic flight control system]], incorporating a [[Flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]] and [[air data computer]]s; more typical to larger commercial aircraft, this system is certifiable for conducting category 3A automatic landings.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The flight control system features significant redundancy, including three individual [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems; even with complete failure and the loss of one [[actuator]], a viable level of assisted control over the key flight surfaces remains present. [[Weather radar]] and [[Marconi]]-built solid-state instrument displays are supplied as standard, as well as a [[Rockwell Collins|Collins]]-built radio set; optional long range radio-based equipment, such as a [[High frequency|HF]] radio set and [[Very high frequency|VHF]] navigational aids can be installed.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nIn a standard executive aircraft configuration, the cabin is divided between the forward galley, and two seating sections, which are typically fitted with a four-chair club section followed by either a conference grouping area or divans, along with a lavatory at the aft end.<ref name=BCA25aug2016/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The chairs are fully reclining and can swivel, while the divans can serve as sleeping accommodation. Early examples feature luxuries such as telephones, lighting controls, and stereo systems; foldaway tables attached to the cabin walls were also installed, along with a pair of wardrobes, one fore and one aft, for storing hand luggage and other small items.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-1A11 Challenger 600 AN1902275.jpg|thumb|Original CL-600s have ALF 502s with full cowlings and do not have winglets, and their tail cones are truncated.]]\n[[File:Untitled Canadair 605 Challenger; VP-BKA@ZRH;10.03.2012 (6976549005).jpg|thumb|Later Challengers have winglets and are powered by CF34s with exposed nozzles, and from the pictured CL-605 have streamlined tail cones.]]\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2A12 Challenger 601 AN2214078.jpg|thumb|The early 601 has small [[Primary flight display|PFDs]].]]\n[[File:VH-URR Bombardier CL-600-2B16 Challenger 604 (6485923771).jpg|thumb|The later 604 has larger screens.]]\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 605, Bombardier AN1426362.jpg|thumb|The 605 modern flight deck]]\n\n===CL-600 (1A11)===\n;CL-600: Original production version, powered by [[Lycoming ALF 502]] turbofans of 7500&nbsp;lbf (33.6&nbsp;kN) thrust each.
