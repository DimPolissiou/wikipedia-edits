Also listed are their original [[Nippon Television|NTV]] [[Voice acting in Japan|voice actors]] (1973), followed by their [[TV Asahi]] voice actors (1979~2005; 2005~). Part of the 22nd century characters are listed in [[The Doraemons]].\n\n'''Note''': In some translations of ''[[Doraemon]]'', the names of these characters are different from the original names.\n\n==Main characters==\nFujiko's friends say that every main character represents elementary school student archetypes Fujiko noticed in his own school days. Nobita appears in every episode of the anime, while Doraemon appears in most episodes, sometimes being substituted (for medical checkup or on leave) by his sister Dorami.\n\n===Doraemon===\n{{main|Doraemon (character)}}\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Doreamon\n| colour       = \n| series       =\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />[[K\u014dsei Tomita]] (1973, 1 to episode 26)<br>[[Masako Nozawa]] (1973, 27 to episode 52)<br>[[Nobuyo \u014cyama]] (1979 \u2013 2005)<br>[[Wasabi Mizuta]] (April 2005 \u2013 present)<br>'''English'''<br>[[Mona Marshall]] (2014\u20132017)\n| nickname     = Dora-chan\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Male\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Nobita (childcare)<br>Dorami (sister)<br/>[[List of Doraemon characters#Tamako Nobi|Tamako Nobi]] (adoptive mother)<br/> [[List of Doraemon characters#Nobisuke Nobi|Nobisuke Nobi]] (adoptive father)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 10 (First appearance)<br/>11 (Current)\n| paux2 name   = Birthday \n| paux2        = 3 September 2112\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n| paux4 name   = Type \n| paux4        = [[Manga]], [[Cartoon]]s\n| paux5 name   = Colour\n| paux5        = {{bulleted list|Beginning: Yellow|Afterward: Blue}}\n}}\n: Yellow {{Voiced by|[[Chisa Yokoyama]]}}\n{{nihongo|Doraemon|\u30c9\u30e9\u3048\u3082\u3093|Doraemon}} (born on 3 September 2112, Virgo) is the title character and main protagonist of the series. He is a cat-like [[robot]] created for Nobita from the future.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Xiao|title=Sassy and Subservient: Chinese Girls and Media in the Urbanizing Countryside|date=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109022964|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCptg4PDyK8C&pg=PA62}}</ref> But people often mistake him for a raccoon dog and he becomes angry as seen in many episodes. He is sent to the {{nihongo|Matsushiba Robot Factory|\u30de\u30c4\u30b7\u30d0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5de5\u5834}} as blueprint, and is sent back in time by Sewashi (Nobita's Great-great-grandson) to aid Nobita, since Sewashi learned from his parents that Nobita suffered much in his life and wanted to help him. Doraemon possesses a 4-dimensional pocket from which he can acquire various kinds of futuristic tools, gadgets, and playthings from a future department store. He also has the tendency to panic during emergencies, characterized by him frantically trying to pull out a very much-needed tool from his pocket, only to produce a huge assortment of household items and unwanted gadgets. Still, Doraemon is very friendly and intelligent, not to mention long-suffering because of Nobita's antics. Since Sewashi sent Doraemon to the past, Doraemon has been living as the unofficial fourth member of Nobita's family and acts like a second son to Nobita's parents, since despite being a robot, he requires basic needs for a person, such as eating, and also sleeps in the closet of Nobita's bedroom.\n\nDoraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly blue, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-coloured hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail \u2014 the appearance most identify him with today. In \"The Doraemons\" [[story arc]] (and the ''[[2112: The Birth of Doraemon]]'' short film), it is revealed that Doraemon's original paint color was yellow. After getting his ears gnawed off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into depression on top of a tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled \"sadness\". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and his voice changed due to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid [[fear of mice]] despite being a robotic cat, and he is now suffering from [[musophobia]].\n\nOne can turn Doraemon off by pulling his balloon tail. Doraemon is considered a substandard product because many of his robotic features (i.e. radar whiskers and cat-calling bell) malfunctioned after production due to an accident in the factory while he was being built. Due to this malfunction, Doraemon did not do well at the robot's school and during the final presentation show, he performed badly and nobody wanted to hire him, until baby Sewashi pushed the button. His parents were a bit reluctant, but since Sewashi liked him, they hired Doraemon, and he took care of him until Sewashi himself sent him to the past to take care of Nobita. Despite this, Doraemon shows a lot of intelligence and common sense. Whenever he hangs out with his friend Mii-Chan (a cute street cat), he calls it 'important and busy work' as excuses for not doing work when Nobita or his mother ask him to do something when he will be going out with Mii.\n\nDoraemon's favourite food is {{nihongo|''[[dorayaki]]''|\u3069\u3089\u713c\u304d}} (known as \"fudgy pudgy pie\" in the English version of the manga, \"yummy buns\" in the English, and \"dora-cakes/bean jam buns\" in other versions), a Japanese treat filled with red bean paste. While it might explain the origin of his name, it was revealed in one of the manga chapters that his name originates from the Japanese word {{nihongo|''nora neko''|\u306e\u3089\u732b}} for \"stray cat\", and the {{nihongo|''-emon''|\u885b\u9580}} ending which is part of traditional Japanese names, as seen also in, for example, Ishikawa Goemon. Doraemon is also appeared in ''[[Perman]]'' series and Mitsuo's friend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/keyword?dbname=mangag&keyword=doraemon |title=Online dictionary of manga and video games in Japan: doraemon |publisher=Docoja.com:8080 |date=2007-08-08 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elanso.com/ArticleModule/JXPzPpHGL9P0P0PpW6W6TgIi.html |title=elanso\u7f51\u7ad9\u8c03\u6574 |publisher=Elanso.com |accessdate=2012-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302010514/http://www.elanso.com/ArticleModule/JXPzPpHGL9P0P0PpW6W6TgIi.html |archive-date=2012-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-92990921.html|title=Just how many gadgets does comic cat Doraemon have?|date=2004-04-01|publisher=Kyodo World News Service|accessdate=2009-02-19|quote=Doraemon, whose name derives from \"doraneko,\" meaning \"stray cat\" and \"-aemon,\"}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n===Nobita Nobi===\n{{anchor|Noby Nobi}}\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Nobita Nobi\n| colour       = Yellow\n| series       =\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />Yoshiko \u014cta (1973), [[Noriko Ohara]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), Hiroko Maruyama (stand-in for Ohara), [[Megumi \u014chara]] (April 2005 \u2013 present)<br/>[[Makiko \u014cmoto]] (2000; Teen), [[Mai Kadowaki]] (2005\u20132007; Teen)<br/>[[K\u014dz\u014d Shioya]] (1984; Adult), Shingo Hiromori (1987\u20131990; Adult), Noriko Ohara (2000\u20132004; Adult), [[T\u014dru \u014ckawa]] (2005; Adult), [[Hideyuki Hori]] (2006; Adult), [[Satoshi Tsumabuki]] (Stand by Me Doraemon; Adult)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Johnny Yong Bosch]]\n| nickname     = Noby\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Male\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Shizuka Minamoto (wife/[[Friend]])<br />Nobisuke Nobi (father)<br />Tamako Nobi (mother)<br />Nobirou Nobi (paternal uncle)<br />Goro Nobi (cousin)<br />Nobie Nobi (cousin)<br />Tamao Kataoka (maternal uncle)<br />Nobiru Nobi (paternal grandfather)<br />Nobita's Grandmother (paternal grandmother)<br />Nobikichi Nobi (paternal great-grandfather)<br />Mr. Kataoka (maternal grandfather)<br />Mrs. Kataoka (maternal grandmother)<br />Nobizaemon Nobi (ancestor)<br />Nobisaku Nobi (ancestor)<br />Nobisuke Nobi (son)<br />Nobisuke's son (grandson)<br />Sewashi's father (great-grandson)<br />Sewashi Nobi (great-great-grandson)<br />Sewashi's cousin (great-great-grandniece)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 10 (First appearance)<br/>11 (Current)\n| paux2 name   = Birthday \n| paux2        = August 7, 1961 (1969)<br>August 7, 1964 (1973)<br>August 7, 1973 (1979)<br>August 7, 1999 (2005)<br>\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}} \n{{nihongo|Nobita Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u592a|Nobi Nobita|English dub: Noby Nobi,<ref>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-05-11/doraemon-anime-visual-and-script-changes-for-u.s-tv-detailed</ref>}} (born on 7 August, Leo) is a fifth grader, the only child of his parents and the co-protagonist. He wears glasses, a red or yellow polo shirt with a white collar, and blue or black shorts. Nobita is usually foolish, uncoordinated, lazy, dimwitted, weak, frail, childish and bad at sports. He dislikes books and possesses basic scientific knowledge, being unable to understand concepts such as the definition of an eclipse. He envies Dekisugi, who is good at everything and admired by Shizuka. He often takes any chance to get a nap and favors gadgets that give him extra time or do work for him, and is thus known as 'The Lazy King'. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's gadgets, he shows them off to Shizuka but not to Suneo and Gian.\n\nNobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring zero (0%) (F's in the English dub) on his tests, getting scolded by his teacher, being teased by his classmates Gian and Suneo, falling in the curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs after mistakenly stepping on their tails, getting grounded by his mother for not completing his homework, and being bullied by all his friends except [[Shizuka]] who remembers Nobita's kind heart and cares for him. He is scared by almost everything, particularly ghosts, and is a cry-baby (a running gag in the show is Nobita crying and asking for Doraemon to bring out his gadgets, mostly at the beginning of the episode). He dislikes going on outdoor activities with his interest being afternoon naps and reading comics, usually right after school. In fact, these are probably his only true hobbies; for example, one story features Nobita falling asleep in three seconds just by closing his eyes, while in others he chooses sleep over important events, such as watching the first sunrise on New Year's Day. The only things stopping him from staying at home all the time, other than experimenting with Doraemon's gadgets, are Gian and Suneo coercing him into participate in baseball games, and being forced by Doraemon or his parents to do so.\n\nEven though Nobita has many flaws, he is kind-hearted, emotional, honest, occasionally hard-working (such as when he gets into a wager with his friends) and sometimes courageous (for example, when Shizuka is in danger). He has often risked his life to help save others, or even entire civilizations in full-length stories. And despite being shown to be academically poor, the reason behind it is principally his laziness, and he has secured good marks when incited to do so in some episodes, proving his credentials. Nobita can be very serious and responsible at times, such as when he cares for pets. Though he is weak at most things, he does have some strengths. For example, he has excellent marksmanship which rivals (or even surpasses) Dora the Kid. He can also weave excellent string figures, and is a fairly good comic book critic, owing to the huge amount of time he spends reading them. Nobita is also very creative when it comes to utilizing Doraemon's gadgets. For example, in one episode, he finds a way to profitably use a gadget called ''the Broadcasting mirror'' for advertising, even when Doraemon himself couldn't think of any use for it.\n\n===Shizuka Nobi / Shizuka Minamoto===\n{{anchor|Sue|Sue Morris}}\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Shizuka Nobi\n| series\n| colour       = pink\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />Masako Ebisu (1973), [[Michiko Nomura]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Rei Sakuma]] (2000), [[Yumi Kakazu]] (2005\u2013present)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Cassandra Morris]]\n| oaux1 name   = Portrayed by\n| oaux1        = \n| nickname     = Shizuka-chan<br />Sue\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Female\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Nobita Nobi (husband)<br />Yoshio Minamoto  (father)<br />Mrs. Minamoto (mother)<br />Kazu (cousin)<br />Shizunadahime (ancestor)<br />Shizu (ancestor)<br />Nobisuke Nobi (son)<br />Nobisuke's son (grandson)<br />Sewashi's father (great-grandson)<br />Sewashi Nobi (great-great-grandson)<br />Sewashi's cousin (great-great-grandniece)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 9\u201310\n| paux2 name   = Birthday \n| paux2        = May 8, 1962 (1969)<br>May 8, 1965 (1973)<br>May 8, 1974 (1979)<br>May 8, 2000 (2005)\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}} \n{{nihongo|Shizuka Minamoto|\u6e90 \u9759\u9999|Minamoto Shizuka|English dub: Sue Morris}} (born on 8 May, Taurus), nicknamed {{nihongo|Shizuka-chan|\u3057\u305a\u304b\u3061\u3083\u3093}} is a smart, kind and pretty girl. The word 'Shizuka (\u3057\u305a\u304b)' means 'Quiet'. She is Nobita's best friend and he has a crush on her. She does not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy disposition or constant failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage him to do better, though she usually fails to convince him. Shizuka likes to take a bath several times a day; however, a [[running gag]] in the series is that she is sometimes interrupted by sudden appearance of Nobita, Gian, or Suneo, usually due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like the ''Anywhere Door'' (''Doko Demo Doa'' in Japanese) (the scene ends with Shizuka shouting, \"Go away!\" to them). Her true passions are [[sweet potato]]es, which she would rather keep to herself out of the knowledge of others, and the violin, in which her playing is even more horrendous than Gian's singing. She is also known for taking piano lessons unwillingly due to her mother's wishes (as she loves violin more), which is sometimes a reason for declining to hang out with friends (but she plays piano better than violin). Shizuka is an animal lover and keeps two pets at home: a dog, who is saved from succumbing to illness by Nobita and Doraemon in one story; and a canary which runs away on multiple occasions and causing Shizuka and Nobita to run around the city chasing her down.\n\nDue to Nobita's heartiest effort and Doraemon's assistance, Shizuka marries Nobita in the future. At present, she does not have any particular crush (but Shizuka secretly loves Nobita very much). Sometimes she fancies some handsome idols on TV. Besides Nobita, Shizuka is also close to her classmate and popular student Dekisugi which makes Nobita jealous. Though they consider each other only as friends, Nobita often tries to prevent them from going together.\n\n===Takeshi Goda \"Gian\"===\n\n\n\n{{anchor|Gian|Big G}}\n<br /> \n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Takeshi Goda \" Gian\"\n| series       =\n| image        = \n| colour       = orange\n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />[[Kaneta Kimotsuki]] (1973), [[Kazuya Tatekabe]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Subaru Kimura]] (2005\u2013present)<br/>[[Kujira]] (2000; Teen)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Kaiji Tang]]\n| oaux1 name   = Portrayed by\n| oaux1        = \n| nickname     = Gian<br>Big G\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Male\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Takeshi's wife (wife)<br />Jaiko Goda (sister)<br />Mr. Goda (father)<br />Sasuke Goda (mother)<br />Gian's uncle (maternal uncle)<br />Gian's aunt (maternal aunt)<br />Takezuchi (ancestor)<br />Jaizou (ancestor)<br />Yasashiku Gouda (son)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 12\u201313\n| paux2 name   = Birthday\n| paux2        = June 15, 1959 (1969)<br>June 15, 1962 (1973)<br>June 15, 1971 (1979)<br>June 15, 1997 (2005)\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|Takeshi Goda|\u525b\u7530 \u6b66|G\u014dda Takeshi}} (born on 15 June, Gemini), usually known by the nickname {{nihongo|\"Gian\"|\u300c\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u300d|\"Jaian\"|English: Big G}}, is a strong and quick-tempered local [[Bullying|bully]]. He also frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Suneo's) under the pretext of \"borrowing\" them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his horrible singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes \"invites\" others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible that, once, Nobita and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, his writings of the song lyrics in a board end up having the same effect as when they hear them. In some films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in 'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some episodes when his voice is recorded and he hears it, he instantly denies it being his voice and threatens to beat up the person who sang his songs in a very bad way (which is an irony). Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his hand-made food can be a nightmare for other people very easily.\n\nHowever, Gian does not hesitate to help his friends when they are in real trouble. Throughout the series, particularly the films, he is often the one who voices the most concern and refuses to look away when there is a problem, an opposite of Suneo's cowardice. While he is described by others as daunting and intimidating, he is very sensitive and prone to crying when something touching happens, and he actually values his friends highly, a feeling which his friends sometimes reciprocate. Gian also has a soft spot for his younger sister, Jaiko, and usually tries to prevent her from trouble, even if she can perfectly handle her situation.\n\nHis catchphrase is {{nihongo|\"What's mine is mine. What's yours is also mine.\"|\u300c\u4ffa\u306e\u7269\u306f\u3001\u4ffa\u306e\u7269\u3002\u304a\u524d\u306e\u7269\u3082\u4ffa\u306e\u7269\u3002\u300d|\"Ore no mono ha, ore no mono.

A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy. He is often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He sometimes despises Nobita and often makes fun of him, most often resulting in Nobita getting into trouble. He also often pushes Nobita aside with silly excuses while he invites Gian and Shizuka to his parties or resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's closest friends, who would often ask for his and Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often the one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures, and he also tries to face as little trouble as possible and go home, unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward. He has an extensive knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer, besides being extremely cunning.\n\nIn some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that he is the most handsome guy in the world. His habit of bragging often lands him into trouble. Suneo is also very self-conscious about his height, being the shortest kid in his class. He likes [[steak]] and melon. There are many reasons why Suneo chooses Shizuka and Gian, except Nobita. It is because he tries to win Shizuka's favour and not to get harmed by Gian.\n\n===Dorami \"Doreme\"===\n\n\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Keiko Yokozawa]] (1980\u20132005), [[Chiaki (tarento)|Chiaki Fujimoto]] (2006\u2013present)|[[Wendee Lee]] (2014-2017)}}, [[Kim Seo-yeong]] (2016-2017, Korean)\n\n{{nihongo|Dorami|\u30c9\u30e9\u30df}} (born on 2 December 2114, Sagittarius) is Doraemon's younger sister. Who' s nickname is Doreme .Like Doraemon before he developed a fear of mice, she is yellow-skinned and has ears that resemble a large red bow. She and Doraemon are siblings due to the fact that they shared half of the oil from a can. Dorami lives in the 22nd-century Tokyo with Sewashi. She sometimes visits Nobita with a [[Time travel|time machine]] when Doraemon is \"off-duty\", to help Doraemon with something or to take care of Nobita when Doraemon has gone for his yearly health checkup. Dorami likes [[melonpan]] and is afraid of cockroaches like Nobita's mom. She is also shown to be a more advanced robot than Doraemon (Dorami is able to produce 10,000 horse power, in comparison to Doraemon's 129.3). Different from her malfunctioning brother, she is the smartest student during her school time, and has better skills in using gadgets. In a story, Nobita is intent on replacing Doraemon with Dorami due to her better skills; however, he quickly learns the fact that Dorami does not understand him as much as Doraemon does and will not tolerate his usual antics.\n\nDorami also has her own spin-off manga. In the manga series ''[[The Doraemons]]'', she is the love interest of Dora-the-Kid, Doraemon's friendly rival and the one most similar to him. Allegedly, she was originally pink, but turned yellow after drinking a potion labeled \"Jealousy\".\n\n===Mini-Doras===\n{{Voiced by|Chie Kitagawa (1990), [[Rei Sakuma]] (1994~March 2005), Tomato Akai (October 2005~)|[[Cristina Vee]] (2014)}}, [[Kim Seo-yeong]] (2016-2017, Korean)\n\n{{nihongo|Mini-Doras|\u30df\u30cb\u30c9\u30e9[\u305f\u3061]}} are one of the gadgets of Doraemon. They are mini versions of Doraemon with different color variation such as red, green and yellow variations. They can think and feel for themselves, and communicate with Doraemon through the \"Mini-Dora\" language (consisting of words like Dorara and speaking with gibberish accent). They act as helpers for all sorts of tasks, such as repairing the internal mechanism of Doraemon.\n\n==Nobi family==\n\n=== {{nihongo|Tamako Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u7389\u5b50|Nobi Tamako}} / Tammy Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Noriko Ohara]] (1973), [[Sachiko Chijimatsu]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] (April 2005 \u2013)|[[Mari Devon]] (2014)}}\n: Young {{voiced by|[[Tomoko Kawakami]]}}\n:: Tamako Nobi (born on 16 February, Aquarius) is Nobita's bespectacled, stay-at-home mother and one of the main [[protagonists]] in short stories, and the one Nobita inherits his appearance from. She can be very strict where she is often seen scolding Nobita for his actions, beating him, grounding him, or sending him out of the house (a typical Japanese household punishment used by parents). Several episodes involve Nobita trying to avoid his mother's scolding by using Doraemon's gadgets. Despite her disappointment with Nobita's lazy attitude and academic failures (even when her house is occasionally visited by Nobita's teacher for his progress in school), she is actually a good mother and cares about her son deeply. Her maiden last name is revealed to be {{nihongo|'''Kataoka'''|\u7247\u5ca1}}. She has a tendency of stopping Nobita from going out to play and forcing him to study. However on cold weather days, she always urges Nobita to go out and play to Nobita's intense displeasure. Her anxiety about the high household expenses is a recurring feature. In a couple of episodes where Nobita sees her in the past, it is revealed that she was rebellious even as a girl. She has an extreme dislike of animals and would always reject requests for any pet Nobita wants; this becomes a plot point in some of the films and stories where Nobita has to take in stray animals secretly. However in one story, her initial dislike of a cat turns her into adoring it so much that she becomes depressed when the cat's owner wants it back. In Mother vs. Rich Mother battle, she eats the Rival-making steak by accident; making her [[:wikt:rivalry|rivals]] with Suneo's mother. During the [[onion]]-cutting scene where she and Suneo's mother battle for who makes the tastiest [[curry]], her glasses help defend her eyes so that she will avoid crying from the onion's scent spreading into the eyes.\n\n'''Shizuka (\u3057\u305a\u304b)''' is also a member of Nobi family because she married Nobita.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobisuke Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u52a9|Nobi Nobisuke}} / Toby Nobi ===\n\n: Adult: {{Voiced by|[[Chichi Murasaki]] (1973), Masaryk Kate (1979~October 1992), Rukeyser Aka (October 1992~March 2005), [[Unoriginal Satsuma]] (April 2005~)|[[Tony Oliver]] (2014)}}\n: Young: {{voiced by|[[Norris Pharaoh]] (1979), [[Biko Yamada]] (1984~1985), Norris Ohara (1987), [[Mikoyan Himalayas]] (2005)}}\n:: Nobisuke (born on 12 March, Pisces), is Nobita's father and laid-back [[salaryman]]. He appears an easy-going father, often seen arriving home from work to soothe Tamako's anger towards Nobita. He has trouble quitting smoking and is self-conscious about his inability to pass the driving test. He also has a poor memory, is a borderline alcoholic, and sometimes arrives home drunk from nightly business meetings. Nobisuke often goes to [[golf]] which most Japanese businessmen and employees play. He had many similar personality traits with Nobita when he was young like getting bad grades, being poor at athletics, and getting scolded by his father. He has an impressive talent for painting, but did not choose to be an artist due to many reasons. Nobisuke is fond of Nobita and probably does not rebuke him like Tamako does because most of Nobita's inabilities and weaknesses remind him of his own childhood faults. Though he would makes comments or conversations that affect Nobita  considerably in one way or another. It was shown that he met Tamako on the day he had rejected an offer to be an artist from a wealthy gentleman, and feeling overjoyed, was running down the street at such speed that he barged straight into her, causing her to drop her ID card. This he latter returns and the acquaintance gradually turns into love and marriage.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobirou Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u90ce|Nobi Nobir\u014d}} / Chester Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yasuo Muramatsu]] (1980 \u2013 March 2005), [[K\u014dichi Hashimoto]] (November 2006)|[[Keith Silverstein]] (2013)}}\n:: Nobisuke's younger brother and an uncle of Nobita, with whom he is very friendly. He works overseas and only comes home during the Christmas-New Year holiday, which Nobita happily awaits every year since his uncle always gives him (and Doraemon) pocket money and presents on that time. He has a noticeably tanned skin due to his frequent stays in the tropics. In one chapter, he recounts on his many animal encounters, including an elephant which he thought had perished during [[World War II]]. The elephant is actually saved by Nobita and Doraemon due to a case of [[predestination paradox]].\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobie Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u6075|Nobi Nobie}} ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Megumi Hayashibara}}\n:: Nobirou's daughter and Nobita's younger cousin.

Nobita and Doraemon, despite initially deteriorating matters, finally help him to propose to (and be accepted by) the lady.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobiru Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u308b|Nobi Nobiru}} ===\n\n:Voiced by: [[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n:: Nobisuke's father and Nobita's paternal grandfather who died before Nobita's birth. He was very strict and very rude to Nobisuke since he valued physical strength and athleticism which Nobisuke lacked, though after all he loved him very much. He did not apparently favour Nobisuke's artistic prowess, but he really treasured the portrait his son had made of him, and for which Nobisuke got first prize in school. His grandson only saw him when he traveled to the past. Despite being harsh to Nobisuke, he enjoys indulging Nobita when Nobita travels to the past.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobita's Grandmother|\u306e\u3073\u592a\u306e\u7956\u6bcd|Nobita no Sobo}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|Unknown (1973), Akiko Takamura (2000)}}\n:: Nobisuke's mother and Nobita's paternal grandmother who is only referred to as {{nihongo|Grandma|\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093|Ob\u0101chan}} by Nobita. She died when Nobita was in kindergarten before the main storyline. She is always seen as a kind woman, if a bit eccentric, and unlike her husband never scolded Nobisuke for his lack of interest in \"masculine activities\", such as getting in a fight. Nobita remembers her very fondly, with most of his better childhood memories being playing with her; many of his toys, including his old [[kendama]], which becomes a plot point in [[Doraemon: Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey|one film]], were given to him by his grandmother. When Nobita travels to the past, she always recognizes him as her grandson even if he has grown up. She appeared in a few episodes. She takes care of Nobita on his former days and in one of '''The Doraemons''' manga, she was proud to see Nobita grown up into a teenage boy.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Sewashi|\u30bb\u30ef\u30b7|Sewashi}} / Soby Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Seiko Minamoto]] (1973), Shikoku Ta (1980~March 2005), [[Saki Satsuma]] (August 2005)|[[Max Mittelman]] (2014)}}\n:: Nobita's great-great-grandson, he is the one who sends Doraemon back to the past to look after Nobita. Sewashi first bought Doraemon in 2112 when Doraemon still had ears and his original factory paint. He sent him because his pocket money was not much due to the debts the family inherited from Nobita, and he also wanted to help out his troubled great-grandfather. He seems to have more common sense and is smarter than Nobita, but is just as reluctant when it comes to studying. Sewashi is also the owner of Doraemon's sister, Dorami.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobisuke Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4\u30ce\u30d3\u30b9\u30b1|Nobi Nobisuke}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|[[Noriko Ohara]] (1979~March 2005), [[Yoshiko Kamei]] (April 2005~)}}\n:: Nobita and Shizuka's son, named after Nobita's father. Though being as stupid as his father, he is a strong child and a good athlete, and brave enough to bully Gian and Suneo's sons. The first time he met the present Nobita, he even beat up Nobita because he regarded him as an imposter. His real name is Nobita Nobi, Jr., but his parents often call him ''Nobisuke'' due to his grandfather's name.\n\n==Minamoto family==\n\n=== {{nihongo|Mrs. Minamoto|\u9759\u9999\u306e\u6bcd|Minamato no Haha}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|Unknown (1973), [[Keiko Yokozawa]] (1979~1981), Masako Matsubara (August 1981~March 2005), [[Ai Orikasa]] (April 2005~)|[[Wendee Lee]] (2015)}}\n:: Shizuka's mother.

His best-known appearance in the series is when Nobita and Doraemon eavesdrop on him talking to Shizuka the night before Nobita and her wedding, in which he trusts that Nobita will be able to take care of Shizuka. So he accepts Nobita as his daughter's spouse.

She loves Suneo very much and spoils him rotten. She is generous to Suneo's friends, but just like her son, she likes to show off her jewellery or branded handbags and sometimes makes Nobita's mother jealous. In the episode \"Mother Vs. Rich Mother Battle,\" she became Tamako's rival after eating the Rival-Making steak and competes Tamako of who makes the tastiest [[curry]]. In the 30 years special, she is seen as just as odd, and mischievous as her son. When she is introduced in the \"Saobody\" special, she is seen as someone who is very sexually active, and enticed. She has a thriving relationship with Suneo's father. She strives to be a spoiling, enticing grandmother to young Nala. When Nala is outside with her, she often laughs throwing her head back. She then smiles a cunning smile, calling Nala her \"best friend\", much like her son.

In the 1973 anime, Mrs. Goda was dead. In later anime projects, she is alive. Gian always tries to flee from her when she orders him to help in the matters of the store or do deliveries. Though being as strong as her son, she is a righteous person as she punishes her son whenever he bullies children as she doesn't want to let Gian hurt other children. Her harsh treatment towards Gian is driven by her love, and Gian too, though sometimes speaking ill of her, cares for his mother deeply. This is evident from the way Gian had painstakingly made a rice-cake, actually a gadget from Doraemon, which had healed his mother's health problem, despite being constantly mocked and annoyed during the process by Nobita and Suneo. Had he lost focus, the gadget would have lost effectiveness, but his love for his mother prevented him from losing concentration.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Sasuke Goda|\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u306e\u7236|Jaian no Chichi}} ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Unknown (1973), Masayuki Kat\u014d (1979~1980), [[Yu Shimaka]] (1987), [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] (November 1987), Y\u016b Shimaka (1993)|[[Kirk Thornton]] (2014)}}\n:: He mostly works outside to help his wife's store. Though being the parent who is the least recurring in Fujiko's story, he is known to be the strongest man in the town that he lives in.

In earlier stories, she had bad tempers when something did not go as she pleases, though she mellows down in later stories. Had Doraemon not intervened, she would have been Nobita's wife in the future which is why her first appearance is earlier than Suneo and Gian in the series. However, Doraemon succeeds on his mission and Nobita eventually marries Shizuka. Her name ''Jaiko'' is usually considered a nickname in the same vein as her brother; her given name is never revealed in the series.\n\nAs an aspiring [[Mangaka|manga artist]], Jaiko goes by her pen name {{nihongo|'''Christine''' Goda|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30cd \u525b\u7530|Kurisuch\u012bne G\u014dda}}, and sometimes submits her manga to publishing companies for prizes. She usually fails because her storytelling is still rough, although she has received much attention from editors. Sometimes when she almost decides to give up writing comic books after failing to get good ideas, Gian and his friends, after being requested and sometimes forced, cheer her up. Unlike Gian, she is kind, polite and good at studies. She and Moteo Mote are good friends.

Muku tries to be as brave as Gian, who praises his strength and courage, but in many emergencies he just runs away and enrages Gian.

He is very intelligent and has a photographic memory. Dekisugi is the perfect all-round student, consistently getting 100s in class (A+'s in English Dub) and also being highly capable in sports. His family is apparently wealthy, owning a house that is so large that one can lose one's way. His name literally means \"brilliant over-achiever\", and his last name is a pun on ''dekisugiru'' (\u51fa\u6765\u904e\u304e\u308b), which means \"over achieving\". Shizuka sometimes prefers the company of Dekisugi, who is more of her intellectual equal. Nobita often feels jealous and concocts bizarre schemes (helped by Doraemon's gadgets) to keep them apart or to win Shizuka's attention. However, Dekisugi never gets angry at Nobita and even willingly helps Nobita whenever he has philosophical or scientific questions. Dekisugi is polite, respectful, and will never argue with or fault anyone even in the most ridiculous of situations \u2013 instead he will always say something positive to lighten the mood.\n\nIn the future, it is shown that in spite of Shizuka's friendship with Dekisugi, she still marries Nobita while Dekisugi himself is wed to another woman.

He sometimes tries to encourage Nobita through kindness to study and get good marks, and sometimes resorts to punishments that range from making Nobita stand in the hallway or clean the classroom alone after school. While Teacher is impressed by Dekisugi's progress and occasionally scolds Gian, Suneo tends to fool Teacher with conning lies or superstitions. Teacher often pays unexpected visits to the Nobi's in order to inform Tamako Nobi about Nobita's recent exam results and his academic position. Nobita's feelings towards him are varied ranging from fear to respect and admiration depending on the situation.\n\nTeacher's real name is unknown.

The children always try not to anger Kaminari and play carefully. Recovering the ball without getting shouted at is difficult.

He is a cat-like [[robot]] created for Nobita from the future.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Xiao|title=Sassy and Subservient: Chinese Girls and Media in the Urbanizing Countryside|date=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109022964|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCptg4PDyK8C&pg=PA62}}</ref> But people often mistake him for a raccoon dog and he becomes angry as seen in many episodes. He is sent to the {{nihongo|Matsushiba Robot Factory|\u30de\u30c4\u30b7\u30d0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5de5\u5834}} as blueprint, and is sent back in time by Sewashi (Nobita's Great-great-grandson) to aid Nobita, since Sewashi learned from his parents that Nobita suffered much in his life and wanted to help him. Doraemon possesses a 4-dimensional pocket from which he can acquire various kinds of futuristic tools, gadgets, and playthings from a future department store. He also has the tendency to panic during emergencies, characterized by him frantically trying to pull out a very much-needed tool from his pocket, only to produce a huge assortment of household items and unwanted gadgets. Still, Doraemon is very friendly and intelligent, not to mention long-suffering because of Nobita's antics. Since Sewashi sent Doraemon to the past, Doraemon has been living as the unofficial fourth member of Nobita's family and acts like a second son to Nobita's parents, since despite being a robot, he requires basic needs for a person, such as eating, and also sleeps in the closet of Nobita's bedroom.\n\nDoraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly blue, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-coloured hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail \u2014 the appearance most identify him with today. In \"The Doraemons\" [[story arc]] (and the ''[[2112: The Birth of Doraemon]]'' short film), it is revealed that Doraemon's original paint color was yellow. After getting his ears gnawed off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into depression on top of a tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled \"sadness\". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and his voice changed due to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid [[fear of mice]] despite being a robotic cat, and he is now suffering from [[musophobia]].\n\nOne can turn Doraemon off by pulling his balloon tail. Doraemon is considered a substandard product because many of his robotic features (i.e. radar whiskers and cat-calling bell) malfunctioned after production due to an accident in the factory while he was being built. Due to this malfunction, Doraemon did not do well at the robot's school and during the final presentation show, he performed badly and nobody wanted to hire him, until baby Sewashi pushed the button. His parents were a bit reluctant, but since Sewashi liked him, they hired Doraemon, and he took care of him until Sewashi himself sent him to the past to take care of Nobita. Despite this, Doraemon shows a lot of intelligence and common sense. Whenever he hangs out with his friend Mii-Chan (a cute street cat), he calls it 'important and busy work' as excuses for not doing work when Nobita or his mother ask him to do something when he will be going out with Mii.\n\nDoraemon's favourite food is {{nihongo|''[[dorayaki]]''|\u3069\u3089\u713c\u304d}} (known as \"fudgy pudgy pie\" in the English version of the manga, \"yummy buns\" in the English, and \"dora-cakes/bean jam buns\" in other versions), a Japanese treat filled with red bean paste. While it might explain the origin of his name, it was revealed in one of the manga chapters that his name originates from the Japanese word {{nihongo|''nora neko''|\u306e\u3089\u732b}} for \"stray cat\", and the {{nihongo|''-emon''|\u885b\u9580}} ending which is part of traditional Japanese names, as seen also in, for example, Ishikawa Goemon.

He wears glasses, a red or yellow polo shirt with a white collar, and blue or black shorts. Nobita is usually foolish, uncoordinated, lazy, dimwitted, weak, frail, childish and bad at sports. He dislikes books and possesses basic scientific knowledge, being unable to understand concepts such as the definition of an eclipse. He envies Dekisugi, who is good at everything and admired by Shizuka. He often takes any chance to get a nap and favors gadgets that give him extra time or do work for him, and is thus known as 'The Lazy King'. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's gadgets, he shows them off to Shizuka but not to Suneo and Gian.\n\nNobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring zero (0%) (F's in the English dub) on his tests, getting scolded by his teacher, being teased by his classmates Gian and Suneo, falling in the curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs after mistakenly stepping on their tails, getting grounded by his mother for not completing his homework, and being bullied by all his friends except [[Shizuka]] who remembers Nobita's kind heart and cares for him. He is scared by almost everything, particularly ghosts, and is a cry-baby (a running gag in the show is Nobita crying and asking for Doraemon to bring out his gadgets, mostly at the beginning of the episode). He dislikes going on outdoor activities with his interest being afternoon naps and reading comics, usually right after school. In fact, these are probably his only true hobbies; for example, one story features Nobita falling asleep in three seconds just by closing his eyes, while in others he chooses sleep over important events, such as watching the first sunrise on New Year's Day. The only things stopping him from staying at home all the time, other than experimenting with Doraemon's gadgets, are Gian and Suneo coercing him into participate in baseball games, and being forced by Doraemon or his parents to do so.\n\nEven though Nobita has many flaws, he is kind-hearted, emotional, honest, occasionally hard-working (such as when he gets into a wager with his friends) and sometimes courageous (for example, when Shizuka is in danger). He has often risked his life to help save others, or even entire civilizations in full-length stories. And despite being shown to be academically poor, the reason behind it is principally his laziness, and he has secured good marks when incited to do so in some episodes, proving his credentials. Nobita can be very serious and responsible at times, such as when he cares for pets. Though he is weak at most things, he does have some strengths. For example, he has excellent marksmanship which rivals (or even surpasses) Dora the Kid. He can also weave excellent string figures, and is a fairly good comic book critic, owing to the huge amount of time he spends reading them. Nobita is also very creative when it comes to utilizing Doraemon's gadgets. For example, in one episode, he finds a way to profitably use a gadget called ''the Broadcasting mirror'' for advertising, even when Doraemon himself couldn't think of any use for it.\n\n===Shizuka Nobi / Shizuka Minamoto===\n{{anchor|Sue|Sue Morris}}\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Shizuka Nobi\n| series\n| colour       = pink\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />Masako Ebisu (1973), [[Michiko Nomura]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Rei Sakuma]] (2000), [[Yumi Kakazu]] (2005\u2013present)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Cassandra Morris]]\n| oaux1 name   = Portrayed by\n| oaux1        = \n| nickname     = Shizuka-chan<br />Sue\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Female\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Nobita Nobi (husband)<br />Yoshio Minamoto  (father)<br />Mrs. Minamoto (mother)<br />Kazu (cousin)<br />Shizunadahime (ancestor)<br />Shizu (ancestor)<br />Nobisuke Nobi (son)<br />Nobisuke's son (grandson)<br />Sewashi's father (great-grandson)<br />Sewashi Nobi (great-great-grandson)<br />Sewashi's cousin (great-great-grandniece)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 9\u201310\n| paux2 name   = Birthday \n| paux2        = May 8, 1962 (1969)<br>May 8, 1965 (1973)<br>May 8, 1974 (1979)<br>May 8, 2000 (2005)\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}} \n{{nihongo|Shizuka Minamoto|\u6e90 \u9759\u9999|Minamoto Shizuka|English dub: Sue Morris}} (born on 8 May, Taurus), nicknamed {{nihongo|Shizuka-chan|\u3057\u305a\u304b\u3061\u3083\u3093}} is a smart, kind and pretty girl. The word 'Shizuka (\u3057\u305a\u304b)' means 'Quiet'. She is Nobita's best friend and he has a crush on her. She does not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy disposition or constant failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage him to do better, though she usually fails to convince him. Shizuka likes to take a bath several times a day; however, a [[running gag]] in the series is that she is sometimes interrupted by sudden appearance of Nobita, Gian, or Suneo, usually due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like the ''Anywhere Door'' (''Doko Demo Doa'' in Japanese) (the scene ends with Shizuka shouting, \"Go away!\" to them). Her true passions are [[sweet potato]]es, which she would rather keep to herself out of the knowledge of others, and the violin, in which her playing is even more horrendous than Gian's singing. She is also known for taking piano lessons unwillingly due to her mother's wishes (as she loves violin more), which is sometimes a reason for declining to hang out with friends (but she plays piano better than violin). Shizuka is an animal lover and keeps two pets at home: a dog, who is saved from succumbing to illness by Nobita and Doraemon in one story; and a canary which runs away on multiple occasions and causing Shizuka and Nobita to run around the city chasing her down.\n\nDue to Nobita's heartiest effort and Doraemon's assistance, Shizuka marries Nobita in the future. At present, she does not have any particular crush (but Shizuka secretly loves Nobita very much). Sometimes she fancies some handsome idols on TV. Besides Nobita, Shizuka is also close to her classmate and popular student Dekisugi which makes Nobita jealous. Though they consider each other only as friends, Nobita often tries to prevent them from going together.\n\n===Takeshi Goda \"Gian\"===\n\n\n\n{{anchor|Gian|Big G}}\n<br /> \n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Takeshi Goda \" Gian\"\n| series       =\n| image        = \n| colour       = orange\n| first        = December 1969\n| creator      = [[Fujiko Fujio]]\n| voiced by    = '''Japanese''':<br />[[Kaneta Kimotsuki]] (1973), [[Kazuya Tatekabe]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Subaru Kimura]] (2005\u2013present)<br/>[[Kujira]] (2000; Teen)<br />'''English''':<br />[[Kaiji Tang]]\n| oaux1 name   = Portrayed by\n| oaux1        = \n| nickname     = Gian<br>Big G\n| alias        = \n| gender       = Male\n| species      = \n| nationality  = Japanese\n| title        = \n| relatives    = Takeshi's wife (wife)<br />Jaiko Goda (sister)<br />Mr. Goda (father)<br />Sasuke Goda (mother)<br />Gian's uncle (maternal uncle)<br />Gian's aunt (maternal aunt)<br />Takezuchi (ancestor)<br />Jaizou (ancestor)<br />Yasashiku Gouda (son)\n| paux1 name   = Age\n| paux1        = 12\u201313\n| paux2 name   = Birthday\n| paux2        = June 15, 1959 (1969)<br>June 15, 1962 (1973)<br>June 15, 1971 (1979)<br>June 15, 1997 (2005)\n| paux3 name   = Hometown\n| paux3        = [[Tokyo]]\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|Takeshi Goda|\u525b\u7530 \u6b66|G\u014dda Takeshi}} (born on 15 June, Gemini), usually known by the nickname {{nihongo|\"Gian\"|\u300c\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u300d|\"Jaian\"|English: Big G}}, is a strong and quick-tempered local [[Bullying|bully]]. He also frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Suneo's) under the pretext of \"borrowing\" them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his horrible singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes \"invites\" others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible that, once, Nobita and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, his writings of the song lyrics in a board end up having the same effect as when they hear them. In some films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in 'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some episodes when his voice is recorded and he hears it, he instantly denies it being his voice and threatens to beat up the person who sang his songs in a very bad way (which is an irony). Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his hand-made food can be a nightmare for other people very easily.\n\nHowever, Gian does not hesitate to help his friends when they are in real trouble. Throughout the series, particularly the films, he is often the one who voices the most concern and refuses to look away when there is a problem, an opposite of Suneo's cowardice. While he is described by others as daunting and intimidating, he is very sensitive and prone to crying when something touching happens, and he actually values his friends highly, a feeling which his friends sometimes reciprocate. Gian also has a soft spot for his younger sister, Jaiko, and usually tries to prevent her from trouble, even if she can perfectly handle her situation.\n\nHis catchphrase is {{nihongo|\"What's mine is mine.

A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy. He is often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He sometimes despises Nobita and often makes fun of him, most often resulting in Nobita getting into trouble. He also often pushes Nobita aside with silly excuses while he invites Gian and Shizuka to his parties or resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's closest friends, who would often ask for his and Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often the one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures, and he also tries to face as little trouble as possible and go home, unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward. He has an extensive knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer, besides being extremely cunning.\n\nIn some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that he is the most handsome guy in the world. His habit of bragging often lands him into trouble. Suneo is also very self-conscious about his height, being the shortest kid in his class. He likes [[steak]] and melon. There are many reasons why Suneo chooses Shizuka and Gian, except Nobita. It is because he tries to win Shizuka's favour and not to get harmed by Gian.\n\n===Dorami \"Doreme\"===\n\n\n\n{{Voiced by|[[Keiko Yokozawa]] (1980\u20132005), [[Chiaki (tarento)|Chiaki Fujimoto]] (2006\u2013present)|[[Wendee Lee]] (2014-2017)}}, [[Kim Seo-yeong]] (2016-2017, Korean)\n\n{{nihongo|Dorami|\u30c9\u30e9\u30df}} (born on 2 December 2114, Sagittarius) is Doraemon's younger sister. Who' s nickname is Doreme .Like Doraemon before he developed a fear of mice, she is yellow-skinned and has ears that resemble a large red bow. She and Doraemon are siblings due to the fact that they shared half of the oil from a can. Dorami lives in the 22nd-century Tokyo with Sewashi. She sometimes visits Nobita with a [[Time travel|time machine]] when Doraemon is \"off-duty\", to help Doraemon with something or to take care of Nobita when Doraemon has gone for his yearly health checkup. Dorami likes [[melonpan]] and is afraid of cockroaches like Nobita's mom. She is also shown to be a more advanced robot than Doraemon (Dorami is able to produce 10,000 horse power, in comparison to Doraemon's 129.3). Different from her malfunctioning brother, she is the smartest student during her school time, and has better skills in using gadgets. In a story, Nobita is intent on replacing Doraemon with Dorami due to her better skills; however, he quickly learns the fact that Dorami does not understand him as much as Doraemon does and will not tolerate his usual antics.\n\nDorami also has her own spin-off manga. In the manga series ''[[The Doraemons]]'', she is the love interest of Dora-the-Kid, Doraemon's friendly rival and the one most similar to him. Allegedly, she was originally pink, but turned yellow after drinking a potion labeled \"Jealousy\".\n\n===Mini-Doras===\n{{Voiced by|Chie Kitagawa (1990), [[Rei Sakuma]] (1994~March 2005), Tomato Akai (October 2005~)|[[Cristina Vee]] (2014)}}, [[Kim Seo-yeong]] (2016-2017, Korean)\n\n{{nihongo|Mini-Doras|\u30df\u30cb\u30c9\u30e9[\u305f\u3061]}} are one of the gadgets of Doraemon. They are mini versions of Doraemon with different color variation such as red, green and yellow variations. They can think and feel for themselves, and communicate with Doraemon through the \"Mini-Dora\" language (consisting of words like Dorara and speaking with gibberish accent). They act as helpers for all sorts of tasks, such as repairing the internal mechanism of Doraemon.\n\n==Nobi family==\n\n=== {{nihongo|Tamako Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u7389\u5b50|Nobi Tamako}} / Tammy Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Noriko Ohara]] (1973), [[Sachiko Chijimatsu]] (1979 \u2013 March 2005), [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] (April 2005 \u2013)|[[Mari Devon]] (2014)}}\n: Young {{voiced by|[[Tomoko Kawakami]]}}\n:: Tamako Nobi (born on 16 February, Aquarius) is Nobita's bespectacled, stay-at-home mother and one of the main [[protagonists]] in short stories, and the one Nobita inherits his appearance from. She can be very strict where she is often seen scolding Nobita for his actions, beating him, grounding him, or sending him out of the house (a typical Japanese household punishment used by parents). Several episodes involve Nobita trying to avoid his mother's scolding by using Doraemon's gadgets. Despite her disappointment with Nobita's lazy attitude and academic failures (even when her house is occasionally visited by Nobita's teacher for his progress in school), she is actually a good mother and cares about her son deeply. Her maiden last name is revealed to be {{nihongo|'''Kataoka'''|\u7247\u5ca1}}. She has a tendency of stopping Nobita from going out to play and forcing him to study. However on cold weather days, she always urges Nobita to go out and play to Nobita's intense displeasure. Her anxiety about the high household expenses is a recurring feature. In a couple of episodes where Nobita sees her in the past, it is revealed that she was rebellious even as a girl. She has an extreme dislike of animals and would always reject requests for any pet Nobita wants; this becomes a plot point in some of the films and stories where Nobita has to take in stray animals secretly. However in one story, her initial dislike of a cat turns her into adoring it so much that she becomes depressed when the cat's owner wants it back. In Mother vs. Rich Mother battle, she eats the Rival-making steak by accident; making her [[:wikt:rivalry|rivals]] with Suneo's mother. During the [[onion]]-cutting scene where she and Suneo's mother battle for who makes the tastiest [[curry]], her glasses help defend her eyes so that she will avoid crying from the onion's scent spreading into the eyes.\n\n'''Shizuka (\u3057\u305a\u304b)''' is also a member of Nobi family because she married Nobita.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobisuke Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u52a9|Nobi Nobisuke}} / Toby Nobi ===\n\n: Adult: {{Voiced by|[[Chichi Murasaki]] (1973), Masaryk Kate (1979~October 1992), Rukeyser Aka (October 1992~March 2005), [[Unoriginal Satsuma]] (April 2005~)|[[Tony Oliver]] (2014)}}\n: Young: {{voiced by|[[Norris Pharaoh]] (1979), [[Biko Yamada]] (1984~1985), Norris Ohara (1987), [[Mikoyan Himalayas]] (2005)}}\n:: Nobisuke (born on 12 March, Pisces), is Nobita's father and laid-back [[salaryman]]. He appears an easy-going father, often seen arriving home from work to soothe Tamako's anger towards Nobita. He has trouble quitting smoking and is self-conscious about his inability to pass the driving test. He also has a poor memory, is a borderline alcoholic, and sometimes arrives home drunk from nightly business meetings. Nobisuke often goes to [[golf]] which most Japanese businessmen and employees play. He had many similar personality traits with Nobita when he was young like getting bad grades, being poor at athletics, and getting scolded by his father. He has an impressive talent for painting, but did not choose to be an artist due to many reasons. Nobisuke is fond of Nobita and probably does not rebuke him like Tamako does because most of Nobita's inabilities and weaknesses remind him of his own childhood faults. Though he would makes comments or conversations that affect Nobita  considerably in one way or another. It was shown that he met Tamako on the day he had rejected an offer to be an artist from a wealthy gentleman, and feeling overjoyed, was running down the street at such speed that he barged straight into her, causing her to drop her ID card. This he latter returns and the acquaintance gradually turns into love and marriage.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobirou Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u90ce|Nobi Nobir\u014d}} / Chester Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yasuo Muramatsu]] (1980 \u2013 March 2005), [[K\u014dichi Hashimoto]] (November 2006)|[[Keith Silverstein]] (2013)}}\n:: Nobisuke's younger brother and an uncle of Nobita, with whom he is very friendly. He works overseas and only comes home during the Christmas-New Year holiday, which Nobita happily awaits every year since his uncle always gives him (and Doraemon) pocket money and presents on that time. He has a noticeably tanned skin due to his frequent stays in the tropics. In one chapter, he recounts on his many animal encounters, including an elephant which he thought had perished during [[World War II]]. The elephant is actually saved by Nobita and Doraemon due to a case of [[predestination paradox]].\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobie Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u6075|Nobi Nobie}} ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Megumi Hayashibara}}\n:: Nobirou's daughter and Nobita's younger cousin.

Nobita and Doraemon, despite initially deteriorating matters, finally help him to propose to (and be accepted by) the lady.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobiru Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u308b|Nobi Nobiru}} ===\n\n:Voiced by: [[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n:: Nobisuke's father and Nobita's paternal grandfather who died before Nobita's birth. He was very strict and very rude to Nobisuke since he valued physical strength and athleticism which Nobisuke lacked, though after all he loved him very much. He did not apparently favour Nobisuke's artistic prowess, but he really treasured the portrait his son had made of him, and for which Nobisuke got first prize in school. His grandson only saw him when he traveled to the past. Despite being harsh to Nobisuke, he enjoys indulging Nobita when Nobita travels to the past.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobita's Grandmother|\u306e\u3073\u592a\u306e\u7956\u6bcd|Nobita no Sobo}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|Unknown (1973), Akiko Takamura (2000)}}\n:: Nobisuke's mother and Nobita's paternal grandmother who is only referred to as {{nihongo|Grandma|\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093|Ob\u0101chan}} by Nobita. She died when Nobita was in kindergarten before the main storyline. She is always seen as a kind woman, if a bit eccentric, and unlike her husband never scolded Nobisuke for his lack of interest in \"masculine activities\", such as getting in a fight. Nobita remembers her very fondly, with most of his better childhood memories being playing with her; many of his toys, including his old [[kendama]], which becomes a plot point in [[Doraemon: Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey|one film]], were given to him by his grandmother. When Nobita travels to the past, she always recognizes him as her grandson even if he has grown up. She appeared in a few episodes. She takes care of Nobita on his former days and in one of '''The Doraemons''' manga, she was proud to see Nobita grown up into a teenage boy.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Sewashi|\u30bb\u30ef\u30b7|Sewashi}} / Soby Nobi ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Seiko Minamoto]] (1973), Shikoku Ta (1980~March 2005), [[Saki Satsuma]] (August 2005)|[[Max Mittelman]] (2014)}}\n:: Nobita's great-great-grandson, he is the one who sends Doraemon back to the past to look after Nobita. Sewashi first bought Doraemon in 2112 when Doraemon still had ears and his original factory paint. He sent him because his pocket money was not much due to the debts the family inherited from Nobita, and he also wanted to help out his troubled great-grandfather. He seems to have more common sense and is smarter than Nobita, but is just as reluctant when it comes to studying. Sewashi is also the owner of Doraemon's sister, Dorami.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Nobisuke Nobi|\u91ce\u6bd4\u30ce\u30d3\u30b9\u30b1|Nobi Nobisuke}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|[[Noriko Ohara]] (1979~March 2005), [[Yoshiko Kamei]] (April 2005~)}}\n:: Nobita and Shizuka's son, named after Nobita's father. Though being as stupid as his father, he is a strong child and a good athlete, and brave enough to bully Gian and Suneo's sons. The first time he met the present Nobita, he even beat up Nobita because he regarded him as an imposter. His real name is Nobita Nobi, Jr., but his parents often call him ''Nobisuke'' due to his grandfather's name.\n\n==Minamoto family==\n\n=== {{nihongo|Mrs. Minamoto|\u9759\u9999\u306e\u6bcd|Minamato no Haha}} ===\n\n:{{voiced by|Unknown (1973), [[Keiko Yokozawa]] (1979~1981), Masako Matsubara (August 1981~March 2005), [[Ai Orikasa]] (April 2005~)|[[Wendee Lee]] (2015)}}\n:: Shizuka's mother.

His best-known appearance in the series is when Nobita and Doraemon eavesdrop on him talking to Shizuka the night before Nobita and her wedding, in which he trusts that Nobita will be able to take care of Shizuka. So he accepts Nobita as his daughter's spouse.

She loves Suneo very much and spoils him rotten. She is generous to Suneo's friends, but just like her son, she likes to show off her jewellery or branded handbags and sometimes makes Nobita's mother jealous. In the episode \"Mother Vs. Rich Mother Battle,\" she became Tamako's rival after eating the Rival-Making steak and competes Tamako of who makes the tastiest [[curry]]. In the 30 years special, she is seen as just as odd, and mischievous as her son. When she is introduced in the \"Saobody\" special, she is seen as someone who is very sexually active, and enticed. She has a thriving relationship with Suneo's father. She strives to be a spoiling, enticing grandmother to young Nala. When Nala is outside with her, she often laughs throwing her head back. She then smiles a cunning smile, calling Nala her \"best friend\", much like her son.

In the 1973 anime, Mrs. Goda was dead. In later anime projects, she is alive. Gian always tries to flee from her when she orders him to help in the matters of the store or do deliveries. Though being as strong as her son, she is a righteous person as she punishes her son whenever he bullies children as she doesn't want to let Gian hurt other children. Her harsh treatment towards Gian is driven by her love, and Gian too, though sometimes speaking ill of her, cares for his mother deeply. This is evident from the way Gian had painstakingly made a rice-cake, actually a gadget from Doraemon, which had healed his mother's health problem, despite being constantly mocked and annoyed during the process by Nobita and Suneo. Had he lost focus, the gadget would have lost effectiveness, but his love for his mother prevented him from losing concentration.\n\n=== {{nihongo|Sasuke Goda|\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u306e\u7236|Jaian no Chichi}} ===\n\n:{{Voiced by|Unknown (1973), Masayuki Kat\u014d (1979~1980), [[Yu Shimaka]] (1987), [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] (November 1987), Y\u016b Shimaka (1993)|[[Kirk Thornton]] (2014)}}\n:: He mostly works outside to help his wife's store. Though being the parent who is the least recurring in Fujiko's story, he is known to be the strongest man in the town that he lives in.

In earlier stories, she had bad tempers when something did not go as she pleases, though she mellows down in later stories. Had Doraemon not intervened, she would have been Nobita's wife in the future which is why her first appearance is earlier than Suneo and Gian in the series. However, Doraemon succeeds on his mission and Nobita eventually marries Shizuka. Her name ''Jaiko'' is usually considered a nickname in the same vein as her brother; her given name is never revealed in the series.\n\nAs an aspiring [[Mangaka|manga artist]], Jaiko goes by her pen name {{nihongo|'''Christine''' Goda|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30cd \u525b\u7530|Kurisuch\u012bne G\u014dda}}, and sometimes submits her manga to publishing companies for prizes. She usually fails because her storytelling is still rough, although she has received much attention from editors. Sometimes when she almost decides to give up writing comic books after failing to get good ideas, Gian and his friends, after being requested and sometimes forced, cheer her up. Unlike Gian, she is kind, polite and good at studies. She and Moteo Mote are good friends.

Muku tries to be as brave as Gian, who praises his strength and courage, but in many emergencies he just runs away and enrages Gian.

He is very intelligent and has a photographic memory. Dekisugi is the perfect all-round student, consistently getting 100s in class (A+'s in English Dub) and also being highly capable in sports. His family is apparently wealthy, owning a house that is so large that one can lose one's way. His name literally means \"brilliant over-achiever\", and his last name is a pun on ''dekisugiru'' (\u51fa\u6765\u904e\u304e\u308b), which means \"over achieving\". Shizuka sometimes prefers the company of Dekisugi, who is more of her intellectual equal. Nobita often feels jealous and concocts bizarre schemes (helped by Doraemon's gadgets) to keep them apart or to win Shizuka's attention. However, Dekisugi never gets angry at Nobita and even willingly helps Nobita whenever he has philosophical or scientific questions. Dekisugi is polite, respectful, and will never argue with or fault anyone even in the most ridiculous of situations \u2013 instead he will always say something positive to lighten the mood.\n\nIn the future, it is shown that in spite of Shizuka's friendship with Dekisugi, she still marries Nobita while Dekisugi himself is wed to another woman.

He sometimes tries to encourage Nobita through kindness to study and get good marks, and sometimes resorts to punishments that range from making Nobita stand in the hallway or clean the classroom alone after school. While Teacher is impressed by Dekisugi's progress and occasionally scolds Gian, Suneo tends to fool Teacher with conning lies or superstitions. Teacher often pays unexpected visits to the Nobi's in order to inform Tamako Nobi about Nobita's recent exam results and his academic position. Nobita's feelings towards him are varied ranging from fear to respect and admiration depending on the situation.\n\nTeacher's real name is unknown.

The children always try not to anger Kaminari and play carefully. Recovering the ball without getting shouted at is difficult.

Both [[quest]]s begin in [[The Shire]], travel east through the wilds of Eriador to [[Rivendell]] and then across the [[Misty Mountains]], involve further travels in the lands of [[Rhovanion]] or Wilderland to the east of those mountains, and return home to The Shire. \n\n===Eriador===\n\nIn the northwest of Middle-earth, Eriador was the region between the sea and the Misty Mountains; near the sea were the Ered Luin (also called Ered Lindon or Blue Mountains). In the Second Age, the northern kingdom of Arnor occupied much of the region. After its collapse, much of Eriador became wild.\n\n===Misty Mountains===\n\nThe Misty Mountains were thrown up by the Dark Lord [[Melkor]] in the [[First Age]] to impede Orom\u00eb, one of the [[Valar]] who often rode across Middle-earth hunting.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ch. 3 \"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\"</ref> The [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-realm of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] was built in the First Age beneath the midpoint of the mountain range.

On its west bank opposite the southern end of Mirkwood is the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elvish]] land of [[Lothlorien]]. Further south, backing on to the Misty Mountains, lies the forest of [[Fangorn]], home of the tree-giants, the [[ent]]s. In a valley at the southern end of the Misty Mountains is [[Isengard]], home to the [[wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Saruman]]. \n\n===Lands to the south===\n[[File:Gondor sketch map.svg|thumb|upright=2|Sketch map of [[Gondor]] in the Third Age, bordered by [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and [[Mordor]]]]\n\nJust to the south of both Fangorn and Isengard is the wide grassy land of the [[Riders of Rohan]], who provide [[cavalry]] to its southerly neighbour, [[Gondor]]. Gondor's border with Rohan is the Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains, which run east-west from the sea to a point near the River Anduin; at that point is Gondor's capital city, [[Minas Tirith]]. \n\nAcross the river to the east is the land of [[Mordor]]. It is bordered to the north by the Ered Lithui, the Ash Mountains; to the west by the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow. Between those two ranges, at Mordor's northwest tip, are the Black Gates of the [[Morannon]]. In the angle between the two ranges is the volcanic Plateau of Gorgoroth, with the tall volcano of Orodruin or [[Mount Doom]], where the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] forged the [[One Ring]], at its centre. To the mountain's east is Sauron's Dark Tower, [[Barad-dur]]. \n\nTo the south of Gondor and Mordor lies [[Harad]]. North of Mordor lies the Sea of Rhun, home to the Easterlings. North of that lie the Iron Hills of [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot|Dain]]'s [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|dwarves]]; between those and Mirkwood is [[Erebor]], the Lonely Mountain, once home to [[Smaug]] the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], and afterwards to [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]]'s dwarves. \n\nThe lands to the east of Rhun and to the south and east of Harad are not described in the stories.<ref name=\"Magoun South 2013\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Magoun |first=John F.

''Kabuki'' music can be divided into three categories: ''geza'', ''shosa-ongaku'', and ''ki'' and ''tsuke''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ntj.jac.go.jp/unesco/kabuki/en/4/4_05.html|title=Invitation to Kabuki {{!}} Expression by sounds|website=www2.ntj.jac.go.jp|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====''Geza''====\n''Geza'' includes music and sound effects played on stage, behind a black bamboo curtain called a ''kuromisu''. ''Geza'' music can be further subdivided into three types. The first type is ''uta'' or song. ''Uta'' is sung accompanied by a ''shamisen''. Typically there are multiple ''uta'' singers singing together. The second type is called ''aikata''. It involves ''shamisen'' music without any singing. The third type is ''narimono''. ''Narimono'' is played by small percussion instruments<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kusanokokichi.com/narimono |title=Narimono |website=kusanokokichi.com |access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>  besides the ''shamisen''.\n\n====''Shosa-ongaku''====\n''Shosa-ongaku'' encompasses music that is played on the stage and accompanies acting and dancing. ''Shosa-ongaku'' includes the ''Takemoto'', ''[[Nagauta]]'', ''Tokiwazu'' and ''Kiyomoto'' music styles. ''Takemoto'' accompanies acting. ''Nagauta'', ''Tokiwazu'' and ''Kiyomoto'' accompany dancing in ''[[kabuki]]'' (dance drama). ''Takemoto'' basically recites the parts of the play concerning scenery. The actors attempt to synchronize their lines with the rhythm of ''takemoto''\u2014 an effect known as ''ito ni noru'' (get onto strings).\n\n''Naguata'' is one of the most commonly seen forms of ''geza''. It involves singers, called ''utakata'', and ''shamisen'' players, called ''shamisenkata''. The ''utakata'' are seated to the right of the stage dancers, and the ''shamisenkata'' are seated ton the left of the stage. The ''shamisenkata'' use ''hosozao'' (thin neck) ''shamisen'' which produce high pitched tones and are capable of producing delicate melodies.\n\n''Tokiwazu'' consists of reciters called ''tayu'' and ''shamisenkata'' that use ''chuzao'' (medium-neck) ''shamisen''. ''Tokiwazu'' is similar to ''Kiyomoto'' music but is slower-paced and more solemn. ''Tokiwazu'' is also performed onstage.\n\n''Kiyomoto'' also consists of ''tayu'' and ''shamisenkata'' using ''chuzao''. However, in ''kiyomoto'' words and sentences full of emotion are recited in very high-pitched tones.\n\n====''Ki'' and ''Tsuke''====\n''Ki'' and ''tsuke'' describe the distinctive sounds made by striking two square oak boards. When the two boards are struck together, they produce the ''ki'' sound. When they are struck against a hardwood board, they produce the ''tsuke'' sound.\n\n==Court Music (''Gagaku'')==\n{{Main|Gagaku}}\n''[[Gagaku]]'' (\u96c5\u697d) is court music, and is the oldest traditional music in [[Japan]]. It was usually patronized by the [[Emperor of Japan|Imperial Court]] or the shrines and temples. ''Gagaku'' music includes songs, dances, and a mixture of other [[Asian music]]. ''Gagaku'' has two styles; these are instrumental music {{nihongo|''kigaku''|\u5668\u697d}} and vocal music {{nihongo|''seigaku''|\u58f0\u697d}}. Sushi\n\nSince {{lang|ja|\u96c5}} means \"elegance\", ''Gagaku'' literally means elegant music and generally refers to musical instruments and music theory imported into Japan from [[China]] and [[Korea]] from 500\u2013600&nbsp;CE. ''Gagaku'' is divided into two main categories: Old Music and New Music. Old Music refers to music and musical compositions from before the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013906). New Music refers to music and compositions produced during or after Tang, including music brought from various regions of China and Korea.<ref>Randel, Don Michael, ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (2003), [[Belknap Press]]. {{ISBN|0-674-01163-5}}, page 339</ref><ref>The International Shakuhachi Society</ref>\n\nOld and New Music are further divided into the categories {{lang|ja|\u5de6\u697d}} (\"Music of the Left\") and {{lang|ja|\u53f3\u697d}} (\"Music of the Right\").

There are four main ''j\u014druri'' styles. These are centuries-old traditions which continue today:\n*''Gidayubushi'' (\u7fa9\u592a\u592b\u7bc0)\u2014During the [[Edo period]], [[Takemoto Gidayu]] (\u7af9\u672c\u7fa9\u592a\u592b) began to play ''joruri'' in [[Osaka]]. This type of ''j\u014druri'' is for ''[[bunraku]]'', ([[puppet]] plays).\n*''Tokiwazubushi'' (\u5e38\u78d0\u6d25\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Tokiwazu Mojidayu (\u5e38\u78d0\u6d25\u6587\u5b57\u592a\u592b) began to play this style of ''joruri'' in [[Edo]]. This type of ''j\u014druri'' is for kabuki [[dance]]s called ''[[Shosagoto]]''.\n*''Kiyomotobushi'' (\u6e05\u5143\u7bc0)\u2014Kiyomoto Enjyudayu (\u6e05\u5143\u5ef6\u5bff\u592a\u592b) began to play this for ''kabuki'' dances in [[Edo]] (Toko) in 1814 during the late [[Edo period]].  He played ''[[Tomimoto-bushi]]'' style at first. He moved from playing this style to the ''Kiyomotobushi'' style. This style is light, refreshingly unrestrained and chic.\n*''Shinnaibushi'' (\u65b0\u5185\u7bc0)\u2014In the middle of the Edo period, Tsuruga Shinnai (\u9db4\u8cc0\u65b0\u5185) began to play this for ''kabuki''. This style of ''j\u014druri ''is typically lively and upbeat.\n\nThere are other four ''j\u014druri'' styles which have largely died out. ''Kat\u014dbushi'', ''Icchuubushi'' and ''Miyazonobushi'' are old style. These styles are referred to as ''Kokyoku'' (\u53e4\u66f2) or old music. ''Kokyoku'' also included ''Ogiebushi''(\u837b\u6c5f\u7bc0). It is not ''j\u014druri'' but is like ''Nagauta''.\n\n*''Kat\u014dbushi'' (\u6cb3\u6771\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Masumi Kat\u014d (\u5341\u5bf8\u898b\u6cb3\u6771) (1684\u20131725) began to play in an original style in 1717. It is heavy.\n*''Icchuubushi'' or ''Itchubushi'' (\u4e00\u4e2d\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Miyako Icchuu (\u90fd\u4e00\u4e2d) or Miyakodayuu Icchuu (\u90fd\u592a\u592b\u4e00\u4e2d)(1650\u20131724) began to play this style.\n*''Miyazonobushi'' (\u5bae\u8597\u7bc0) or ''Sonohachibushi'' (\u8597\u516b\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Miyakoji Sonohachi (\u5bae\u53e4\u8def\u8597\u516b) began to play this style in [[Kyoto]]. ''Miyazonobushi'' is a modest style.\n*''Tomimotobushi'' (\u5bcc\u672c\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Tomimoto Buzennoj\u014d (\u5bcc\u672c\u8c4a\u524d\u63be) (1716\u20131764) began to play this style. He played the ''Tokiwazubushi'' style at first and then changed to play ''Tomimotobushi'' style.\n\n===Nagauta===\n''[[Nagauta]]'' (\u9577\u5504) is music using the ''shamisen''. There are three styles of ''nagauta'': one for ''kabuki'' dance, one for ''kabuki'' plays (dialogue), and one for music unconnected with ''kabuki''.\n\n''Ogiebushi'' (\u837b\u6c5f\u7bc0) is similar to ''nagauta''. Ogie Royuu I (\u837b\u6c5f\u9732\u53cb) (?-1787) began to play this style, having first played ''nagauta'' style. He moved from playing this style to play ''Ogiebushi'' style. His rival was Fujita Kichiji(\u5bcc\u58eb\u7530\u5409\u6cbb) who was a ''Nagauta'' singer in Edo. Ogie Royuu I had a beautiful but small voice. In a theater a voice with volume was important, So Ogie Royuu I stopped singing in the theater. <!--Another theory says that Ogie Royuu I(?-1787) lost. Fujita Kichiji won. So, Ogie Royuu I(?-1787) stopped to sing in theater. meaningless---> Ogie Royuu I began to play in the ''[[Yoshiwara]]'' (red-light district). ''Ogiebushi'' declined after 1818. Tamaya Yamazaburou (\u7389\u5c4b\u5c71\u4e09\u90ce) composed new ''Ogiebushi'' pieces at the end of the Edo Period. Yamazaburou was an owner of a parlor house in the red-light district of Yoshiwara. Yamazaburou knew music very well. Tamaya Yamazaburou's pieces are influenced by ''[[Jiuta]]'' (\u5730\u6b4c) music. Iijima Kizaemon (\u98ef\u5cf6\u559c\u5de6\u885b\u9580) re-established ''Ogiebushi''. Kizaemon changed his name to Ogie Royuu IV in 1876 or 1879. (It is not known if there was an Ogie Royuu II or Ogie Royuu III.) ''Ogiebushi'' is classified as a ''Kokyoku'' (\u53e4\u66f2) (\"old music\"). (''Kyoku'' usually means a musical piece or musical number in modern Japanese. \"music\" is old sense.) Now ''Kokyoku'' is ''Katohbushi''(\u6cb3\u6771\u7bc0), ''Icchuubushi''(\u4e00\u4e2d\u7bc0), ''Miyazonobushi''(\u5bae\u8597\u7bc0) and ''Ogiebushi''(\u837b\u6c5f\u7bc0).\n''Kokyoku'' is old music from the Edo period. Not many players perform ''Kokyoku'' and those who do are elderly; there are few young musicians playing this music. <!--New music is Nagauta, Gidayuubushi, Tokiwazubushi, Kiyomotobushi, Shinnaibushi etc... in Edo Period). Kokyoku is an expedient name. Kokyoku was named by Machida Kashou(\u753a\u7530\u4f73\u8072[[Help:Japanese|<sup>'''?'''</sup>]]) in 1919. Machida Kashou(1888\u20131981) was a Japanese music researcher and composer. Exactly, Ogiebushi is newer than Nagauta. But Ogiebushi is classified as Kokyoku. Kokyoku is an expedient name. After 1919 the word Kokyoku has been used in Japan. The word Kokyoku had popular usage in the Taisho Period. In 1962 Kokyokukai(\u53e4\u66f2\u4f1a[[Help:Japanese|<sup>'''?'''</sup>]], Old music group) was established.\nKokyokukai has trained the successor. Kokyokukai has held the concert. In modern Japanese, \"hurui ongaku\" refers to old music. Kokyoku is idiom. (makes no sense - needs work--->\n\n===''Shakuhachi'' music===\n''[[Shakuhachi]]'' (\u5c3a\u516b) music began in the Edo period.

Sometimes the ''shakuhachi'' is played along with other instruments.\n\n===''S\u014dkyoku''===\n''[[S\u014dkyoku]]'' (\u7b5d\u66f2) uses the Chinese ''koto'' (''[[guzheng]]''), which differs from the Japanese ''[[koto (musical instrument)|koto]]'' (\u7434).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Soukyoku/ |title=Soukyoku |website=rateyourmusic.com |access-date=June 23, 2019}}</ref> There are two families of ''s\u014dkyoku''.\n*''Ikuta ryu''\u2014Originated in Eastern Japan.

''Shosa-ongaku'' includes the ''Takemoto'', ''[[Nagauta]]'', ''Tokiwazu'' and ''Kiyomoto'' music styles. ''Takemoto'' accompanies acting. ''Nagauta'', ''Tokiwazu'' and ''Kiyomoto'' accompany dancing in ''[[kabuki]]'' (dance drama). ''Takemoto'' basically recites the parts of the play concerning scenery. The actors attempt to synchronize their lines with the rhythm of ''takemoto''\u2014 an effect known as ''ito ni noru'' (get onto strings).\n\n''Naguata'' is one of the most commonly seen forms of ''geza''. It involves singers, called ''utakata'', and ''shamisen'' players, called ''shamisenkata''. The ''utakata'' are seated to the right of the stage dancers, and the ''shamisenkata'' are seated ton the left of the stage. The ''shamisenkata'' use ''hosozao'' (thin neck) ''shamisen'' which produce high pitched tones and are capable of producing delicate melodies.\n\n''Tokiwazu'' consists of reciters called ''tayu'' and ''shamisenkata'' that use ''chuzao'' (medium-neck) ''shamisen''. ''Tokiwazu'' is similar to ''Kiyomoto'' music but is slower-paced and more solemn. ''Tokiwazu'' is also performed onstage.\n\n''Kiyomoto'' also consists of ''tayu'' and ''shamisenkata'' using ''chuzao''. However, in ''kiyomoto'' words and sentences full of emotion are recited in very high-pitched tones.\n\n====''Ki'' and ''Tsuke''====\n''Ki'' and ''tsuke'' describe the distinctive sounds made by striking two square oak boards. When the two boards are struck together, they produce the ''ki'' sound. When they are struck against a hardwood board, they produce the ''tsuke'' sound.\n\n==Court Music (''Gagaku'')==\n{{Main|Gagaku}}\n''[[Gagaku]]'' (\u96c5\u697d) is court music, and is the oldest traditional music in [[Japan]]. It was usually patronized by the [[Emperor of Japan|Imperial Court]] or the shrines and temples. ''Gagaku'' music includes songs, dances, and a mixture of other [[Asian music]]. ''Gagaku'' has two styles; these are instrumental music {{nihongo|''kigaku''|\u5668\u697d}} and vocal music {{nihongo|''seigaku''|\u58f0\u697d}}.\n\nSince {{lang|ja|\u96c5}} means \"elegance\", ''Gagaku'' literally means elegant music and generally refers to musical instruments and music theory imported into Japan from [[China]] and [[Korea]] from 500\u2013600&nbsp;CE. ''Gagaku'' is divided into two main categories: Old Music and New Music. Old Music refers to music and musical compositions from before the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013906). New Music refers to music and compositions produced during or after Tang, including music brought from various regions of China and Korea.<ref>Randel, Don Michael, ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (2003), [[Belknap Press]]. {{ISBN|0-674-01163-5}}, page 339</ref><ref>The International Shakuhachi Society</ref>\n\nOld and New Music are further divided into the categories {{lang|ja|\u5de6\u697d}} (\"Music of the Left\") and {{lang|ja|\u53f3\u697d}} (\"Music of the Right\"). Music of the left {{lang|ja|\u5de6\u697d}} is composed of {{lang|ja|\u5510\u697d}} (music from ''Tang'') and {{lang|ja|\u6797\u9091\u697d}} (music from [[Indochina|Indo-China]]).

There are four main ''j\u014druri'' styles. These are centuries-old traditions which continue today:\n*''Gidayubushi'' (\u7fa9\u592a\u592b\u7bc0)\u2014During the [[Edo period]], [[Takemoto Gidayu]] (\u7af9\u672c\u7fa9\u592a\u592b) began to play ''joruri'' in [[Osaka]]. This type of ''j\u014druri'' is for ''[[bunraku]]'', ([[puppet]] plays).\n*''Tokiwazubushi'' (\u5e38\u78d0\u6d25\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Tokiwazu Mojidayu (\u5e38\u78d0\u6d25\u6587\u5b57\u592a\u592b) began to play this style of ''joruri'' in [[Edo]]. This type of ''j\u014druri'' is for kabuki [[dance]]s called ''[[Shosagoto]]''.\n*''Kiyomotobushi'' (\u6e05\u5143\u7bc0)\u2014Kiyomoto Enjyudayu (\u6e05\u5143\u5ef6\u5bff\u592a\u592b) began to play this for ''kabuki'' dances in [[Edo]] (Toko) in 1814 during the late [[Edo period]].  He played ''[[Tomimoto-bushi]]'' style at first. He moved from playing this style to the ''Kiyomotobushi'' style. This style is light, refreshingly unrestrained and chic.\n*''Shinnaibushi'' (\u65b0\u5185\u7bc0)\u2014In the middle of the Edo period, Tsuruga Shinnai (\u9db4\u8cc0\u65b0\u5185) began to play this for ''kabuki''. This style of ''j\u014druri ''is typically lively and upbeat.\n\nThere are other four ''j\u014druri'' styles which have largely died out. ''Kat\u014dbushi'', ''Icchuubushi'' and ''Miyazonobushi'' are old style. These styles are referred to as ''Kokyoku'' (\u53e4\u66f2) or old music. ''Kokyoku'' also included ''Ogiebushi''(\u837b\u6c5f\u7bc0). It is not ''j\u014druri'' but is like ''Nagauta''.\n\n*''Kat\u014dbushi'' (\u6cb3\u6771\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Masumi Kat\u014d (\u5341\u5bf8\u898b\u6cb3\u6771) (1684\u20131725) began to play in an original style in 1717. It is heavy.\n*''Icchuubushi'' or ''Itchubushi'' (\u4e00\u4e2d\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Miyako Icchuu (\u90fd\u4e00\u4e2d) or Miyakodayuu Icchuu (\u90fd\u592a\u592b\u4e00\u4e2d)(1650\u20131724) began to play this style.\n*''Miyazonobushi'' (\u5bae\u8597\u7bc0) or ''Sonohachibushi'' (\u8597\u516b\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Miyakoji Sonohachi (\u5bae\u53e4\u8def\u8597\u516b) began to play this style in [[Kyoto]]. ''Miyazonobushi'' is a modest style.\n*''Tomimotobushi'' (\u5bcc\u672c\u7bc0)\u2014During the Edo period, Tomimoto Buzennoj\u014d (\u5bcc\u672c\u8c4a\u524d\u63be) (1716\u20131764) began to play this style. He played the ''Tokiwazubushi'' style at first and then changed to play ''Tomimotobushi'' style.\n\n===Nagauta===\n''[[Nagauta]]'' (\u9577\u5504) is music using the ''shamisen''. There are three styles of ''nagauta'': one for ''kabuki'' dance, one for ''kabuki'' plays (dialogue), and one for music unconnected with ''kabuki''.\n\n''Ogiebushi'' (\u837b\u6c5f\u7bc0) is similar to ''nagauta''. Ogie Royuu I (\u837b\u6c5f\u9732\u53cb) (?-1787) began to play this style, having first played ''nagauta'' style. He moved from playing this style to play ''Ogiebushi'' style. His rival was Fujita Kichiji(\u5bcc\u58eb\u7530\u5409\u6cbb) who was a ''Nagauta'' singer in Edo. Ogie Royuu I had a beautiful but small voice. In a theater a voice with volume was important, So Ogie Royuu I stopped singing in the theater. <!--Another theory says that Ogie Royuu I(?-1787) lost. Fujita Kichiji won. So, Ogie Royuu I(?-1787) stopped to sing in theater. meaningless---> Ogie Royuu I began to play in the ''[[Yoshiwara]]'' (red-light district). ''Ogiebushi'' declined after 1818. Tamaya Yamazaburou (\u7389\u5c4b\u5c71\u4e09\u90ce) composed new ''Ogiebushi'' pieces at the end of the Edo Period. Yamazaburou was an owner of a parlor house in the red-light district of Yoshiwara. Yamazaburou knew music very well. Tamaya Yamazaburou's pieces are influenced by ''[[Jiuta]]'' (\u5730\u6b4c) music. Iijima Kizaemon (\u98ef\u5cf6\u559c\u5de6\u885b\u9580) re-established ''Ogiebushi''. Kizaemon changed his name to Ogie Royuu IV in 1876 or 1879. (It is not known if there was an Ogie Royuu II or Ogie Royuu III.) ''Ogiebushi'' is classified as a ''Kokyoku'' (\u53e4\u66f2) (\"old music\"). (''Kyoku'' usually means a musical piece or musical number in modern Japanese. \"music\" is old sense.) Now ''Kokyoku'' is ''Katohbushi''(\u6cb3\u6771\u7bc0), ''Icchuubushi''(\u4e00\u4e2d\u7bc0), ''Miyazonobushi''(\u5bae\u8597\u7bc0) and ''Ogiebushi''(\u837b\u6c5f\u7bc0).\n''Kokyoku'' is old music from the Edo period. Not many players perform ''Kokyoku'' and those who do are elderly; there are few young musicians playing this music. <!--New music is Nagauta, Gidayuubushi, Tokiwazubushi, Kiyomotobushi, Shinnaibushi etc... in Edo Period). Kokyoku is an expedient name. Kokyoku was named by Machida Kashou(\u753a\u7530\u4f73\u8072[[Help:Japanese|<sup>'''?'''</sup>]]) in 1919. Machida Kashou(1888\u20131981) was a Japanese music researcher and composer. Exactly, Ogiebushi is newer than Nagauta. But Ogiebushi is classified as Kokyoku. Kokyoku is an expedient name. After 1919 the word Kokyoku has been used in Japan. The word Kokyoku had popular usage in the Taisho Period. In 1962 Kokyokukai(\u53e4\u66f2\u4f1a[[Help:Japanese|<sup>'''?'''</sup>]], Old music group) was established.\nKokyokukai has trained the successor. Kokyokukai has held the concert. In modern Japanese, \"hurui ongaku\" refers to old music. Kokyoku is idiom. (makes no sense - needs work--->\n\n===''Shakuhachi'' music===\n''[[Shakuhachi]]'' (\u5c3a\u516b) music began in the Edo period. Buddhist monks played the ''shakuhachi'' as a substitute for a ''sutra''. Sometimes the ''shakuhachi'' is played along with other instruments.\n\n===''S\u014dkyoku''===\n''[[S\u014dkyoku]]'' (\u7b5d\u66f2) uses the Chinese ''koto'' (''[[guzheng]]''), which differs from the Japanese ''[[koto (musical instrument)|koto]]'' (\u7434).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Soukyoku/ |title=Soukyoku |website=rateyourmusic.com |access-date=June 23, 2019}}</ref> There are two families of ''s\u014dkyoku''.\n*''Ikuta ryu''\u2014Originated in Eastern Japan.

This condition was associated with low reproductive rates. He provided evidence to suggest that chlamydial disease may be affecting population dynamics of wild koala colonies. As a result of his studies he became convinced that chlamydial disease was a major threat to the species, given the widespread occurrence of the organism. This conviction led him to seek support for the establishment of a body which could fund research into the koala and its problems.\n\nIn 1985, when Barry Scott was asked to manage the Oasis Tourist Gardens, he met Steve Brown who was acting as the honorary veterinary consultant to a colony of disease free koalas that lived there. Steve was a passionate advocate for the koala and he inspired Barry who suggested that a Foundation for the koala be formed. Together they began to gather friends and supporters around them to form an organisation to help cure koala diseases and save their declining numbers.\n\nA constitution was drawn up and on 17 January 1986 a Certificate of Incorporation (no. 1262) was issued in the name of the Australian Koala Association Inc. This name was changed on 3 October 1986 to the Australian Koala Foundation Inc. Later the word Inc. was dropped.\n\nIn those early days, Barry Scott travelled from Brisbane to Perth, Adelaide and Sydney, setting up branches and bringing people together who would form the basic structure of the AKF's honorary support.\n\nInitially the focus of the '''Australian Koala Foundation''' was to 'raise $5 million to save the koala'. At the beginning the general consensus was that the disease commonly known as [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] was the major threat to koalas and that it needed to be cured so the population could be saved. It didn\u2019t take long, however, to realise that [[habitat destruction]] was and is the main cause of the koala\u2019s problems. The direction of the AKF moved towards addressing the loss of habitat and reversing it.\n\nDeborah Tabart OAM has been leading the Australian Koala Foundation as CEO since 1988 and is recognised around the world as an advocate for koalas, or simply as ''''the Koala Woman'''<nowiki/>'.\n\nToday, the AKF uses science, politics, and a global support base to rally for change at the legislative, developmental, and personal level.\n\n==Slogan campaign==\n\"No Tree No Me\" is the slogan for the AKF. It was coined by the AKF\u2019s creative supporter, Dick Marks, in 1994 and has become an appropriate slogan for the foundation as they focus on the fight for [[habitat conservation]] of the koala. This slogan is known in households all around Australia, and has been printed on apparel and stickers on the popular worldwide online retailer Redbubble.\n\n== Conservation and research ==\nThe AKF has mapped over four million hectares of land for their Koala Habitat Atlas (see below). The AKF believes that captive breeding programs for koalas are not a solution for the conservation of wild koala populations. Instead, conservation relies on the integrity of wild populations, their genetic diversity, and retention of habitat. As a result, many of the AKF projects focus on conservation of the koala habitat as described below.\n\n==Projects==\nThe AKF has several ongoing projects dedicated to saving the wild koala through conserving its habitat and raising funds to enable the AKF to continue running despite its non-profit status. These include:\n\n# '''Koala Beach''': This housing estate in northern New South Wales was the result of collaboration between The Ray Group of developers and the AKF. It is the first property to be master planned and designed with the protection of the environment as its priority, with the community making conscious compromises to its lifestyle so that it can co-exist with wild koalas. With the focus of the environment in mind, Koala Beach was developed from an old dairy farm where land had already been cleared. In addition to protecting koalas, this beach has also benefited at least 25 other vulnerable species such as the Bush Thick Knee, a local endangered bird. Fueled by volunteers, Koala Beach has also helped instill a sense of community and stewardship for the land in New South Wales, giving the people a strong close knit community. Koala Beach has brought economic growth to the area as well. More people are moving to the area located near the beach, and Queensland University is engaging in technological growth by developing a system to view koalas from a home.\n# '''Koala Habitat Atlas''':<ref>{{Cite web|title = Koala Habitat Atlas {{!}} Australian Koala Foundation|url = https://www.savethekoala.com/our-work/koala-habitat-atlas|website = www.savethekoala.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref> This project involves the mapping, identifying, and quantifying of koala habitat throughout the koala's geographic range in eastern Australia. It aims to identify which trees are preferentially used by koalas, and to identify and rank koala habitat based on primary and secondary habitat categorization. The growing database has been designed to assist land-use planners by providing information on the occurrence and relative importance of suitable koala habitat so that informed and effective decisions on koala habitat conservation and management can be made. This ongoing project was awarded a Computerworld Smithsonian Award Medal for Innovative Use of Technology in Washington, DC in April 1998. \n# '''Koala Protection Act''': Presently, the AKF's primary focus is the Koala Protection Act.<ref name=\":0\" /> Current legislation solely focuses on the koalas, not their habitats.<ref>{{Cite web|url =https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/N/NatureConKP06.pdf|title =Nature Conservation (Koala) Conservation Plan 2006|accessdate =1 February 2018|website =Queensland Government|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170330212255/http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/N/NatureConKP06.pdf|archivedate =30 March 2017|url-status =live|df =dmy-all}}</ref> It is insufficient in providing the level of protection koalas need.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ballarat koalas under threat despite protection overlay|url = http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/06/05/3775383.htm|website = www.abc.net.au|accessdate = 2015-10-21|language = en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Koala populations at Gunnedah under threat from coal project|url = http://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/news/koala-populations-at-gunnedah-under-threat-from-co/2300048/|website = Clarence Valley Daily Examiner|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/koalas-caught-in-qld-development-plan/story-fn3dxiwe-1227039004411|title = The Australian|date = 27 August 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Johnson|first = Stephen}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Noosa koalas on the brink of extinction|url = http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/noosa-koalas-on-the-brink-of-extinction/2574428/#/0|website = Sunshine Coast Daily|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref> Because it is known that almost all koala problems are caused by the loss of the koala habitat, the Koala Protection Act will thus focus on protecting trees and pushing the Australian government to treat koalas with respect as Australia\u2019s national treasures, deserving of protection and long-term survival.

There are 128 Federally elected representatives in Koala habitat of Australia, and the AKF is asking these politicians to support a Koala Protection Act. According to CEO Tabart, \u201cThe most sickening thing about existing legislation is the fact that industries are given a permit \u2018to take\u2019 which is a nicer word for \u2018kill\u2019<ref>{{}Cite web|title=Australian Koala Foundation calls on the new Prime Minister to\nprotect the Koala. {{!}} Austrailia Koala Foundation|url = https://www.elespectador.com/sites/default/files/pdf-file/fundacion_australiana_del_koala.pdf|accessdate=2020=19-04}}</ref>.

The property was named in honour of the couple, Peter and Julanne Quinlan, who bequeathed it to the AKF. Deborah (AKF CEO) took on the ambitious task of establishing Quinlan\u2019s as a one-off bushland showplace asset that embodies the AKF values. A spokeswoman said the Quinlans' property would provide \"great opportunities as a research station and for regenerating for koala habitat.\" As a result, the site is to be used for research on [[climate change]], habitat restoration, and in time it is hoped that Koala will come to use the area as a refuge. Due to the nature of the deaths, the will and donation of the estate has been disputed but Tabart is hopeful AKF will be able to keep the property. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Families contest $1m legacy to koalas {{!}} Sunshine Coast Daily| url = https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/families-contest-1m-legacy-koalas/348996/|accessdate = 2020-19-4}}</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\nThe AKF is the world's largest funding body of koala research.

They release the National Kola Tree Planting List which is comprised from the AKF\u2019s extensive database (includes over 100,000 trees from 2000 sites), published research, and collaboration from several independent Koala researchers, the list covers everywhere that Koalas live and takes into account 273 local government areas across 4 states. They have identified the best conditions for Koalas to live in and ensure that donated trees are planted in those areas.\n\nThe Australian Koala foundation has also created a Koala-friendly housing development with the goal of allowing people in the community to co-exist with wild Koalas in a proper manner. They partnered with The Ray Group to create this sight on the northern New South Wales coast. This site is home to 500 residential homes along with Koala\u2019s and other endangered species. Since its beginning in 1994, the Koala Beach Housing Development has seen great success.\n\nThe foundation is also very strong with updating the public on Koala\u2019s and their habitats as it has countless research projects posted on its website to inform and educate people. The foundation gives people the resources to help in interesting ways such as adopting your own Koala or purchasing Koala merchandise to raise money.\n\n==Save the Koala Month==\n[[File:SavetheKoalaMonth.jpg|thumb|September is Save the Koala Month.]]\nSeptember is Save the Koala Month.

Many of these trees are being cleared each year. The primary focus of the AKF is getting new legislation in place to protect Koala trees.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Koala Protection Act {{!}} Australian Koala Foundation|url = https://www.savethekoala.com/our-work/koala-protection-act|website = www.savethekoala.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref> The organisation receives no form of government funding by choice, because this leaves the AKF to speak freely for Koalas without the constraints of government. Therefore, the AKF relies on donations, sponsorship, and fundraising to finance its ongoing work. AKF research indicates that somewhere between 47,860 and 85,695 koalas remain in the wild.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bob's Map {{!}} Australian Koala Foundation|url = https://www.savethekoala.com/sites/savethekoala.com/files/uploads/Bobs%20Map%202018%20A0%2020180131%281%29.jpg|website = www.savethekoala.com|accessdate = 2019-05-02}}</ref> Local extinctions are occurring regularly, and AKF believes that the only way to protect and regenerate populations into the future is with a Koala Protection Act.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:FrankieakaLogan.jpg|thumb|Protecting habitat and managing koala populations are the goals of the foundation.]]\nDuring the mid-1980s, Steve Brown, a veterinary graduate who had developed a special interest in koalas, was pursuing Ph.D studies at the University of Queensland, focusing on a not uncommon pathological condition in koalas, cystic ovaries. This condition was associated with low reproductive rates. He provided evidence to suggest that chlamydial disease may be affecting population dynamics of wild koala colonies. As a result of his studies he became convinced that chlamydial disease was a major threat to the species, given the widespread occurrence of the organism. This conviction led him to seek support for the establishment of a body which could fund research into the koala and its problems.\n\nIn 1985, when Barry Scott was asked to manage the Oasis Tourist Gardens, he met Steve Brown who was acting as the honorary veterinary consultant to a colony of disease free koalas that lived there. Steve was a passionate advocate for the koala and he inspired Barry who suggested that a Foundation for the koala be formed. Together they began to gather friends and supporters around them to form an organisation to help cure koala diseases and save their declining numbers.\n\nA constitution was drawn up and on 17 January 1986 a Certificate of Incorporation (no. 1262) was issued in the name of the Australian Koala Association Inc. This name was changed on 3 October 1986 to the Australian Koala Foundation Inc. Later the word Inc. was dropped.\n\nIn those early days, Barry Scott travelled from Brisbane to Perth, Adelaide and Sydney, setting up branches and bringing people together who would form the basic structure of the AKF's honorary support.\n\nInitially the focus of the '''Australian Koala Foundation''' was to 'raise $5 million to save the koala'. At the beginning the general consensus was that the disease commonly known as [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] was the major threat to koalas and that it needed to be cured so the population could be saved. It didn\u2019t take long, however, to realise that [[habitat destruction]] was and is the main cause of the koala\u2019s problems. The direction of the AKF moved towards addressing the loss of habitat and reversing it.\n\nDeborah Tabart OAM has been leading the Australian Koala Foundation as CEO since 1988 and is recognised around the world as an advocate for koalas, or simply as ''''the Koala Woman'''<nowiki/>'.\n\nToday, the AKF uses science, politics, and a global support base to rally for change at the legislative, developmental, and personal level.\n\n==Slogan campaign==\n\"No Tree No Me\" is the slogan for the AKF. It was coined by the AKF\u2019s creative supporter, Dick Marks, in 1994 and has become an appropriate slogan for the foundation as they focus on the fight for [[habitat conservation]] of the koala. This slogan is known in households all around Australia, and has been printed on apparel and stickers on the popular worldwide online retailer Redbubble.\n\n== Conservation and research ==\nThe AKF has mapped over four million hectares of land for their Koala Habitat Atlas (see below). The AKF believes that captive breeding programs for koalas are not a solution for the conservation of wild koala populations. Instead, conservation relies on the integrity of wild populations, their genetic diversity, and retention of habitat. As a result, many of the AKF projects focus on conservation of the koala habitat as described below.\n\n==Projects==\nThe AKF has several ongoing projects dedicated to saving the wild koala through conserving its habitat and raising funds to enable the AKF to continue running despite its non-profit status. These include:\n\n# '''Koala Beach''': This housing estate in northern New South Wales was the result of collaboration between The Ray Group of developers and the AKF. It is the first property to be master planned and designed with the protection of the environment as its priority, with the community making conscious compromises to its lifestyle so that it can co-exist with wild koalas. With the focus of the environment in mind, Koala Beach was developed from an old dairy farm where land had already been cleared. In addition to protecting koalas, this beach has also benefited at least 25 other vulnerable species such as the Bush Thick Knee, a local endangered bird. Fueled by volunteers, Koala Beach has also helped instill a sense of community and stewardship for the land in New South Wales, giving the people a strong close knit community. Koala Beach has brought economic growth to the area as well. More people are moving to the area located near the beach, and Queensland University is engaging in technological growth by developing a system to view koalas from a home.\n# '''Koala Habitat Atlas''':<ref>{{Cite web|title = Koala Habitat Atlas {{!}} Australian Koala Foundation|url = https://www.savethekoala.com/our-work/koala-habitat-atlas|website = www.savethekoala.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref> This project involves the mapping, identifying, and quantifying of koala habitat throughout the koala's geographic range in eastern Australia. It aims to identify which trees are preferentially used by koalas, and to identify and rank koala habitat based on primary and secondary habitat categorization. The growing database has been designed to assist land-use planners by providing information on the occurrence and relative importance of suitable koala habitat so that informed and effective decisions on koala habitat conservation and management can be made. This ongoing project was awarded a Computerworld Smithsonian Award Medal for Innovative Use of Technology in Washington, DC in April 1998. \n# '''Koala Protection Act''': Presently, the AKF's primary focus is the Koala Protection Act.<ref name=\":0\" /> Current legislation solely focuses on the koalas, not their habitats.<ref>{{Cite web|url =https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/N/NatureConKP06.pdf|title =Nature Conservation (Koala) Conservation Plan 2006|accessdate =1 February 2018|website =Queensland Government|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170330212255/http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/N/NatureConKP06.pdf|archivedate =30 March 2017|url-status =live|df =dmy-all}}</ref> It is insufficient in providing the level of protection koalas need.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ballarat koalas under threat despite protection overlay|url = http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/06/05/3775383.htm|website = www.abc.net.au|accessdate = 2015-10-21|language = en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Koala populations at Gunnedah under threat from coal project|url = http://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/news/koala-populations-at-gunnedah-under-threat-from-co/2300048/|website = Clarence Valley Daily Examiner|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/koalas-caught-in-qld-development-plan/story-fn3dxiwe-1227039004411|title = The Australian|date = 27 August 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Johnson|first = Stephen}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Noosa koalas on the brink of extinction|url = http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/noosa-koalas-on-the-brink-of-extinction/2574428/#/0|website = Sunshine Coast Daily|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref> Because it is known that almost all koala problems are caused by the loss of the koala habitat, the Koala Protection Act will thus focus on protecting trees and pushing the Australian government to treat koalas with respect as Australia\u2019s national treasures, deserving of protection and long-term survival.

Cosmopolitan Book was sold to [[Farrar & Rinehart]] in 1931.<ref name=\"cosmobook\" /> After two years of leasing them to Eleanor \"Cissy\" Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''), Hearst sold her the ''Washington Times'' and ''Herald'' in 1939; she merged them to form the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. That year he also bought the ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon ''Wisconsin News'' into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the ''Atlanta Georgian'' to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.\n\nHearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/devil-and-mr-hearst/|title=The Devil and Mr. Hearst|last=Frank|first=Dana|date=June 22, 2000|website=The Nation}}</ref>, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers. In Chicago, he combined the morning ''Herald-Examiner'' and the afternoon ''American'' into the ''Herald-American'' in 1939. This followed the 1937 combination of the New York ''Evening Journal'' and the morning ''American'' into the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', the sale of the ''[[Omaha Daily Bee]]'' to the ''[[World-Herald]]''. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media holdings as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold or closed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during [[World War II]]. After the war, however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon to fit television schedules and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the [[DuMont Television Network]]: ''[[I.N.S. Telenews]]'', and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. \n\nThe earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', and ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', supported the company's money-losing afternoon publications such as the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', and the ''[[Chicago American]]''. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s owners, who changed it to the tabloid-size ''Chicago Today'' in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974). In 1960, Hearst also sold the ''[[Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph]]'' to the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' and the ''Detroit Times'' to ''[[The Detroit News]]''. After a lengthy strike it sold the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' to the afternoon ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' in 1962. The same year Hearst's Los Angeles papers \u2013 the morning ''Examiner'' and the afternoon ''Herald-Express'' \u2013 merged to become the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. The [[1962-63 New York City newspaper strike]] left the city with no papers for over three months, with the ''Journal-American'' one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The ''Boston Record'' and the ''Evening American'' merged in 1961 as the ''Record-American'' and in 1964, the ''Baltimore News-Post'' became the ''Baltimore News-American''.\n\nIn 1953 Hearst Magazines bought ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to [[Robert E. Petersen]]. In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' [[United Press]], forming [[United Press International]] as a response to the growth of the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]]. The following year Scripps-Howard's ''San Francisco News'' merged with Hearst's afternoon ''San Francisco Call-Bulletin''. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher [[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864911,00.html|title=The Press: Quiet Deal|date=1959-08-31|work=Time|access-date=2019-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing [[Joint Operating Agreement]]s (JOA's). It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the ''Examiner''. In turn, the ''Examiner'' became an evening publication, absorbing the ''[[The San Francisco Call|News-Call-Bulletin]]''. The following year, the ''Journal-American'' reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and [[Scripps-Howard]]'s ''[[New York World-Telegram|World-Telegram and Sun]]'' to form the ''New York World Journal Tribune'' (recalling the names of the city's mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.\n\nThe 1962 merger of the ''Herald-Express'' and ''Examiner'' in Los Angeles led to the termination of many journalists who began to stage a 10-year strike in 1967. The effects of the strike accelerated the pace of the company's demise, with the ''Herald Examiner'' ceasing publication November 2, 1989.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Last Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Strike| url=https://library.csun.edu/SCA/Peek-in-the-Stacks/Examiner| date=February 3, 2014| website=[[California State University Northridge]] [[Oviatt Library]]| accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Newspaper shifts===\nHearst moved into hardcover publishing by acquiring [[Arbor House]] in 1978 and [[William Morrow and Company]] in 1981.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/16/arts/donald-fine-75-publisher-of-suspenseful-best-sellers.html|title=Donald Fine, 75, Publisher Of Suspenseful Best Sellers|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=1997-08-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Hearst acquires leading book publisher| agency=United Press International| accessdate=28 August 2018| url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/02/13/Hearst-acquires-leading-book-publisher/5505350888400/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the company sold the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Herald American]]'' \u2014the result of the 1972 merger of Hearst's ''Record-American & Advertiser'' with the ''Herald-Traveler'' \u2014 to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/18/Murdoch-Hearst-agree-on-sale-of-Boston-Herald-American/3484406443600/|title=Murdoch, Hearst agree on sale of Boston Herald American|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> which renamed the paper as ''[[The Boston Herald]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/22/us/boston-newspaper-renamed.html|title=Boston Newspaper Renamed|last=Ap|date=1982-12-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> competing to this day with the ''[[Boston Globe]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Hearst bought the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' and that same year closed the 213-year-old ''[[Baltimore News-American]]'' after a failed attempt to reach a JOA with [[Arunah Shepherdson Abell|A.S.

Cosmopolitan Book was sold to [[Farrar & Rinehart]] in 1931.<ref name=\"cosmobook\" /> After two years of leasing them to Eleanor \"Cissy\" Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''), Hearst sold her the ''Washington Times'' and ''Herald'' in 1939; she merged them to form the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. That year he also bought the ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon ''Wisconsin News'' into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the ''Atlanta Georgian'' to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.\n\nHearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/devil-and-mr-hearst/|title=The Devil and Mr. Hearst|last=Frank|first=Dana|date=June 22, 2000|website=The Nation}}</ref>, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers. In Chicago, he combined the morning ''Herald-Examiner'' and the afternoon ''American'' into the ''Herald-American'' in 1939. This followed the 1937 combination of the New York ''Evening Journal'' and the morning ''American'' into the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', the sale of the ''[[Omaha Daily Bee]]'' to the ''[[World-Herald]]''. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media holdings as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold or closed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during [[World War II]]. After the war, however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon to fit television schedules and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the [[DuMont Television Network]]: ''[[I.N.S. Telenews]]'', and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. \n\nThe earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', and ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', supported the company's money-losing afternoon publications such as the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', and the ''[[Chicago American]]''. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s owners, who changed it to the tabloid-size ''Chicago Today'' in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974). In 1960, Hearst also sold the ''[[Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph]]'' to the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' and the ''Detroit Times'' to ''[[The Detroit News]]''. After a lengthy strike it sold the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' to the afternoon ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' in 1962. The same year Hearst's Los Angeles papers \u2013 the morning ''Examiner'' and the afternoon ''Herald-Express'' \u2013 merged to become the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. The [[1962-63 New York City newspaper strike]] left the city with no papers for over three months, with the ''Journal-American'' one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The ''Boston Record'' and the ''Evening American'' merged in 1961 as the ''Record-American'' and in 1964, the ''Baltimore News-Post'' became the ''Baltimore News-American''.\n\nIn 1953 Hearst Magazines bought ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to [[Robert E. Petersen]]. In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' [[United Press]], forming [[United Press International]] as a response to the growth of the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]]. The following year Scripps-Howard's ''San Francisco News'' merged with Hearst's afternoon ''San Francisco Call-Bulletin''. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher [[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864911,00.html|title=The Press: Quiet Deal|date=1959-08-31|work=Time|access-date=2019-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing [[Joint Operating Agreement]]s (JOA's). It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the ''Examiner''. In turn, the ''Examiner'' became an evening publication, absorbing the ''[[The San Francisco Call|News-Call-Bulletin]]''. The following year, the ''Journal-American'' reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and [[Scripps-Howard]]'s ''[[New York World-Telegram|World-Telegram and Sun]]'' to form the ''New York World Journal Tribune'' (recalling the names of the city's mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.\n\nThe 1962 merger of the ''Herald-Express'' and ''Examiner'' in Los Angeles led to the termination of many journalists who began to stage a 10-year strike in 1967. The effects of the strike accelerated the pace of the company's demise, with the ''Herald Examiner'' ceasing publication November 2, 1989.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Last Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Strike| url=https://library.csun.edu/SCA/Peek-in-the-Stacks/Examiner| date=February 3, 2014| website=[[California State University Northridge]] [[Oviatt Library]]| accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Newspaper shifts===\nHearst moved into hardcover publishing by acquiring [[Arbor House]] in 1978 and [[William Morrow and Company]] in 1981.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/16/arts/donald-fine-75-publisher-of-suspenseful-best-sellers.html|title=Donald Fine, 75, Publisher Of Suspenseful Best Sellers|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=1997-08-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Hearst acquires leading book publisher| agency=United Press International| accessdate=28 August 2018| url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/02/13/Hearst-acquires-leading-book-publisher/5505350888400/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the company sold the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Herald American]]'' \u2014the result of the 1972 merger of Hearst's ''Record-American & Advertiser'' with the ''Herald-Traveler'' \u2014 to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/18/Murdoch-Hearst-agree-on-sale-of-Boston-Herald-American/3484406443600/|title=Murdoch, Hearst agree on sale of Boston Herald American|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> which renamed the paper as ''[[The Boston Herald]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/22/us/boston-newspaper-renamed.html|title=Boston Newspaper Renamed|last=Ap|date=1982-12-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> competing to this day with the ''[[Boston Globe]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Hearst bought the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' and that same year closed the 213-year-old ''[[Baltimore News-American]]'' after a failed attempt to reach a JOA with [[Arunah Shepherdson Abell|A.S.
