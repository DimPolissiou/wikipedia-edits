It was during this time period that Lee dropped his surname and earned the nickname \"T-bone\" due to his 6\u2032 2\u00bd\u2033 height and his lean physique. When London finally broke up in 1981, Lee and Sixx decided to form a new group together. Shortly afterward, guitarist [[Mick Mars]] joined the band. Seeking a charismatic frontman, Lee mentioned to the others a singer, [[Vince Neil]], whom he had known casually in high school; Neil soon joined the group, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was formed.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n===M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce===\n{{main|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce}}\n[[File:Crue CIMG4784.JPG|thumb|right|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce from left to right: [[Nikki Sixx]], Lee, [[Mick Mars]], and [[Vince Neil]]]]\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce quickly built a strong fanbase, and released its debut album ''[[Too Fast for Love]]'' in 1981 on its own independent label ([[Leath\u00fcr Records]]). [[Elektra Records]] decided to sign the band shortly thereafter, reissuing the debut in 1982. The band then began a string of hit releases throughout the decade\u20141983's ''[[Shout at the Devil]]'', 1985's ''[[Theatre of Pain]]'', 1987's ''[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]'', and 1989's ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]''\u2014establishing the quartet as one of the biggest [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|metal]] bands of the 1980s.\n\nLee used several memorable [[gimmicks]] during his drum solos at concerts, such as having his entire kit revolving and spinning, or having the entire kit float above the crowd while he continued to play. He was noted for [[mooning]] the crowd at nearly every show. The band was known for its decadent behavior both on and offstage, often consuming excessive amounts of drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, pills and alcohol.\n\nIn 2004, Lee reunited with the original M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce line-up to release the double-disc anthology album entitled ''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce]]'', which went quadruple-platinum and launched a monumental reunion tour to support it, ''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce ... Better Live Than Dead|The Red, White & Cr\u00fce Tour 2005: Better Live Than Dead]]'', the band's first tour in six years. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce finished the year at #8 on the Top Concert Money Earners list. It played 81 shows and grossed {{USD|33}} million according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Solo career===\n[[File:Tommy Lee at Digital Playground Party 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lee at Digital Playground Party on September 22, 2004.]]\nLee came back once with Motley Cr\u00fce to go on the ''Cr\u00fce's Greatest Hits'' tour in 1999. With the popularity of [[rap metal]], he formed a band called [[Methods of Mayhem]]. The band released a self-titled album the same year and toured in support of it. Although Lee distanced himself from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce after splitting, he agreed to take part in the band's 2001 autobiography, ''[[The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band|The Dirt]]''. In addition to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Methods of Mayhem, Lee has made guest appearances on albums by other artists, such as [[Stuart Hamm]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Rob Zombie]]. He also contributed a song, \"Planet Boom\" (originally on M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's [[Quaternary (EP)|Quaternary EP]]) to the soundtrack of then-wife [[Pamela Anderson]]'s 1996 movie, ''[[Barb Wire (film)|Barb Wire]]'', and produced an album for the pre-[[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]] project from [[John Feldmann]] and [[Simon Williams (bassist)|Simon Williams]], the [[Electric Love Hogs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K88GFEJCGc |work=YouTube |accessdate=2010-02-06 |date=March 12, 2008 |title=Electric Love Hogs in the Studio With Tommy Lee}}</ref>\nLee parted ways with [[Methods of Mayhem]] partner [[TiLo (rapper)|TiLo]] and began recording with members of [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]. He then released his first solo album. The album, 2002's ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Tommy Lee album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'', has tones of [[rap metal]] and [[electronica]]. The song \"Blue\" features guest vocalist [[Rodleen Getsic]] (the credits read: \"Rolleen\"). In August 2002, Tommy Lee and his solo band joined [[Ozzfest]], mainstage. In 2006, he formed a new band called [[Rock Star Supernova]] with [[Jason Newsted]] ([[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], ex-[[Metallica]]) and [[Gilby Clarke]] (ex-[[Guns N' Roses]]).\n\nThe 2006 [[Rock Star: Supernova|season]] of ''[[Rock Star (TV series)|Rock Star]]'' selected [[Lukas Rossi]] as the lead singer for Supernova. [[Dilana]], [[Magni \u00c1sgeirsson]], and [[Toby Rand]] with his own band [[Juke Kartel]] were the three runners up and accepted an offer to go on tour with Supernova. The self-titled debut album ''[[Rock Star Supernova (album)|Rock Star Supernova]]'' was released on November 21, 2006.\n\nLee released his autobiography, ''Tommyland'' and his second solo album, ''[[Tommyland: The Ride]]'' in 2005. The CD featured as a soundtrack to the book and includes the singles, \"Tryin to be Me\", \"[[Good Times (Tommy Lee song)|Good Times]]\" which was the theme song to his reality TV series ''[[Tommy Lee Goes to College]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=18859 |title=Tommy Lee Goes to College soundtrack |publisher= }}2011</ref> and \"Hello, Again\" which features [[Andrew McMahon]] from [[Something Corporate]] and [[Jack's Mannequin]]. Lee was also a guest DJ at [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] \"K-Rock\" in New York during the Fourth of July Monster Metal Meltdown in 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nHe also recorded drum tracks for the alternative rock band [[Jack's Mannequin]], which has released the album ''[[Everything in Transit]]''.\n\n[[File:Criss Angel and Tommy Lee.jpg|thumb|upright|Lee (right) with illusionist [[Criss Angel]] at the 2007 Scream Awards]]\nIn November 2007, it was announced by Nikki Sixx that Lee was no longer a member of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The drummer reportedly quit after the rest of the band sued his manager, [[Carl Stubner]], for forcing Tommy to take part in reality TV shows, thus forcing the cancellation of a lengthy leg of Cr\u00fce tour dates in 2006. Lee had already quit once in September 2007 before returning to the band. Vince Neil refuted the claims that Tommy Lee resigned from the band, and said that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce would be going into the studio in January to start recording its new album. In the end, Lee did end up recording the new album, ''Saints of Los Angeles'', and toured with the band in 2008 on its Cr\u00fce Fest tour.\n\nTommy Lee's current artistic endeavors include touring as an electronic dance music DJ with his Methods of Mayhem DJ/production partner, DJ Aero (birth name: Chester Deitz). As DJs, they are also known as Electro Mayhem and have clocked over 60 club dates as DJs throughout North America (with stops in the Bahamas and Central America) in 2007 alone, with more international dates planned for 2008 (including a stop in Iceland). Lee and Aero debuted as DJs on the mainstage at Ultra Music Festival during Winter Music Conference (WMC) in 2004. Lee and Aero have been DJing together since 2000, and they will again have a major presence at Miami's WMC in 2008. In 2009, Lee appeared in select cities with [[Sharam]], one half of Grammy-winning [[Deep Dish (band)|Deep Dish]], accompanying Sharam live on the piano during his house DJ sets. Lee and DJ Aero also accompanied [[deadmau5]] in his 2011 Meowington Hax tour. He played keyboards too with [[Deftones]] at a benefit show for defunct bassist Chi Cheng in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0D3Dh_XHA0|date=December 11, 2009|title=DEFTONES - Anniversary Of An Uninteresting Event - w/ Tommy Lee and Mike Shinoda}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview held backstage at the 2009 Download Festival, Lee confirmed that he is currently working on his yet-to-be-named third solo album. It is expected to be released sometime in 2010. On June 27, 2010 Tommy played drums for [[Ludacris]] at the BET Awards 2010. On March 25, 2010, he co-presented the International Dance Music Awards (IDMA) along with Roger Sanchez and [[DJ Rap]].\n\nIn 2014, Tommy Lee joined [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] to perform drums for their [[Monuments to an Elegy]] album.<ref name=SmashingPumpkins>{{cite web |last1=Grow |first1=Kory |title=Motley Crue's Tommy Lee to Drum on Smashing Pumpkins Record |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/motley-crues-tommy-lee-to-drum-on-smashing-pumpkins-record-20140508 |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> That same year Tommy Lee joined the rest of his M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce bandmates in a farewell tour.

Lee was also one of the producers of the show. In spring 2008, Lee commenced filming another reality TV show with rapper [[Ludacris]] for [[Planet Green]] ([[Discovery Channel]]'s 24-hour eco-friendly network) titled ''[[Battleground Earth]]''.

As well as being the band's long-term drummer, Lee founded rap-metal band [[Methods of Mayhem]], and has pursued solo musical projects.\n\n==Early life==\nLee was born Thomas Lee Bass on October 3, 1962 in&nbsp;Athens, Greece, to father David Lee Thomas Bass, an American U.S. Army sergeant, and mother Vassilikki \"Voula\" Papadimitriou (Greek:&nbsp;\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5), a&nbsp;Miss Greece&nbsp;contestant for the 1960 Miss World event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greekamericangirl.com/athena-kottak-drummin-to-a-greek-beat/ |title=Athena Kottak: Tommy Lee's Little Sister Drummin' to a Greek Beat |date=March 29, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2018 |first=Irene |last=Archos |publisher=GreekAmericanGirl.com |archivedate=June 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610125720/http://greekamericangirl.com/athena-kottak-drummin-to-a-greek-beat/ |url-status=live}}</ref> He has a younger sister, [[Athena Lee|Athena]], who is also a drummer. When Lee was approximately one year old, his father moved the family back to the United States, settling in California.<ref name=\"Tommy Lee AMG\"/>\n\nLee received his first drum sticks when he was four years old, and his first proper drum kit when he was a teenager. He dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music, starting with the L.A. club band Suite 19.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/people/tommy-lee-222294 |title=Tommy Lee Biography}}</ref> As a teenager, he listened to [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Van Halen]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[AC/DC]] and [[The Sweet|Sweet]]. His main drumming influences are [[John Bonham]], [[Tommy Aldridge]], [[Alex Van Halen]] and [[Terry Bozzio]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drummagazine.com/features/post/tommy-lee-double-bass-old-schooler/ |title=Tommy Lee: Double Bass Old Schooler |first=Jared |last=Cobb |publisher=Drummagazine.com |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref> <!--After transferring from [[South Hills High School (West Covina, California)|South Hills High School]]; he joined the marching band at Royal Oak High School (now Royal Oak Middle School) in [[Covina, California]].\n-->\n\n==Music career==\nIn the late 1970s Lee's band, Suite 19, was a regular on the [[Sunset Strip]] club circuit in Los Angeles along with other up-and-coming acts such as [[Van Halen]] and [[Quiet Riot]]. He became acquainted with bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], whose bands [[Sister (band)|Sister]] and later [[London (heavy metal band)|London]] played the same circuit. Sixx was forming a theatrical band that borrowed heavily from Sister's fusion of occult imagery with a theatrical [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] performance, and became a fan of Lee's drumming. It was during this time period that Lee dropped his surname and earned the nickname \"T-bone\" due to his 6\u2032 2\u00bd\u2033 height and his lean physique. When London finally broke up in 1981, Lee and Sixx decided to form a new group together. Shortly afterward, guitarist [[Mick Mars]] joined the band. Seeking a charismatic frontman, Lee mentioned to the others a singer, [[Vince Neil]], whom he had known casually in high school; Neil soon joined the group, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was formed.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n===M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce===\n{{main|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce}}\n[[File:Crue CIMG4784.JPG|thumb|right|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce from left to right: [[Nikki Sixx]], Lee, [[Mick Mars]], and [[Vince Neil]]]]\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce quickly built a strong fanbase, and released its debut album ''[[Too Fast for Love]]'' in 1981 on its own independent label ([[Leath\u00fcr Records]]). [[Elektra Records]] decided to sign the band shortly thereafter, reissuing the debut in 1982. The band then began a string of hit releases throughout the decade\u20141983's ''[[Shout at the Devil]]'', 1985's ''[[Theatre of Pain]]'', 1987's ''[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]'', and 1989's ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]''\u2014establishing the quartet as one of the biggest [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|metal]] bands of the 1980s.\n\nLee used several memorable [[gimmicks]] during his drum solos at concerts, such as having his entire kit revolving and spinning, or having the entire kit float above the crowd while he continued to play. He was noted for [[mooning]] the crowd at nearly every show. The band was known for its decadent behavior both on and offstage, often consuming excessive amounts of drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, pills and alcohol.\n\nIn 2004, Lee reunited with the original M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce line-up to release the double-disc anthology album entitled ''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce]]'', which went quadruple-platinum and launched a monumental reunion tour to support it, ''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce ... Better Live Than Dead|The Red, White & Cr\u00fce Tour 2005: Better Live Than Dead]]'', the band's first tour in six years. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce finished the year at #8 on the Top Concert Money Earners list. It played 81 shows and grossed {{USD|33}} million according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Solo career===\n[[File:Tommy Lee at Digital Playground Party 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lee at Digital Playground Party on September 22, 2004.]]\nLee came back once with Motley Cr\u00fce to go on the ''Cr\u00fce's Greatest Hits'' tour in 1999. With the popularity of [[rap metal]], he formed a band called [[Methods of Mayhem]]. The band released a self-titled album the same year and toured in support of it. Although Lee distanced himself from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce after splitting, he agreed to take part in the band's 2001 autobiography, ''[[The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band|The Dirt]]''. In addition to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Methods of Mayhem, Lee has made guest appearances on albums by other artists, such as [[Stuart Hamm]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Rob Zombie]]. He also contributed a song, \"Planet Boom\" (originally on M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's [[Quaternary (EP)|Quaternary EP]]) to the soundtrack of then-wife [[Pamela Anderson]]'s 1996 movie, ''[[Barb Wire (film)|Barb Wire]]'', and produced an album for the pre-[[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]] project from [[John Feldmann]] and [[Simon Williams (bassist)|Simon Williams]], the [[Electric Love Hogs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K88GFEJCGc |work=YouTube |accessdate=2010-02-06 |date=March 12, 2008 |title=Electric Love Hogs in the Studio With Tommy Lee}}</ref>\nLee parted ways with [[Methods of Mayhem]] partner [[TiLo (rapper)|TiLo]] and began recording with members of [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]. He then released his first solo album. The album, 2002's ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Tommy Lee album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'', has tones of [[rap metal]] and [[electronica]]. The song \"Blue\" features guest vocalist [[Rodleen Getsic]] (the credits read: \"Rolleen\"). In August 2002, Tommy Lee and his solo band joined [[Ozzfest]], mainstage. In 2006, he formed a new band called [[Rock Star Supernova]] with [[Jason Newsted]] ([[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], ex-[[Metallica]]) and [[Gilby Clarke]] (ex-[[Guns N' Roses]]).\n\nThe 2006 [[Rock Star: Supernova|season]] of ''[[Rock Star (TV series)|Rock Star]]'' selected [[Lukas Rossi]] as the lead singer for Supernova. [[Dilana]], [[Magni \u00c1sgeirsson]], and [[Toby Rand]] with his own band [[Juke Kartel]] were the three runners up and accepted an offer to go on tour with Supernova. The self-titled debut album ''[[Rock Star Supernova (album)|Rock Star Supernova]]'' was released on November 21, 2006.\n\nLee released his autobiography, ''Tommyland'' and his second solo album, ''[[Tommyland: The Ride]]'' in 2005. The CD featured as a soundtrack to the book and includes the singles, \"Tryin to be Me\", \"[[Good Times (Tommy Lee song)|Good Times]]\" which was the theme song to his reality TV series ''[[Tommy Lee Goes to College]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=18859 |title=Tommy Lee Goes to College soundtrack |publisher= }}2011</ref> and \"Hello, Again\" which features [[Andrew McMahon]] from [[Something Corporate]] and [[Jack's Mannequin]]. Lee was also a guest DJ at [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] \"K-Rock\" in New York during the Fourth of July Monster Metal Meltdown in 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nHe also recorded drum tracks for the alternative rock band [[Jack's Mannequin]], which has released the album ''[[Everything in Transit]]''.\n\n[[File:Criss Angel and Tommy Lee.jpg|thumb|upright|Lee (right) with illusionist [[Criss Angel]] at the 2007 Scream Awards]]\nIn November 2007, it was announced by Nikki Sixx that Lee was no longer a member of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The drummer reportedly quit after the rest of the band sued his manager, [[Carl Stubner]], for forcing Tommy to take part in reality TV shows, thus forcing the cancellation of a lengthy leg of Cr\u00fce tour dates in 2006. Lee had already quit once in September 2007 before returning to the band. Vince Neil refuted the claims that Tommy Lee resigned from the band, and said that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce would be going into the studio in January to start recording its new album. In the end, Lee did end up recording the new album, ''Saints of Los Angeles'', and toured with the band in 2008 on its Cr\u00fce Fest tour.\n\nTommy Lee's current artistic endeavors include touring as an electronic dance music DJ with his Methods of Mayhem DJ/production partner, DJ Aero (birth name: Chester Deitz). As DJs, they are also known as Electro Mayhem and have clocked over 60 club dates as DJs throughout North America (with stops in the Bahamas and Central America) in 2007 alone, with more international dates planned for 2008 (including a stop in Iceland). Lee and Aero debuted as DJs on the mainstage at Ultra Music Festival during Winter Music Conference (WMC) in 2004. Lee and Aero have been DJing together since 2000, and they will again have a major presence at Miami's WMC in 2008. In 2009, Lee appeared in select cities with [[Sharam]], one half of Grammy-winning [[Deep Dish (band)|Deep Dish]], accompanying Sharam live on the piano during his house DJ sets. Lee and DJ Aero also accompanied [[deadmau5]] in his 2011 Meowington Hax tour. He played keyboards too with [[Deftones]] at a benefit show for defunct bassist Chi Cheng in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0D3Dh_XHA0|date=December 11, 2009|title=DEFTONES - Anniversary Of An Uninteresting Event - w/ Tommy Lee and Mike Shinoda}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview held backstage at the 2009 Download Festival, Lee confirmed that he is currently working on his yet-to-be-named third solo album. It is expected to be released sometime in 2010. On June 27, 2010 Tommy played drums for [[Ludacris]] at the BET Awards 2010. On March 25, 2010, he co-presented the International Dance Music Awards (IDMA) along with Roger Sanchez and [[DJ Rap]].\n\nIn 2014, Tommy Lee joined [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] to perform drums for their [[Monuments to an Elegy]] album.<ref name=SmashingPumpkins>{{cite web |last1=Grow |first1=Kory |title=Motley Crue's Tommy Lee to Drum on Smashing Pumpkins Record |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/motley-crues-tommy-lee-to-drum-on-smashing-pumpkins-record-20140508 |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> That same year Tommy Lee joined the rest of his M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce bandmates in a farewell tour. As part of the tour each member signed a legal document preventing them from ever touring under the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce moniker again.<ref name=SmashingPumpkins/>\n\n==Television career==\nIn 2004, he starred in a reality show for [[NBC]] called ''[[Tommy Lee Goes to College]]''. Lee was also one of the producers of the show. In spring 2008, Lee commenced filming another reality TV show with rapper [[Ludacris]] for [[Planet Green]] ([[Discovery Channel]]'s 24-hour eco-friendly network) titled ''[[Battleground Earth]]''.  He guest starred on Season 7, Episode 14 of ''The Goldbergs'' as Professor Lee.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Relationships===\nLee has been married four times; his first wife was Elaine Starchuk.

We really didn\u2019t have enough talent to do that, and in addition to that, if you were going to do that maybe not do it on the broadcast show because Vince McMahon was looking at that the more eyeballs.\u201d</ref>\n\nIn March 2002, WWF underwent the \"[[WWE brand extension|brand extension]]\",<ref name=\"wwe57\">{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=57}}</ref> a process in which WWE divided itself into two branches with separate rosters, storylines and [[Professional wrestling authority figures|authority figures]].<ref name=\"wwe57\"/> The two divisions, hosted by and named after ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown!'', would compete against each other. The split resulted from WWE purchasing its two biggest competitors, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW); and the subsequent doubling of its roster and [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]]. The brand extension was made public during a telecast of ''Raw'' on March 18, initiated with the first [[WWE draft|draft]] a week later on the March 25 episode of ''Raw'' and became official on the April 1 episode of ''Raw''.\n\nWrestlers began to wrestle exclusively for their specific show. At the time, this excluded the [[WWE Championship|WWE Undisputed Championship]] and [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]] as those WWE titles would be defended on both shows.<ref name=\"wwe57\"/> In August 2002, then WWE Undisputed Champion, [[Brock Lesnar]], refused to defend the title on ''Raw'', in effect causing his title to become exclusive to SmackDown.<ref name=\"wwe57\"/> The following week on ''Raw'', [[List of WWE Raw on-air personalities#Authority figures|Raw General Manager]] Eric Bischoff awarded a newly instated [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] to Raw's designated number one contender [[Triple H]]. Accordingly, Lesnar's championship was no longer deemed \"undisputed\". Following this, the WWE Women's Championship soon became a Raw exclusive as well. As a result of the brand extension, an annual \"[[WWE draft|draft lottery]]\" was instituted to exchange members of each roster and generally refresh the lineups.\n\nSmackDown was the home brand for many top WWE stars including [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Big Show]], [[John Layfield|John Bradshaw Layfield]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[The Undertaker]], [[Rey Mysterio]], [[John Cena]], [[Torrie Wilson]]. Guerrero would go on to become the WWE Champion as part of the show, thus becoming the main feature of ''SmackDown!'' throughout 2004 and the most popular wrestler of that year. The biggest star of the next decade, John Cena, started his WWE career on this brand and rose to stardom as \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" on the show, eventually winning his first WWE Championship during his tenure on the brand.\n\nOn June 6, then WWE Champion John Cena switched brands from SmackDown to Raw as part of the month-long [[2005 WWE draft lottery|2005 draft lottery]]. This effectively left SmackDown without a [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world title]]. On the June 23 episode of ''SmackDown!'', [[List of WWE SmackDown on-air personalities#Authority figures|SmackDown General Manager]] [[Theodore Long]] scheduled a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|six-man elimination match]] between Big Show, [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[Chris Benoit]], [[Christian Cage|Christian]] (replacing Big Show, who was picked by Raw in the lottery), John Bradshaw Layfield, [[Muhammad Hassan (wrestler)|Muhammad Hassan]] and The Undertaker to crown the first SmackDown Champion. On the June 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Layfield won the match, but Long appeared afterward and stated that even though he had won the match SmackDown did not need a championship anymore, instead revealing that Layfield was the number one contender for the World Heavyweight championship, at which point [[Dave Bautista|Batista]], then World Heavyweight Champion, entered the ring as SmackDown's final draft lottery pick.\n\nAt the ''SmackDown!'' taping on January 10, 2006 that aired January 13, Batista had to forfeit the World Heavyweight Championship because of a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#legit|legitimate]] [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] injury suffered at the hands of [[Mark Henry]] the previous week. Long decreed a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] for the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacant]] title, which was won by Kurt Angle, who was on the Raw brand, but switched to the SmackDown brand for the duration of his reign as champion. On the April 7 episode of ''SmackDown!'' (which was taped on April 4), Long revived the [[King of the Ring]] tournament after a four-year hiatus as a SmackDown exclusive tournament. The tournament ended at [[Judgment Day (2006)|Judgment Day]] with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] as the winner, defeating [[Bobby Lashley]] in the final.\n\nOn October 16, 2007, the SmackDown and [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] brands began a talent exchange, allowing their respective talent to appear and compete on either brand, as ''ECW'' was broadcast live from the same arena where ''SmackDown!'' was taped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/articles/partnershipforming|title=Partnership Forming?|date=October 16, 2007|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=October 25, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/|title=Setting the night on fire|work=ECW results|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=October 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2008 WWE draft]], WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to SmackDown, resulting in two world championships appearing on the brand \u2013 [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] was the World Heavyweight Champion at the time \u2013 and leaving Raw without a world title. However, Edge was attacked by Batista on the June 30 episode of ''Raw'' and immediately afterwards [[CM Punk]] cashed in his [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract to become World Heavyweight Champion, bringing the World Heavyweight Championship back to Raw for the first time since 2005. Also that year, for the first time in the brand's history a women's exclusive championship was introduced, the [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Championship]], a counterpart to the Women's Championship that had been the only active championship competed for by [[Women in WWE|Divas]], but which was exclusive to Raw, meaning that the Divas on SmackDown had no championship to compete for. [[Michelle McCool]] became the inaugural champion by defeating [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] on July 20 at [[The Great American Bash (2008)|The Great American Bash]].\n\nOn February 15, 2009 at [[No Way Out (2009)|No Way Out]], Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship in Raw's [[Elimination Chamber]] match, thus making it a SmackDown exclusive title and giving SmackDown two top tier championships.<ref name=\"edgewhceliminationchamber\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/matches/9229100/results/|title=Elimination chamber result at no way out|last=Tello|first=Craig|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=February 17, 2009}}</ref> As a result of the [[2009 WWE draft]] in April, then WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to Raw while the World Heavyweight Championship also moved to the Raw brand after Edge lost the title to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXV]], once again leaving SmackDown without a world title.<ref name=\"Draft2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/04132009/|title=Rough Draft (Televised draft results)|last=Sitterson|first=Aubrey|date=April 13, 2009|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=April 14, 2009}}</ref> SmackDown regained the World Heavyweight Championship at [[Backlash (2009)|Backlash]] when Edge invoked his WrestleMania rematch clause and defeated Cena to win the championship back.<ref name=\"LastManStanding\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/matches/9808960/results/|title=Results:Fueled by hatred and desperation|date=April 26, 2009|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}</ref> In addition, Raw and SmackDown exchanged both women-exclusive championships with Raw gaining the Divas Championship and SmackDown gaining the Women's Championship.

Article is not named SmackDown Live. ---> is a [[WWE brand extension|brand]] of the U.S. based [[professional wrestling]] promotion [[WWE]]. The brand was first established on March 25, 2002 with a draft on ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' and went into effect one week later on April 2. The brand would be discontinued for a period between August 2011 and July 2016.\n\nWrestlers assigned to the SmackDown brand wrestle predominantly on WWE's weekly ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' television program, as well as branded and co-branded [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view events]] and [[List of WWE Network events|WWE Network events]]. The brand has also appeared in the ''[[Mixed Match Challenge]]'' and the interbrand ''[[WWE Worlds Collide (series)|Worlds Collide]]'' events. During the first brand split, they also competed on an exclusive supplementary show, ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'', and on ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'', under a talent exchange program.\n\n==History==\n{{main|WWE brand extension}}\n=== First split (2002\u20132011)===\n\n[[File:Stephanie McMahon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stephanie McMahon]] was the first SmackDown General Manager]]\nIn its conception, according to [[Bruce Prichard]] in his ''[[Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard|Something to Wrestle]]'' podcast released in October 2018, the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) originally planned to make SmackDown an [[Women in WWE|all-women's brand]] but ultimately decided against it because of the lack of talent.<ref>[http://wrestling-edge.com/former-wwe-producer-reveals-they-thought-about-making-smackdown-an-all-women-show/ Former WWE producer reveals they thought about making SmackDown an all women show] - WrestlingEdge.com \u201cWe definitely discussed it, we looked at it, but we just didn\u2019t have the depth to do it on a consistent basis week after week. We really didn\u2019t have enough talent to do that, and in addition to that, if you were going to do that maybe not do it on the broadcast show because Vince McMahon was looking at that the more eyeballs.\u201d</ref>\n\nIn March 2002, WWF underwent the \"[[WWE brand extension|brand extension]]\",<ref name=\"wwe57\">{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=57}}</ref> a process in which WWE divided itself into two branches with separate rosters, storylines and [[Professional wrestling authority figures|authority figures]].<ref name=\"wwe57\"/> The two divisions, hosted by and named after ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown!'', would compete against each other. The split resulted from WWE purchasing its two biggest competitors, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW); and the subsequent doubling of its roster and [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]]. The brand extension was made public during a telecast of ''Raw'' on March 18, initiated with the first [[WWE draft|draft]] a week later on the March 25 episode of ''Raw'' and became official on the April 1 episode of ''Raw''.\n\nWrestlers began to wrestle exclusively for their specific show. At the time, this excluded the [[WWE Championship|WWE Undisputed Championship]] and [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]] as those WWE titles would be defended on both shows.<ref name=\"wwe57\"/> In August 2002, then WWE Undisputed Champion, [[Brock Lesnar]], refused to defend the title on ''Raw'', in effect causing his title to become exclusive to SmackDown.<ref name=\"wwe57\"/> The following week on ''Raw'', [[List of WWE Raw on-air personalities#Authority figures|Raw General Manager]] Eric Bischoff awarded a newly instated [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] to Raw's designated number one contender [[Triple H]]. Accordingly, Lesnar's championship was no longer deemed \"undisputed\". Following this, the WWE Women's Championship soon became a Raw exclusive as well. As a result of the brand extension, an annual \"[[WWE draft|draft lottery]]\" was instituted to exchange members of each roster and generally refresh the lineups.\n\nSmackDown was the home brand for many top WWE stars including [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Big Show]], [[John Layfield|John Bradshaw Layfield]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[The Undertaker]], [[Rey Mysterio]], [[John Cena]], [[Torrie Wilson]]. Guerrero would go on to become the WWE Champion as part of the show, thus becoming the main feature of ''SmackDown!'' throughout 2004 and the most popular wrestler of that year. The biggest star of the next decade, John Cena, started his WWE career on this brand and rose to stardom as \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" on the show, eventually winning his first WWE Championship during his tenure on the brand.\n\nOn June 6, then WWE Champion John Cena switched brands from SmackDown to Raw as part of the month-long [[2005 WWE draft lottery|2005 draft lottery]]. This effectively left SmackDown without a [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world title]]. On the June 23 episode of ''SmackDown!'', [[List of WWE SmackDown on-air personalities#Authority figures|SmackDown General Manager]] [[Theodore Long]] scheduled a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|six-man elimination match]] between Big Show, [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[Chris Benoit]], [[Christian Cage|Christian]] (replacing Big Show, who was picked by Raw in the lottery), John Bradshaw Layfield, [[Muhammad Hassan (wrestler)|Muhammad Hassan]] and The Undertaker to crown the first SmackDown Champion. On the June 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Layfield won the match, but Long appeared afterward and stated that even though he had won the match SmackDown did not need a championship anymore, instead revealing that Layfield was the number one contender for the World Heavyweight championship, at which point [[Dave Bautista|Batista]], then World Heavyweight Champion, entered the ring as SmackDown's final draft lottery pick.\n\nAt the ''SmackDown!'' taping on January 10, 2006 that aired January 13, Batista had to forfeit the World Heavyweight Championship because of a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#legit|legitimate]] [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] injury suffered at the hands of [[Mark Henry]] the previous week. Long decreed a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] for the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacant]] title, which was won by Kurt Angle, who was on the Raw brand, but switched to the SmackDown brand for the duration of his reign as champion. On the April 7 episode of ''SmackDown!'' (which was taped on April 4), Long revived the [[King of the Ring]] tournament after a four-year hiatus as a SmackDown exclusive tournament. The tournament ended at [[Judgment Day (2006)|Judgment Day]] with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] as the winner, defeating [[Bobby Lashley]] in the final.\n\nOn October 16, 2007, the SmackDown and [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] brands began a talent exchange, allowing their respective talent to appear and compete on either brand, as ''ECW'' was broadcast live from the same arena where ''SmackDown!'' was taped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/articles/partnershipforming|title=Partnership Forming?|date=October 16, 2007|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=October 25, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/|title=Setting the night on fire|work=ECW results|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=October 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2008 WWE draft]], WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to SmackDown, resulting in two world championships appearing on the brand \u2013 [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] was the World Heavyweight Champion at the time \u2013 and leaving Raw without a world title. However, Edge was attacked by Batista on the June 30 episode of ''Raw'' and immediately afterwards [[CM Punk]] cashed in his [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract to become World Heavyweight Champion, bringing the World Heavyweight Championship back to Raw for the first time since 2005. Also that year, for the first time in the brand's history a women's exclusive championship was introduced, the [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Championship]], a counterpart to the Women's Championship that had been the only active championship competed for by [[Women in WWE|Divas]], but which was exclusive to Raw, meaning that the Divas on SmackDown had no championship to compete for. [[Michelle McCool]] became the inaugural champion by defeating [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] on July 20 at [[The Great American Bash (2008)|The Great American Bash]].\n\nOn February 15, 2009 at [[No Way Out (2009)|No Way Out]], Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship in Raw's [[Elimination Chamber]] match, thus making it a SmackDown exclusive title and giving SmackDown two top tier championships.<ref name=\"edgewhceliminationchamber\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/matches/9229100/results/|title=Elimination chamber result at no way out|last=Tello|first=Craig|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=February 17, 2009}}</ref> As a result of the [[2009 WWE draft]] in April, then WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to Raw while the World Heavyweight Championship also moved to the Raw brand after Edge lost the title to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXV]], once again leaving SmackDown without a world title.<ref name=\"Draft2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/04132009/|title=Rough Draft (Televised draft results)|last=Sitterson|first=Aubrey|date=April 13, 2009|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=April 14, 2009}}</ref> SmackDown regained the World Heavyweight Championship at [[Backlash (2009)|Backlash]] when Edge invoked his WrestleMania rematch clause and defeated Cena to win the championship back.<ref name=\"LastManStanding\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/matches/9808960/results/|title=Results:Fueled by hatred and desperation|date=April 26, 2009|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}</ref> In addition, Raw and SmackDown exchanged both women-exclusive championships with Raw gaining the Divas Championship and SmackDown gaining the Women's Championship.

In 1630, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] invaded [[Pomerania]], partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, but also to control the [[Baltic_maritime_trade_(c._1400\u20131800)|Baltic trade]], which provided much of Sweden's income.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1938|pp=385-386}} \n\nEconomic factors meant Swedish intervention continued after Gustavus was killed in 1632, but conflicted with states within the Empire, including Saxony, and regional rivals, such as Denmark. Most of Sweden's German allies made peace in the 1635 [[Peace_of_Prague_(1635)|Treaty of Prague]]. The war lost its religious nature, becoming a contest between the Empire and Sweden, with Sweden supported by [[Kingdom_of_France|France]] and [[George_I_R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|George R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, Prince of Transylvania]].{{sfn|Setton|1991|pp=80-81}} \n\n[[Ferdinand_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Ferdinand III]], who succeeded his father in 1637, began peace talks in 1643, but ordered his negotiators to delay, pending a 1644 military offensive.{{sfn|H\u00f6belt|2012|p=143}} This was unsuccessful; the Swedes defeated the [[Torstenson_War|Danes]], who had re-entered the war as an Imperial ally, then destroyed an Imperial army in Saxony. Despite victory at [[Battle_of_Freiburg|Freiburg]] in August, the Bavarians under [[Franz von Mercy]] could not prevent French troops capturing [[Philippsburg]], and occupying [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]]. Mercy withdrew into [[Franconia]], establishing winter quarters at [[Heilbronn]].{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=682-683}}  \n\nFor 1645, Swedish commander [[Lennart Torstensson]] proposed a three-part offensive, intended to compel Ferdinand III to agree to terms.

His left was the most vulnerable, with open ground directly to its front, overlooked by a hill to the south, known as 'Kappellhodjen' or Chapel Hill. In a conference the night before, Torstensson and his senior officers recognised the drawbacks, but agreed to an assault; their co-ordinated attack contrasted with command failures among the Imperial generals.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=134}}\n[[Image:Jean, baron de Wert (bgw17 0615).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johann_von_Werth|Werth]], whose Bavarian cavalry charges nearly succeeded in preventing defeat]]\nThe battle consisted of two parts, the first from dawn to midday, the second from early afternoon until nightfall.

Observing this, Torstensson moved his guns forward and began firing at close range into the helpless Imperial infantry. Werth charged and scattered the Swedish right, before his cavalry stopped to loot the baggage train, capturing Torstensson's wife. The Swedish cavalry reformed and counter-attacked, inflicting heavy casualties; only 1,500 of the 5,000 Bavarians made it back to [[Munich]]. Left isolated, the infantry surrendered, with 4,450 taken prisoner, including Hatzfeldt. In addition, his army suffered 5,000 casualties; less than 3,000 men from the 36 infantry regiments involved were present in Prague a week later.

Although it could not match the Swedish veterans, 25 years of constant war had devastated the countryside, and combatants could no longer live off the land. The further the Swedes advanced, the harder it was to secure supplies, and Torstensson decided to establish a base at [[Brno]], held by an Imperial garrison of 1,500 under [[Jean-Louis_Raduit_de_Souches|de Souches]], a French Protestant exile. He was joined by 14,200 Transylvanian troops, largely unpaid and unfed, increasing his supply issue; the besiegers lost over 8,000 men, mostly from disease.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=697}} \n\nHaving just begun the [[Cretan_War_(1645\u20131669)|Fifth Ottoman-Venetian Cretan War]], the [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottomans]] withdrew support from the Transylvanians in return for Ferdinand renewing the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]].{{sfn |H\u00f6tte|Mihalik|1867 |p=12}} Deprived of Turkish backing, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and Ferdinand agreed the Treaty of Linz, and in August, the Transylvanians and Swedes withdrew from Brno. Shortly after, the [[Second_Treaty_of_Br\u00f6msebro_(1645)|Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]] ended the Danish war, and encouraged Torstensson to make another attempt on Vienna. By October, he had fewer than 10,000 men facing 20,000 Imperialists; too ill to sit a horse, he retreated into Saxony, where he handed over command to [[Carl_Gustaf_Wrangel|Wrangel]] on 23 December.

By February 1646, the Swedes had been expelled from their remaining positions in Bohemia.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=697}}           \n\nAlthough Ferdinand prevented the Swedes taking advantage of Jankau, he could not support his allies in Bavaria and Saxony. The Bavarians defeated the French at [[Battle_of_Herbsthausen|Herbsthausen]] in May; [[Battle_of_N\u00f6rdlingen_(1645)|N\u00f6rdlingen]] in August was a French victory, but casualties exceeded 4,000 on each side, and the French ended the year where they started. However, Torstensson's three part strategy showed its worth when [[Hans_Christoff_von_K\u00f6nigsmarck|K\u00f6nigsmarck]] burst into Saxony; without hope of reinforcement, [[John_George_I,_Elector_of_Saxony|Elector John George]] agreed a six month truce in September 1645.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=704}} \n\nFerdinand accepted a military solution was no longer possible, and in October, instructed his representatives at Westphalia to begin serious negotiations.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=716}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |last1=Guthrie |first1=William P |title=The Later Thirty Years War : From the Battle of Wittstock to the Treaty of Westphalia |date=2003 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=H\u00f6belt |first1= Lothar ||editor-last1=Afflerbach |editor-first1=Holger |editor-last2=Strachan |editor-first2=Hew |title=Surrender in the Thirty Years War in How Fighting Ends: A History of Surrender |date=2012 |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0199693627 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=H\u00f6tte |first1=Hans |last2=Mihalik |first2=B\u00e9la Vilmos |editor-last=Heywood |editor-first=Colin |title=Atlas of Southeast Europe: Geopolitics and History; Volume One: 1521-1699 |date=1867 |publisher=Brill |ref=harv |edition=2016}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Setton |first1=Kenneth Meyer |title=Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century |date=1991 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-0871691927 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Spielvogel |first1=Jackson |title=Western Civilization |date=2006 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|isbn=978-1285436401 |edition=2014|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Wedgwood |first1=CV |title=The Thirty Years War |date=1938 |publisher=New York Review of Books |isbn=978-1590171462 |ref=harv|edition=2005}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Peter |title=Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War |date=2009 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=978-0713995923 |ref=harv}}\n\n{{coord|49.6503|N|14.7294|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle Of Jankau}}\n[[Category:Battles involving the Holy Roman Empire|Jankau]]\n[[Category:Battles involving Sweden|Jankau]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Thirty Years' War|Jankau]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1645]]\n[[Category:1645 in Europe]]\n[[Category:Battles involving Bohemia]]\n", "name_user": "Djmaschek", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAftermath:Move peace signing picture to top.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jankau"}
