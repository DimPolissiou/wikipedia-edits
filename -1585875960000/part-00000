Initially trained by Luke Skywalker as a Jedi, he is later seduced to the dark side by [[Snoke]], the Supreme Leader of the First Order, and becomes the leader of the [[Knights of Ren]] and a high-ranking commander within the First Order. He later kills his father to prove his allegiance to the dark side, betrays and kills Snoke, becoming the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and forms a special connection with Rey, whom he attempts to seduce to dark side and convince to rule over the galaxy alongside him, but she refuses. Ren later forms an alliance with the resurrected Emperor Palpatine and his fleet of Star Destroyers, capable of destroying planets, entitled the Final Order, but is eventually redeemed after a confrontation with Rey, as well as his mother's death and a vision of his father's spirit, and comes to Rey's aid to confront the Emperor, killing the Knights of Ren in the process. After Rey is able to unlock her full potential by summoning the spirits of all Jedi before her and kill Palpatine, she briefly dies, but Ren revives her and the two share a kiss.

They make a brief appearance in ''The Force Awakens'', where they are shown to have helped Kylo Ren destroy Luke's Jedi Academy in one of Rey's Force visions. They return in ''The Rise of Skywalker'', where they join Kylo Ren in his hunt of Rey. Following Kylo's redemption, the Knight of Ren instead swear their allegiance to the resurrected Emperor Palpatine and, during the final Battle of Exegol, they attempt to stop Kylo when he comes to Rey's aid, leading to him fighting and killing all the Knights of Ren.\n|-\n| {{visible anchor|[[Captain Rex]]|Captain Rex}}\n| Voice: Dee Bradley Baker (''The Clone Wars'' and ''Rebels'')<ref name=\"DBB youtube\"/>\n| Anakin Skywalker's second-in-command and captain of 501st in ''The Clone Wars'';<ref name=\"Coolest Clones\"/> as a retired clone trooper he joins the Rebellion in ''Star Wars Rebels''.\n|-\n|[[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey Skywalker]]\n| [[Daisy Ridley]] (''Episodes VII\u2013IX'')<br>Voice: Daisy Ridley (''Forces of Destiny'')\n| Scavenger who lives on the desert planet Jakku.

His interrogation unlocks her ability to use the Force and she is later able to defeat Kylo Ren, before accepting her destiny as a Jedi and leaving to find Luke Skywalker. In ''The Last Jedi'', she is reluctantly trained by Luke, who fears that she will succumb to the dark side, similarly to Ren, but she later learns of his attempt to kill Ren after sensing the darkness in him and leaves to confront him, believing that there is still good in him. After Ren kills Supreme Leader Snoke and works alongside Rey to defeat his guards, Ren offers Rey to join him and rule over the galaxy together, but she refuses and escapes during the destruction of the ''Supremacy''. Rey later briefly takes part in the Battle of Crait, escaping aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' whilst Luke sacrifices himself to face Ren and allow the Resistance to escape. In ''The Rise of Skywalker'', Rey completes her Jedi training at the hands of Leia Organa, and discovers her origins as Palpatine's granddaughter, having been abandoned on Jakku by her parents to keep her safe from him. During the final battle against Palpatine, she is able to unlock her full potential by summoning the spirits of all Jedi before her and kills Palpatine, but dies in the process. Rey is shortly after revived by a redeemed Kylo Ren and the two share a kiss, before Ren passes away, having used all of his remaining life energy to save her. Sometime after the defeat of the Final Order and the Sith, Rey travels to Luke's old home on Tatooine, where she buries Luke's and Leia's lightsabers, and although being born a Palpatine, she decides to name herself a Skywalker in spirit.\n|-\n| General {{visible anchor|Carlist Rieekan}}\n| [[Bruce Boa]] (''The Empire Strikes Back'')\n| Rebel commanding officer on Hoth in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/general-rieekan/|title=Carlist Rieekan, General|website=StarWars.com |publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{visible anchor|Riley}}\n| Voice: Catherine Taber (''Uprising'')\n| Riley is the sister of an unnamed smuggler.

He was eventually rescued by a woman named Shaa, who trained him in the Dark Side of the Force and whom he eventually killed after believing that he had become more powerful than his master. Momin then built a superweapon to destroy an entire city and perished when the Jedi intervened to stop him, losing control over the energy he wielded and causing his physical body to be destroyed, leaving only his mask with his consciousness inside. Years later, the mask would be retrieved from the Jedi Archieve vault by Emperor Palpatine, who gave it to his apprentice Darth Vader as a gift for his journey to [[Mustafar]], which Vader sought to make his personal stronghold. After Momin's mask killed some of his personnel, Vader examined it and learned of Momin's past, before letting him possess the body of a Mustafarian and build his fortress for him. Shortly after Momin finished the build of the fortress, Vader was distracted by an invasion of Mustafarians, which Momin took advantage of to open the door to the dark side and resurrect himself. However, after challenging Vader to a duel, Momin would soon meet his demise by being crashed against the wall with a giant rock. Despite Momin's death, his dark esence would remain in the mask for years to come and at one point the mask was located aboard the Imperial yacht ''Imperialis'', where it possessed the bodies of two thieves who attempted to rob the ship, forcing the others to abandon them and destroy the ship. Darth Momin appears in the novel series ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', as well as the 4th issue of ''Lando''.\n|-\n| {{visible anchor|Morley}}\n| Voice: [[Benjamin Diskin|Ben Diskin]] (''The Clone Wars'')\n| Snake-like Anacondan that helps Darth Maul survive on the junk world of Lotho Minor.

He later kills his father to prove his allegiance to the dark side, betrays and kills Snoke, becoming the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and forms a special connection with Rey, whom he attempts to seduce to dark side and convince to rule over the galaxy alongside him, but she refuses. Ren later forms an alliance with the resurrected Emperor Palpatine and his fleet of Star Destroyers, capable of destroying planets, entitled the Final Order, but is eventually redeemed after a confrontation with Rey, as well as his mother's death and a vision of his father's spirit, and comes to Rey's aid to confront the Emperor, killing the Knights of Ren in the process. After Rey is able to unlock her full potential by summoning the spirits of all Jedi before her and kill Palpatine, she briefly dies, but Ren revives her and the two share a kiss.

In ''The Last Jedi'', she is reluctantly trained by Luke, who fears that she will succumb to the dark side, similarly to Ren, but she later learns of his attempt to kill Ren after sensing the darkness in him and leaves to confront him, believing that there is still good in him. After Ren kills Supreme Leader Snoke and works alongside Rey to defeat his guards, Ren offers Rey to join him and rule over the galaxy together, but she refuses and escapes during the destruction of the ''Supremacy''. Rey later briefly takes part in the Battle of Crait, escaping aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' whilst Luke sacrifices himself to face Ren and allow the Resistance to escape.

It lies near [[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za]]. It is an important place for pilgrimage. It has a [[Byzantine Catholic]] church, which houses the Weeping  Madonna, an enormous ornate iconostasis that now takes pride of place above the altar. This icon is not the original, but an 18th-century copy. The original one is kept in [[Stephansdom|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in [[Vienna]].<ref>http://mariapocskegyhely.hu/?q=en/node/322</ref>\n\n== The History of M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs ==\nBefore the end of the seventeenth century P\u00f3cs only received mention in the written sources a few times. The first reference was in a document from 1280 that mentions a place called \u201cPolch,\u201d over which the members of the Hont-Pazm\u00e1ny family were disputing. During the fourteenth century, the Gutkeled family purchased Pouch, or Powch. Later, the Bathory family acquired the village, and it became a part of the Ecsed property. While the population was Hungarian during the Middle Ages, beginning with the middle of the seventeenth century a portion of the Ruthenians, spreading South from the Northeastern counties, such as Zempl\u00e9n, S\u00e1ros, Ung, also settled at P\u00f3cs. By the end of the century, the Ruthenians constituted the majority. This fundamentally changed the ratio of the denominations in the town, and from that point on, the Byzantine Catholics became the majority. In addition to them, Latin Catholics and smaller numbers of Reformed and Lutherans also live in the settlement.\n\nP\u00f3cs acquired a national and international reputation in 1696. During the Sunday Liturgy on 4 November in the wooden church of the Byzantine Catholics, a peasant named Mih\u00e1ly E\u00f6ry noticed that tears flowed from the eyes of the Icon of the Theotokos on the iconostasis. He drew the attention of Cantor J\u00e1nos Moln\u00e1r and then the rest of those present to the extraordinary sight. The weeping continued with varying intensity until 8 December and then stopped. The news of the inexplicable phenomenon soon spread beyond the village to the neighboring settlements. The imperial general stationed at the town of K\u00e1ll\u00f3, which was near to P\u00f3cs and served as the center of local administration, Count Johannes Andreas Corbelli rode out, accompanied by his officers, to P\u00f3cs in order to see the Weeping Mary icon. Taking the painting into his own hands and carefully examining it, he became personally convinced that there was no fraud, as the tears also fell copiously from the eyes of the Mother of God, when he was holding the icon in his hands. He soaked up the tears with his handkerchief. Later, when he reported to the Emperor Leopold and the Empress Eleonora on the incident, he took his handkerchief to Vienna with him.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with Corbelli\u2019s visit, Jakab Kriegsmann the priest of K\u00e1ll\u00f3 also saw the miraculous phenomenon and notified Cardinal Leopold Kollonich, the Archbishop of Esztergom, as well as his own superior, Gy\u00f6rgy Fenesi, the Bishop of Eger. Already at that time it was noted that the icon should not remain in the wooden church of the completely insignificant village of P\u00f3cs. The bishop of Eger Gy\u00f6rgy Fenesi ordered an investigation, which was carried out by his vicar Grand Provost Andr\u00e1s Pettes during the last days of 1696 and the first days of 1697. The official record of the investigation, which is today housed in the Archive of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, contains the testimony of thirty-six witnesses, including those of Reformed and Lutheran soldiers, as well as the sworn written deposition of General Corbelli. We can learn details about the origins of the Icon of Theotokos from the testimony of the eighth witness, Judge L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Csigri. According to Csigri, he had ordered the painting around 1675 from Istv\u00e1n, the younger brother of the parish priest D\u00e1niel Papp. The negotiated price of six forints, however, was considered to be excessive by Csigri\u2019s parents, and so the painting was bought and donated to the church by another inhabitant of P\u00f3cs, L\u0151rinc Hurta.\n\nThe picture was a tempera painting by Istv\u00e1n Papp onto a 50x 70&nbsp;cm maplewood tablet. Painted with relatively simple strokes, the icon belongs to the so-called Hodigitria (the Guide) icons. Mary holds the baby Jesus on her left arm and points to him with her right hand: He is the Way. On the lower part of the icon one can read in Cyrillic letters, \u201cAs a servant of God, I have presented this picture to atone for my sins.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the official investigation, and perhaps even more as a result of the unambiguous testimony of General Corbelli, the Emperor Leopold, in March 1697, formally directed Gy\u00f6rgy Fenesi, the Bishop of Eger, to send the Weeping Icon of P\u00f3cs to Vienna. This decision led to strenuous resistance, not just on the part of the inhabitants of P\u00f3cs, but by the entire population of the country. During these years, a significant part of the country, and most especially Northeastern Hungary could be considered a war zone. The housing and provisioning of the imperial forces participating in the war of liberation from the Turkish occupation imposed enormous burdens on the population. The frequent violence of the housed soldiers further undermined the mood of the country, and as a result an anti-Habsburg uprising broke out at Hegyalja at that time. When the soldiers appeared to take away the P\u00f3cs icon, the locals and the pilgrims felt that once again those in power were stealing from them.\n\nThe forcible removal of the P\u00f3cs icon to Vienna was transformed into an affront to the entire nation. In the declaration of the program of the R\u00e1k\u00f3czy uprising (1703-1711), ''Recrudescunt diutina Inclytae Gentis Hungarae vulnera \u2026,'' the ninetieth of the one hundred grievances was the \u201cremoval and failure to return\u201d the P\u00f3cs painting.\n\nThe process of carrying the Weeping Icon to Vienna lasted for five months. The route touched the towns of Tokaj, B\u00e1rca, Kassa, Eger, Pest, Buda and Gy\u0151r. At these places the picture was publicly exhibited, several copies were made, and Liturgies were celebrated in front of it. The Icon arrived in Vienna on 4 July 1697, where with the leadership of Archbishop Ernst von Trautman 300,000 people received it. At first, the picture was taken to the ruling couple in the Favorita Palace, then it was exhibited in the larger churches of the city for three days each. A famous orator of the day, Abraham a Santa Clara, delivered a memorable sermon on 8 August in which he placed the icon in the context of the war against the Turks. From that point on the prayer for the intercession of the Weeping Icon of the P\u00f3cs Virgin Mother became an important element in the struggle against the Turks. The decisive victory over the Turks at Zenta on 11 September 1697 was interpreted by public opinion obviously to have been due to the intercession of the Virgin Mother of P\u00f3cs. The victory at Zenta further strengthened the cult of the Icon of P\u00f3cs in Vienna. In December 1697, on the First Sunday of Advent, the Icon was placed permanently in the St. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral, where due to the intensity of the cult, soon a copy had to be put on display, and the original was only displayed on special occasions or holidays. In 1946, the copy was stolen and since then the original icon has been located on the altar of the southern side of the nave of the Stephansdom. Although the intensity of the Viennese adoration of the Icon of P\u00f3cs, ''\u201cunsere Liebe Frau von Wien,\u201c'' has not decreased over the centuries, the miracle of the weeping has not been repeated.\n\nDespite the transference of the weeping Icon to Vienna the attention directed at P\u00f3cs did not decline. The little wooden chapel became a pilgrimage site because the pilgrims considered the place of the weeping to be a place selected and blessed by God, independently from the Icon. The fact that the picture no longer shed tears in Vienna further strengthened this view. The place of the Icone of the Weeping Theotokos remained empty for years. Then, probably as the gift of the Bishop of Eger Istv\u00e1n Telekessy, a copy was put in its place. The artist is unknown. The ever larger mass of pilgrims arriving in the settlement engulfed the simple wooden church, which was not in particularly good condition. Already in 1701, some suggested that a collection should be taken up throughout the country for the renovation of the church. M\u00e1ty\u00e1s M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, an inhabitant of P\u00f3cs, received permission from Emperor Leopold to make the collection. We do not know how the fundraising drive went. The restoration of the wooden church may have been the result. It is, however, certain that during the years that followed the church authorities began to consider the building of a new church and a Basilian monastery.\n\nIn 1714, J\u00e1nos J\u00f3zsef Hoderm\u00e1rszky, elected Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs, made such a recommendation at the Vienna court but due to the delayed opinion of the Bishop of Eger the initiative did not prove to be successful. Nevertheless, during the following year the attention focused on P\u00f3cs increased. On 1 August 1715 during the morning liturgical service celebrated by priest Mih\u00e1ly Pap, the cantor J\u00e1nos Moln\u00e1r began to notice that the eyes of the copy placed on the spot of the original Icon began to shed tears. Even on the following day and on the 5th the weeping was witnessed by several dozen people. The priest notified bishop Gy\u00f6rgy Biz\u00e1nczy Gennadius, who was staying in K\u00e1ll\u00f3 and the Bishop of Eger G\u00e1bor Antal Erd\u0151dy, who assigned J\u00e1nos Kiss, Grand Provost of Eger, to investigate the weeping. This inquiry also ended with the conclusion that the miracle was real, and that there was no sign of any manipulation. In a letter of 19 September 1715, the Bishop of Eger recognized the miracle as fact and declared the settlement to be a saint shrine, which now became known as M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs. Although the construction of a new church became ever more urgent after the second weeping and the designation as a saint shrine, the competition for the position of Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs between J\u00f3zsef Hoderm\u00e1rszky and Gy\u00f6rgy Biz\u00e1nczy Gennadius delayed the plans. Simultaneously, the peculiar situation of the Eparchy of Munk\u00e1cs in canon law, according to which the Byzantine Catholic Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs is the vicar in ritual matters to the Bishop of Eger made the execution of the plans even more difficult. Being subordinate to the Bishop of Eger also meant that the Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs could only build a new church in the diocese with the permission of the Bishop of Eger. The Bishop of Eger, however, in this matter kept the interests of the nearby Minorite church at Ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor, which was only a few kilometers away, firmly in sight. The question of building a church in P\u00f3cs only returned to the forefront after the death of Hoderm\u00e1rszky in 1729.\n\nDuring the last days of 1730, Gy\u00f6rgy Gennadius Biz\u00e1nczy initiated negotiations with Nikod\u00e9mus Licky, a master builder of Kassa, on the building of a new church at P\u00f3cs. The Szepes Chamber and a representative of the Aspermont family, which had local feudal jurisdiction, joined the negotiations. They agreed that the church, which was to be constructed, had to be built in light of the needs of the Byzantine rite. Bishop Biz\u00e1nczy sent the plans, which had been drawn up by Liczky, to the Bishop of Eger G\u00e1bor Antal Erd\u0151dy. With his approval the construction began in the spring of 1731. The first phase took two years. In 1733, bishop Biz\u00e1nczy died, and during the years that his successor, Simon Olsavszky, Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs (1733-1737), was in office no progress was achieved. The work was continued during the time of bishop Gy\u00f6rgy G\u00e1bor Blazsovszky (1738-1742), who signed a new contract with Liczky. Only the side walls were, however, completed in the lifetime of the bishop. The church was finally finished by bishop Mih\u00e1ly M\u00e1nuel Olsavszky (1743-1767), who reinvigorated the work starting in 1744. Not only was the church completed and consecrated by 1749 but in the same year the construction of the Basilian monastery began. Nikod\u00e9mus Liczky, the master builder of the church, was commissioned by Bishop Olsavszky to build it. Since the settlement of the Basilians in P\u00f3cs was against the interests of the Franciscans in Ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor, in 1751 the construction of the monastery stopped, and the first Basilian monks could only settle two years later. They assumed responsibility for the shrine church. The first internal painting of the church began in 1748-1749. Bishop Olsavszky gave the commission to Istv\u00e1n V\u00f6r\u00f6s, a painter from Kassa. The decorative paintings he made were painted over at the end of the nineteenth century. However, during the renewal under the leadership of J\u00f3zsef Boksay in 1940, several of its elements were restored, or repainted. The monumental \u201cpanneau\u201d depicting the Cult of the in Hungary, which decorated the wall of the Sanctuary, was created at this time by Man\u00f3 Petrasovszky. In 1748, bishop Olsavszky commissioned a Greek master craftsman, named Constantine, to create the iconostasis of the shrine church. He completed the thirteen meter tall and six meter wide work, richly decorated with carvings, in less than eight months. The painters of the earliest pictures are unknown. In 1785, the basilian painter Mih\u00e1ly Spalinszky was entrusted with the creation of the icons of the iconostasis. Most of the icons he painted were removed by the Spis\u00e1k brothers, who created the new pictures in 1896, and only five remain. The Saint Icon was placed above the central beautiful gates of the iconostasis. The new holy altar on the left side of the nave was finished with the assistance of the Franciscan masters at P\u00e9cs in 1946. The design allows the pilgrims to approach the Saint Icon from the courtyard of the church and without disturbing the services in the church. The new pilgrimage church is able to accommodate much larger numbers of pilgrims. Under the guardianship of the Basilian monks, the Saint Shrine has become the most important pilgrimage site in Eastern Hungary. This made the nineteenth-century expansion possible and necessary. In 1856, the church towers were raised one level, and in 1896 the interior of the church was renewed.\n\nThe third weeping of the Icon, and until now the last, occurred on 3 December 1905. Kelemen G\u00e1vris, Basilian monk, noticed that the face of the Virgin Mother was darker than usual, and a line of tears flowed down her face from the right eye, which ended in a teardrop. The weeping was continuous until 19 December, and then on the last two days of December, a total of eighteen days. The committee investigating the events determined that the weeping had been real.\n\nThe ceremonial services commemorating the 250th anniversary of the first weeping and the 300th anniversary of the Union of Ungv\u00e1r took place under the leadership of Cardinal J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty, the later witness to the faith, in the presence of 250,000 pilgrims on 8 September 1946. The ceremonial procession took place at the beginning of a new era, which would bring many trials for the religious.\n\nIn 1948, the pilgrimage church received a designation of \u201cbasilica minor\u201d from Pope Pius XII but two years later the Basilian monks were expelled from the monastery by the communist authorities and in their place the building was used to house people with psychological ailments. The subsequent pilgrimages were carried out under strict police supervision, and M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs became inaccessible for the pilgrims of neighboring countries. Nevertheless, the significance of the customary processions did not change. All those who were afraid to display their religious identities in the vicinity of their carefully supervised homes often found their way to the sacraments in the safety of the multitudes. The collapse of communism in 1989-1990 brought important changes in the life of the Saint Shrine. M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs was a significant place of celebration during the visit of Pope John Paul II to Hungary in 1991. After several decades it once again became possible to visit as pilgrims in organized groups, and, in 1999, a pilgrimage house was built to accommodate them. The Basilian fathers and sisters were allowed to return to M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs. The infrastructural improvements, which had been neglected during the communist era, are currently underway. The external and internal renovation of the shrine church, as well as the improvement of the basilica\u2019s surroundings, were accomplished with European Union funds during 2008-2010.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hungarian Greek Catholic Church]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.rusyn.org/relmariapocs.html |title=Mariapocs Monastery |author=Ivan Pop |work=World Academy of Rusyn Culture |accessdate=24 April 2011}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://mariapocskegyhely.hu/?q=en/node/322|title=Mariapocs Monastery Official Hungarian Site 2012}}\n*Tam\u00e1s V\u00e9ghse\u0151 - Szilveszter Terdik, ''\u201c\u2026you have foreseen all of my paths\u2026\u201d: Byzantine Rite Catholics in Hungary'', Strasbourg: \u00c9ditions Du Signe, 2012. {{ISBN|978-2-7468-2775-2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131225040709/http://www.tccweb.org/ourchurches.htm The Shrine of M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs - The Carpathian Connection ]\n* [http://mariapocskegyhely.hu/ Official Site of the Sanctuary of M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs]\n* [http://gorogkatolikus.hu/ Official Site of the Hungarian Greek Catholic Church]\n* [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-mariapocs.php Our Lady of Mariap\u00f3cs on \"All About Mary\"] The University of Dayton's Marian Library/International Marian Research Institute (IMRI) is the world's largest repository of books, artwork and artifacts devoted to Mary, the mother of Christ, and a pontifical center of research and scholarship with a vast presence in cyberspace.\n\n{{Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mariapocs}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg County]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox settlement-->\n|settlement_type        = <!--For Town or Village (Leave blank for the default City)-->\n|subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n|subdivision_name       = {{HUN}}\n|coordinates            = {{Coord|47|53|N|22|02|E|region:HU_type:city|display=title, inline}}\n\n<!--If coordinates are filled in above remove ed notes from \"Hungary\" in pushpin_map field to display map-->\n|pushpin_map            = Hungary\n|pushpin_label_position = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    =\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|timezone=[[Central European Time|CET]]\n|utc_offset=+1\n|timezone_DST=[[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST=+2\n|\nofficial_name=M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs|\nsubdivision_type1=[[Counties of Hungary|County]]|\nsubdivision_name1=Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg|\nimage_shield=HUN_M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs_C\u00edmer.svg|\nimage_flag = Flag of M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs.svg|\narea_total_km2=22.09|\npopulation_as_of=2015|\npopulation_total=2153|\npopulation_density_km2=auto|\npostal_code_type=[[Postal code]]|\npostal_code=4326|\narea_code=42|\n}}\n\n[[File:Greek Catholic pilgrimage church, St Michael Archangel in M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs.PNG|thumb|166px|Greek Catholic pilgrimage church, St Michael Archangel in M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs]]\n[[Image:M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs - zar\u00e1ndokhely.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Aerialphotography of the church]]\n\n'''M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs''' is a small town in [[Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg]] county, in the [[Northern Great Plain]] [[region]] of eastern [[Hungary]]. It lies near [[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za]]. It is an important place for pilgrimage. It has a [[Byzantine Catholic]] church, which houses the Weeping  Madonna, an enormous ornate iconostasis that now takes pride of place above the altar. This icon is not the original, but an 18th-century copy. The original one is kept in [[Stephansdom|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in [[Vienna]].<ref>http://mariapocskegyhely.hu/?q=en/node/322</ref>\n\n== The History of M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs ==\nBefore the end of the seventeenth century P\u00f3cs only received mention in the written sources a few times. The first reference was in a document from 1280 that mentions a place called \u201cPolch,\u201d over which the members of the Hont-Pazm\u00e1ny family were disputing. During the fourteenth century, the Gutkeled family purchased Pouch, or Powch. Later, the Bathory family acquired the village, and it became a part of the Ecsed property. While the population was Hungarian during the Middle Ages, beginning with the middle of the seventeenth century a portion of the Ruthenians, spreading South from the Northeastern counties, such as Zempl\u00e9n, S\u00e1ros, Ung, also settled at P\u00f3cs. By the end of the century, the Ruthenians constituted the majority. This fundamentally changed the ratio of the denominations in the town, and from that point on, the Byzantine Catholics became the majority. In addition to them, Latin Catholics and smaller numbers of Reformed and Lutherans also live in the settlement.\n\nP\u00f3cs acquired a national and international reputation in 1696. During the Sunday Liturgy on 4 November in the wooden church of the Byzantine Catholics, a peasant named Mih\u00e1ly E\u00f6ry noticed that tears flowed from the eyes of the Icon of the Theotokos on the iconostasis. He drew the attention of Cantor J\u00e1nos Moln\u00e1r and then the rest of those present to the extraordinary sight. The weeping continued with varying intensity until 8 December and then stopped. The news of the inexplicable phenomenon soon spread beyond the village to the neighboring settlements. The imperial general stationed at the town of K\u00e1ll\u00f3, which was near to P\u00f3cs and served as the center of local administration, Count Johannes Andreas Corbelli rode out, accompanied by his officers, to P\u00f3cs in order to see the Weeping Mary icon. Taking the painting into his own hands and carefully examining it, he became personally convinced that there was no fraud, as the tears also fell copiously from the eyes of the Mother of God, when he was holding the icon in his hands. He soaked up the tears with his handkerchief. Later, when he reported to the Emperor Leopold and the Empress Eleonora on the incident, he took his handkerchief to Vienna with him.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with Corbelli\u2019s visit, Jakab Kriegsmann the priest of K\u00e1ll\u00f3 also saw the miraculous phenomenon and notified Cardinal Leopold Kollonich, the Archbishop of Esztergom, as well as his own superior, Gy\u00f6rgy Fenesi, the Bishop of Eger. Already at that time it was noted that the icon should not remain in the wooden church of the completely insignificant village of P\u00f3cs. The bishop of Eger Gy\u00f6rgy Fenesi ordered an investigation, which was carried out by his vicar Grand Provost Andr\u00e1s Pettes during the last days of 1696 and the first days of 1697. The official record of the investigation, which is today housed in the Archive of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, contains the testimony of thirty-six witnesses, including those of Reformed and Lutheran soldiers, as well as the sworn written deposition of General Corbelli. We can learn details about the origins of the Icon of Theotokos from the testimony of the eighth witness, Judge L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Csigri. According to Csigri, he had ordered the painting around 1675 from Istv\u00e1n, the younger brother of the parish priest D\u00e1niel Papp. The negotiated price of six forints, however, was considered to be excessive by Csigri\u2019s parents, and so the painting was bought and donated to the church by another inhabitant of P\u00f3cs, L\u0151rinc Hurta.\n\nThe picture was a tempera painting by Istv\u00e1n Papp onto a 50x 70 cm maplewood tablet. Painted with relatively simple strokes, the icon belongs to the so-called Hodigitria (the Guide) icons. Mary holds the baby Jesus on her left arm and points to him with her right hand: He is the Way. On the lower part of the icon one can read in Cyrillic letters, \u201cAs a servant of God, I have presented this picture to atone for my sins.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the official investigation, and perhaps even more as a result of the unambiguous testimony of General Corbelli, the Emperor Leopold, in March 1697, formally directed Gy\u00f6rgy Fenesi, the Bishop of Eger, to send the Weeping Icon of P\u00f3cs to Vienna. This decision led to strenuous resistance, not just on the part of the inhabitants of P\u00f3cs, but by the entire population of the country. During these years, a significant part of the country, and most especially Northeastern Hungary could be considered a war zone. The housing and provisioning of the imperial forces participating in the war of liberation from the Turkish occupation imposed enormous burdens on the population. The frequent violence of the housed soldiers further undermined the mood of the country, and as a result an anti-Habsburg uprising broke out at Hegyalja at that time. When the soldiers appeared to take away the P\u00f3cs icon, the locals and the pilgrims felt that once again those in power were stealing from them.\n\nThe forcible removal of the P\u00f3cs icon to Vienna was transformed into an affront to the entire nation. In the declaration of the program of the R\u00e1k\u00f3czy uprising (1703-1711), ''Recrudescunt diutina Inclytae Gentis Hungarae vulnera \u2026,'' the ninetieth of the one hundred grievances was the \u201cremoval and failure to return\u201d the P\u00f3cs painting.\n\nThe process of carrying the Weeping Icon to Vienna lasted for five months. The route touched the towns of Tokaj, B\u00e1rca, Kassa, Eger, Pest, Buda and Gy\u0151r. At these places the picture was publicly exhibited, several copies were made, and Liturgies were celebrated in front of it. The Icon arrived in Vienna on 4 July 1697, where with the leadership of Archbishop Ernst von Trautman 300,000 people received it. At first, the picture was taken to the ruling couple in the Favorita Palace, then it was exhibited in the larger churches of the city for three days each. A famous orator of the day, Abraham a Santa Clara, delivered a memorable sermon on 8 August in which he placed the icon in the context of the war against the Turks. From that point on the prayer for the intercession of the Weeping Icon of the P\u00f3cs Virgin Mother became an important element in the struggle against the Turks. The decisive victory over the Turks at Zenta on 11 September 1697 was interpreted by public opinion obviously to have been due to the intercession of the Virgin Mother of P\u00f3cs. The victory at Zenta further strengthened the cult of the Icon of P\u00f3cs in Vienna. In December 1697, on the First Sunday of Advent, the Icon was placed permanently in the St. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral, where due to the intensity of the cult, soon a copy had to be put on display, and the original was only displayed on special occasions or holidays. In 1946, the copy was stolen and since then the original icon has been located on the altar of the southern side of the nave of the Stephansdom. Although the intensity of the Viennese adoration of the Icon of P\u00f3cs, ''\u201cunsere Liebe Frau von Wien,\u201c'' has not decreased over the centuries, the miracle of the weeping has not been repeated.\n\nDespite the transference of the weeping Icon to Vienna the attention directed at P\u00f3cs did not decline. The little wooden chapel became a pilgrimage site because the pilgrims considered the place of the weeping to be a place selected and blessed by God, independently from the Icon. The fact that the picture no longer shed tears in Vienna further strengthened this view. The place of the Icone of the Weeping Theotokos remained empty for years. Then, probably as the gift of the Bishop of Eger Istv\u00e1n Telekessy, a copy was put in its place. The artist is unknown. The ever larger mass of pilgrims arriving in the settlement engulfed the simple wooden church, which was not in particularly good condition. Already in 1701, some suggested that a collection should be taken up throughout the country for the renovation of the church. M\u00e1ty\u00e1s M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, an inhabitant of P\u00f3cs, received permission from Emperor Leopold to make the collection. We do not know how the fundraising drive went. The restoration of the wooden church may have been the result. It is, however, certain that during the years that followed the church authorities began to consider the building of a new church and a Basilian monastery.\n\nIn 1714, J\u00e1nos J\u00f3zsef Hoderm\u00e1rszky, elected Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs, made such a recommendation at the Vienna court but due to the delayed opinion of the Bishop of Eger the initiative did not prove to be successful. Nevertheless, during the following year the attention focused on P\u00f3cs increased. On 1 August 1715 during the morning liturgical service celebrated by priest Mih\u00e1ly Pap, the cantor J\u00e1nos Moln\u00e1r began to notice that the eyes of the copy placed on the spot of the original Icon began to shed tears. Even on the following day and on the 5th the weeping was witnessed by several dozen people. The priest notified bishop Gy\u00f6rgy Biz\u00e1nczy Gennadius, who was staying in K\u00e1ll\u00f3 and the Bishop of Eger G\u00e1bor Antal Erd\u0151dy, who assigned J\u00e1nos Kiss, Grand Provost of Eger, to investigate the weeping. This inquiry also ended with the conclusion that the miracle was real, and that there was no sign of any manipulation. In a letter of 19 September 1715, the Bishop of Eger recognized the miracle as fact and declared the settlement to be a saint shrine, which now became known as M\u00e1riap\u00f3cs. Although the construction of a new church became ever more urgent after the second weeping and the designation as a saint shrine, the competition for the position of Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs between J\u00f3zsef Hoderm\u00e1rszky and Gy\u00f6rgy Biz\u00e1nczy Gennadius delayed the plans. Simultaneously, the peculiar situation of the Eparchy of Munk\u00e1cs in canon law, according to which the Byzantine Catholic Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs is the vicar in ritual matters to the Bishop of Eger made the execution of the plans even more difficult. Being subordinate to the Bishop of Eger also meant that the Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs could only build a new church in the diocese with the permission of the Bishop of Eger. The Bishop of Eger, however, in this matter kept the interests of the nearby Minorite church at Ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor, which was only a few kilometers away, firmly in sight. The question of building a church in P\u00f3cs only returned to the forefront after the death of Hoderm\u00e1rszky in 1729.\n\nDuring the last days of 1730, Gy\u00f6rgy Gennadius Biz\u00e1nczy initiated negotiations with Nikod\u00e9mus Licky, a master builder of Kassa, on the building of a new church at P\u00f3cs. The Szepes Chamber and a representative of the Aspermont family, which had local feudal jurisdiction, joined the negotiations. They agreed that the church, which was to be constructed, had to be built in light of the needs of the Byzantine rite. Bishop Biz\u00e1nczy sent the plans, which had been drawn up by Liczky, to the Bishop of Eger G\u00e1bor Antal Erd\u0151dy. With his approval the construction began in the spring of 1731. The first phase took two years. In 1733, bishop Biz\u00e1nczy died, and during the years that his successor, Simon Olsavszky, Bishop of Munk\u00e1cs (1733-1737), was in office no progress was achieved. The work was continued during the time of bishop Gy\u00f6rgy G\u00e1bor Blazsovszky (1738-1742), who signed a new contract with Liczky. Only the side walls were, however, completed in the lifetime of the bishop. The church was finally finished by bishop Mih\u00e1ly M\u00e1nuel Olsavszky (1743-1767), who reinvigorated the work starting in 1744. Not only was the church completed and consecrated by 1749 but in the same year the construction of the Basilian monastery began. Nikod\u00e9mus Liczky, the master builder of the church, was commissioned by Bishop Olsavszky to build it. Since the settlement of the Basilians in P\u00f3cs was against the interests of the Franciscans in Ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor, in 1751 the construction of the monastery stopped, and the first Basilian monks could only settle two years later. They assumed responsibility for the shrine church. The first internal painting of the church began in 1748-1749. Bishop Olsavszky gave the commission to Istv\u00e1n V\u00f6r\u00f6s, a painter from Kassa. The decorative paintings he made were painted over at the end of the nineteenth century. However, during the renewal under the leadership of J\u00f3zsef Boksay in 1940, several of its elements were restored, or repainted. The monumental \u201cpanneau\u201d depicting the Cult of the in Hungary, which decorated the wall of the Sanctuary, was created at this time by Man\u00f3 Petrasovszky. In 1748, bishop Olsavszky commissioned a Greek master craftsman, named Constantine, to create the iconostasis of the shrine church. He completed the thirteen meter tall and six meter wide work, richly decorated with carvings, in less than eight months. The painters of the earliest pictures are unknown. In 1785, the basilian painter Mih\u00e1ly Spalinszky was entrusted with the creation of the icons of the iconostasis. Most of the icons he painted were removed by the Spis\u00e1k brothers, who created the new pictures in 1896, and only five remain. The Saint Icon was placed above the central beautiful gates of the iconostasis. The new holy altar on the left side of the nave was finished with the assistance of the Franciscan masters at P\u00e9cs in 1946. The design allows the pilgrims to approach the Saint Icon from the courtyard of the church and without disturbing the services in the church.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
