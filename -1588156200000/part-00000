Voter turnout was considered high despite widespread concerns of violence.]]\n{{voting}}\n'''Voter turnout''' is the percentage of eligible [[voting|voters]] who cast a [[ballot]] in an [[election]]. Eligibility varies by country, and the voting-eligible population should not be confused with the total adult population. Age and citizenship status are often among the criteria used to determine eligibility, but some countries further restrict eligibility based on sex, race, or religion.\n\nAfter increasing for many decades, there has been a trend of decreasing voter turnout in most established [[democracy|democracies]] since the 1980s.<ref name=\"Niemi and Weisberg p. 31\">Niemi and Weisberg p. 31</ref> In general, low turnout is attributed to disillusionment, [[apathy|indifference]], or a sense of futility (the perception that one's vote won't make any difference). According to Stanford University political scientists Adam Bonica and Michael McFaul, there is a consensus among political scientists that \"democracies perform better when more people vote.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/want-americans-to-vote-give-them-the-day-off/2018/10/10/5bde4b1a-ccae-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Want Americans to vote?

As a result, there have been many efforts to increase voter turnout and encourage participation in the political process. In spite of significant study into the issue, scholars are divided on the reasons for the decline. Its cause has been attributed to a wide array of [[economics|economic]], [[demographics|demographic]], cultural, [[technology|technological]], and institutional factors.\n\nDifferent [[country|countries]] have very different voter turnout rates. For example, turnout in the [[2012 United States presidential election|United States 2012 presidential election]] was about 55%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php|title=Voter Turnout in Presidential Elections: 1828-2012|website=The American Presidency Project|access-date=2017-01-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112090401/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php|archivedate=2017-01-12}}</ref>  In both [[Belgium]], which has [[obligatory attendance]],<ref>[http://www.senate.be/doc/const_nl.html#art62 Belgian constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819040116/http://www.senate.be/doc/const_nl.html |date=2007-08-19 }} (in dutch)</ref> and [[Malta]], which does not, participation reaches about 95%.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]]|volume=27|issue=2|last=Hirczy|first=Wolfgang|author-link=Wolfgang Hirczy|date=February 1995|title=Explaining near-universal turnout: The case of Malta|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1995.tb00638.x|pages=255\u2013272}}</ref> In [[Belgium]] there is [[obligatory attendance]] which is often misinterpreted as [[compulsory voting]].<ref>https://www.dekrachtvanjestem.be/bij-u-in-de-klas/politiek-woordenboek/opkomstplicht (in Dutch)</ref>\n\n==Reasons for voting==\nThe chance of any one vote determining the outcome is low.

The formula itself was developed by [[William H. Riker]] and [[Peter Ordeshook]] and published in  \"A Theory of the Calculus of Voting.\" ''American Political Science Review.'' 1968. 62:25\u201342.</ref>\n\n: <math>PB + D > C,</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''P'' is the [[probability]] that an individual's vote will affect the outcome of an election,\n* ''B'' is the perceived benefit that would be received if that person's favored [[political party]] or candidate were elected,\n* ''D'' originally stood for democracy or [[civic duty]], but today represents any social or personal [[Utility|gratification]] an individual gets from voting, and\n* ''C'' is the time, effort, and financial cost involved in voting.\n\nSince ''P'' is virtually zero in most elections, ''PB'' is also near zero, and ''D'' is thus the most important element in motivating people to vote. For a person to vote, these factors must outweigh ''C''. Experimental political science has found that even when ''P'' is likely greater than zero, this term has no effect on voter turnout. Enos and Fowler (2014) conducted a field experiment that exploits the rare opportunity of a tied election for major political office. Informing citizens that the special election to break the tie will be close (meaning a high ''P'' term)  has little mobilizing effect on voter turnout.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Enos|first1=Ryan D.|last2=Fowler|first2=Anthony|title=Pivotality and Turnout: Evidence from a Field Experiment in the Aftermath of a Tied Election|journal=Political Science Research and Methods|date=11 March 2014|pages=1\u201311|url=http://people.hmdc.harvard.edu/~renos/papers/EnosFowlerPivotal/EnosFowlerPivotal.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729153507/http://people.hmdc.harvard.edu/~renos/papers/EnosFowlerPivotal/EnosFowlerPivotal.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nRiker and Ordeshook developed the modern understanding of ''D''. They listed five major forms of gratification that people receive for voting: complying with the social obligation to vote; affirming one's allegiance to the political system; affirming a partisan preference (also known as expressive voting, or voting for a candidate to express support, not to achieve any outcome); affirming one's importance to the political system; and, for those who find politics interesting and entertaining, researching and making a decision.<ref>Riker and Ordeshook, 1968</ref> Other political scientists have since added other motivators and questioned some of Riker and Ordeshook's assumptions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} All of these concepts are inherently imprecise, making it difficult to discover exactly why people choose to vote.\n\nRecently, several scholars have considered the possibility that B includes not only a personal interest in the outcome, but also a concern for the welfare of others in the society (or at least other members of one's favorite group or party).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jankowski | first1 = Richard | year = 2002 | title = Buying a Lottery Ticket to Help the Poor: Altruism, Civic Duty, and Self-Interest in the Decision to Vote | url = | journal = Rationality and Society | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 55\u201377 }}</ref><ref>[[Aaron Edlin|Edlin, Aaron]], [[Andrew Gelman]], and Noah Kaplan. 2007. \"Voting as a Rational Choice: Why and How People Vote to Improve the Well-Being of Others.\" Rationality and Society.</ref> In particular, experiments in which subject [[altruism]] was measured using a [[dictator game]] showed that concern for the well-being of others is a major factor in predicting turnout<ref>[[James H.

Researchers have also identified several strategic motivations for abstention in which a voter is better off by not voting. The most straightforward example of this is known as the No-Show Paradox, which can occur in both large and small electorates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1561&context=faculty_scholarship|title=Hayden, Grant M. \"Abstention: the unexpected power of withholding your vote.\" Conn.

Rev. 43 (2010): 585.|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\nHigh voter turnout is often considered to be desirable, though among political scientists and economists specializing in public choice, the issue is still debated.<ref>See Mark N. Franklin. \"Electoral Engineering and Cross National Turnout Differences.\" ''British Journal of Political Science,'' who attempts to challenge some of this consensus</ref> A high turnout is generally seen as evidence of the [[legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of the current system. [[Dictator]]s have often fabricated high turnouts in [[show election|showcase elections]] for this purpose. For instance, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s 2002 plebiscite was claimed to have had 100% participation.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/10/16/iraq.vote/ CNN \u2013 Saddam gets perfect poll result] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211015236/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/10/16/iraq.vote/ |date=2005-12-11 }}</ref> Opposition parties sometimes boycott votes they feel are unfair or illegitimate, or if the election is for a government that is considered illegitimate. For example, the [[Holy See]] instructed Italian Catholics to boycott national elections for several decades after the [[Italian unification|creation of the state of Italy]].<ref>Katz p. 242</ref> In some countries, there are threats of violence against those who vote, such as during the [[December 2005 Iraqi legislative election|2005 Iraq elections]], an example of [[voter suppression]]. However, some political scientists question the view that high turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system. Mark N. Franklin contends that in [[European Union elections]] opponents of the federation, and of its legitimacy, are just as likely to vote as proponents.<ref name=\"Franklin\">Franklin. \"Electoral Engineering\"</ref>\n\nAssuming that low turnout is a reflection of disenchantment or indifference, a poll with very low turnout may not be an accurate reflection of the [[popular sovereignty|will of the people]]. On the other hand, if low turnout is a reflection of contentment of voters about likely winners or parties, then low turnout is as legitimate as high turnout, as long as the right to vote exists. Still, low turnouts can lead to unequal representation among various parts of the population. In developed countries, non-voters tend to be concentrated in particular demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially the [[youth|young]] and the [[poverty|poor]]. However, in [[India]], which boasts an electorate of more than 814 million people, the opposite is true. The poor, who comprise the majority of the demographic, are more likely to vote than the rich and the middle classes,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and turnout is higher in rural areas than urban areas.<ref>Gupta, D. (2004). [http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/asarc/india_forum/IndiaForum_Gupta-AnalysisIndianElections-Final.pdf An analysis of Indian elections], Appendix D. Australia South Asia Research Centre, Australian National University. Retrieved 2008-11-20.</ref> In low-turnout countries, these groups{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} are often significantly under-represented in elections.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This has the potential to skew policy. For instance, a high voter turnout among the [[old age|elderly]] coupled with a low turnout among the young may lead to more money for retirees' [[health care]], and less for youth employment schemes. Some nations thus have rules that render an election invalid if too few people vote, such as [[Serbia]], where three successive presidential elections were rendered invalid in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Determinants and demographics of turnout==\n{|align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 15px 0 15px;\"\n|+'''Socio-Economic Status and Voting Turnout in USA and India<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Linz\n  | first = Juan\n  |author2=Alfred Stephan |author3=Yogendra Yadav\n   | title = Democracy and Diversity\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | year = 2007\n  | location = New Delhi\n  | pages = 99\n  | isbn = 978-0-19-568368-4}}\n</ref>\n|-\n!USA (1988)\n!India (1988)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Turnout\n|-\n|50.1 %<sup><ref>Federal Election Commission via [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781453.html National Voter Turnout in Federal Elections: 1960\u20132008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109024538/http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781453.html |date=2008-11-09 }}, infoplease.com</ref></sup>\n|62 % \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Income (Quinitile)\n|-\n|Lowest 20%: 36.4%\n|57 %\n|-\n|52\n|65\n|-\n|59\n|73\n|-\n|67\n|60\n|-\n|Highest 20%: 63.1\n|47\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Education\n|-\n|No high school 38% \n|Illiterate 57%\n|-\n|Some high school 43\n|Up to middle 83\n|-\n|High school graduate 57\n|College 57 \n|-\n|Some college 66 \n|Post-graduate 41\n|-\n|College grad 79\n|\n|-\n|Post-graduate 84\n|\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Community (1996)\n|-\n|White 56\n|Hindu 60\n|-\n|Black 50\n|Hindu (OBC) 58\n|-\n|Latino 27\n|[[Scheduled caste|SC]] 75\n|-\n|\n|[[Scheduled tribe|ST]] 59\n|-\n|\n|Muslim 70\n|-\n|\n|Sikh 89\n|}\n\nIn each country, some parts of society are more likely to vote than others.

The most important socioeconomic factor affecting voter turnout is [[education]]. The more educated a person is, the more likely they are to vote, even controlling for other factors that are closely associated with education level, such as [[income]] and [[Social class|class]]. Income has some effect independently: wealthier people are more likely to vote, regardless of their educational background. There is some debate over the effects of [[ethnicity]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and [[gender]]. In the past, these factors unquestionably influenced turnout in many nations, but nowadays the consensus among political scientists is that these factors have little effect in Western democracies when education and income differences are taken into account.<ref name=\"Sigelman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sigelman | first1 = L. | last2 = Roeder | first2 = P.

One issue that arises in continent-spanning nations, such as Australia, [[Canada]], the United States and [[Russia]], is that of [[time zone]]s. Canada banned the broadcasting of election results in any region where the polls have not yet closed; this ban was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. In several recent Australian national elections, the citizens of Western Australia knew which party would form the new government up to an hour before the polling booths in their State closed.\n\n=== Differences between elections ===\nWithin countries there can be important differences in turnout between individual elections\n.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Franses|first2=Ph.-H.|last3=Van Dijk|first3=D.|year=1998|title=Timing of vote decision in first and second order Dutch elections 1978\u20131995.

In the United States, [[off-year elections|midterm congressional elections]] attract far lower turnouts than Congressional elections held concurrently with Presidential ones.<ref>Lijphart. p. 12</ref> [[Runoff election]]s also tend to attract lower turnouts.\n\n==== Competitiveness of races ====\nIn theory, one of the factors that is most likely to increase turnout is a close race. With an intensely polarized electorate and all polls showing a close finish between [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger [[John F. Kerry]], the turnout in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 U.S. presidential election]] was close to 60%, resulting in a record number of popular votes for both candidates (around 62 million for Bush and 59 million for Kerry). However, this race also demonstrates the influence that contentious social issues can have on voter turnout; for example, the voter turnout rate in 1860 wherein anti-[[slavery]] candidate Abraham Lincoln won the election was the second-highest on record (81.2 percent, second only to 1876, with 81.8 percent). Nonetheless, there is evidence to support the argument that predictable election results&mdash;where one vote is not seen to be able to make a difference&mdash;have resulted in lower turnouts, such as [[1996 United States presidential election|Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election]] (which featured the lowest voter turnout in the United States since 1924), the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|United Kingdom general election of 2001]], and the 2005 [[Spanish referendum on the European Constitution]]; all of these elections produced decisive results on a low turnout.\n\nA 2017 NBER paper found that an awareness by the electorate that an election would be close increased turnout: \"Closer elections are associated with greater turnout only when polls exist. Examining within-election variation in newspaper reporting on polls across cantons, we find that close polls increase turnout significantly more where newspapers report on them most.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bursztyn|first=Leonardo|last2=Cantoni|first2=Davide|last3=Funk|first3=Patricia|last4=Yuchtman|first4=Noam|date=June 2017|title=Polls, the Press, and Political Participation: The Effects of Anticipated Election Closeness on Voter Turnout|journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23490 |doi=10.3386/w23490 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n=== Incarceration ===\nOne 2017 study in the ''Journal of Politics'' found that, in the United States, incarceration had no significant impact on turnout in elections: ex-felons did not become less likely to vote after their time in prison.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gerber|first=Alan S.|last2=Huber|first2=Gregory A.|last3=Meredith|first3=Marc|last4=Biggers|first4=Daniel R.|last5=Hendry|first5=David J.|date=2017-07-19|title=Does Incarceration Reduce Voting?

When nations set fixed election dates, these are usually midweek during the spring or autumn to maximize turnout. Variations in turnout between elections tend to be insignificant. It is extremely rare for factors such as competitiveness, weather, and time of year to cause an increase or decrease in turnout of more than five percentage points, far smaller than the differences between groups within society, and far smaller than turnout differentials between nations.<ref name=\":4\">G.

Confusingly, some of the factors that cause internal differences do not seem to apply on a global level. For instance, nations with better-educated populaces do not have higher turnouts. \nThere are two main commonly cited causes of these international differences: culture and institutions. However, there is much debate over the relative impact of the various factors.\n\n===Cultural factors===\nWealth and literacy have some effect on turnout, but are not reliable measures. Countries such as [[Angola]] and [[Ethiopia]] have long had high turnouts, but so have the wealthy states of Europe. The [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]] shows some correlation between higher standards of living and higher turnout. The age of a democracy is also an important factor. Elections require considerable involvement by the population, and it takes some time to develop the cultural habit of voting, and the associated understanding of and confidence in the electoral process. This factor may explain the lower turnouts in the newer democracies of Eastern Europe and Latin America. Much of the impetus to vote comes from a sense of civic duty, which takes time and certain social conditions that can take decades to develop:\n*trust in government;\n*degree of partisanship among the population;\n*interest in politics, and\n*belief in the efficacy of voting.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Powell | first1 = G. Bingham | year = | title = American Voter Turnout in Comparative Perspective | url = | journal = The American Political Science Review | volume = 1986 | issue = | page = 19 }}</ref>\n\nDemographics also have an effect. Older people tend to vote more than youths, so societies where the average age is somewhat higher, such as Europe; have higher turnouts than somewhat younger countries such as the United States. Populations that are more mobile and those that have lower marriage rates tend to have lower turnout. In countries that are highly multicultural and multilingual, it can be difficult for national election campaigns to engage all sectors of the population.\n\nThe nature of elections also varies between nations. In the United States, [[negative campaigning]] and character attacks are more common than elsewhere, potentially suppressing turnouts. The focus placed on [[get out the vote]] efforts and mass-marketing can have important effects on turnout. Partisanship is an important impetus to turnout, with the highly partisan more likely to vote. Turnout tends to be higher in nations where political allegiance is closely linked to class, ethnic, linguistic, or religious loyalties.<ref>Powell \"Thirty Democracies.\" p. 14</ref> Countries where [[multiparty]] systems have developed also tend to have higher turnouts. Nations with a party specifically geared towards the [[working class]] will tend to have higher turnouts among that class than in countries where voters have only [[big tent]] parties, which try to appeal to all the voters, to choose from.<ref>Powell. p. 13</ref> A four-wave panel study conducted during the 2010 Swedish national election campaign, show (1) clear differences in media use between age groups and (2) that both political social media use and attention to political news in traditional media increase political engagement over time.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Age and the effects of news media attention and social media use on political interest and participation: Do social media function as leveller?|last1=Kristoffer Holt|last2=Adam Shehata|last3=Jesper Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck|last4=Elisabet Ljungberg|date=1 February 2013|journal=European Journal of Communication|volume=28|issue=1|pages=19\u201334|doi=10.1177/0267323112465369}}</ref>\n\n===Institutional factors===\nInstitutional factors have a significant impact on voter turnout. Rules and laws are also generally easier to change than attitudes, so much of the work done on how to improve voter turnout looks at these factors. Making [[compulsory voting|voting compulsory]] has a direct and dramatic effect on turnout. Simply making it easier for candidates to stand through easier [[nomination rules]] is believed to increase voting. Conversely, adding barriers, such as a separate [[voter registration|registration]] process, can suppress turnout. The salience of an election, the effect that a vote will have on policy, and its proportionality, how closely the result reflects the will of the people, are two structural factors that also likely have important effects on turnout.\n\n====Voter registration====\nThe modalities of how electoral registration is conducted can also affect turnout. For example, until \"rolling registration\" was introduced in the United Kingdom, there was no possibility of the electoral register being updated during its currency, or even amending genuine mistakes after a certain cut off date. The register was compiled in October, and would come into force the next February, and would remain valid until the next January. The electoral register would become progressively more out of date during its period of validity, as electors moved or died (also people studying or working away from home often had difficulty voting). This meant that elections taking place later in the year tended to have lower turnouts than those earlier in the year. The introduction of rolling registration where the register is updated monthly has reduced but not entirely eliminated this issue since the process of amending the register is not automatic, and some individuals do not join the electoral register until the annual October compilation process.  In comparison, the introduction of individual electoral registration in the UK was thought to have negatively affected the number of eligible citizens on the register and voter turnout.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Toby S.|date=2014|title=The Spill-Over and Displacement Effects of Implementing Election Administration Reforms: Introducing Individual Electoral Registration in Britain|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=67|issue=2|pages=281\u2013305|doi=10.1093/pa/gss032}}</ref>\n\nAnother country with a highly efficient registration process is France. At the age of eighteen, all youth are automatically registered. Only new residents and citizens who have moved are responsible for bearing the costs and inconvenience of updating their registration. Similarly, in [[Nordic countries]], all citizens and residents are included in the official population register, which is simultaneously a tax list, voter registration, and membership in the universal health system. Residents are required by law to report any change of address to register within a short time after moving. This is also the system in [[Germany]] (but without the membership in the health system).\n\nThe elimination of registration as a separate bureaucratic step can result in higher voter turnout. This is reflected in statistics from the United States Bureau of Census, 1982\u20131983. States that have same day registration, or no registration requirements, have a higher voter turnout than the national average. At the time of that report, the four states that allowed election day registration were Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maine, and Oregon. Since then, Idaho and Maine have changed to allow same day registration. North Dakota is the only state that requires no registration.<ref>U.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1982\u201383, Table no.804, p.492</ref>\n\n====Compulsory voting====\nOne of the strongest factors affecting voter turnout is whether voting is [[compulsory voting|compulsory]]. In [[Australia]], voter registration and attendance at a polling booth have been mandatory since the 1920s, with [[2016 Australian federal election|the most recent federal election in 2016]] having turnout figures of 91% for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 91.9% for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]].<ref>[https://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/research/files/voter-turnout-2016.pdf] 2016 House of Representatives and Senate elections</ref> Several other countries have similar laws, generally with somewhat reduced levels of enforcement. If a [[Bolivia]]n voter fails to participate in an election, the citizen may be denied withdrawal of their salary from the bank for three months.<ref>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/apathy/story/0,,1521096,00.html The Guardian ''Compulsory voting around the world'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210122003/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/apathy/story/0,,1521096,00.html |date=2006-12-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Mexico]] and [[Brazil]], existing sanctions for non-voting are minimal or are rarely enforced. When enforced, compulsion has a dramatic effect on turnout.\n\nIn [[Venezuela]] and the [[Netherlands]] compulsory voting has been rescinded, resulting in substantial decreases in turnout.\n\nIn [[Greece]] voting is compulsory, however there are practically no sanctions for those who do not vote.\n\nIn [[Luxembourg]] voting is compulsory, too, but not strongly enforced. In Luxembourg only voters below the age of 75 and those who are not physically handicapped or chronically ill have the legal obligation to vote.\n\nIn [[Belgium]] attendance is required and absence is punishable by law.\n\nSanctions for non-voting behaviour were foreseen sometimes even in absence of a formal requirement\nto vote. In [[Italy]] the Constitution describes voting as a duty (art. 48), though electoral participation is not obligatory. From 1946 to 1992, thus, the Italian electoral law included light sanctions for non-voters (lists of non-voters were posted at polling stations).<ref>[[Sarah Birch]], ''[http://i.unu.edu/media/publication/000/002/224/full_participation_web.pdf Full Participation. A comparative study of compulsory voting]'', United Nations University, p.5</ref> Turnout rates have not declined substantially since 1992 in Italy, though, pointing to other factors than compulsory voting to explain high electoral participation.\n\n====Salience====\nMark N. Franklin argues that salience, the perceived effect that an individual vote will have on how the country is run, has a significant effect on turnout. He presents [[Switzerland]] as an example of a nation with low salience. The nation's administration is highly decentralized, so that the federal government has limited powers. The government invariably consists of a coalition of parties, and the power wielded by a party is far more closely linked to its position relative to the coalition than to the number of votes it received. Important decisions are placed before the population in a [[referendum]]. Individual votes for the federal legislature are thus unlikely to have a significant effect on the nation, which probably explains the low average turnouts in that country. By contrast [[Malta]], with one of the world's highest voter turnouts, has a single legislature that holds a near monopoly on political power. Malta has a [[two-party system]] in which a small swing in votes can completely alter the executive.<ref>Mark N. Franklin. \"Electoral Participation.\" in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior'' p. 87</ref> On the other hand, countries with a two-party system can experience low turnout if large numbers of potential voters perceive little real difference between the main parties. Voters' perceptions of fairness also have an important effect on salience. If voters feel that the result of an election is more likely to be determined by fraud and corruption than by the will of the people, fewer people will vote.<ref>Richard S. Katz. Democracy and Elections. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\n====Proportionality====\nAnother institutional factor that may have an important effect is proportionality, i.e., how closely the legislature reflects the views of the populace. Under a pure [[proportional representation]] system the composition of the legislature is fully proportional to the votes of the populace and a voter can be sure that of being represented in parliament, even if only from the opposition benches. (However many nations that use a form of proportional representation in elections depart from pure proportionality by stipulating that smaller parties are not supported by a certain threshold percentage of votes cast will be excluded from parliament.) By contrast, a voting system based on single seat constituencies (such as the [[Plurality electoral system|plurality system]] used in North America, the UK and India) will tend to result in many non-competitive electoral districts, in which the outcome is seen by voters as a foregone conclusion.\n\nProportional systems tend to produce multiparty [[coalition government]]s. This may reduce salience, if voters perceive that they have little influence over which parties are included in the coalition.<ref>Robert W. Jackman and Ross A. Miller. \"Voter Turnout in the Industrial Democracies During the 1980s.\" in ''Elections and Voting Behaviour: New Challenges, New Perspectives.'' p. 308</ref> For instance, after the [[2005 German election]], the creation of the executive not only expressed the will of the voters of the majority party but also was the result of political deal-making. Although there is no guarantee, this is lessened as the parties usually state with whom they will favour a coalition after the elections.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nPolitical scientists are divided on whether proportional representation increases voter turnout, though in countries with proportional representation voter turnout is higher.<ref>Katz p. 240</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Arend |last=Lijphart |title=Unequal Participation: Democracy's Unresolved Dilemma |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |volume=91 |issue=1 |date=March 1997 |pages=1\u201314 |doi=10.2307/2952255 |jstor=2952255 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.1990.tb00227.x | volume=18 | title=Does proportional representation foster voter turnout? | year=1990 | journal=European Journal of Political Research | pages=167\u2013181 | last1 = Blais | first1 = Andre}}</ref> There are other systems that attempt to preserve both salience and proportionality, for example, the [[Mixed member proportional representation]] system in [[New Zealand]] (in operation since 1996), Germany, and several other countries. However, these tend to be complex electoral systems, and in some cases complexity appears to suppress voter turnout.<ref>Powell \"Thirty Democracies.\" p. 12</ref> The dual system in Germany, though, seems to have had no negative impact on voter turnout.\n\n====Ease of voting====\nEase of voting is a factor in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through separate [[voter registration]] procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts.<ref>Richard G. Niemi and Herbert F. Weisberg. ''Controversies in Voting Behavior'' p. 31</ref> Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available [[absentee voting|absentee polling]] and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day.{{which| which nations enact these measures|date=March 2011}} In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as [[India]], elections often take several days. Some countries have considered [[Internet voting]] as a possible solution. In other countries, like [[France]], voting is held on the weekend, when most voters are away from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.\n\nMany countries have looked into Internet voting as a possible solution for low voter turnout.  Some countries like France and Switzerland use Internet voting.  However, it has only been used sparingly by a few states in the US. This is due largely to security concerns.  For example, the US Department of Defense looked into making Internet voting secure, but cancelled the effort.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/28/internet-voting-not-ready-prime-time-security-risks/79456776/|title = Internet voting is just too hackable, say security experts|website = USA TODAY|access-date = 2016-03-22|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160323102823/http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/28/internet-voting-not-ready-prime-time-security-risks/79456776/|archivedate = 2016-03-23}}</ref>  The idea would be that voter turnout would increase because people could cast their vote from the comfort of their own homes, although the few experiments with Internet voting have produced mixed results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voting Drops 83 Percent In All-Digital Election|url=http://www.kitv.com/Voting-Drops-83-Percent-In-All-Digital-Election/-/8906042/5389636/-/8fij32z/-/index.html|work=26 May 2009|publisher=KITV News|accessdate=2 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104210641/http://www.kitv.com/Voting-Drops-83-Percent-In-All-Digital-Election/-/8906042/5389636/-/8fij32z/-/index.html|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Voter fatigue====\n{{Main|Voter fatigue}}\nVoter fatigue can lower turnout. If there are many elections in close succession, voter turnout will decrease as the public tires of participating. In low-turnout Switzerland, the average voter is invited to go to the polls an average of seven times a year; the United States has frequent elections, with two votes per year on average, if one includes all levels of government as well as [[primary election|primaries]].<ref>Franklin \"Electoral Participation.\" p. 98</ref> Holding multiple elections at the same time can increase turnout; however, presenting voters with massive multipage ballots, as occurs in some parts of the United States, can reduce turnouts.<ref>Arend Lijphart. \"[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/gpa/wang_files/Dem15.pdf Unequal Participation: Democracy's Unresolved Dilemma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326225342/http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/gpa/wang_files/Dem15.pdf |date=2006-03-26 }}.\" ''American Political Science Review.''</ref>\n\n==== Voter pledges ====\nA 2018 study found that \"young people who pledge to vote are more likely to turn out than those who are contacted using standard Get-Out-the-Vote materials. Overall, pledging to vote increased voter turnout by 3.7 points among all subjects and 5.6 points for people who had never voted before.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=Mia|last2=Schaffner|first2=Brian F.|last3=Prevost|first3=Alicia|date=2018-05-29|title=Walking the walk?

There are difficulties in measuring both the numerator, the number of voters who cast votes, and the denominator, the number of voters eligible to vote.\n\nFor the numerator, it is often assumed that the number of voters who went to the polls should equal the number of ballots cast, which in turn should equal the number of votes counted, but this is not the case.  Not all voters who arrive at the polls necessarily cast ballots.  Some may be turned away because they are ineligible, some may be turned away improperly, and some who sign the voting register may not actually cast ballots.  Furthermore, voters who do cast ballots may abstain, deliberately voting for nobody, or they may [[spoiled ballot|spoil]] their votes, either accidentally or as an act of protest.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] distinguishes between \"valid vote turnout\", which excludes spoilt ballots, and \"ballot box turnout\", which does not.\n\nIn the United States, it has been common to report turnout as the sum of votes for the top race on the ballot, because not all jurisdictions report the actual number of people who went to the polls nor the number of undervotes or overvotes.<ref name=\"eac.gov\">Kimball W.

In the United States, for example, there is no accurate registry of exactly who is eligible to vote, since only about 70\u201375% of people choose to register themselves.<ref>Katz p. 239</ref> Thus, turnout has to be calculated based on population estimates. Some political scientists have argued that these measures do not properly account for the large number of [[Green card|Legal Permanent Residents]],<ref>https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/population-estimates/LPR</ref> [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]], disenfranchised [[felony|felon]]s and persons who are considered 'mentally incompetent' in the United States, and that American voter turnout is higher than is normally reported.<ref>Niemi and Weisberg \"Introduction.\" ''Controversies in Voting Behavior.'' p. 25</ref> Even in countries with fewer restrictions on the franchise, VAP turnout can still be biased by large numbers of non-citizen residents, often under-reporting turnout by as much as 10 percentage points.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wigginton|first=Michael J.|last2=Stockemer|first2=Daniel|last3=van Schouwen|first3=Jasmine|date=30 July 2019|title=International Migration and Turnout Bias|journal=PS: Political Science & Politics|language=en|pages=33\u201338|doi=10.1017/S104909651900101X|issn=1049-0965|hdl=10393/39655|volume=53|hdl-access=free}}</ref>   Professor Michael P. McDonald constructed an estimation of the turnout against the '[[voting eligible population]]' (VEP), instead of the '[[voting age population]]' (VAP). For the American presidential elections of 2004, turnout could then be expressed as 60.32% of VEP, rather than 55.27% of VAP.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}<ref>{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}McDonald \"2004 Voting-Age and Voting-Eligible Population Estimates and Voter Turnout\" {{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Voter_Turnout_2004.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419061428/http://elections.gmu.edu/Voter_Turnout_2004.htm |archivedate=2008-04-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn New Zealand, registration is supposed to be universal.  This does not eliminate uncertainty in the eligible population because this system has been shown to be unreliable, with a large number of eligible but unregistered citizens, creating inflated turnout figures.<ref>Katz p. 334</ref>\n\nA second problem with turnout measurements lies in the way turnout is computed.  One can count the number of voters, or one can count the number of ballots, and in a vote-for-one race, one can sum the number of votes for each candidate.  These are not necessarily identical because not all voters who sign in at the polls necessarily cast ballots, although they ought to, and because voters may cast [[spoiled ballot]]s.\n\n==Trends of decreasing turnout since the 1980s==\n[[File:Voter turnout by country.png|right|frame|Change in voter turnout over time for five selected countries]]\nOver the last 40 years,{{when|date=July 2018}} voter turnout has been steadily declining in the established democracies.<ref name=\"Niemi and Weisberg p. 31\"/> This trend has been significant in the United States, Western Europe, Japan and Latin America. It has been a matter of concern and controversy among political scientists for several decades. During this same period, other forms of political participation have also declined, such as voluntary participation in political parties and the attendance of observers at town meetings. The decline in voting has also accompanied a general decline in civic participation, such as church attendance, membership in professional, fraternal, and student societies, youth groups, and parent-teacher associations.<ref>Robert D. Putnam \"Tuning In, Tuning Out: The Strange Disappearance of Social Capital in America.\" in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior'' p. 40</ref> At the same time, some forms of participation have increased. People have become far more likely to participate in [[boycott]]s, [[protest|demonstration]]s, and to donate to political campaigns.<ref>Niemi and Weisberg. p. 30</ref>\n\nBefore the late 20th century, [[suffrage]] \u2014 the right to vote \u2014 was so limited in most nations that turnout figures have little relevance to today. One exception was the United States, which had near universal white male suffrage by 1840. The U.S. saw a steady rise in voter turnout during the century, reaching its peak in the years after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Turnout declined from the 1890s until the 1930s, then increased again until 1960 before beginning its current long decline.<ref>Walter Dean Burnham. \"The Appearance and Disappearance of the American Voter.\"</ref> In Europe, voter turnouts steadily increased from the introduction of universal suffrage before peaking in the mid-to-late 1960s, with modest declines since then. These declines have been smaller than those in the United States, and in some European countries turnouts have remained stable and even slightly increased. Globally, voter turnout has decreased by about five percentage points over the last four decades.<ref>Lijphart p. 6</ref>\n\n===Reasons for decline===\n{{see also|Get out the vote}}\n[[File:GOTV.png|thumb|Methods of raising turnout.]]\n{{globalize|section|US|date=December 2019}}\n\nMany causes have been proposed for this decline; a combination of factors is most likely. When asked why they do not vote, many people report that they have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies have consistently shown that the amount of [[Free time|leisure time]] has not decreased. According to a study by the Heritage Foundation, Americans report on average an additional 7.9 hours of leisure time per week since 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/08/upwards-leisure-mobility-americans-work-less-and-have-more-leisure-time-than-ever-before|title=Upwards Leisure Mobility: Americans Work Less and Have More LeisureTime than Ever Before|work=The Heritage Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105210848/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/08/upwards-leisure-mobility-americans-work-less-and-have-more-leisure-time-than-ever-before|archivedate=2016-11-05}}</ref> Furthermore, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, increases in wages and employment actually decrease voter turnout in gubernatorial elections and do not affect national races.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Kerwin Kofi|last2=Jr|first2=Melvin Stephens|date=2013 |title=Employment, Wages, and Voter Turnout |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=111\u201343 |doi=10.1257/app.5.4.111 |citeseerx=10.1.1.595.1201}}</ref> Potential voters' perception that they are busier is common and might be just as important as a real decrease in leisure time. Geographic mobility has increased over the last few decades. There are often barriers to voting in a district where one is a recent arrival, and a new arrival is likely to know little about the local candidate and local issues. [[Francis Fukuyama]] has blamed the [[welfare state]], arguing that the decrease in turnout has come shortly after the government became far more involved in people's lives. He argues in ''Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity'' that the [[social capital]] essential to high voter turnouts is easily dissipated by government actions. However, on an international level those states with the most extensive social programs tend to be the ones with the highest turnouts. Richard Sclove argues in ''Democracy and Technology'' that technological developments in society such as \"automobilization,\" suburban living, and \"an explosive proliferation of home entertainment devices\" have contributed to a loss of community, which in turn has weakened participation in civic life.<ref>Sclove p. 241</ref>{{Nonspecific|date=September 2009}}\n\nTrust in government and in politicians has decreased in many nations. However, the first signs of decreasing voter turnout occurred in the early 1960s, which was before the major upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s. [[Robert D. Putnam]] argues that the collapse in civil engagement is due to the introduction of television. In the 1950s and 1960s, television quickly became the main leisure activity in developed nations. It replaced earlier more social entertainments such as bridge clubs, church groups, and bowling leagues. Putnam argues that as people retreated within their homes and general social participation declined, so too did voting.<ref>Putnam p. 61</ref>\n\n====United States====\n\nRosenstone and Hansen contend that the decline in turnout in the United States is the product of a change in campaigning strategies as a result of the so-called new media. Before the introduction of television, almost all of a party's resources would be directed towards intensive local campaigning and [[get out the vote]] initiatives. In the modern era, these resources have been redirected to expensive media campaigns in which the potential voter is a passive participant.<ref>Steven J. Rosenstone and John Mark Hansen. \"Solving the Puzzle of Participation in Electoral Politics.\" p. 73</ref> During the same period, [[negative campaigning]] has become ubiquitous in the United States and elsewhere and has been shown to impact voter turnout.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00522.x|title = When Does Negativity Demobilize?

The evidence for this is mixed: elections involving highly unpopular incumbents generally have high turnout; some studies have found that mudslinging and character attacks reduce turnout, but that substantive attacks on a party's record can increase it.<ref>Niemi and Weisberg p. 30.</ref>\n\nPart of the reason for voter decline in the recent 2016 election is likely because of restrictive voting laws around the country. Brennan Center for Justice reported that in 2016 fourteen states passed restrictive voting laws.<ref>Regan, Michael D. \"Why Is Voter Turnout so Low in the U.S.?\" PBS. PBS, 6 Nov. 2016. Web. 13 Dec. 2016.</ref> Examples of these laws are photo ID mandates, narrow times for early voter, and limitations on voter registration. Barbour and Wright also believe that one of the causes is restrictive voting laws but they call this system of laws regulating the electorate.<ref name=\"Barbour, Christine 2016\">Barbour, Christine, and Gerald C. Wright. KEEPING THE REPUBLIC: Power and Citizenship in American Politics. Place of Publication Not Identified: CQ, 2016. Print.</ref> The Constitution gives states the power to make decisions regarding restrictive voting laws. In 2008 the Supreme Court made a crucial decision regarding Indiana's [[voter ID law]] in saying that it does not violate the constitution. Since then almost half of the states have passed restrictive voting laws. These laws contribute to Barbour and Wrights idea of the rational nonvoter. This is someone who does not vote because the benefits of them not voting outweighs the cost to vote.<ref name=\"Barbour, Christine 2016\"/> These laws add to the \u201ccost\u201d of voting, or reason that make it more difficult and to vote. In the United States programs such as MTV's \"[[Rock the Vote]]\" and the \"[[Vote or Die]]\" initiatives have been introduced to increase turnouts of those between the ages of 18 and 25. A number of governments and [[Election management body|electoral commissions]] have also launched efforts to boost turnout. For instance [[Elections Canada]] has launched mass media campaigns to encourage voting prior to elections, as have bodies in Taiwan and the United Kingdom.\n\nGoogle extensively studied the causes behind low voter turnout in the United States, and argues that one of the key reasons behind lack of voter participation is the so-called \"interested bystander\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Krontiris|first=Kate|last2=Webb|first2=John|last3=Chapman|first3=Chris|date=2015-01-01|title=Understanding America's Interested Bystander: A Complicated Relationship with Civic Duty|url=http://research.google.com/pubs/pub44180.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221164901/https://research.google.com/pubs/pub44180.html|archivedate=2016-12-21}}</ref> According to Google's study, 48.9% of adult Americans can be classified as \"interested bystanders\", as they are politically informed but are reticent to involve themselves in the civic and political sphere.

For instance, the establishment of the European Union created an international platform above the national governments, and yet voters can only vote via their national parties for the European parliament, and not directly via European parties. Meanwhile, because the national governments gave more powers to 'Europe' less power remained for parties at that national level and for their voters. Therefore, the added level of governance did no longer coincide with the highest participation level for voters, while 'at home' the national parties had given (part of) their national powers away to Brussels. It should be common logic that voters given lesser importance would not be coming to the polls like before.\n\nIn a different example of international affairs, the World Trade Organization (1995) created an economic platform that is once-removed from actual voter participation. Already in the eighties, the decision by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher to liberalize their markets was swiftly followed by other nations doing the same. They followed suit in liberalizing their markets to keep their economies viable places for international investments. In effect, the importance of the economic tools were made more important than before and this helped to diminish the importance of the political tools. Again, voters reflected their diminished importance by staying home in larger numbers.\n\nThe more international treaties are put in place, the less power (or control) is left for voters. As such, globalization may have contributed to a lower voter turnout since the parameters of voters' power have been restricted to making decisions only on items of lesser importance.\n\nIt has been argued that democratic consolidation (the stabilization of new democracies) contributes to the decline in voter turnout. A 2017 study challenges this however.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kostelka|first=Filip|date=July 2017|title=Does Democratic Consolidation Lead to a Decline in Voter Turnout?

In a 2001 article in the [[American Political Science Review]], Michael McDonald and Samuel Popkin argued, that at least in the United States, voter turnout since 1972 has not actually declined when calculated for those eligible to vote, what they term the voting-eligible population.<ref>Michael McDonald and Samual Popkin. \"The Myth of the Vanishing Voter\" in ''American Political Science Review.''</ref>  In 1972, noncitizens and ineligible felons (depending on state law) constituted about 2% of the voting-age population. By 2004, ineligible voters constituted nearly 10%. Ineligible voters are not evenly distributed across the country \u2013 20% of California's voting-age population is ineligible to vote \u2013 which confounds comparisons of states. Furthermore, they argue that an examination of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey shows that turnout is low but not declining among the youth, when the high youth turnout of 1972 (the first year 18- to 20-year-olds were eligible to vote in most states) is removed from the trendline.\n\n==See also==\n*[[I-Voting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Franklin, Mark N. \"Electoral Engineering and Cross National Turnout Differences.\" ''British Journal of Political Science.'' 1999\n*Kanazawa, Satoshi. \"A Possible Solution to the Paradox of Voter Turnout.\" ''The Journal of Politics.''\n*Lijphart, Arend. \"Unequal Participation: Democracy's Unresolved Dilemma.\" ''American Political Science Review.'' vol. 91 (March 1997): 1\u201314. p.&nbsp;12\n*McDonald, Michael and Samuel Popkin. \"The Myth of the Vanishing Voter.\" ''American Political Science Review.'' 2001.\n*Niemi, Richard G. and Herbert F.

Eligibility varies by country, and the voting-eligible population should not be confused with the total adult population. Age and citizenship status are often among the criteria used to determine eligibility, but some countries further restrict eligibility based on sex, race, or religion.\n\nAfter increasing for many decades, there has been a trend of decreasing voter turnout in most established [[democracy|democracies]] since the 1980s.<ref name=\"Niemi and Weisberg p. 31\">Niemi and Weisberg p. 31</ref> In general, low turnout is attributed to disillusionment, [[apathy|indifference]], or a sense of futility (the perception that one's vote won't make any difference). According to Stanford University political scientists Adam Bonica and Michael McFaul, there is a consensus among political scientists that \"democracies perform better when more people vote.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/want-americans-to-vote-give-them-the-day-off/2018/10/10/5bde4b1a-ccae-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Want Americans to vote?

As a result, there have been many efforts to increase voter turnout and encourage participation in the political process. In spite of significant study into the issue, scholars are divided on the reasons for the decline. Its cause has been attributed to a wide array of [[economics|economic]], [[demographics|demographic]], cultural, [[technology|technological]], and institutional factors.\n\nDifferent [[country|countries]] have very different voter turnout rates.

For a person to vote, these factors must outweigh ''C''. Experimental political science has found that even when ''P'' is likely greater than zero, this term has no effect on voter turnout. Enos and Fowler (2014) conducted a field experiment that exploits the rare opportunity of a tied election for major political office. Informing citizens that the special election to break the tie will be close (meaning a high ''P'' term)  has little mobilizing effect on voter turnout.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Enos|first1=Ryan D.|last2=Fowler|first2=Anthony|title=Pivotality and Turnout: Evidence from a Field Experiment in the Aftermath of a Tied Election|journal=Political Science Research and Methods|date=11 March 2014|pages=1\u201311|url=http://people.hmdc.harvard.edu/~renos/papers/EnosFowlerPivotal/EnosFowlerPivotal.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729153507/http://people.hmdc.harvard.edu/~renos/papers/EnosFowlerPivotal/EnosFowlerPivotal.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nRiker and Ordeshook developed the modern understanding of ''D''. They listed five major forms of gratification that people receive for voting: complying with the social obligation to vote; affirming one's allegiance to the political system; affirming a partisan preference (also known as expressive voting, or voting for a candidate to express support, not to achieve any outcome); affirming one's importance to the political system; and, for those who find politics interesting and entertaining, researching and making a decision.<ref>Riker and Ordeshook, 1968</ref> Other political scientists have since added other motivators and questioned some of Riker and Ordeshook's assumptions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} All of these concepts are inherently imprecise, making it difficult to discover exactly why people choose to vote.\n\nRecently, several scholars have considered the possibility that B includes not only a personal interest in the outcome, but also a concern for the welfare of others in the society (or at least other members of one's favorite group or party).<ref>Jankowski, Richard. 2002. \"Buying a Lottery Ticket to Help the Poor: Altruism, Civic Duty, and Self-Interest in the Decision to Vote.\" Rationality and Society 14(1): 55\u201377.</ref><ref>[[Aaron Edlin|Edlin, Aaron]], [[Andrew Gelman]], and Noah Kaplan. 2007. \"Voting as a Rational Choice: Why and How People Vote to Improve the Well-Being of Others.\" Rationality and Society.</ref> In particular, experiments in which subject [[altruism]] was measured using a [[dictator game]] showed that concern for the well-being of others is a major factor in predicting turnout<ref>[[James H.

Researchers have also identified several strategic motivations for abstention in which a voter is better off by not voting. The most straightforward example of this is known as the No-Show Paradox, which can occur in both large and small electorates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1561&context=faculty_scholarship|title=Hayden, Grant M. \"Abstention: the unexpected power of withholding your vote.\" Conn.

Franklin. \"Electoral Engineering and Cross National Turnout Differences.\" ''British Journal of Political Science,'' who attempts to challenge some of this consensus</ref> A high turnout is generally seen as evidence of the [[legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of the current system. [[Dictator]]s have often fabricated high turnouts in [[show election|showcase elections]] for this purpose. For instance, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s 2002 plebiscite was claimed to have had 100% participation.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/10/16/iraq.vote/ CNN \u2013 Saddam gets perfect poll result] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211015236/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/10/16/iraq.vote/ |date=2005-12-11 }}</ref> Opposition parties sometimes boycott votes they feel are unfair or illegitimate, or if the election is for a government that is considered illegitimate. For example, the [[Holy See]] instructed Italian Catholics to boycott national elections for several decades after the [[Italian unification|creation of the state of Italy]].<ref>Katz p. 242</ref> In some countries, there are threats of violence against those who vote, such as during the [[December 2005 Iraqi legislative election|2005 Iraq elections]], an example of [[voter suppression]]. However, some political scientists question the view that high turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system. Mark N. Franklin contends that in [[European Union elections]] opponents of the federation, and of its legitimacy, are just as likely to vote as proponents.<ref name=\"Franklin\">Franklin. \"Electoral Engineering\"</ref>\n\nAssuming that low turnout is a reflection of disenchantment or indifference, a poll with very low turnout may not be an accurate reflection of the [[popular sovereignty|will of the people]]. On the other hand, if low turnout is a reflection of contentment of voters about likely winners or parties, then low turnout is as legitimate as high turnout, as long as the right to vote exists. Still, low turnouts can lead to unequal representation among various parts of the population. In developed countries, non-voters tend to be concentrated in particular demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially the [[youth|young]] and the [[poverty|poor]]. However, in [[India]], which boasts an electorate of more than 814 million people, the opposite is true. The poor, who comprise the majority of the demographic, are more likely to vote than the rich and the middle classes,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and turnout is higher in rural areas than urban areas.<ref>Gupta, D.

For instance, a high voter turnout among the [[old age|elderly]] coupled with a low turnout among the young may lead to more money for retirees' [[health care]], and less for youth employment schemes.

The most important socioeconomic factor affecting voter turnout is [[education]]. The more educated a person is, the more likely they are to vote, even controlling for other factors that are closely associated with education level, such as [[income]] and [[Social class|class]]. Income has some effect independently: wealthier people are more likely to vote, regardless of their educational background. There is some debate over the effects of [[ethnicity]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and [[gender]]. In the past, these factors unquestionably influenced turnout in many nations, but nowadays the consensus among political scientists is that these factors have little effect in Western democracies when education and income differences are taken into account.<ref name=\"Sigelman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sigelman | first1 = L. | last2 = Roeder | first2 = P.

One issue that arises in continent-spanning nations, such as Australia, [[Canada]], the United States and [[Russia]], is that of [[time zone]]s. Canada banned the broadcasting of election results in any region where the polls have not yet closed; this ban was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].

In the United States, [[off-year elections|midterm congressional elections]] attract far lower turnouts than Congressional elections held concurrently with Presidential ones.<ref>Lijphart. p. 12</ref> [[Runoff election]]s also tend to attract lower turnouts.\n\n==== Competitiveness of races ====\nIn theory, one of the factors that is most likely to increase turnout is a close race. With an intensely polarized electorate and all polls showing a close finish between [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger [[John F. Kerry]], the turnout in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 U.S. presidential election]] was close to 60%, resulting in a record number of popular votes for both candidates (around 62 million for Bush and 59 million for Kerry). However, this race also demonstrates the influence that contentious social issues can have on voter turnout; for example, the voter turnout rate in 1860 wherein anti-[[slavery]] candidate Abraham Lincoln won the election was the second-highest on record (81.2 percent, second only to 1876, with 81.8 percent). Nonetheless, there is evidence to support the argument that predictable election results&mdash;where one vote is not seen to be able to make a difference&mdash;have resulted in lower turnouts, such as [[1996 United States presidential election|Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election]] (which featured the lowest voter turnout in the United States since 1924), the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|United Kingdom general election of 2001]], and the 2005 [[Spanish referendum on the European Constitution]]; all of these elections produced decisive results on a low turnout.\n\nA 2017 NBER paper found that an awareness by the electorate that an election would be close increased turnout: \"Closer elections are associated with greater turnout only when polls exist.

Confusingly, some of the factors that cause internal differences do not seem to apply on a global level. For instance, nations with better-educated populaces do not have higher turnouts. \nThere are two main commonly cited causes of these international differences: culture and institutions. However, there is much debate over the relative impact of the various factors.\n\n===Cultural factors===\nWealth and literacy have some effect on turnout, but are not reliable measures. Countries such as [[Angola]] and [[Ethiopia]] have long had high turnouts, but so have the wealthy states of Europe. The [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]] shows some correlation between higher standards of living and higher turnout. The age of a democracy is also an important factor. Elections require considerable involvement by the population, and it takes some time to develop the cultural habit of voting, and the associated understanding of and confidence in the electoral process. This factor may explain the lower turnouts in the newer democracies of Eastern Europe and Latin America. Much of the impetus to vote comes from a sense of civic duty, which takes time and certain social conditions that can take decades to develop:\n*trust in government;\n*degree of partisanship among the population;\n*interest in politics, and\n*belief in the efficacy of voting.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Powell | first1 = G. Bingham | year = | title = American Voter Turnout in Comparative Perspective | url = | journal = The American Political Science Review | volume = 1986 | issue = | page = 19 }}</ref>\n\nDemographics also have an effect. Older people tend to vote more than youths, so societies where the average age is somewhat higher, such as Europe; have higher turnouts than somewhat younger countries such as the United States. Populations that are more mobile and those that have lower marriage rates tend to have lower turnout. In countries that are highly multicultural and multilingual, it can be difficult for national election campaigns to engage all sectors of the population.\n\nThe nature of elections also varies between nations. In the United States, [[negative campaigning]] and character attacks are more common than elsewhere, potentially suppressing turnouts. The focus placed on [[get out the vote]] efforts and mass-marketing can have important effects on turnout. Partisanship is an important impetus to turnout, with the highly partisan more likely to vote. Turnout tends to be higher in nations where political allegiance is closely linked to class, ethnic, linguistic, or religious loyalties.<ref>Powell \"Thirty Democracies.\" p. 14</ref> Countries where [[multiparty]] systems have developed also tend to have higher turnouts. Nations with a party specifically geared towards the [[working class]] will tend to have higher turnouts among that class than in countries where voters have only [[big tent]] parties, which try to appeal to all the voters, to choose from.<ref>Powell. p. 13</ref> A four-wave panel study conducted during the 2010 Swedish national election campaign, show (1) clear differences in media use between age groups and (2) that both political social media use and attention to political news in traditional media increase political engagement over time.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Age and the effects of news media attention and social media use on political interest and participation: Do social media function as leveller?|last1=Kristoffer Holt|last2=Adam Shehata|last3=Jesper Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck|last4=Elisabet Ljungberg|date=1 February 2013|journal=European Journal of Communication|volume=28|issue=1|pages=19\u201334|doi=10.1177/0267323112465369}}</ref>\n\n===Institutional factors===\nInstitutional factors have a significant impact on voter turnout. Rules and laws are also generally easier to change than attitudes, so much of the work done on how to improve voter turnout looks at these factors. Making [[compulsory voting|voting compulsory]] has a direct and dramatic effect on turnout. Simply making it easier for candidates to stand through easier [[nomination rules]] is believed to increase voting. Conversely, adding barriers, such as a separate [[voter registration|registration]] process, can suppress turnout. The salience of an election, the effect that a vote will have on policy, and its proportionality, how closely the result reflects the will of the people, are two structural factors that also likely have important effects on turnout.\n\n====Voter registration====\nThe modalities of how electoral registration is conducted can also affect turnout. For example, until \"rolling registration\" was introduced in the United Kingdom, there was no possibility of the electoral register being updated during its currency, or even amending genuine mistakes after a certain cut off date. The register was compiled in October, and would come into force the next February, and would remain valid until the next January. The electoral register would become progressively more out of date during its period of validity, as electors moved or died (also people studying or working away from home often had difficulty voting). This meant that elections taking place later in the year tended to have lower turnouts than those earlier in the year. The introduction of rolling registration where the register is updated monthly has reduced but not entirely eliminated this issue since the process of amending the register is not automatic, and some individuals do not join the electoral register until the annual October compilation process.  In comparison, the introduction of individual electoral registration in the UK was thought to have negatively affected the number of eligible citizens on the register and voter turnout.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Toby S.|date=2014|title=The Spill-Over and Displacement Effects of Implementing Election Administration Reforms: Introducing Individual Electoral Registration in Britain|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=67|issue=2|pages=281\u2013305|doi=10.1093/pa/gss032}}</ref>\n\nAnother country with a highly efficient registration process is France. At the age of eighteen, all youth are automatically registered. Only new residents and citizens who have moved are responsible for bearing the costs and inconvenience of updating their registration. Similarly, in [[Nordic countries]], all citizens and residents are included in the official population register, which is simultaneously a tax list, voter registration, and membership in the universal health system. Residents are required by law to report any change of address to register within a short time after moving. This is also the system in [[Germany]] (but without the membership in the health system).\n\nThe elimination of registration as a separate bureaucratic step can result in higher voter turnout. This is reflected in statistics from the United States Bureau of Census, 1982\u20131983. States that have same day registration, or no registration requirements, have a higher voter turnout than the national average. At the time of that report, the four states that allowed election day registration were Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maine, and Oregon. Since then, Idaho and Maine have changed to allow same day registration. North Dakota is the only state that requires no registration.<ref>U.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1982\u201383, Table no.804, p.492</ref>\n\n====Compulsory voting====\nOne of the strongest factors affecting voter turnout is whether voting is [[compulsory voting|compulsory]]. In [[Australia]], voter registration and attendance at a polling booth have been mandatory since the 1920s, with [[2016 Australian federal election|the most recent federal election in 2016]] having turnout figures of 91% for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 91.9% for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]].<ref>[https://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/research/files/voter-turnout-2016.pdf] 2016 House of Representatives and Senate elections</ref> Several other countries have similar laws, generally with somewhat reduced levels of enforcement. If a [[Bolivia]]n voter fails to participate in an election, the citizen may be denied withdrawal of their salary from the bank for three months.<ref>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/apathy/story/0,,1521096,00.html The Guardian ''Compulsory voting around the world'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210122003/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/apathy/story/0,,1521096,00.html |date=2006-12-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Mexico]] and [[Brazil]], existing sanctions for non-voting are minimal or are rarely enforced. When enforced, compulsion has a dramatic effect on turnout.\n\nIn [[Venezuela]] and the [[Netherlands]] compulsory voting has been rescinded, resulting in substantial decreases in turnout.\n\nIn [[Greece]] voting is compulsory, however there are practically no sanctions for those who do not vote.\n\nIn [[Luxembourg]] voting is compulsory, too, but not strongly enforced. In Luxembourg only voters below the age of 75 and those who are not physically handicapped or chronically ill have the legal obligation to vote.\n\nIn [[Belgium]] attendance is required and absence is punishable by law.\n\nSanctions for non-voting behaviour were foreseen sometimes even in absence of a formal requirement\nto vote. In [[Italy]] the Constitution describes voting as a duty (art. 48), though electoral participation is not obligatory. From 1946 to 1992, thus, the Italian electoral law included light sanctions for non-voters (lists of non-voters were posted at polling stations).<ref>[[Sarah Birch]], ''[http://i.unu.edu/media/publication/000/002/224/full_participation_web.pdf Full Participation. A comparative study of compulsory voting]'', United Nations University, p.5</ref> Turnout rates have not declined substantially since 1992 in Italy, though, pointing to other factors than compulsory voting to explain high electoral participation.\n\n====Salience====\nMark N. Franklin argues that salience, the perceived effect that an individual vote will have on how the country is run, has a significant effect on turnout. He presents [[Switzerland]] as an example of a nation with low salience. The nation's administration is highly decentralized, so that the federal government has limited powers. The government invariably consists of a coalition of parties, and the power wielded by a party is far more closely linked to its position relative to the coalition than to the number of votes it received. Important decisions are placed before the population in a [[referendum]]. Individual votes for the federal legislature are thus unlikely to have a significant effect on the nation, which probably explains the low average turnouts in that country. By contrast [[Malta]], with one of the world's highest voter turnouts, has a single legislature that holds a near monopoly on political power. Malta has a [[two-party system]] in which a small swing in votes can completely alter the executive.<ref>Mark N. Franklin. \"Electoral Participation.\" in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior'' p. 87</ref> On the other hand, countries with a two-party system can experience low turnout if large numbers of potential voters perceive little real difference between the main parties. Voters' perceptions of fairness also have an important effect on salience. If voters feel that the result of an election is more likely to be determined by fraud and corruption than by the will of the people, fewer people will vote.<ref>Richard S. Katz. Democracy and Elections. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\n====Proportionality====\nAnother institutional factor that may have an important effect is proportionality, i.e., how closely the legislature reflects the views of the populace. Under a pure [[proportional representation]] system the composition of the legislature is fully proportional to the votes of the populace and a voter can be sure that of being represented in parliament, even if only from the opposition benches. (However many nations that use a form of proportional representation in elections depart from pure proportionality by stipulating that smaller parties are not supported by a certain threshold percentage of votes cast will be excluded from parliament.) By contrast, a voting system based on single seat constituencies (such as the [[Plurality electoral system|plurality system]] used in North America, the UK and India) will tend to result in many non-competitive electoral districts, in which the outcome is seen by voters as a foregone conclusion.\n\nProportional systems tend to produce multiparty [[coalition government]]s. This may reduce salience, if voters perceive that they have little influence over which parties are included in the coalition.<ref>Robert W. Jackman and Ross A. Miller. \"Voter Turnout in the Industrial Democracies During the 1980s.\" in ''Elections and Voting Behaviour: New Challenges, New Perspectives.'' p. 308</ref> For instance, after the [[2005 German election]], the creation of the executive not only expressed the will of the voters of the majority party but also was the result of political deal-making. Although there is no guarantee, this is lessened as the parties usually state with whom they will favour a coalition after the elections.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nPolitical scientists are divided on whether proportional representation increases voter turnout, though in countries with proportional representation voter turnout is higher.<ref>Katz p. 240</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Arend |last=Lijphart |title=Unequal Participation: Democracy's Unresolved Dilemma |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |volume=91 |issue=1 |date=March 1997 |pages=1\u201314 |doi=10.2307/2952255 |jstor=2952255 }}</ref><ref>AU: ANDR\u00c9 BLAIS\nAU: R.

However, these tend to be complex electoral systems, and in some cases complexity appears to suppress voter turnout.<ref>Powell \"Thirty Democracies.\" p. 12</ref> The dual system in Germany, though, seems to have had no negative impact on voter turnout.\n\n====Ease of voting====\nEase of voting is a factor in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through separate [[voter registration]] procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts.<ref>Richard G. Niemi and Herbert F. Weisberg. ''Controversies in Voting Behavior'' p. 31</ref> Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available [[absentee voting|absentee polling]] and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day.{{which| which nations enact these measures|date=March 2011}} In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as [[India]], elections often take several days. Some countries have considered [[Internet voting]] as a possible solution. In other countries, like [[France]], voting is held on the weekend, when most voters are away from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.\n\nMany countries have looked into Internet voting as a possible solution for low voter turnout.  Some countries like France and Switzerland use Internet voting.  However, it has only been used sparingly by a few states in the US. This is due largely to security concerns.  For example, the US Department of Defense looked into making Internet voting secure, but cancelled the effort.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/28/internet-voting-not-ready-prime-time-security-risks/79456776/|title = Internet voting is just too hackable, say security experts|website = USA TODAY|access-date = 2016-03-22|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160323102823/http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/28/internet-voting-not-ready-prime-time-security-risks/79456776/|archivedate = 2016-03-23}}</ref>  The idea would be that voter turnout would increase because people could cast their vote from the comfort of their own homes, although the few experiments with Internet voting have produced mixed results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voting Drops 83 Percent In All-Digital Election|url=http://www.kitv.com/Voting-Drops-83-Percent-In-All-Digital-Election/-/8906042/5389636/-/8fij32z/-/index.html|work=26 May 2009|publisher=KITV News|accessdate=2 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104210641/http://www.kitv.com/Voting-Drops-83-Percent-In-All-Digital-Election/-/8906042/5389636/-/8fij32z/-/index.html|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Voter fatigue====\n{{Main|Voter fatigue}}\nVoter fatigue can lower turnout. If there are many elections in close succession, voter turnout will decrease as the public tires of participating. In low-turnout Switzerland, the average voter is invited to go to the polls an average of seven times a year; the United States has frequent elections, with two votes per year on average, if one includes all levels of government as well as [[primary election|primaries]].<ref>Franklin \"Electoral Participation.\" p. 98</ref> Holding multiple elections at the same time can increase turnout; however, presenting voters with massive multipage ballots, as occurs in some parts of the United States, can reduce turnouts.<ref>Arend Lijphart. \"[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/gpa/wang_files/Dem15.pdf Unequal Participation: Democracy's Unresolved Dilemma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326225342/http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/gpa/wang_files/Dem15.pdf |date=2006-03-26 }}.\" ''American Political Science Review.''</ref>\n\n==== Voter pledges ====\nA 2018 study found that \"young people who pledge to vote are more likely to turn out than those who are contacted using standard Get-Out-the-Vote materials.

There are difficulties in measuring both the numerator, the number of voters who cast votes, and the denominator, the number of voters eligible to vote.\n\nFor the numerator, it is often assumed that the number of voters who went to the polls should equal the number of ballots cast, which in turn should equal the number of votes counted, but this is not the case.  Not all voters who arrive at the polls necessarily cast ballots.  Some may be turned away because they are ineligible, some may be turned away improperly, and some who sign the voting register may not actually cast ballots.  Furthermore, voters who do cast ballots may abstain, deliberately voting for nobody, or they may [[spoiled ballot|spoil]] their votes, either accidentally or as an act of protest.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] distinguishes between \"valid vote turnout\", which excludes spoilt ballots, and \"ballot box turnout\", which does not.\n\nIn the United States, it has been common to report turnout as the sum of votes for the top race on the ballot, because not all jurisdictions report the actual number of people who went to the polls nor the number of undervotes or overvotes.<ref name=\"eac.gov\">Kimball W.

In the United States, for example, there is no accurate registry of exactly who is eligible to vote, since only about 70\u201375% of people choose to register themselves.<ref>Katz p. 239</ref> Thus, turnout has to be calculated based on population estimates. Some political scientists have argued that these measures do not properly account for the large number of [[Green card|Legal Permanent Residents]],<ref>https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/population-estimates/LPR</ref> [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]], disenfranchised [[felony|felon]]s and persons who are considered 'mentally incompetent' in the United States, and that American voter turnout is higher than is normally reported.<ref>Niemi and Weisberg \"Introduction.\" ''Controversies in Voting Behavior.'' p. 25</ref> Even in countries with fewer restrictions on the franchise, VAP turnout can still be biased by large numbers of non-citizen residents, often under-reporting turnout by as much as 10 percentage points.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wigginton|first=Michael J.|last2=Stockemer|first2=Daniel|last3=van Schouwen|first3=Jasmine|date=30 July 2019|title=International Migration and Turnout Bias|journal=PS: Political Science & Politics|language=en|pages=33\u201338|doi=10.1017/S104909651900101X|issn=1049-0965|hdl=10393/39655|volume=53|hdl-access=free}}</ref>   Professor Michael P. McDonald constructed an estimation of the turnout against the '[[voting eligible population]]' (VEP), instead of the '[[voting age population]]' (VAP). For the American presidential elections of 2004, turnout could then be expressed as 60.32% of VEP, rather than 55.27% of VAP.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}<ref>{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}McDonald \"2004 Voting-Age and Voting-Eligible Population Estimates and Voter Turnout\" {{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Voter_Turnout_2004.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419061428/http://elections.gmu.edu/Voter_Turnout_2004.htm |archivedate=2008-04-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn New Zealand, registration is supposed to be universal.  This does not eliminate uncertainty in the eligible population because this system has been shown to be unreliable, with a large number of eligible but unregistered citizens, creating inflated turnout figures.<ref>Katz p. 334</ref>\n\nA second problem with turnout measurements lies in the way turnout is computed.  One can count the number of voters, or one can count the number of ballots, and in a vote-for-one race, one can sum the number of votes for each candidate.  These are not necessarily identical because not all voters who sign in at the polls necessarily cast ballots, although they ought to, and because voters may cast [[spoiled ballot]]s.\n\n==Trends of decreasing turnout since the 1980s==\n[[File:Voter turnout by country.png|right|frame|Change in voter turnout over time for five selected countries]]\nOver the last 40 years,{{when|date=July 2018}} voter turnout has been steadily declining in the established democracies.<ref name=\"Niemi and Weisberg p. 31\"/> This trend has been significant in the United States, Western Europe, Japan and Latin America. It has been a matter of concern and controversy among political scientists for several decades. During this same period, other forms of political participation have also declined, such as voluntary participation in political parties and the attendance of observers at town meetings. The decline in voting has also accompanied a general decline in civic participation, such as church attendance, membership in professional, fraternal, and student societies, youth groups, and parent-teacher associations.<ref>Robert D. Putnam \"Tuning In, Tuning Out: The Strange Disappearance of Social Capital in America.\" in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior'' p. 40</ref> At the same time, some forms of participation have increased. People have become far more likely to participate in [[boycott]]s, [[protest|demonstration]]s, and to donate to political campaigns.<ref>Niemi and Weisberg. p. 30</ref>\n\nBefore the late 20th century, [[suffrage]] \u2014 the right to vote \u2014 was so limited in most nations that turnout figures have little relevance to today. One exception was the United States, which had near universal white male suffrage by 1840. The U.S. saw a steady rise in voter turnout during the century, reaching its peak in the years after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Turnout declined from the 1890s until the 1930s, then increased again until 1960 before beginning its current long decline.<ref>Walter Dean Burnham. \"The Appearance and Disappearance of the American Voter.\"</ref> In Europe, voter turnouts steadily increased from the introduction of universal suffrage before peaking in the mid-to-late 1960s, with modest declines since then. These declines have been smaller than those in the United States, and in some European countries turnouts have remained stable and even slightly increased. Globally, voter turnout has decreased by about five percentage points over the last four decades.<ref>Lijphart p. 6</ref>\n\n===Reasons for decline===\n{{see also|Get out the vote}}\n[[File:GOTV.png|thumb|Methods of raising turnout.]]\n{{globalize|section|US|date=December 2019}}\n\nMany causes have been proposed for this decline; a combination of factors is most likely. When asked why they do not vote, many people report that they have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies have consistently shown that the amount of [[Free time|leisure time]] has not decreased. According to a study by the Heritage Foundation, Americans report on average an additional 7.9 hours of leisure time per week since 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/08/upwards-leisure-mobility-americans-work-less-and-have-more-leisure-time-than-ever-before|title=Upwards Leisure Mobility: Americans Work Less and Have More LeisureTime than Ever Before|work=The Heritage Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105210848/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/08/upwards-leisure-mobility-americans-work-less-and-have-more-leisure-time-than-ever-before|archivedate=2016-11-05}}</ref> Furthermore, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, increases in wages and employment actually decrease voter turnout in gubernatorial elections and do not affect national races.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Kerwin Kofi|last2=Jr|first2=Melvin Stephens|date=2013 |title=Employment, Wages, and Voter Turnout |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=111\u201343 |doi=10.1257/app.5.4.111 |citeseerx=10.1.1.595.1201}}</ref> Potential voters' perception that they are busier is common and might be just as important as a real decrease in leisure time. Geographic mobility has increased over the last few decades. There are often barriers to voting in a district where one is a recent arrival, and a new arrival is likely to know little about the local candidate and local issues. [[Francis Fukuyama]] has blamed the [[welfare state]], arguing that the decrease in turnout has come shortly after the government became far more involved in people's lives. He argues in ''Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity'' that the [[social capital]] essential to high voter turnouts is easily dissipated by government actions. However, on an international level those states with the most extensive social programs tend to be the ones with the highest turnouts. Richard Sclove argues in ''Democracy and Technology'' that technological developments in society such as \"automobilization,\" suburban living, and \"an explosive proliferation of home entertainment devices\" have contributed to a loss of community, which in turn has weakened participation in civic life.<ref>Sclove p. 241</ref>{{Nonspecific|date=September 2009}}\n\nTrust in government and in politicians has decreased in many nations. However, the first signs of decreasing voter turnout occurred in the early 1960s, which was before the major upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s. [[Robert D. Putnam]] argues that the collapse in civil engagement is due to the introduction of television. In the 1950s and 1960s, television quickly became the main leisure activity in developed nations. It replaced earlier more social entertainments such as bridge clubs, church groups, and bowling leagues. Putnam argues that as people retreated within their homes and general social participation declined, so too did voting.<ref>Putnam p. 61</ref>\n\n====United States====\n\nRosenstone and Hansen contend that the decline in turnout in the United States is the product of a change in campaigning strategies as a result of the so-called new media. Before the introduction of television, almost all of a party's resources would be directed towards intensive local campaigning and [[get out the vote]] initiatives. In the modern era, these resources have been redirected to expensive media campaigns in which the potential voter is a passive participant.<ref>Steven J. Rosenstone and John Mark Hansen. \"Solving the Puzzle of Participation in Electoral Politics.\" p. 73</ref> During the same period, [[negative campaigning]] has become ubiquitous in the United States and elsewhere and has been shown to impact voter turnout.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00522.x|title = When Does Negativity Demobilize?

The evidence for this is mixed: elections involving highly unpopular incumbents generally have high turnout; some studies have found that mudslinging and character attacks reduce turnout, but that substantive attacks on a party's record can increase it.<ref>Niemi and Weisberg p. 30.</ref>\n\nPart of the reason for voter decline in the recent 2016 election is likely because of restrictive voting laws around the country. Brennan Center for Justice reported that in 2016 fourteen states passed restrictive voting laws.<ref>Regan, Michael D. \"Why Is Voter Turnout so Low in the U.S.?\" PBS. PBS, 6 Nov. 2016.

Barbour and Wright also believe that one of the causes is restrictive voting laws but they call this system of laws regulating the electorate.<ref name=\"Barbour, Christine 2016\">Barbour, Christine, and Gerald C. Wright. KEEPING THE REPUBLIC: Power and Citizenship in American Politics. Place of Publication Not Identified: CQ, 2016. Print.</ref> The Constitution gives states the power to make decisions regarding restrictive voting laws. In 2008 the Supreme Court made a crucial decision regarding Indiana's [[voter ID law]] in saying that it does not violate the constitution. Since then almost half of the states have passed restrictive voting laws. These laws contribute to Barbour and Wrights idea of the rational nonvoter. This is someone who does not vote because the benefits of them not voting outweighs the cost to vote.<ref name=\"Barbour, Christine 2016\"/> These laws add to the \u201ccost\u201d of voting, or reason that make it more difficult and to vote. In the United States programs such as MTV's \"[[Rock the Vote]]\" and the \"[[Vote or Die]]\" initiatives have been introduced to increase turnouts of those between the ages of 18 and 25. A number of governments and [[Election management body|electoral commissions]] have also launched efforts to boost turnout. For instance [[Elections Canada]] has launched mass media campaigns to encourage voting prior to elections, as have bodies in Taiwan and the United Kingdom.\n\nGoogle extensively studied the causes behind low voter turnout in the United States, and argues that one of the key reasons behind lack of voter participation is the so-called \"interested bystander\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Krontiris|first=Kate|last2=Webb|first2=John|last3=Chapman|first3=Chris|date=2015-01-01|title=Understanding America's Interested Bystander: A Complicated Relationship with Civic Duty|url=http://research.google.com/pubs/pub44180.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221164901/https://research.google.com/pubs/pub44180.html|archivedate=2016-12-21}}</ref> According to Google's study, 48.9% of adult Americans can be classified as \"interested bystanders\", as they are politically informed but are reticent to involve themselves in the civic and political sphere. This category is not limited to any socioeconomic or demographic groups. Google theorizes that individuals in this category suffer from [[voter apathy]], as they are interested in political life but believe that their individual effect would be negligible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politics.googleblog.com/2015/06/understanding-americas-interested.html|title=Understanding America's \"Interested Bystander:\" A Complicated Relationship with Civic Duty|work=Politics & Elections Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220154129/https://politics.googleblog.com/2015/06/understanding-americas-interested.html|archivedate=2016-12-20}}</ref> These individuals often participate politically on the local level, but shy away from national elections.\n\n====International treaties====\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2020}}\nWhen national governments establish international treaties and agreements, a platform of powers is created above the voter platform that undermines the voter importance, directly or indirectly. For instance, the establishment of the European Union created an international platform above the national governments, and yet voters can only vote via their national parties for the European parliament, and not directly via European parties. Meanwhile, because the national governments gave more powers to 'Europe' less power remained for parties at that national level and for their voters. Therefore, the added level of governance did no longer coincide with the highest participation level for voters, while 'at home' the national parties had given (part of) their national powers away to Brussels. It should be common logic that voters given lesser importance would not be coming to the polls like before.\n\nIn a different example of international affairs, the World Trade Organization (1995) created an economic platform that is once-removed from actual voter participation. Already in the eighties, the decision by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher to liberalize their markets was swiftly followed by other nations doing the same. They followed suit in liberalizing their markets to keep their economies viable places for international investments. In effect, the importance of the economic tools were made more important than before and this helped to diminish the importance of the political tools. Again, voters reflected their diminished importance by staying home in larger numbers.\n\nThe more international treaties are put in place, the less power (or control) is left for voters. As such, globalization may have contributed to a lower voter turnout since the parameters of voters' power have been restricted to making decisions only on items of lesser importance.\n\nIt has been argued that democratic consolidation (the stabilization of new democracies) contributes to the decline in voter turnout. A 2017 study challenges this however.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kostelka|first=Filip|date=July 2017|title=Does Democratic Consolidation Lead to a Decline in Voter Turnout? Global Evidence Since 1939|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=111|issue=4|pages=653\u2013667|doi=10.1017/S0003055417000259|issn=0003-0554|df=|url=http://spire.sciencespo.fr/hdl:/2441/4870tpmhtg8fdb64l5s45kpgmb}}</ref>\n\n===Ineligibility===\nMuch of the above analysis is predicated on voter turnout as measured as a percentage of the voting-age population. In a 2001 article in the [[American Political Science Review]], Michael McDonald and Samuel Popkin argued, that at least in the United States, voter turnout since 1972 has not actually declined when calculated for those eligible to vote, what they term the voting-eligible population.<ref>Michael McDonald and Samual Popkin. \"The Myth of the Vanishing Voter\" in ''American Political Science Review.''</ref>  In 1972, noncitizens and ineligible felons (depending on state law) constituted about 2% of the voting-age population. By 2004, ineligible voters constituted nearly 10%. Ineligible voters are not evenly distributed across the country \u2013 20% of California's voting-age population is ineligible to vote \u2013 which confounds comparisons of states. Furthermore, they argue that an examination of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey shows that turnout is low but not declining among the youth, when the high youth turnout of 1972 (the first year 18- to 20-year-olds were eligible to vote in most states) is removed from the trendline.\n\n==See also==\n*[[I-Voting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Franklin, Mark N. \"Electoral Engineering and Cross National Turnout Differences.\" ''British Journal of Political Science.'' 1999\n*Kanazawa, Satoshi. \"A Possible Solution to the Paradox of Voter Turnout.\" ''The Journal of Politics.''\n*Lijphart, Arend. \"Unequal Participation: Democracy's Unresolved Dilemma.\" ''American Political Science Review.'' vol. 91 (March 1997): 1\u201314. p.&nbsp;12\n*McDonald, Michael and Samuel Popkin. \"The Myth of the Vanishing Voter.\" ''American Political Science Review.'' 2001.\n*Niemi, Richard G. and Herbert F.

[[2003 Pan American Games]], and later represented the [[United States]] in two editions of the Olympic Games (2004 and 2008).

Since then, he finished his junior career fifth in the world, and earned two U.S. national titles, and top finishes at the UCI World Cup series. Off the sport, Massie also attended the Faith Christian Academy in [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania]], where he enrolled on a music scholarship from the U.S. National Band Association for his talent in clarinet, an instrument that had been inherited by his father.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blockus|first=Gary|title=Massie looking to hit a high note in team sprint|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2004-08-08/sports/3557412_1_track-cycling-ride-first-olympic-medal|publisher=[[The Morning Call]]|date=8 August 2004|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Massie moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], where he trained and worked as a resident athlete for the [[U.S. Olympic Training Center]] and has been continuously lived until the present.
