It has more than 17,000 members from more than 95 countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nAs food technology grew from the individual family farm to the factory level, including the [[slaughterhouse]] for meat and poultry processing, the [[cannery]] for canned foods, and bakeries for bread, the need to have personnel trained for the food industry did also. Literature such as [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) later that year. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] was also interested in food technology, and research was already being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>Goldblith, S.A.

Prescott replied with \"fifty or sixty people.\" 500 people actually attended the event.<ref name=\"Goldblith p101\"/>\n\nThis meeting proved so successful that in early 1938 that a second conference would be held in 1939. Initially led by [[George J. Hucker]] of the [[New York State Agricultural Experiment Station]] (part of [[Cornell University]]) in [[Geneva, New York]], a small group meeting was held on August 5, 1938 on forming an organization with an expanded group meeting in New York City on January 16, 1939 to further discuss this.<ref name=\"Goldblith p102\">Goldblith. p. 102.</ref> The second conference was held at MIT June 29 to July 1, 1939 with Proctor as conference chair. 600 people attended this event. At the final session, the chairman of the session [[Fred C. Blanck]] of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the '''Institute of Food Technologists.''' This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as President, [[Roy C. Newton]] of [[Swift & Company]] in Chicago, Illinois as Vice President, and Hucker as Secretary-Treasurer.<ref name=\"Goldblith p102\"/> By 1949, IFT had 3,000 members.\n\n===Growth===\nRegional sections were established in IFT as early as 1940 in northern California (San Francisco, [[Bakersfield]], [[Sacramento]]).<ref>[http://www.ift.org/sections/ncift/oldguard.htm Northern California IFT Section Chairs]</ref> The first IFT Award, the [[Nicholas Appert Award]] was established in 1942 by IFT's Chicago section with additional awards being established since then. For the first ten years, IFT officers were President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer. In 1949, IFT moved into offices in Chicago and created a permanent position of Executive Secretary to run daily organizational operations. Retired [[U.S. Army]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Charles S. Lawrence]] was named the first Executive Secretary, a position he would hold until 1961 when he was replaced by [[Calvert L. Willey]]. During Willey's term as Executive Director (Executive Secretary 1961\u20131966), IFT would grow from 6,000 members in 1961 to 23,000 members in 1987.<ref>\"In Memoriam: Calvert L.

Literature such as [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) later that year. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] was also interested in food technology, and research was already being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>Goldblith, S.A.

At the final session, the chairman of the session [[Fred C. Blanck]] of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the '''Institute of Food Technologists.''' This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as President, [[Roy C.

In India, nomadic communities form nearly 7 per cent of population and consists of about 500 different communities of mobile herders, foragers and traditional peripatetics (Rao and Casimir 2003 :1).}}</ref>\n\nThe nomadic communities in India can be broadly divided into three groups [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter gatherers]], [[pastoral]]ists and the [[Nomad#Peripatetic minorities|peripatetic]] or non-food producing groups. Among these, peripatetic nomads are the most neglected and discriminated social group in India.<ref>Customary strangers : new perspectives on peripatetic peoples in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia / edited by Joseph C. Berland and Aparna Rao</ref> They have lost their livelihood because of drastic changes in transport, industries, production, entertainment and distribution systems. They find pastures for their herders\n\n== Historic development ==\n\nNomadic tribes have always been a source of suspicion to [[Sedentism|sedentary]] people. In the colonial period, the British normalized a set of notions about such groups that echoed European ideas about the [[Romani people|gypsies]], whose [[History of the Romani people|origins are in the Indian subcontinent]]. They listed such groups that posed a \u2018threat\u2019 to settled society and introduced a legislative measure, the [[Criminal Tribes Act]] (CTA) in 1871 and as a result of which nearly 200 such communities stood \u2018notified\u2019 as criminal.\n\nThe Targalas or Nayaks have been [[Itinerant groups in Europe|itinerant]] drama troupes in [[Gujarat]] who moved from village to village to perform \u2018[[Bhavai]]\u2019, a [[folk dance]] theatre form. These performers too carry the stigma of criminality. There are numerous folk tales of \u2018the skillful thefts\u2019 allegedly committed by Bhavai troupe members. And if a burglary had taken place in a village where Bhavai had been performed, members of the troupe would be arrested and interrogated. The itinerant Bhavai players have always been expected to report their entry, stay and exit to the village headman.\n\nThe folk dance drama of [[Bhavai]] probably originated in the then Anart Pradesh (now North Gujarat). It then spread over other parts of Gujarat, [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], [[Kutch]] and [[Marvad]] (now [[Rajasthan]]). It has been a popular form of entertainment among the rural and the townsfolk from the 14th century through to the 19th century in the North-west region of India. Although its origin are in the worship of the Mother Goddess, [[Bhavani]], it has gathered secular elements with the passage of time and come to embrace the whole range of human emotions of the rural community. It is to Gujarat what [[Yakshagana]] is to [[Karnataka]], [[Nautanki]] to [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Tamasha]] and [[Lalit (raga)|Lalit]] to [[Maharashtra]] - a veritable folk dance drama.\n\nThe performing Targalas are believed to be the descendants of the poet [[Asait Thakar]] of [[Unjha]] who lived in the 14th century. As the legend goes, Asait was an Audichya Brahmin of [[Unjha]] in North Gujarat. His host Hemala Patel\u2019s daughter Ganga was kidnapped by a Rawal Ratan Singh, Sardar Jahan Roz. Hemala Patel urged Asait Thakar to use his artistic skills to help liberate his daughter from the Sardar.

Among these, peripatetic nomads are the most neglected and discriminated social group in India.<ref>Customary strangers : new perspectives on peripatetic peoples in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia / edited by Joseph C. Berland and Aparna Rao</ref> They have lost their livelihood because of drastic changes in transport, industries, production, entertainment and distribution systems. They find pastures for their herders\n\n== Historic development ==\n\nNomadic tribes have always been a source of suspicion to [[Sedentism|sedentary]] people. In the colonial period, the British normalized a set of notions about such groups that echoed European ideas about the [[Romani people|gypsies]], whose [[History of the Romani people|origins are in the Indian subcontinent]]. They listed such groups that posed a \u2018threat\u2019 to settled society and introduced a legislative measure, the [[Criminal Tribes Act]] (CTA) in 1871 and as a result of which nearly 200 such communities stood \u2018notified\u2019 as criminal.\n\nThe Targalas or Nayaks have been [[Itinerant groups in Europe|itinerant]] drama troupes in [[Gujarat]] who moved from village to village to perform \u2018[[Bhavai]]\u2019, a [[folk dance]] theatre form. These performers too carry the stigma of criminality. There are numerous folk tales of \u2018the skillful thefts\u2019 allegedly committed by Bhavai troupe members. And if a burglary had taken place in a village where Bhavai had been performed, members of the troupe would be arrested and interrogated. The itinerant Bhavai players have always been expected to report their entry, stay and exit to the village headman.\n\nThe folk dance drama of [[Bhavai]] probably originated in the then Anart Pradesh (now North Gujarat). It then spread over other parts of Gujarat, [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], [[Kutch]] and [[Marvad]] (now [[Rajasthan]]). It has been a popular form of entertainment among the rural and the townsfolk from the 14th century through to the 19th century in the North-west region of India. Although its origin are in the worship of the Mother Goddess, [[Bhavani]], it has gathered secular elements with the passage of time and come to embrace the whole range of human emotions of the rural community. It is to Gujarat what [[Yakshagana]] is to [[Karnataka]], [[Nautanki]] to [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Tamasha]] and [[Lalit (raga)|Lalit]] to [[Maharashtra]] - a veritable folk dance drama.\n\nThe performing Targalas are believed to be the descendants of the poet [[Asait Thakar]] of [[Unjha]] who lived in the 14th century. As the legend goes, Asait was an Audichya Brahmin of [[Unjha]] in North Gujarat. His host Hemala Patel\u2019s daughter Ganga was kidnapped by a Rawal Ratan Singh, Sardar Jahan Roz. Hemala Patel urged Asait Thakar to use his artistic skills to help liberate his daughter from the Sardar. Asait told the Sardar, after pleasing him with his performance and songs that he should liberate the girl, who he claimed was his.\n\nIndian distinguished  from other nomads in India in that they breed animals and this distinguishes them from other groups that which make a living by combining with other itinerant professions such as blacksmithing by [[Gadia Lohar]], or selling salt by the [[Lambadi]].  These pastoral groups are concentrated in certain regions such as the [[semi-arid]] and arid [[Thar Desert|Thar]] desert region and the neighbouring [[salt marsh]]es of [[Kutch]] along the [[Indo-Pakistan border]], the [[alpine climate|alpine]] and [[sub-alpine]] zones above 3200 metres in the [[Himalayas]] forming the states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"dfid.gov.uk\">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/outputs/ZC0181b.pdf</ref>\n\nTypes of livestock kept in mobile pastoral systems include buffaloes, sheep, goats, camels, cattle, donkeys, and [[yaks]] among others. Unlike in the [[Middle East]], where pastoralist are organized in tribes occupying distinct areas, in India pastoralist are integrated in the [[caste]] system, representing [[endogamous group|endogamous]] social units specialising in animal husbandry.<ref name=\"dfid.gov.uk\"/>\n\nIn western India in the [[Kutch]] region, there are a groups of pastoral nomads known as the [[Maldhari]].
