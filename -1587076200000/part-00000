[[Tyrone Power]] stars as the scrappy Irish immigrant whose 50-year career at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] took him from a [[Dishwashing|dishwasher]] to a [[non-commissioned officer]] and athletic instructor. Maher was buried there in January 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-society.org/home/hedgemaster-archives-2/people/maher-marty|title=irish-society|website=irish-society|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Maureen O'Hara]], one of [[John Ford|Ford's]] favorite leading ladies, plays Maher's wife and fellow [[Immigration|immigrant]], Mary O'Donnell. The film co-stars [[Ward Bond]] as [[Herman Koehler]], the Master of the Sword (athletic director) and Army's head football coach (1897\u20131900), who first befriends Maher. [[Milburn Stone]] appears as [[John J. Pershing]], who in 1898 swears Maher into the Army. [[Harry Carey, Jr.]], makes a brief appearance as the young cadet [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. [[Philip Carey]] plays (fictional) Army football player and future general Chuck Dotson. In addition, actress [[Betsy Palmer]] makes her screen debut as Kitty Carter.\n\nThe phrase \"The Long Gray Line\" is used to describe, as a continuum, all graduates and cadets of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], New York. Many of the scenes in the film were shot on location at West Point, including the \"million dollar view\" of the [[Hudson River]] near the parade grounds. The film was the last one in which actor [[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]] appeared before his death at age 25 in an air crash. His rising stardom had reached third billing behind Power and O'Hara at the time of his death.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is framed as the reminiscences of Master Sergeant Martin Maher ([[Tyrone Power]]), who first came to West Point in 1898 as a civilian employee. Arriving from [[County Tipperary]], Ireland, Marty begins as a waiter. When he realizes that enlisted men receive better treatment than do hired laborers, he immediately signs up and joins the U.S. Army. Capt. Koehler ([[Ward Bond]]), impressed with his boxing skills, wants him as an assistant in athletics instruction.\n\nMarty meets Mrs. Koehler's cook, Mary O'Donnell ([[Maureen O'Hara]]), also recently arrived from Ireland. They marry and settle into a house on campus. Marty becomes a corporal, and Mary saves enough money to bring his father ([[Donald Crisp]]) and brother ([[Sean McClory]]) to America. Mary becomes pregnant, but the baby dies only hours after birth, and Mary learns that she may never have another child. The cadets become the children they will never have. Over time, Marty continues to earn the love and respect of cadets such as [[Omar Bradley]], [[James Van Fleet]], [[George Patton]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. The Mahers grow close to the family of \"Red\" Sundstrom, a West Point cadet killed in World War I.\n\nYears later, Marty is still at West Point, and James \"Red\" Sundstrom, Jr. ([[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]]), along with the sons of others whom Marty had trained, has become a cadet. At the outbreak of World War II Sundstrom confesses to Marty that he has illegally married his girlfriend which could disqualify him from graduating. Although his marriage is annulled, Sundstrom resigns from West Point to join the regular U.S. Army. Later, Mary attempts to view one of the parades she so loves but her poor health forces her to watch from her porch. She quietly dies while Marty is fetching her shawl. On Christmas Eve, Marty prepares for a quiet evening but is joined by a group of cadets. Kitty ([[Betsy Palmer]]) arrives with Red, Jr., who has earned his captain's bars in [[Western Front (World War II)|Europe]] and wants Marty to pin them on.\n\nAfter Marty is faced with retirement, he heads to Washington to see the President (a West Point graduate) about the matter. He is met by the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy along with several high-ranking officers on his return to West Point. Slightly bemused by the attention, he is taken to the parade field. The film concludes with a full dress parade in Marty's honor. As the band plays a series of Irish tunes, all the people Marty loves, both living and dead, join the parade to honor him.<ref name=tcm>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81751/The-Long-Gray-Line/|title=The Long Gray Line (1955) - Overview - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Tyrone Power]] as [[Martin Maher (soldier)|Martin Maher]]\n*[[Maureen O'Hara]] as Mary O'Donnell\n*[[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]] as James N.

Pershing]]. Pershing was a West Point instructor in 1897, but between 1898 and 1899 he was serving in Cuba and the Philippines. \n*The representation of Maher's family at West Point is incorrect, even showing his over-aged father trying to enlist in the US Army in 1917. Although Maher's father did come to West Point, he had died in 1912. Maher had three brothers, not one, who also served in the U.S. Army: one private and two NCO's.\n*Cadet Sundstrom was created for the film. The only historically real West Point graduate to be awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] during [[World War I]] was [[Emory Jenison Pike]] from the Class of 1901. He, like the fictional Sundstrom, received the award posthumously. However, it is factually correct that any infant son of a Medal of Honor recipient is eligible for an appointment to the United States Military Academy.\n*Maher did not appeal to the sitting U.S. President (implied to be [[Dwight Eisenhower]]) to stay with the U.S. Army beyond compulsory retirement age. Maher actually retired from the U.S. Army in 1928 after 30 years service. He then remained at West Point as a civilian employee until 1946.\n*Maher's wife died in 1948, not earlier as shown in the film.\n*Vicente P. Lim, who is shown graduating with the class of 1915, actually graduated in 1914.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1955]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{AFI film|53487}}\n*{{IMDb title|0048312}}\n*{{Tcmdb title|81751}}\n*{{Allmovie title|29925}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|long_gray_line}}\n\n{{John Ford}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long Gray Line, The}}\n[[Category:1955 films]]\n[[Category:1950s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about military personnel]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Ford]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Duning]]\n[[Category:Films set in the United States Military Academy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Dwight D.

The film co-stars [[Ward Bond]] as [[Herman Koehler]], the Master of the Sword (athletic director) and Army's head football coach (1897\u20131900), who first befriends Maher. [[Milburn Stone]] appears as [[John J. Pershing]], who in 1898 swears Maher into the Army. [[Harry Carey, Jr.]], makes a brief appearance as the young cadet [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. [[Philip Carey]] plays (fictional) Army football player and future general Chuck Dotson. In addition, actress [[Betsy Palmer]] makes her screen debut as Kitty Carter.\n\nThe phrase \"The Long Gray Line\" is used to describe, as a continuum, all graduates and cadets of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], New York. Many of the scenes in the film were shot on location at West Point, including the \"million dollar view\" of the [[Hudson River]] near the parade grounds. The film was the last one in which actor [[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]] appeared before his death at age 25 in an air crash. His rising stardom had reached third billing behind Power and O'Hara at the time of his death.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is framed as the reminiscences of Master Sergeant Martin Maher ([[Tyrone Power]]), who first came to West Point in 1898 as a civilian employee. Arriving from [[County Tipperary]], Ireland, Marty begins as a waiter. When he realizes that enlisted men receive better treatment than do hired laborers, he immediately signs up and joins the U.S. Army. Capt. Koehler ([[Ward Bond]]), impressed with his boxing skills, wants him as an assistant in athletics instruction.\n\nMarty meets Mrs. Koehler's cook, Mary O'Donnell ([[Maureen O'Hara]]), also recently arrived from Ireland. They marry and settle into a house on campus. Marty becomes a corporal, and Mary saves enough money to bring his father ([[Donald Crisp]]) and brother ([[Sean McClory]]) to America. Mary becomes pregnant, but the baby dies only hours after birth, and Mary learns that she may never have another child. The cadets become the children they will never have. Over time, Marty continues to earn the love and respect of cadets such as [[Omar Bradley]], [[James Van Fleet]], [[George Patton]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. The Mahers grow close to the family of \"Red\" Sundstrom, a West Point cadet killed in World War I.\n\nYears later, Marty is still at West Point, and James \"Red\" Sundstrom, Jr. ([[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]]), along with the sons of others whom Marty had trained, has become a cadet. At the outbreak of World War II Sundstrom confesses to Marty that he has illegally married his girlfriend which could disqualify him from graduating. Although his marriage is annulled, Sundstrom resigns from West Point to join the regular U.S. Army. Later, Mary attempts to view one of the parades she so loves but her poor health forces her to watch from her porch. She quietly dies while Marty is fetching her shawl. On Christmas Eve, Marty prepares for a quiet evening but is joined by a group of cadets. Kitty ([[Betsy Palmer]]) arrives with Red, Jr., who has earned his captain's bars in [[Western Front (World War II)|Europe]] and wants Marty to pin them on.\n\nAfter Marty is faced with retirement, he heads to Washington to see the President (a West Point graduate) about the matter. He is met by the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy along with several high-ranking officers on his return to West Point. Slightly bemused by the attention, he is taken to the parade field. The film concludes with a full dress parade in Marty's honor. As the band plays a series of Irish tunes, all the people Marty loves, both living and dead, join the parade to honor him.<ref name=tcm>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81751/The-Long-Gray-Line/|title=The Long Gray Line (1955) - Overview - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Tyrone Power]] as [[Martin Maher (soldier)|Martin Maher]]\n*[[Maureen O'Hara]] as Mary O'Donnell\n*[[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]] as James N.

Pershing]]. Pershing was a West Point instructor in 1897, but between 1898 and 1899 he was serving in Cuba and the Philippines. \n*The representation of Maher's family at West Point is incorrect, even showing his over-aged father trying to enlist in the US Army in 1917. Although Maher's father did come to West Point, he had died in 1912. Maher had three brothers, not one, who also served in the US Army: one private and two NCO's.\n*Cadet Sundstrom was created for the film. The only historically real West Point graduate to be awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] during [[World War I]] was [[Emory Jenison Pike]] from the Class of 1901. He, like the fictional Sundstrom, received the award posthumously. However, it is factually correct that any infant son of a Medal of Honor recipient is eligible for an appointment to the United States Military Academy.\n*Maher did not appeal to the sitting US President (implied to be [[Dwight Eisenhower]]) to stay with the US Army beyond compulsory retirement age. Maher actually retired from the US Army in 1928 after 30 years service. He then remained at West Point as a civilian employee until 1946.\n*Maher's wife died in 1948, not earlier as shown in the film.\n*Vicente P. Lim, who is shown graduating with the class of 1915, actually graduated in 1914.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1955]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{AFI film|53487}}\n*{{IMDb title|0048312}}\n*{{Tcmdb title|81751}}\n*{{Allmovie title|29925}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|long_gray_line}}\n\n{{John Ford}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long Gray Line, The}}\n[[Category:1955 films]]\n[[Category:1950s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about military personnel]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Ford]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Duning]]\n[[Category:Films set in the United States Military Academy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Dwight D.

She launched [[Virgin 1]] in October 2007 and re-positioned Bravo in 2009. She became part of the management team that ran the company.\n\nWhen Rosencrantz joined Living TV, the channel had already broadcast ''Jade's Salon'', featuring [[Jade Goody]], a contestant in the [[Big Brother (British series 3)|third series]] of ''[[Big Brother (British TV series)|Big Brother]]'', and was in production with a second series, ''[[Just Jade]]'', following Goody as she launched a perfume range. Then in the autumn of 2006 came ''Jade's PA'' and then ''[[Bigg Boss]]'', the Indian version of ''Big Brother'', in August 2008. Goody heard the diagnosis of her terminal condition, cervical cancer, on screen. The series of documentaries broadcast leading up to Jade's Wedding, transmitted on 12 March, brought the highest ratings in the history of the Livings channel.\n\nIn 2009 VMTV enjoyed a successful year, in which Living TV commissioned the series ''[[Four Weddings]]'', ''[[Dating in the Dark]]'' and ''Living with My Idol'' featuring [[Pamela Anderson]] and [[David Hasselhoff]], among others.\n\nIn 2010 Living received up the [[RTS Award]] for the series ''Dating in the Dark''. It also won the Broadcast Award for ''Four Weddings''. Living also made the supermodel [[Elle Macpherson]] the host on the series ''[[Britain's Next Top Model]]''.\n\nRosencrantz was responsible for commissioning Living's first original drama, ''[[Bedlam (2011 TV series)|Bedlam]]'' starring [[Will Young]] and [[Theo James]], which was taken into a second series.\n\nIn 2010, Virgin Media sold their portfolio of Virgin channels to [[Sky UK|BSkyB]] for \u00a3160 million. Living was renamed Sky Living, alongside the new channel [[Sky Atlantic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/1048321/Claudia-Rosencrantz-leave-Living-TV-Group/|title=Claudia Rosencrantz to leave the Living TV Group|work=Campaign|last=McCabe|first=Maisie|date=7 January 2011|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref> Journalist Maggie Brown of ''[[The Guardian]]'' broke the story that Rosencrantz had decided to leave post-integration of the channels as she felt there was no suitable role for her in the new structure at Sky.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/claudia-rosencrantz-exiting-post-living-69122|title=Claudia Rosencrantz Exiting Post at Living TV Group|work=Hollywood Reporter|last=Turner|first=Mimi|date=1 June 2011|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>\nOn Rosencrantz's departure, the Virgin chief executive was quoted as saying:<blockquote>Claudia is the real deal.
