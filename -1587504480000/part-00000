On December 10, 2012, SACS leadership elected to revoke Florida Christian College's regional accreditation, effectively terminating the college's ability to function independently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/12/12/high-profile-problems-highly-visible-universities-get-accreditors-attention |title=Headline-Driven Accreditation |author=Doug Lederman |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=December 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> Although the college appealed the committee's decision, SACS denied the appeal in February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=SACS Disclosure Statement|url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2012/12/famu-only-state-university-to-ever-face-sacs-probation.html|publisher=SACSCOC|accessdate=Dec 29, 2012}}</ref>  Under the administrative guidance of [[Johnson University]], the college sought an injunction against SACS in order to restore its regional accreditation and proceed with a planned merger between the two schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.edu/about/documents/Eubanks-Letter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827160822/http://www.fcc.edu/about/documents/Eubanks-Letter.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-27 }}</ref> On March 8, 2013, the U.S. District Court of Northern Georgia granted the injunction restoring probationary status of FCC as a member of SACS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacscoc.org/2012%20December%20Actions%20and%20Disclosure%20Statements/floridachristiancollegemarch2013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503070027/http://sacscoc.org/2012%20December%20Actions%20and%20Disclosure%20Statements/floridachristiancollegemarch2013.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-03 }}</ref> During this transition period, a number of significant events took place. First, the University purchased the Florida campus, simultaneously permitting financial oversight of the college and erasing its debt. Next, FCC President Bill Behrman stepped down and [[David L.

The college offers multiple undergraduate programs, including one-year certificates, two-year Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science programs, and four-year Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science programs, as well as a Master of Strategic Ministry program.\n\nThe university is organized into eight schools:\n*School of Arts & Sciences\n*School of Bible & Theology\n*School of Business & Public Leadership\n*School of Communication & Creative Arts\n*School of Congregational Ministry\n*Templar School of Education\n*School of Intercultural Studies\n*School of Social & Behavioral Sciences\n\n==Athletics==\nJohnson University's athletics teams are known as the Suns.

The [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] facilitated a change in the designs of Japanese swords. Thin ''tachi'' and ''chokut\u014d-''style blades were often unable to cut through the boiled leather armour of the Mongols, with the blades often chipping or breaking off.<ref>Sat\u014d, Kanzan. Kodansha International. 1983. Page 104</ref>  The evolution of the ''tachi'' into what would become the ''katana'' seems to have continued during the early [[Muromachi period]] (1337 to 1573). Starting around the year 1400, long swords signed with the ''katana-''style ''mei'' were made. This was in response to ''samurai'' wearing their ''tachi'' in what is now called \"''katana'' style\" (cutting edge up). Japanese swords are traditionally worn with the ''mei'' facing away from the wearer. When a ''tachi'' was worn in the style of a ''katana'', with the cutting edge up, the ''tachi''<nowiki/>'s signature would be facing the wrong way. The fact that [[Japanese swordsmithing|swordsmiths]] started signing swords with a ''katana'' signature shows that some ''samurai'' of that time period had started wearing their swords in a different manner.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2011\">{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull |title=Katana: The Samurai Sword |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFTe6JUEkQC&pg=PA22|date=8 February 2011 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-84908-658-5 |pages=22\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Nagayama 1997\">{{cite book|author=K\u014dkan Nagayama |title=The Connoisseur's Book of Japanese Swords |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPyswmGDBFkC&pg=PA28|year=1997 |publisher=Kodansha International |isbn=978-4-7700-2071-0 |page=28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kissaki no katana Met 2007.478.3.jpg|thumb|left|''Kissaki'' (point) of an Edo period ''katana'']]\n[[File:Nakago no katana Met 2007.478.3.jpg|thumb|left|''Nakago'' ([[tang (tools)|tang]]) of an Edo period ''katana'']]\n\nThe rise in popularity of ''katana'' amongst ''samurai'' came about due to the changing nature of [[close combat|close-combat]] warfare. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times. The ''katana'' further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (''[[Obi (sash)|obi]]'') with the sharpened edge facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion.

Traditionally made swords were produced during this period, but in order to supply such large numbers of swords, blacksmiths with little or no knowledge of traditional Japanese sword manufacture were recruited. In addition, supplies of the Japanese steel (''[[tamahagane]]'') used for swordmaking were limited, so several other types of steel were also used. Quicker methods of forging were also used, such as the use of [[power hammers]], and [[quenching]] the blade in oil, rather than hand forging and water. The non-traditionally made swords from this period are called ''sh\u014dwat\u014d'', after the [[regnal name]] of the Emperor [[Hirohito]], and in 1937, the Japanese government started requiring the use of special stamps on the [[tang (tools)|tang]] (''nakago'') to distinguish these swords from traditionally made swords. During this period of war, older antique swords were remounted for use in military mounts.

The age of the steel plays a role in the ability to remove impurities, with older steel having a higher oxygen concentration, being more easily stretched and rid of impurities during hammering, resulting in a stronger blade.<ref>{{cite web |title=Step 1: Types of Katana Swords |url=http://katanaswordreviews.com/types-of-katana-swords/ |website=Katana Sword Reviews |access-date=25 April 2016}}</ref> The smith begins by folding and welding pieces of the steel several times to work out most of the differences in the steel. The resulting block of steel is then drawn out to form a billet.\n\nAt this stage, it is only slightly curved or may have no curve at all. The ''katana''<nowiki/>'s gentle curvature is attained by a process of [[Differential hardening|differential hardening or differential quenching]]: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called ''tsuchioki''. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel.<ref name=\"Kapp 1987\"/> When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750&nbsp;\u00b0C, it enters the [[austenite]] phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into [[martensite]], which is a very hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] and [[pearlite]] which is softer than martensite.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Cohen |title=By the Sword: A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and Olympic Champions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=inND87EFFF4C&pg=PA124|date=18 December 2007 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-307-43074-8 |page=124}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Drewe |title=T\u00e0ij\u00ed Ji\u00e0n 32-Posture Sword Form |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6UdWcIx95YC&pg=PT10|date=15 February 2009 |publisher=Singing Dragon |isbn=978-1-84642-869-2 |page=10}}</ref> This process also creates the distinct line down the sides of the blade called the [[Hamon (swordsmithing)|''hamon'']], which is made distinct by polishing.

The traditional oil used is [[choji oil|ch\u014dji oil]] (99% mineral oil and 1% clove oil for fragrance).  Similarly, when stored for longer periods, it is important that the ''katana'' be inspected frequently and aired out if necessary in order to prevent rust or [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] from forming (mold may feed off the salts in the oil used to polish the blade).<ref name=\"Draeger-swordsmanship\">{{cite book |author1=Gordon Warner|author1-link=Gordon Warner |author2=Donn F.

The [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] facilitated a change in the designs of Japanese swords. Thin ''tachi'' and ''chokut\u014d-''style blades were often unable to cut through the boiled leather armour of the Mongols, with the blades often chipping or breaking off.<ref>Sat\u014d, Kanzan. Kodansha International. 1983. Page 104</ref>  The evolution of the ''tachi'' into what would become the ''katana'' seems to have continued during the early [[Muromachi period]] (1337 to 1573). Starting around the year 1400, long swords signed with the ''katana-''style ''mei'' were made. This was in response to ''samurai'' wearing their ''tachi'' in what is now called \"''katana'' style\" (cutting edge up). Japanese swords are traditionally worn with the ''mei'' facing away from the wearer. When a ''tachi'' was worn in the style of a ''katana'', with the cutting edge up, the ''tachi''<nowiki/>'s signature would be facing the wrong way. The fact that [[Japanese swordsmithing|swordsmiths]] started signing swords with a ''katana'' signature shows that some ''samurai'' of that time period had started wearing their swords in a different manner.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2011\">{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull |title=Katana: The Samurai Sword |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFTe6JUEkQC&pg=PA22|date=8 February 2011 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-84908-658-5 |pages=22\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Nagayama 1997\">{{cite book|author=K\u014dkan Nagayama |title=The Connoisseur's Book of Japanese Swords |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPyswmGDBFkC&pg=PA28|year=1997 |publisher=Kodansha International |isbn=978-4-7700-2071-0 |page=28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kissaki no katana Met 2007.478.3.jpg|thumb|left|''Kissaki'' (point) of an Edo period ''katana'']]\n[[File:Nakago no katana Met 2007.478.3.jpg|thumb|left|''Nakago'' ([[tang (tools)|tang]]) of an Edo period ''katana'']]\n\nThe rise in popularity of ''katana'' amongst ''samurai'' came about due to the changing nature of [[close combat|close-combat]] warfare. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times. The ''katana'' further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (''[[Obi (sash)|obi]]'') with the sharpened edge facing up.

Traditionally made swords were produced during this period, but in order to supply such large numbers of swords, blacksmiths with little or no knowledge of traditional Japanese sword manufacture were recruited. In addition, supplies of the Japanese steel (''[[tamahagane]]'') used for swordmaking were limited, so several other types of steel were also used. Quicker methods of forging were also used, such as the use of [[power hammers]], and [[quenching]] the blade in oil, rather than hand forging and water. The non-traditionally made swords from this period are called ''sh\u014dwat\u014d'', after the [[regnal name]] of the Emperor [[Hirohito]], and in 1937, the Japanese government started requiring the use of special stamps on the [[tang (tools)|tang]] (''nakago'') to distinguish these swords from traditionally made swords. During this period of war, older antique swords were remounted for use in military mounts. Presently, in Japan, ''sh\u014dwat\u014d'' are not considered to be \"true\" Japanese swords, and they can be confiscated.

The resulting block of steel is then drawn out to form a billet.\n\nAt this stage, it is only slightly curved or may have no curve at all. The ''katana''<nowiki/>'s gentle curvature is attained by a process of [[Differential hardening|differential hardening or differential quenching]]: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called ''tsuchioki''. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel.<ref name=\"Kapp 1987\"/> When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750&nbsp;\u00b0C, it enters the [[austenite]] phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into [[martensite]], which is a very hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] and [[pearlite]] which is softer than martensite.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Cohen |title=By the Sword: A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and Olympic Champions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=inND87EFFF4C&pg=PA124|date=18 December 2007 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-307-43074-8 |page=124}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Drewe |title=T\u00e0ij\u00ed Ji\u00e0n 32-Posture Sword Form |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6UdWcIx95YC&pg=PT10|date=15 February 2009 |publisher=Singing Dragon |isbn=978-1-84642-869-2 |page=10}}</ref> This process also creates the distinct line down the sides of the blade called the [[Hamon (swordsmithing)|''hamon'']], which is made distinct by polishing.

The inscriptions from [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] era circa 8th to 10th century mentioned several ancient dishes, among others are ''Hadangan Harang'' (water buffalo minced meat satay, similar with today Balinese ''sate lilit''), ''Hadangan Madura'' (water buffalo meat with sweet palm sugar), and ''Dundu Puyengan'' (eel seasoned with lemon basil). Ancient beverages include ''Nalaka Rasa'' ([[sugarcane juice]]), ''Jati Wangi'' (jasmine beverage), and ''Kinca'' (tamarind juice).

The Javanese are known to revere [[Dewi Sri]] as the Rice Goddess. [[Steamed rice]] is the common staple food, and is served at every meal. ''[[Tumpeng]]'', a cone-shaped yellow rice is essential in [[slametan]], Javanese traditional ceremonies. Rice can be processed into ''[[lontong]]'' or ''[[ketupat]]'', or cooked in coconut milk as ''[[nasi liwet]]'' or colored with [[turmeric]] as ''[[nasi kuning]]'' (yellow rice). Other sources of [[carbohydrate]] such as ''[[gaplek]]'' (dried [[cassava]]) is sometimes mixed into rice or replaces rice. ''[[Gaplek]]'' is usually consumed by poor commoners during hard times when rice is scarce. [[Tubers]] such as [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[taro]], and [[sweet potato]] are consumed as snacks in between meals. [[Bread]] and [[grain]]s other than rice are uncommon, although [[noodle]]s and [[potato]]es are often served as accompaniments to rice. Potatoes are often boiled then mashed, shaped into discs, spiced, coated in beaten [[egg]]s and fried into ''[[perkedel]]''.  Wheat noodles, ''bihun'' ([[rice vermicelli]]), and ''[[kwetiau]]'' are influences of [[Chinese cuisine]]. The Javanese adopted these ingredients and made them their own by adding ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) and local spices to create ''[[bakmi Jawa]]'', [[Mi rebus|''bakmi rebus'']], and ''[[bihun]] goreng''. Vegetables feature heavily in Javanese cuisine, notably in vegetable-heavy dishes such as ''[[pecel]]'', [[Gado-gado|''lotek'']], and ''[[urap]]''.\n[[File:Nasi Tumpeng.jpg|thumb|''Tumpeng'' cone shaped rice surrounded with chicken, omelette eggs, ''sambel goreng ati'' (beef liver in ''sambal''), potato ''[[perkedel]]'', and [[tempeh]] ''orek''.]]\n[[Coconut milk]], [[peanut sauce]], ''gula jawa'' ([[palm sugar]]), ''asem jawa'' ([[tamarind]]), ''[[petis]]'', ''[[terasi]]'' (shrimp paste), [[shallot]], [[garlic]], [[turmeric]], [[galangal]], [[ginger]], and chili ''[[sambal]]'' are common ingredients and spices that can be found in Javanese cuisine. Freshwater fishes such as [[carp]], [[tilapia]], [[gourami]] and [[catfish]] are popular, while seafood such as [[tuna]], [[red snapper (fish)|red snapper]], [[wahoo]], [[Ray (fish)|ray]], [[anchovy]], [[shrimp]], [[squid]], and various [[salted fish]] are popular in coastal Javanese cities. [[Chicken (food)|Chicken]], [[goat meat]], [[mutton]] and [[beef]] are popular meats in Javanese cuisine. Next to common farmed chicken, the ''ayam kampung'' or [[Free range|free-range]] chicken, is popular and valued for its leaner, more natural flavors. Almost 90% of Javanese are [[Muslim]], and consequently, much of Javanese cuisine omits [[pork]]. However, in small enclaves of [[Catholic]] Javanese population around [[Muntilan]], [[Magelang]], [[Yogyakarta]], and [[Klaten]], pork might be consumed. Few ethnic groups in Indonesia use pork and other sources of protein considered ''[[haram]]'' under Muslim dietary laws in their cuisine, most prominently [[Balinese cuisine]], [[Indonesian Chinese cuisine]], and [[Manado cuisine]].\n\n== Influences ==\n[[File:Sambal tempe penyet kemangi.JPG|thumb|''[[Sambal]]'' [[tempeh]] ''penyet kemangi''.]]\n\nCompared to the spicy and curry-like cuisine of [[Sumatra]] that is heavily influenced by [[Indian cuisine]], Javanese cuisine is most notably influenced by [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and [[Dutch cuisine|European]] with some local touch. Javanese cuisine in different areas show different foreign influences. For example, Chinese influences is prevalent in [[Semarang]], [[Yogyakarta]], and [[Cirebon]]; [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Arab cuisine|Arabic]] influences in [[Surabaya]], [[Lamongan]], and [[Gresik]]; and [[Europe]]an influences in [[Surakarta|Solo]] and [[Malang]].\n\nJavanese cuisine may also have contributed and influenced foreign cuisines. Javanese ''[[botok]]'', for example, has influenced the [[South Africa]]n [[bobotie]] dish. Because of the dispersion of Javanese people outside of Indonesia, the Javanese cuisine has influenced the cuisine of [[Johor]] in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and the cuisine of [[Culture of Suriname#Cuisine|Suriname]]. The influence of Javanese cuisine has contributed significantly to the food of Johor. Malaysian-Javanese dishes such as ''[[nasi ambeng]]'', ''[[soto ayam]]'', ''[[pecel]]'', [[Tempeh|''tempe'']], and ''[[sambal tempe]]'' are popular in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.degree-essays.com/sample-essays/health/foods-in-malaysia.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121090921/http://www.degree-essays.com/sample-essays/health/foods-in-malaysia.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 January 2013 |title=Foods in Malaysia |publisher=Degree Essays |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Outlets ==\n[[File:Food at Warung Tegal.jpg|thumb|Food display in Warung Tegal.]]\n\nJavanese households usually purchase fresh ingredients from the local market every morning, cook and serve them in the late morning to be mainly consumed for lunch. The leftovers are stored to be heated again for family dinner. Other than homemade family dishes, Javanese cuisine are served from humble street side carts and ''[[warung]]''s, to fancy restaurants in five-star hotels. Small family-run ''[[warung]]''s are the budget options for street food, serving everything from family dishes for full meals, or snack foods. The popular simple Javanese cuisine establishments are the budget food of ''Warung Tegal,'' which are mainly established by Javanese from [[Tegal (city)|Tegal]] city, and the ''Angkringan'' street side carts in Yogyakarta and Solo that sold cheap [[Nasi kucing|''sego kucing'']] and various ''wedang'' (hot beverages).\n\n[[File:Lesehan Malioboro Yogyakarta.jpg|thumb|right|''Lesehan'' sit on the mat dining at Malioboro street, Yogyakarta.]]\nIn Javanese tradition, it is common to dine in ''lesehan'' style, which is sitting cross-legged on the mat while dining in front of short-legged table.

These ethnic groups have their own distinctive cuisines.\n\nJavanese cuisine is largely divided into three major groups:\n* Central Javanese cuisine\n* East Javanese cuisine\n* Common Javanese dishes\n\nThere are similarities in these cuisines but the main differences lie in the flavors. Central Javanese cuisine tend to be sweeter and less spicy, while East Javanese cuisine uses less [[sugar]] and more [[chili pepper|chili]], possibly influenced by [[Madurese people|Madurese]] cuisine or Indian cuisine.\n\n== History ==\nJavanese cooking tradition has a long history, derived from Javanese indigenous elements, and along its history, was enrichen by foreign influences \u2014 including Indian, Chinese and European influences. Ancient dishes and recipes was mentioned in numbers of Javanese ''prasasti'' (inscription) and modern historians has been succeed on deciphered some of them. The inscriptions from [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] era circa 8th to 10th century mentioned several ancient dishes, among others are ''Hadangan Harang'' (water buffalo minced meat satay, similar with today Balinese ''sate lilit''), ''Hadangan Madura'' (water buffalo meat with sweet palm sugar), and ''Dundu Puyengan'' (eel seasoned with lemon basil). Ancient beverages include ''Nalaka Rasa'' ([[sugarcane juice]]), ''Jati Wangi'' (jasmine beverage), and ''Kinca'' (tamarind juice). Also various ''Kuluban'' (boiled vegetables served in spices, similar with today ''[[urab]]'') and ''Phalamula'' (boiled yams and tubers served with liquid palm sugar).<ref name=\"tempo-1\">{{cite news | title = Hanya Ada Di Candi Sojiwan: Menu Hidangan Raja Mataram Kuno | work = TEMPO.CO | date = 22 February 2017 | url = https://travel.tempo.co/read/848941/hanya-ada-di-candi-sojiwan-menu-hidangan-raja-mataram-kuno | language = Indonesian}}</ref>\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:Pasar Keputran Surabaya.JPG|thumb|Fresh produce including vegetables on sale in ''[[pasar pagi]]'' (morning wet market) in [[Surabaya]].]]\n[[Rice]] is an important food crop in Java, dating back to ancient times. The Javanese are known to revere [[Dewi Sri]] as the Rice Goddess. [[Steamed rice]] is the common staple food, and is served at every meal. ''[[Tumpeng]]'', a cone-shaped yellow rice is essential in [[slametan]], Javanese traditional ceremonies. Rice can be processed into ''[[lontong]]'' or ''[[ketupat]]'', or cooked in coconut milk as ''[[nasi liwet]]'' or colored with [[turmeric]] as ''[[nasi kuning]]'' (yellow rice). Other sources of [[carbohydrate]] such as ''[[gaplek]]'' (dried [[cassava]]) is sometimes mixed into rice or replaces rice. ''[[Gaplek]]'' is usually consumed by poor commoners during hard times when rice is scarce. [[Tubers]] such as [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[taro]], and [[sweet potato]] are consumed as snacks in between meals. [[Bread]] and [[grain]]s other than rice are uncommon, although [[noodle]]s and [[potato]]es are often served as accompaniments to rice. Potatoes are often boiled then mashed, shaped into discs, spiced, coated in beaten [[egg]]s and fried into ''[[perkedel]]''.  Wheat noodles, ''bihun'' ([[rice vermicelli]]), and ''[[kwetiau]]'' are influences of [[Chinese cuisine]]. The Javanese adopted these ingredients and made them their own by adding ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) and local spices to create ''[[bakmi Jawa]]'', [[Mi rebus|''bakmi rebus'']], and ''[[bihun]] goreng''. Vegetables feature heavily in Javanese cuisine, notably in vegetable-heavy dishes such as ''[[pecel]]'', [[Gado-gado|''lotek'']], and ''[[urap]]''.\n[[File:Nasi Tumpeng.jpg|thumb|''Tumpeng'' cone shaped rice surrounded with chicken, omelette eggs, ''sambel goreng ati'' (beef liver in ''sambal''), potato ''[[perkedel]]'', and [[tempeh]] ''orek''.]]\n[[Coconut milk]], [[peanut sauce]], ''gula jawa'' ([[palm sugar]]), ''asem jawa'' ([[tamarind]]), ''[[petis]]'', ''[[terasi]]'' (shrimp paste), [[shallot]], [[garlic]], [[turmeric]], [[galangal]], [[ginger]], and chili ''[[sambal]]'' are common ingredients and spices that can be found in Javanese cuisine. Freshwater fishes such as [[carp]], [[tilapia]], [[gourami]] and [[catfish]] are popular, while seafood such as [[tuna]], [[red snapper (fish)|red snapper]], [[wahoo]], [[Ray (fish)|ray]], [[anchovy]], [[shrimp]], [[squid]], and various [[salted fish]] are popular in coastal Javanese cities. [[Chicken (food)|Chicken]], [[goat meat]], [[mutton]] and [[beef]] are popular meats in Javanese cuisine. Next to common farmed chicken, the ''ayam kampung'' or [[Free range|free-range]] chicken, is popular and valued for its leaner, more natural flavors. Almost 90% of Javanese are [[Muslim]], and consequently, much of Javanese cuisine omits [[pork]]. However, in small enclaves of [[Catholic]] Javanese population around [[Muntilan]], [[Magelang]], [[Yogyakarta]], and [[Klaten]], pork might be consumed. Few ethnic groups in Indonesia use pork and other sources of protein considered ''[[haram]]'' under Muslim dietary laws in their cuisine, most prominently [[Balinese cuisine]], [[Indonesian Chinese cuisine]], and [[Manado cuisine]].\n\n== Influences ==\n[[File:Sambal tempe penyet kemangi.JPG|thumb|''[[Sambal]]'' [[tempeh]] ''penyet kemangi''.]]\n\nCompared to the spicy and curry-like cuisine of [[Sumatra]] that is heavily influenced by [[Indian cuisine]], Javanese cuisine is most notably influenced by [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and [[Dutch cuisine|European]] with some local touch. Javanese cuisine in different areas show different foreign influences. For example, Chinese influences is prevalent in [[Semarang]], [[Yogyakarta]], and [[Cirebon]]; [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Arab cuisine|Arabic]] influences in [[Surabaya]], [[Lamongan]], and [[Gresik]]; and [[Europe]]an influences in [[Surakarta|Solo]] and [[Malang]].\n\nJavanese cuisine may also have contributed and influenced foreign cuisines. Javanese ''[[botok]]'', for example, has influenced the [[South Africa]]n [[bobotie]] dish. Because of the dispersion of Javanese people outside of Indonesia, the Javanese cuisine has influenced the cuisine of [[Johor]] in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and the cuisine of [[Culture of Suriname#Cuisine|Suriname]]. The influence of Javanese cuisine has contributed significantly to the food of Johor. Malaysian-Javanese dishes such as ''[[nasi ambeng]]'', ''[[soto ayam]]'', ''[[pecel]]'', [[Tempeh|''tempe'']], and ''[[sambal tempe]]'' are popular in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.degree-essays.com/sample-essays/health/foods-in-malaysia.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121090921/http://www.degree-essays.com/sample-essays/health/foods-in-malaysia.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 January 2013 |title=Foods in Malaysia |publisher=Degree Essays |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Outlets ==\n[[File:Food at Warung Tegal.jpg|thumb|Food display in Warung Tegal.]]\n\nJavanese households usually purchase fresh ingredients from the local market every morning, cook and serve them in the late morning to be mainly consumed for lunch. The leftovers are stored to be heated again for family dinner. Other than homemade family dishes, Javanese cuisine are served from humble street side carts and ''[[warung]]''s, to fancy restaurants in five-star hotels. Small family-run ''[[warung]]''s are the budget options for street food, serving everything from family dishes for full meals, or snack foods. The popular simple Javanese cuisine establishments are the budget food of ''Warung Tegal,'' which are mainly established by Javanese from [[Tegal (city)|Tegal]] city, and the ''Angkringan'' street side carts in Yogyakarta and Solo that sold cheap [[Nasi kucing|''sego kucing'']] and various ''wedang'' (hot beverages).\n\n[[File:Lesehan Malioboro Yogyakarta.jpg|thumb|right|''Lesehan'' sit on the mat dining at Malioboro street, Yogyakarta.]]\nIn Javanese tradition, it is common to dine in ''lesehan'' style, which is sitting cross-legged on the mat while dining in front of short-legged table.

Today, Javanese ''lesehan'' foodstalls can be found in several cities, including Surakarta, Semarang and Jakarta.\n\n== Central Javanese cuisine ==\nThe food in [[Central Java]] is influenced by the two ancient kingdoms of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta Sunanate|Surakarta]] (also commonly known as Solo). Most of Central Javanese dishes are indigenously developed, however in coastal cities such as [[Semarang]] and [[Pekalongan]], notable [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] influences can be seen, such as ''[[lumpia]]'' (spring roll) and ''[[bakmi Jawa]]''. While in royal court of Surakarta, the European influences can be seen, such as ''bistik Jawa'' and ''selat Solo''.

Not to be confused with ''[[pecel lele]]'', which is deep-fried local [[catfish]] served with ''[[sambal]]''.\n*''[[Brem]]'' Madiun: fermented sugar and [[cassava]] cakes.\n\n=== Lamongan ===\n*[[Soto (food)|''Soto'']] [[Lamongan]]: chicken soup originated from the town of Lamongan.\n*''[[Ayam penyet]]'': fried chicken (see ''[[ayam goreng]]''), lightly smashed using a pestle in a mortar laced with ''[[sambal]]''.\n*''Bebek goreng'': deep fried [[duck]], similar to [[duck confit]].\n*''[[Tahu campur]]'': fried [[tofu]], served in ''[[petis]]''-based beef stew.\n*''Pecel lele'': deep fried [[catfish]] with ''[[sambal]]'', vegetables, and [[rice]].\n\n=== Surabaya ===\n[[File:Rujak Cingur.jpg|thumb|''Rujak cingur'', specialty of Surabaya.]]\n\n*''[[Rawon]]'': a dark beef soup, served with [[mung bean]] sprouts and the ubiquitous ''[[sambal]]''. The dark (almost black) color comes from the kluwak (''Pangium edule'') nuts.\n*[[Rujak#Rujak Cingur|''Rujak cingur'']]:<ref>{{Cite book| last = Tania| first = Vania | title = Djakabaia: Djalan-djalan dan Makan-makan| publisher = Gramedia Pustaka Utama| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c33bzkrQ3vEC| isbn = 978-979-223923-2| id = {{ISBN|979-22-3923-5}} }}</ref> a marinated [[cow]] snout or lips and noses (''cingur''), served with boiled vegetables and shrimp crackers. It is then dressed in a sauce made of caramelized fermented shrimp paste (''[[petis]]''), peanuts, [[Sambal|chili]], and spices. It is usually served with ''[[lontong]]'', a boiled rice cake. ''Rujak cingur'' is considered traditional food of [[Surabaya]] in [[East Java]].\n*''Lontong kupang'': ''[[lontong]]'' with small [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockles]] in ''[[petis]]'' sauce.\n*''Semanggi'': a salad made of boiled ''semanggi'' (''M. crenata'') leaves that grow in paddy fields. It is dressed in a spicy peanut sauce.\n\n=== Madura ===\n*[[Soto (food)|''Soto'']] [[Madura]]: a [[turmeric]]-based beef and [[offal]] soup, served with boiled egg slices, and ''[[sambal]]''.\n*''[[Sate]]'' [[Madura]]: originating on the island of Madura, near Java, is a famous variant among Indonesians. Most often made from [[mutton]] or chicken, the recipe's main characteristic is the black sauce made from Indonesian sweet soy sauce (''kecap manis'') mixed with [[palm sugar]] (called ''gula jawa'' or \"Javanese sugar\" in Indonesia), [[garlic]], deep fried [[shallot]]s, peanut paste, ''petis'' (a kind of shrimp paste), [[candlenut]], and salt. Chicken Madura satay is usually served in peanut sauce, while the mutton Madura satay is usually served in sweet soy sauce. Sate Madura uses smaller chunks of meat than other variants. It is eaten with rice or rice cakes wrapped in [[banana]]/coconut leaves (''lontong/ketupat''). Raw thinly sliced shallots and plain ''sambal'' are often served as condiments.\n\n=== Malang ===\n[[File:Baso Malang Karapitan.JPG|thumb|''Bakso'' Malang, meatball and fried wonton soup from Malang, East Java. Sometimes also called ''bakwan'' Malang.]]\n\n* ''[[Bakso]]'' Malang: ''bakso'' literally means meatball. ''Bakso'' Malang has more accompaniments, beside the meatball (mostly beef) itself. For example, offal, ''[[siomay]]'' dumplings (fried or steamed), ''tahu'' (tofu, fried or steamed, filled with meat), ''soun'' (mung bean threads), and yellow egg noodles. All of these are served in hot beef stock.\n*''Cwie mie'': a Chinese-influenced noodle dish, containing boiled and seasoned noodles, topped with pre-cooked minced meat (usually [[pork]] or chicken) and boiled [[wonton]]. Similar to the Chinese [[zhajiang mian]].\n\n=== Other East Javanese cuisine ===\n*''Sate'' Ponorogo: a variant of [[satay]] originating in [[Ponorogo]], a town in East Java. It is made from sliced marinated chicken, served with a sauce made of peanuts and chili, and garnished with shredded shallots, ''[[sambal]]'', and [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice. This variant is unique for the fact that each skewer contains one large piece of chicken, rather than several small cubes. The meat is marinated in spices and sweet soy sauce, in a process called \"''bacem''\" and is served with rice or ''lontong'' (rice cake). The grill is made from [[terracotta]] earthenware with a hole on one side to allow ventilation for the coals. After three months of use, the earthenware grill disintegrates and must be replaced.\n*''Lontong balap'': literally means \"racing rice cake\", which is a dish of rice cakes, fried tofu, and beansprouts, doused in ''[[kecap manis]]'' and ''[[sambal]]'' sauce. In the past, ''lontong balap'' hawkers carried their wares in a large, heavy metal urn. The heaviness caused them to have to walk really quickly while carrying it, so they looked like they were \"racing\".\n*''Tahu campur'': a beef and offal soup, mixed with fresh vegetables, [[potato]]es, rice cake, and tofu. The secret ingredient is the caramelized fermented shrimp paste (''[[petis]]'') which is mixed in just before serving.\n*''Tahu tek-tek'': a dish containing cut-up fried [[tofu]], boiled vegetables (mostly beansprouts), potatoes, drenched in a peanut-based sauce. The sauce has caramelized fermented shrimp paste (''[[petis]]''), chili, and [[garlic]].\n\n== Common Javanese dishes ==\n[[File:Satay Seller Java.jpg|thumb|Street-side Javanese chicken satay vendor near [[Borobudur]].]]\n[[File:Gorengan.JPG|thumb|''Gorengan'' (\"fried snacks\") in a market at [[Dieng Plateau]], [[Central Java]].]]\n[[File:Nasi Kuning Ibu Sulastri.jpg|thumb|''[[Nasi kuning]]'' with ''[[urap]]'', fried beef, anchovy and peanuts, potato and shrimp in ''sambal''.]]\nThese are the common Javanese dishes, which can be found throughout Java regardless of the location.\n*[[Satay|''Sate'']]: skewered grilled meat is a common dish in Java.
