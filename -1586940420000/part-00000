He fought in France during [[World War I]], where he was shot in the right shoulder. The injury initially cost him the use of his arm and always limited his range of motion. He said of his combat experience:<blockquote>I did not care what or where I went. I asked God to help me, and he did so. And that is the way I came through that terrible and Hellish place.

Some draw on his personal experience of the war or turn-of-the-century domestic life.\n\nIn 1937, he started exhibiting his work formally, with the support of the founders of the local art association, critic Christian Brinton and artist [[N. C. Wyeth]]. He soon attracted curators [[Dorothy Miller]] and [[Holger Cahill]] and, by 1940, the Philadelphia dealer Robert Carlen and the collector [[Albert C. Barnes]].

During this period, he had solo exhibitions in commercial galleries in Philadelphia (1940, 1941) and New York (1940, 1944), and at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] (1941), and [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (1942). Private collections and museums such as the [[Barnes Foundation]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and the Whitney Museum of American Art, acquired his works. His paintings were featured in national surveys held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL; [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]], Pittsburgh, PA; [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; Dayton Art Institute, OH;  [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; [[Newark Museum]], Newark, NJ;  Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA. and [[Tate Gallery]], London, UK.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the catalogue for his memorial exhibition in 1947, critic [[Alain Locke]] described Pippin as \"a real and rare genius, combining folk quality with artistic maturity so uniquely as almost to defy classification.\"\n\n==Artworks==\nHis first oil painting,''The Ending of the War, Starting Home,'' depicts a military engagement resembling the assault on Sechault, in which he was wounded and his regiment was decimated. He depicted World War I several times thereafter in the 1930s and once more in 1945.[[File:1941-2-1-cx.jpg!Large.jpg|thumb|center|A depiction by Horace Pippin of the end of World War I]]\n\nPippin painted several religious subjects, both those illustrating Bible passages and more visionary statements like his ''Holy Mountain'' series.\n[[File:Crucifixion-1943.jpg|thumb|center|Crucifixion, Painted by Horace Pippin in 1943.]]\n\nHis ''Self-portrait'' of 1941 shows him seated at the easel. His painting of ''[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] Going to his Hanging'' (1942) is in the collection of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]] is part of a trilogy on the subject of the abolitionist who is sometimes credited with igniting the Civil War.<br />\n\n<!----- This is a non-free image, being used under \"fair use\" please don't increase the size or add another image of his paintings ----><center>\n<gallery widths=\"250px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Horace Pippin, John Brown Going to His Hanging.jpg|Horace Pippin, ''John Brown Going to His Hanging''\n</gallery></center>\n\nAmong Pippin's work there are many [[Genre art|genre paintings]], such as the ''[[Domino Game|Domino Players]]'' (1943), in the [[Phillips Collection]], [[Washington D.C.]], and several versions of ''Cabin in the Cotton''. His portraits include a depiction of the [[contralto]] [[Marian Anderson]] singing, painted in 1941. He also painted landscapes and religious subjects.\n\nHis painting ''Mr. Prejudice,'' made at the request of an unidentified patron, depicts African-Americans and whites standing near front of the Statue of Liberty. Above the group of people, a Caucasian man can be seen driving a wedge between the two groups. Alongside him stands a member of the Ku Klux Klan. One of the men seems to be an African-American soldier dressed in a World War I uniform, which may refer to his service in that war.[[File:Mr-prejudice-1943.jpg|thumb|center|Mr. Prejudice painted by Horace Pippin in 1943|alt=|border]]\n  \nPippin left ''The Park Bench'' unfinished in his studio at this death in 1946.

Some of his best-known works address the U.S.'s  history of [[slavery]] and racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]].\n\nA Pennsylvania State historical Marker was placed at 327 Gay Street, [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], to commemorate his accomplishments and mark his home where he lived at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite web|title=Horace Pippin - Pennsylvania Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMM4F_Horace_Pippin|website=www.waymarking.com|accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], and grew up in and around [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen, New York]].

He fought in France during [[World War I]], where he was shot in the right shoulder. The injury initially cost him the use of his arm and always limited his range of motion. He said of his combat experience:<blockquote>I did not care what or where I went. I asked God to help me, and he did so. And that is the way I came through that terrible and Hellish place.

He later explained his creative process: \"The pictures which I have already painted come to me in my mind, and if to me it is a worth while picture, I paint it.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/americanfolkpain00lipm|title=American folk painters of three centuries|date=1980|publisher=Hudson Hills Press|others=Lipman, Jean; Armstrong, Tom; Whitney Museum of American Art|isbn=0933920059|url-access=registration}}</ref> He  addressed a range of themes, from landscapes and still lifes to biblical subjects and political statements. Some draw on his personal experience of the war or turn-of-the-century domestic life.\n\nIn 1937, he started exhibiting his work formally, with the support of the founders of the local art association, critic Christian Brinton and artist [[N. C. Wyeth]]. He soon attracted curators [[Dorothy Miller]] and [[Holger Cahill]] and, by 1940, the Philadelphia dealer Robert Carlen and the collector [[Albert C. Barnes]].

During this period, he had solo exhibitions in commercial galleries in Philadelphia (1940, 1941) and New York (1940, 1944), and at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] (1941), and [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (1942). Private collections and museums such as the [[Barnes Foundation]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and the Whitney Museum of American Art, acquired his works. His paintings were featured in national surveys held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL; [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]], Pittsburgh, PA; [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; Dayton Art Institute, OH;  [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; [[Newark Museum]], Newark, NJ;  Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA. and [[Tate Gallery]], London, UK.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the catalogue for his memorial exhibition in 1947, critic [[Alain Locke]] described Pippin as \"a real and rare genius, combining folk quality with artistic maturity so uniquely as almost to defy classification.\"\n\n==Artworks==\nHis first oil painting,''The Ending of the War, Starting Home,'' depicts a military engagement resembling the assault on Sechault, in which he was wounded and his regiment was decimated. He depicted World War I several times thereafter in the 1930s and once more in 1945.[[File:1941-2-1-cx.jpg!Large.jpg|thumb|center|A depiction by Horace Pippin of the end of World War I]]\n\nPippin painted several religious subjects, both those illustrating Bible passages and more visionary statements like his ''Holy Mountain'' series.\n[[File:Crucifixion-1943.jpg|thumb|center|Crucifixion, Painted by Horace Pippin in 1943.]]\n\n\nHis ''Self-portrait'' of 1941 shows him seated at the easel. His painting of ''[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] Going to his Hanging'' (1942) is in the collection of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]] is part of a trilogy on the subject of the abolitionist who is sometimes credited with igniting the Civil War.<br />\n\n<!----- This is a non-free image, being used under \"fair use\" please don't increase the size or add another image of his paintings ----><center>\n<gallery widths=\"250px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Horace Pippin, John Brown Going to His Hanging.jpg|Horace Pippin, ''John Brown Going to His Hanging''\n</gallery></center>\n\nAmong Pippin's work there are many [[Genre art|genre paintings]], such as the ''[[Domino Game|Domino Players]]'' (1943), in the [[Phillips Collection]], [[Washington D.C.]], and several versions of ''Cabin in the Cotton''. His portraits include a depiction of the [[contralto]] [[Marian Anderson]] singing, painted in 1941. He also painted landscapes and religious subjects.\n\nHis painting ''Mr. Prejudice,'' made at the request of an unidentified patron, depicts African-Americans and whites standing near front of the Statue of Liberty. Above the group of people, a Caucasian man can be seen driving a wedge between the two groups. Alongside him stands a member of the Ku Klux Klan. One of the men seems to be an African-American soldier dressed in a World War I uniform, which may refer to his service in that war.[[File:Mr-prejudice-1943.jpg|thumb|center|Mr. Prejudice painted by Horace Pippin in 1943|alt=|border]]\n  \nPippin left ''The Park Bench'' unfinished in his studio at this death in 1946.

In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, stored audible materials began to dominate the music recording industry and revolutionized the portability and ease of use of band and instrumental music by musicians and entertainers as the demand for entertainers increased globally. This may have been attributable to the [[Compact Cassette#Introduction of music cassettes|introduction of music cassette tapes]], technology that arose from the need to customize music recordings and the desire for a \"handy\" format that would allow fast and convenient duplication of music and thereby meet the requirements of the entertainers' lifestyles and the 'footloose' character of the entertainment industry.\n\n=== 1970s: Development of the karaoke machine ===\n\nThe karaoke-styled machine was developed in various places in Japan. Japanese engineer Shigeichi Negishi, who ran a car audio system assembly business in Tokyo, made the first prototype in 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.karaoke.or.jp/03nenpyo/|title=A History of KARAOKE|website=All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Karaoke Secret History \u2013 world revolution of ingenuity|last=Ugaya|first=Hiromichi|publisher=Shinchosha Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-4106102929|location=|pages=49\u201353}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title=Selection from TOP 100 Japanese Innovations of \"Karaoke\"|url=https://www.jpo.go.jp/torikumi_e/kokusai_e/training/enishi/theme/No11_December2015_11.pdf|journal=IP Friends Connections|volume=December 2015 No. 11|pages=53|access-date=19 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109014209/https://www.jpo.go.jp/torikumi_e/kokusai_e/training/enishi/theme/No11_December2015_11.pdf|archive-date=9 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> 3 years later, Toshiharu Yamashita, who worked as a singing coach sold an 8-track playback deck and kick-started the karaoke trend.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIt was 1971 that a musician [[Daisuke Inoue]],<ref>[http://www.events-in-music.com/who-invented-the-karaoke-machine.html Who Invented the Karaoke Machine?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305204829/http://www.events-in-music.com/who-invented-the-karaoke-machine.html |date=5 March 2008 }} Events-in-Music.com</ref> who was believed as an inventor of karaoke, devised karaoke equipment in [[Kobe]],<ref>[http://www.inouej1.com/index.html \u4e95\u4e0a\u5927\u7950\u3010\u30ab\u30e9\u30aa\u30b1\u767a\u660e\u8005\u3011 J-ONE/INOUE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321051214/http://www.inouej1.com/index.html |date=21 March 2009 }} Events-in-Music.com</ref><ref>''Time 100:Daisuke Inoue'', 23\u201330 August 1999 VOL. 154 NO. 7/8</ref> although the audio company Clarion was the first commercial producer of the machine due to there being no patent.\n\nIn Japan, it has long been common to provide musical entertainment at a dinner or a party. Inoue, a drummer, was frequently asked by guests in the [[Utagoe coffeehouse|Utagoe Kissa]] where he performed to provide recordings of his performances so that they could sing along. Realizing the potential for the market, he made a tape recorder-like machine that played songs for a 100-yen coin each.\n\nInstead of giving his karaoke machines away, Inoue leased them out so that stores did not have to buy new songs on their own. Originally, it was considered a somewhat expensive [[Fads and trends|fad]], as it lacked the live atmosphere of a real performance and 100 yen in the 1970s was the price of two typical lunches, but it caught on as a popular kind of entertainment. Karaoke machines were initially placed in restaurants and hotel rooms; soon, new businesses called [[karaoke box]]es, with compartmented rooms, became popular. In 2004, Daisuke Inoue was awarded the [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[Ig Nobel]] Peace Prize for inventing karaoke, \"thereby providing an entirely new way for people to learn to tolerate each other.\"<ref name=\"ignobel 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2004|title=The 2004 Ig Nobel Prize Winners|work=Winners of the Ig Nobel Prize|publisher=[[Improbable Research]]|accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe patent holder of the karaoke machine is [[Roberto del Rosario]].

In-home karaoke machines soon followed but lacked success in the American and Canadian markets. When creators became aware of this problem, karaoke machines were no longer being sold strictly for the purpose of karaoke but as [[home cinema|home theater]] systems to enhance television watching to \"movie theater like quality\". Home theater systems took off, and karaoke went from being the main purpose of the stereo system to a side feature.\n\nAs more music became available for karaoke machines, more people within the industry saw karaoke as a profitable form of [[Bar (counter)|lounge]] and [[nightclub]] entertainment. It is not uncommon for some bars to have karaoke performances seven nights a week.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nVTqAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=karaoke+performances+seven+nights+a+week#v=onepage&q=karaoke%20performances%20seven%20nights%20a%20week&f=false|title=Karaoke: The Global Phenomenon|last=Zhou|first=Xun|last2=Tarocco|first2=Francesca|date=1 June 2013|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=9781780232409|language=en}}</ref> commonly with high-end sound equipment superior to the small, stand-alone consumer versions. [[:wikt:dance floor|Dance floor]]s and lighting effects are also becoming common sights in karaoke bars. Lyrics are often displayed on multiple television screens around the bar.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[File:KaraokeMachine.JPG|thumb|right|Early karaoke machine]]\nA basic karaoke machine consists of a music player, [[microphone]] inputs, a means of altering the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the played music, and an audio output. Some low-end machines attempt to provide vocal suppression so that one can feed regular songs into the machine and remove the voice of the original singer; however, this is rarely effective. Most common machines are [[CD+G]], [[Laser Disc]], [[VCD]] or DVD players with microphone inputs and an audio mixer built in.<ref name=\"cloud\">{{cite web | url=http://karaokecloud.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/the-history-of-karaoke-in-america/ | title=The History of Karaoke in America | publisher=Karaoke Cloud | accessdate=15 January 2014| date=12 April 2013 }}</ref> CD+G players use a special track called [[subcode]] to encode the lyrics and pictures displayed on the screen while other formats natively display both audio and video.\n\nMost karaoke machines have technology<ref name=clickblue>Clickblue [http://clickblue.in/persang-entertainment-pvtltd/http-googl-zyp7hp \"Best technology Karaoke systems from a renowned karaoke manufacturing company\"], 30 November 2014, ''International Business Times''. Retrieved 30 November 2014</ref> that electronically changes the pitch of the music so that amateur singers can choose a key that is appropriate for their vocal range, while maintaining the original tempo of the song. (Old systems which used cassettes changed the pitch by altering playback speed, but none are still on the market, and their commercial use is virtually nonexistent.)\n\nA popular game using karaoke is to type in a random number and call up a song, which participants attempt to sing. In some machines, this game is pre-programmed and may be limited to a genre so that they cannot call up an obscure national anthem that none of the participants can sing. This game has come to be called \"Kamikaze Karaoke\" or \"Karaoke [[Roulette]]\" in some parts of the United States and Canada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nMany low-end entertainment systems have a karaoke mode that attempts to remove the vocal track from regular audio CDs, using an [[Out Of Phase Stereo (OOPS)]] technique. This is done by center channel extraction, which exploits the fact that in most stereo recordings the vocals are in the center. This means that the voice, as part of the music, has equal volume on both stereo channels and no phase difference. To get the quasi-karaoke ([[monoaural|mono]]) track, the left channel of the original audio is subtracted from the right channel. The Sega Saturn also has a \"mute vocals\" feature that is based on the same principle and is also able to adjust the pitch of the song to match the singer's vocal range.\n\n[[File:Karaoke Booth.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A row of 3 karaoke booths at a shopping center in [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles City]], [[Philippines]]]]\nThis crude approach results in the often-poor performance of voice removal. Common effects are hearing the [[reverberation]] effects on the voice track (due to stereo reverb on the vocals not being in the center); also, other instruments (snare/bass drum, bass guitar and solo instruments) that happen to be mixed into the center get removed, degrading this approach to hardly more than a gimmick in those devices. Recent years have seen the development of new techniques based on the [[Fast Fourier Transform]]. Although still not perfect, the results are usually much better than the old technique, because the stereo left-right comparison can be done on individual frequencies.\n\n=== Early age ===\n\nEarly karaoke machines used [[8-track tape|8-track cartridges]] (The Singing Machine) and [[cassette tape]]s, with printed lyric sheets, but technological advances replaced this with CDs, [[video CD|VCD]]s, [[laserdisc]]s and, currently, DVDs. In the late 1980s and 1990s, [[Pioneer Electronics]] dominated the international karaoke music video market, producing high quality karaoke music videos (inspired by the music videos such as those on [[MTV]]). {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1992, [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] introduced the [https://webcomicms.net/clipart-9412363-karaoke-machine-cliparts X2000], which fetched music via a dial-up telephone network. Its repertoire of music and graphics was limited, but its smaller size and the advantage of continuous updates saw it gradually replace traditional machines. Karaoke machines which are connected via [[fiber-optic]] links enabling them to provide instant high-quality music and video are becoming increasingly popular.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n''Karaoke direct'' is an Internet division established in 1997 been serving the public online since 1998. They released the first karaoke player that supports [[MP3+G]] and now {{When|date=June 2010}} the KDX2000 model supporting karaoke in DIVX Format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhymezone.com/r/rhyme.cgi?loc=ol_ue&typeofrhyme=wke&Word=Divx|title=RhymeZone: Use Divx in a sentence|website=www.rhymezone.com|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Video games ===\n{{Main|Music video game#Pitch games}}\n\nThe earliest karaoke-based [[music video game]], called ''[[Karaoke Studio]]'', was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Famicom]] in 1985, but its limited computing ability made for a short catalog of songs and therefore reduced replay value. As a result, karaoke games were considered little more than collector's items until they saw release in higher-capacity DVD formats.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'', created for the [[PlayStation 2]] by [[Harmonix]] and released by [[Konami]] in North America in 2003, is a console game in which a single player sings along with on-screen guidance and receives a score based on pitch, timing, and rhythm. The game soon spawned several follow-ups including ''Karaoke Revolution Vol. 2'', ''Karaoke Revolution Vol. 3'', ''Karaoke Revolution Party Edition'', ''CMT Presents Karaoke Revolution: Country'' and ''Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol''. While the original ''Karaoke Revolution'' was also eventually released for the Microsoft [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console in late 2004, the new online-enabled version included the ability to download additional song packs through the console's exclusive [[Xbox Live]] service.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nA similar series, ''[[SingStar]]'', published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, is particularly popular in the European and Australasian markets. Other [[music video game]] titles that involve singing by the player include ''[[Boogie (video game)|Boogie]]'' and its sequel ''[[Boogie Superstar]]'', ''[[Disney Sing It]]'', ''[[Get On Da Mic]]'', the ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' series starting with ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'', ''[[High School Musical: Sing It!]]'', ''[[Lips (video game)|Lips]]'', the ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' series, ''[https://www.smule.com/songs SingSong]'', ''[[UltraStar]]'', and ''[[Xbox Music Mixer]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xbox.com/en-in/search/learn|title=https://www.xbox.com/en-in/search/learn|website=www.xbox.com|language=en-in|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\nAn Xbox Live App with the same name created by iNiS and powered by The Karaoke Channel/Stingray Karaoke was released in 12 December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft's upcoming XBOX 360 Karaoke App will charge you by the hour|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-19-microsofts-upcoming-xbox-360-karaoke-app-will-charge-you-by-the-hour|work=EuroGamer|access-date=19 November 2012|date=19 November 2012}}</ref> The app uses [[Unreal Engine 3]].\n\n=== VCDs ===\n\nMany VCD players in Southeast Asia have a built-in karaoke function. On stereo recordings, one speaker will play the music with the vocal track, and the other speaker will play the music without the vocal track. So, to sing karaoke, users play the music-only track through both speakers. In the past, there were only pop-song karaoke VCDs. Nowadays, different types of karaoke VCDs are available. [[Cantonese opera]] karaoke VCD is now a big hit among the elderly in Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== On mobile phones ===\n\nIn 2003, several companies started offering a karaoke service on mobile phones, using a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[MIDlet]] that runs with a text file containing the words and a MIDI file with the music. More usual is to contain the lyrics within the same MIDI file. Often the file extension is then changed from .mid to .kar, both are compatible with the standard for MIDI files.\n\nResearchers have also developed karaoke games for cell phones to boost music database training. In 2006, the Interactive Audio Lab at Northwestern University released a game called Karaoke Callout for the Nokia Series 60 phone. The project has since then expanded into a web-based game and will be released soon as an iPhone application.\n\nKaraoke is now available for the Android, iPhone and other playback devices at many internet storefronts.\n\n=== On computers and the Internet ===\n\nSince 2003, much software has been released for hosting karaoke shows and playing karaoke songs on a personal computer. Instead of having to carry around hundreds of CD-Gs or laserdiscs, KJs{{who|date=January 2018}} can \"[[ripping|rip]]\" their entire libraries onto their hard drives and play the songs and lyrics from the computer.\n\nAdditionally, new software permits singers to sing and listen to one another over the Internet.\n\nKaraoke devices in the 2000s saw a shift towards the use of hard drives to store large collections of karaoke tracks and touch screen devices that allows users to select their songs. This trend was driven by the decline cost of hard drive storage<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2017/12/20/digital-storage-projections-for-2018-part-1/|title=Digital Storage Projections For 2018, Part 1|last=Coughlin|first=Tom|work=Forbes|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref> and improvement in [[touchscreen]] technology in the consumer space.\n\nIn 2010, a new concept of home karaoke system through the use of live streaming from a cloud server emerged.

ROXI matches songs in its cloud based licensed music streaming catalogue to a lyrics database to provide real time scrolling on-screen lyrics.

Europe's first commercial \"karaokecab\" which was a London TX4 taxi with a karaoke machine inside for occupants of the cab to use to sing whilst in the cab. The idea and installation were made by Richard Harfield of karaokeshop.com and was featured on Channel 4's Big Breakfast and several German TV stations featured the karaokecab. Granada TV also featured the cab, which is now in its 4th vehicle and operates in [[Bolton]], Greater Manchester as Clint's Karaoke Cab. Karaoke is often also found as a feature in [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] in-car DVD players.\n\nIn 2010, karaoke taxis were available in London, England in the 'Kabeoke' fleet of private hire vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starnow.co.uk/listing/177086|title=Photoshoot for The Kabeoke \u2013 Karaoke Taxi- London}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative playback devices ===\n\nThe [[CD+G]] format of a karaoke disc, which contains the lyrics on a specially encoded subcode track, has heretofore required special\u2014and expensive\u2014equipment to play. Commercial players have come down in price, though, and some unexpected devices (including the [[Sega Saturn]] [[video game console]] and [[XBMC Media Center]] on the first Xbox) can decode the graphics; in fact, karaoke machines, including video and sometimes recording capability, are often popular electronics items for sale in toy stores and electronics stores.\n\nAdditionally, there is software for Windows, Pocket PC, Linux, and Macintosh PCs that can decode and display karaoke song tracks, though usually these must be ripped from the CD first, and possibly compressed.\n\nIn addition to CD+G and software-based karaoke, microphone-based karaoke players enjoy popularity mainly in North America and some Asian countries such as the Philippines. Microphone-based karaoke players only need to be connected to a TV\u2014and in some cases to a power outlet; in other cases they run on batteries. These devices often support advanced features, such as pitch correction and special sound effects. Some companies offer karaoke content for paid download to extend the song library in microphone-based karaoke systems.\n\nCD+G, DVD, VCD and microphone-based players are most popular for home use. Due to song selection and quality of recordings, CD+G is the most popular format for English and Spanish. It is also important to note that CD+G has limited graphical capabilities, whereas VCD and DVD usually have a moving picture or video background. VCD and DVD are the most common format for Asian singers due to music availability and largely due to the moving picture/video background.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n== Terms ==\n\n;J\u016bhachiban\n: ([[wiktionary:\u5341\u516b\u756a|\u5341\u516b\u756a]]. also ''ohako'').

A karaoke box is a small or medium-sized room containing karaoke equipment rented by the hour or half-hour, providing a more intimate atmosphere. Karaoke venues of this type are often dedicated businesses, some with multiple floors and a variety of amenities including food service, but hotels and business facilities sometimes provide karaoke boxes as well. In [[South Korea]], karaoke boxes are called ''norebangs''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.exploringkorea.com/karaoke-in-korea/|title=Karaoke in Korea \u2013 Exploring Korea|date=11 July 2011|newspaper=Exploring Korea|access-date=22 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119184544/http://www.exploringkorea.com/karaoke-in-korea/|archivedate=19 November 2016}}</ref> In Taiwan and China, a karaoke establishment is called a KTV.\n\nIn some [[dim sum|traditional Chinese restaurants]], there are so-called \"mahjong-karaoke rooms\" where the elderly play [[mahjong]] while teenagers sing karaoke. The result is fewer complaints about boredom, but more noise. [[Noise regulation]]s can be an issue, especially when karaoke is brought into residential areas.\n\nViolent reactions to karaoke singing have made headlines in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, with reports of killings by listeners disturbed by the singing. In the Philippines, at least half a dozen killings of people singing \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\" caused newspapers there to label the phenomenon \"[[My Way killings]]\"; some bars refuse to allow the song, and some singers refrain from vocalizing it among strangers.<ref name=noss>Onishi, Norimitsu, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/world/asia/07karaoke.html?hpw=&pagewanted=print \"Sinatra Song Often Strikes Deadly Chord\"], 7 February 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Most of these establishments allow patrons to sing for free, with the expectation that sufficient revenue will be made selling food and drink to the singers. Less commonly, the patron wishing to sing must pay a small fee for each song they sing. Both are financially beneficial for the establishment by not having to pay a professional singer or a cabaret tax which is usually applied to any entertainment of more than 1 person.\n\nMany establishments offer karaoke on a weekly schedule, while some have shows every night. Such establishments commonly invest more in both equipment and song discs, and are often extremely popular, with an hour or more wait between a singer's opportunities to take the stage (called the ''rotation'').\n\nPrivate karaoke rooms, similar to Asia's karaoke boxes, are commonplace in communities such as [[Toronto]], Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City and San Francisco. Toronto's [[Koreatown]] is one example of an area where popularity is growing to the point that private karaoke rooms require reservations on the weekends.\n\nKaraoke is very popular in [[Scotland]] with dedicated karaoke venues in most reasonably large towns. [[Aberdeen]] is home to a number of notable karaoke bars including Wagleys, The Spirit Level, Bardot's Karaoke Bar, Sing City.\n\nThroughout much of North America, live band karaoke is also popular. With [[live band karaoke]], singers sing with a live band instead of the prerecorded backing track.\n\nRock critic [[Rob Sheffield]] claims that the 1986 music video for the song \"[[Wild Wild Life]]\" by the [[Talking Heads]] was the first depiction of karaoke in American popular culture. The video features a variety of characters taking turns singing portions of the song to an audience at a bar.<ref name=\"sheffield\">{{cite book | title=Turn Around Bright Eyes: The Rituals of Love and Karaoke | publisher=HarperCollins | author=Sheffield, Rob | year=2013 | location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/turnaroundbright0000shef/page/288 288] | isbn=978-0062207623 | url=https://archive.org/details/turnaroundbright0000shef/page/288 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Room 601, Karaoke Kan, Tokyo.jpg|right|thumb|The karaoke box at Karaoke Kan (Tokyo) where Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson sang in ''Lost in Translation.'']] Karaoke made a brief appearance in Sofia Coppola's 2003 movie ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'', and it was, three years before, the primary focus of [[Bruce Paltrow]]'s 2000 film ''[[Duets (film)|Duets]],'' written by John Bynum and starring Paltrow's daughter [[Gwyneth Paltrow|Gwyneth]] and [[Huey Lewis]], \"anchor-man\" of [[Huey Lewis and the News]].\n\nAlso popular among the international performing arts community in Europe, a group of Finnish producers organized an international karaoke competition called KWC (Karaoke World Championships). Their 2011 international karaoke competition has attracted [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] producers to help host America's karaoke competition in Las Vegas Nevada called Karaoke Battle USA. The competition is promised to select 1 male and 1 female contestant to represent the U.S. in the international arena. Largely supported by the Broadway community in Times Square, [[Pulse Karaoke Lounge]] sponsored 2011's New York state karaoke finals to select individuals representing New York in the eastern finals.\n\nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the dozens of karaoke bars in [[Portland, Oregon]] make it not just \"the capital of karaoke\" in the United States, but \"one of the most exciting music scenes in America.\"<ref>''[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/portland-karaoke-scene.html?pagewanted=all How Good Does Karaoke Have to Be to Qualify as Art?]'', Dan Kois, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 January 2013</ref>\n\n=== Taiwan ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}\nIn Taiwan, karaoke bars similar to those in Japan and South Korea are called KTVs, which stands for karaoke television. Karaoke is a highly popular form of recreation in Taiwan. The biggest KTV chains in Taiwan are Partyworld Cashbox, Holiday KTV and NewCBParty.\n\n===South Korea===\nA '''noraebang''' ([[Hangul]]: \ub178\ub798\ubc29) refers to a singing venue in South Korea where private sound-proof rooms are available for rent, equipped for singing \u2013 typically microphones, remote controls, a large video screen, couches, and mood d\u00e9cor such as disco lights and tambourines. The term noraebang is a Korean compound word, blending norae ([[Hangul]]: \ub178\ub798, English: song) and bang ([[Hangul]]: \ubc29, English: room). It is the regional equivalent to the [[Karaoke box]] in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://musicaroo.com/noraebang-korean-karaoke-box/|title=Noraebang: The Korean Karaoke Box|date=13 February 2017|website=Musicaroo}}</ref>\n\nSinging is an important part of social life in Korea, where people will perform, and be persuaded to perform, an impromptu song at virtually any social occasion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Donald |date=2000 |title=Culture and Customs of Korea|url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00clar |url-access=registration }}</ref> As such, noraebangs are popular and widespread, often identifiable by bright neon signs with musical notes or microphones.<ref>[http://traveltips.usatoday.com/things-see-seoul-korea-11625.html \"Things to See & Do in Seoul, Korea\"] ''USA Today'' <!-- retrieved 7 December 2015 --></ref>\n\nOften the last stop after a night of alcohol-lined entertainment for youths and businesspeople alike,<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/off-track-planet/karaoke-seoul_b_4144228.html \"How to Karaoke Like a Boss in Seoul\"] ''HuffPost'' 29 October 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.koreanzbc.co.nz/en/-business-in-korea/doing-business-in-korea \"Doing Business in Korea\"] ''Korean New Zealand Business Council <!-- retrieved 7 December 2015 --></ref> noraebangs are also a favorite family pastime, and many are surprisingly dry venues.<ref>[http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/People/view?articleId=120631 \"Singin\u2019 in the room noraebang nights\"] ''Korea.net'' 16 July 2014</ref> People also frequent noraebangs as a form of stress relief, and some noraebangs cater to those who seek to sing alone.<ref>[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140212001033 \"Uniquely Korean \u2013 Noraebang: Singing relieves stress, smoothes relationships\"] ''The Korea Herald'', 2 December 2014</ref>\n\n=== The Philippines ===\n\nKaraoke has become a pastime activity in the Philippines especially when entertaining friends at home. The 'minus-one' music on tapes during the late 1960s with prevailing songs such as [[the Beatles]] pop songs had become favorite songs. Singing contests during town festivals would attract contestants who carry with them cassette tapes with instrumental versions of their songs to use during their renditions.\n\nSharp Corporation produced a karaoke party system, HK-Z20, with double cassette decks, one for synchronizing/recording and one for continuous playback. This model became a popular device and had been exported to other countries.\n\nOne long-running popular device from the 1990s has been the MagicSing, a plug and play microphone that houses about 2000+ songs and with extendable song chips in it and connected directly to a TV unit. This device also provides singing scores, and later models (some now known as WOW MagicSing) have a recording feature.\n\nKaraoke in the Philippines is also known for the [[My Way killings]], a number of fatal disputes which arose due to the singing of the song \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\", popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]], in karaoke or \"videoke\" bars. A ''[[The New York Times]]'' article estimated the number of killings to be about six up to 2010.<ref name=noss/> Another source estimated at least 12 between 2002 and 2012.<ref name=ibtimes>Palash, Ghosh, [http://www.ibtimes.com/karaoke-killings-bizarre-phenomenon-east-asia-781429 \"Karaoke Killings: A Bizarre Phenomenon In East Asia\"], 10 September 2012, ''International Business Times''. Retrieved 5 March 2015</ref> Opinions differ over whether the possible connection is due to the coincidence that the song was simply frequently sung amid the nation's karaoke bars where violence is common or to the aggressive lyrics of the song itself.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe current{{when|date=January 2018}} best-selling karaoke in the Philippines is The Grand Videoke, released in 2013 and produced and manufactured by the same company who handles Wow Fiesta.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Other karaoke brands are currently available, such as Platinum Karaoke, Megapro Plus, HDT (Hyundai Digital Technology), TJ Media, Megavision, Karavision, & among others.\n\n=== Australia ===\n\nIn Australia, karaoke was gradually popularized in the late 1980s. A number of Filipino migrants brought with them their own 'minus-one' music from cassette music tapes and video tapes purchased mainly in the Philippines. A number of Philippine-imported karaoke units with two cassette drives were used in private households. Video TV tapes, mainly consisted of popular and contemporary songs rendered by Filipino artists, and with a mix of English and Tagalog songs were soon used. Projected lyrics on TV screens became very common as the main source of karaoke renditions. These tapes were soon replaced by CD+Gs, but a plug-n-play karaoke microphone that housed a factory built-in songchip loaded with hundreds of karaoke songs quickly became a favourite. This unit would usually be purchased in the Philippines and brought into Australia, becoming a common household item and is popularly used during gatherings.\n\nCommercially, karaoke was first introduced into Australia in 1989 by Robin Hemmings who had seen karaoke operating in Fiji. Prior to this, karaoke was generally unknown to the broader population. Hemmings, of Adelaide, South Australia, offered systems manufactured by Pioneer which used 12in (30&nbsp;cm) double-sided laser discs containing a maximum of 24 songs with accompanying video track and subtitled lyrics.\n\nDespite some initial resistance, Adelaide hoteliers The Booze Brothers offered limited access to their hotels and the karaoke phenomenon was born. Hemmings business, Karaoke Hire Systems, operated seven machines on a casual rental basis to numerous hotels, clubs and private parties in and around Adelaide with an additional machine on snow-season lease at Jindabyne, NSW. Each system came complete with up to 24 discs containing a maximum of 576 music video tracks. In Adelaide, karaoke reached its zenith in 1991 with virtually every hotel offering at least one karaoke night per week with many having undertaken alterations to their premises with the addition of purpose built stages and sound systems. Karaoke rental suppliers had proliferated during this period and Hemmings is known to have sold his business in late 1991 as a going concern.\n\nKaraoke's popularity in Adelaide waned from mid 1992 and was virtually extinguished by early 1993. Despite periodic attempts by hoteliers and clubs to revitalise karaoke, it has never managed to re-establish its former popularity.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, a number of karaoke bars sprouted in Sydney with karaoke boxes frequented by Japanese students and tourists and a few locals, especially on Thursday nights and weekends. A number of clubs such as RSL, League Clubs and restaurants and bars mainly feature karaoke nights to entice more customers and to entertain guests. Sunfly Karaoke is probably the major karaoke brand in Australia as well as the UK.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n=== Production methods ===\n[[File:Kumyoung vivaus feeltong.jpg|right|200px|thumb|<br />[[Karaoke box|Computer Music Player]] by [[Keumyoung Group|Kumyoung]] in South Korea]]\n\nKaraoke is very popular in Asian countries, and many artists distribute a karaoke track at the same time the song is released. The most common form of karaoke nowadays{{when|date=January 2018}} is released in [[MIDI]] format with on-screen lyrics on a DVD background video.\n\nIn Europe and North America, karaoke tracks are almost never done by the original artist, but are re-recorded by other musicians.\n\nSouth Korean firms T.J. Media and [[Keumyoung Group|Kumyoung]] produce digital music content in MIDI format and manufacture [[MIDI|computer music players]] for the Asian market.\n\n=== Contests ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nSince the rise of karaoke around the world, karaoke contests have become a phenomenon of mainstream culture, giving non-professional singers opportunity to showcase their talent, win prizes, and at times, travel the world. Contest participants are usually rated 50% by customer votes and 50% by judges' votes, but this may vary, depending on the venue and the level of competition.\n\n[[Karaoke World Championships|Karaoke World Championship]] is one of the most popular karaoke contests and has been around since 2003. In September 2011, Karaoke World Championships took place in Killarney, Ireland.\n\n=== World records ===\n\nAs of 2009, the world record for the most people singing karaoke was at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]] in the United States.

In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, stored audible materials began to dominate the music recording industry and revolutionized the portability and ease of use of band and instrumental music by musicians and entertainers as the demand for entertainers increased globally. This may have been attributable to the [[Compact Cassette#Introduction of music cassettes|introduction of music cassette tapes]], technology that arose from the need to customize music recordings and the desire for a \"handy\" format that would allow fast and convenient duplication of music and thereby meet the requirements of the entertainers' lifestyles and the 'footloose' character of the entertainment industry.\n\n=== 1970s: Development of the karaoke machine ===\n\nThe karaoke-styled machine was developed in various places in Japan.

Inoue, a drummer, was frequently asked by guests in the [[Utagoe coffeehouse|Utagoe Kissa]] where he performed to provide recordings of his performances so that they could sing along. Realizing the potential for the market, he made a tape recorder-like machine that played songs for a 100-yen coin each.\n\nInstead of giving his karaoke machines away, Inoue leased them out so that stores did not have to buy new songs on their own. Originally, it was considered a somewhat expensive [[Fads and trends|fad]], as it lacked the live atmosphere of a real performance and 100 yen in the 1970s was the price of two typical lunches, but it caught on as a popular kind of entertainment. Karaoke machines were initially placed in restaurants and hotel rooms; soon, new businesses called [[karaoke box]]es, with compartmented rooms, became popular. In 2004, Daisuke Inoue was awarded the [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[Ig Nobel]] Peace Prize for inventing karaoke, \"thereby providing an entirely new way for people to learn to tolerate each other.\"<ref name=\"ignobel 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2004|title=The 2004 Ig Nobel Prize Winners|work=Winners of the Ig Nobel Prize|publisher=[[Improbable Research]]|accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe patent holder of the karaoke machine is [[Roberto del Rosario]].

In-home karaoke machines soon followed but lacked success in the American and Canadian markets. When creators became aware of this problem, karaoke machines were no longer being sold strictly for the purpose of karaoke but as [[home cinema|home theater]] systems to enhance television watching to \"movie theater like quality\". Home theater systems took off, and karaoke went from being the main purpose of the stereo system to a side feature.\n\nAs more music became available for karaoke machines, more people within the industry saw karaoke as a profitable form of [[Bar (counter)|lounge]] and [[nightclub]] entertainment.

Lyrics are often displayed on multiple television screens around the bar.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[File:KaraokeMachine.JPG|thumb|right|Early karaoke machine]]\nA basic karaoke machine consists of a music player, [[microphone]] inputs, a means of altering the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the played music, and an audio output. Some low-end machines attempt to provide vocal suppression so that one can feed regular songs into the machine and remove the voice of the original singer; however, this is rarely effective. Most common machines are [[CD+G]], [[Laser Disc]], [[VCD]] or DVD players with microphone inputs and an audio mixer built in.<ref name=\"cloud\">{{cite web | url=http://karaokecloud.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/the-history-of-karaoke-in-america/ | title=The History of Karaoke in America | publisher=Karaoke Cloud | accessdate=15 January 2014| date=12 April 2013 }}</ref> CD+G players use a special track called [[subcode]] to encode the lyrics and pictures displayed on the screen while other formats natively display both audio and video.\n\nMost karaoke machines have technology<ref name=clickblue>Clickblue [http://clickblue.in/persang-entertainment-pvtltd/http-googl-zyp7hp \"Best technology Karaoke systems from a renowned karaoke manufacturing company\"], 30 November 2014, ''International Business Times''. Retrieved 30 November 2014</ref> that electronically changes the pitch of the music so that amateur singers can choose a key that is appropriate for their vocal range, while maintaining the original tempo of the song. (Old systems which used cassettes changed the pitch by altering playback speed, but none are still on the market, and their commercial use is virtually nonexistent.)\n\nA popular game using karaoke is to type in a random number and call up a song, which participants attempt to sing. In some machines, this game is pre-programmed and may be limited to a genre so that they cannot call up an obscure national anthem that none of the participants can sing. This game has come to be called \"Kamikaze Karaoke\" or \"Karaoke [[Roulette]]\" in some parts of the United States and Canada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nMany low-end entertainment systems have a karaoke mode that attempts to remove the vocal track from regular audio CDs, using an [[Out Of Phase Stereo (OOPS)]] technique. This is done by center channel extraction, which exploits the fact that in most stereo recordings the vocals are in the center. This means that the voice, as part of the music, has equal volume on both stereo channels and no phase difference. To get the quasi-karaoke ([[monoaural|mono]]) track, the left channel of the original audio is subtracted from the right channel. The Sega Saturn also has a \"mute vocals\" feature that is based on the same principle and is also able to adjust the pitch of the song to match the singer's vocal range.\n\n[[File:Karaoke Booth.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A row of 3 karaoke booths at a shopping center in [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles City]], [[Philippines]]]]\nThis crude approach results in the often-poor performance of voice removal. Common effects are hearing the [[reverberation]] effects on the voice track (due to stereo reverb on the vocals not being in the center); also, other instruments (snare/bass drum, bass guitar and solo instruments) that happen to be mixed into the center get removed, degrading this approach to hardly more than a gimmick in those devices. Recent years have seen the development of new techniques based on the [[Fast Fourier Transform]]. Although still not perfect, the results are usually much better than the old technique, because the stereo left-right comparison can be done on individual frequencies.\n\n=== Early age ===\n\nEarly karaoke machines used [[8-track tape|8-track cartridges]] (The Singing Machine) and [[cassette tape]]s, with printed lyric sheets, but technological advances replaced this with CDs, [[video CD|VCD]]s, [[laserdisc]]s and, currently, DVDs. In the late 1980s and 1990s, [[Pioneer Electronics]] dominated the international karaoke music video market, producing high quality karaoke music videos (inspired by the music videos such as those on [[MTV]]). {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1992, [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] introduced the [https://webcomicms.net/clipart-9412363-karaoke-machine-cliparts X2000], which fetched music via a dial-up telephone network. Its repertoire of music and graphics was limited, but its smaller size and the advantage of continuous updates saw it gradually replace traditional machines.

While the original ''Karaoke Revolution'' was also eventually released for the Microsoft [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console in late 2004, the new online-enabled version included the ability to download additional song packs through the console's exclusive [[Xbox Live]] service.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nA similar series, ''[[SingStar]]'', published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, is particularly popular in the European and Australasian markets. Other [[music video game]] titles that involve singing by the player include ''[[Boogie (video game)|Boogie]]'' and its sequel ''[[Boogie Superstar]]'', ''[[Disney Sing It]]'', ''[[Get On Da Mic]]'', the ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' series starting with ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'', ''[[High School Musical: Sing It!]]'', ''[[Lips (video game)|Lips]]'', the ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' series, ''[https://www.smule.com/songs SingSong]'', ''[[UltraStar]]'', and ''[[Xbox Music Mixer]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xbox.com/en-in/search/learn|title=https://www.xbox.com/en-in/search/learn|website=www.xbox.com|language=en-in|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\nAn Xbox Live App with the same name created by iNiS and powered by The Karaoke Channel/Stingray Karaoke was released in 12 December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft's upcoming XBOX 360 Karaoke App will charge you by the hour|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-19-microsofts-upcoming-xbox-360-karaoke-app-will-charge-you-by-the-hour|work=EuroGamer|access-date=19 November 2012|date=19 November 2012}}</ref> The app uses [[Unreal Engine 3]].\n\n=== VCDs ===\n\nMany VCD players in Southeast Asia have a built-in karaoke function. On stereo recordings, one speaker will play the music with the vocal track, and the other speaker will play the music without the vocal track. So, to sing karaoke, users play the music-only track through both speakers. In the past, there were only pop-song karaoke VCDs. Nowadays, different types of karaoke VCDs are available. [[Cantonese opera]] karaoke VCD is now a big hit among the elderly in Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== On mobile phones ===\n\nIn 2003, several companies started offering a karaoke service on mobile phones, using a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[MIDlet]] that runs with a text file containing the words and a MIDI file with the music. More usual is to contain the lyrics within the same MIDI file. Often the file extension is then changed from .mid to .kar, both are compatible with the standard for MIDI files.\n\nResearchers have also developed karaoke games for cell phones to boost music database training. In 2006, the Interactive Audio Lab at Northwestern University released a game called Karaoke Callout for the Nokia Series 60 phone. The project has since then expanded into a web-based game and will be released soon as an iPhone application.\n\nKaraoke is now available for the Android, iPhone and other playback devices at many internet storefronts.\n\n=== On computers and the Internet ===\n\nSince 2003, much software has been released for hosting karaoke shows and playing karaoke songs on a personal computer. Instead of having to carry around hundreds of CD-Gs or laserdiscs, KJs{{who|date=January 2018}} can \"[[ripping|rip]]\" their entire libraries onto their hard drives and play the songs and lyrics from the computer.\n\nAdditionally, new software permits singers to sing and listen to one another over the Internet.\n\nKaraoke devices in the 2000s saw a shift towards the use of hard drives to store large collections of karaoke tracks and touch screen devices that allows users to select their songs. This trend was driven by the decline cost of hard drive storage<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2017/12/20/digital-storage-projections-for-2018-part-1/|title=Digital Storage Projections For 2018, Part 1|last=Coughlin|first=Tom|work=Forbes|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref> and improvement in [[touchscreen]] technology in the consumer space.\n\nIn 2010, a new concept of home karaoke system through the use of live streaming from a cloud server emerged. The earliest cloud based streaming device, KaraOK!, was released by [[StarHub]] on 14 January 2010,<ref>{{Cite|url=http://www.starhub.com/about-us/newsroom/2010/january/14012010_singyourheartsoutwithstarhub.html|title=Sing Your Hearts Out With StarHub|work=StarHub|access-date=16 October 2018}}</ref> licensing songs from RIMMS.<ref>{{Cite|url=http://www.rimss.com.sg/starhub-karaok/|title=24/7 SINGALONG FUN FOR THE FAMILY|work=RIMMSS|access-date=16 October 2018}}</ref> The use of cloud streaming allows for smaller devices with over the air updates compared to costly and bulky hard drive-based systems.\n\nIn August 2017, [[ROXI]] home music system launched in the UK, and later that year in the US, providing on-demand music streaming and a karaoke singalong feature called Sing with the Stars. ROXI matches songs in its cloud based licensed music streaming catalogue to a lyrics database to provide real time scrolling on-screen lyrics. The music system also uses a hand-held [[Wii]] style point and click controller with built-in microphone allowing users to select and sing along to thousands of songs from its catalogue.<ref>Landridge, Max.

Europe's first commercial \"karaokecab\" which was a London TX4 taxi with a karaoke machine inside for occupants of the cab to use to sing whilst in the cab. The idea and installation were made by Richard Harfield of karaokeshop.com and was featured on Channel 4's Big Breakfast and several German TV stations featured the karaokecab. Granada TV also featured the cab, which is now in its 4th vehicle and operates in [[Bolton]], Greater Manchester as Clint's Karaoke Cab. Karaoke is often also found as a feature in [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] in-car DVD players.\n\nIn 2010, karaoke taxis were available in London, England in the 'Kabeoke' fleet of private hire vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starnow.co.uk/listing/177086|title=Photoshoot for The Kabeoke \u2013 Karaoke Taxi- London}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative playback devices ===\n\nThe [[CD+G]] format of a karaoke disc, which contains the lyrics on a specially encoded subcode track, has heretofore required special\u2014and expensive\u2014equipment to play. Commercial players have come down in price, though, and some unexpected devices (including the [[Sega Saturn]] [[video game console]] and [[XBMC Media Center]] on the first Xbox) can decode the graphics; in fact, karaoke machines, including video and sometimes recording capability, are often popular electronics items for sale in toy stores and electronics stores.\n\nAdditionally, there is software for Windows, Pocket PC, Linux, and Macintosh PCs that can decode and display karaoke song tracks, though usually these must be ripped from the CD first, and possibly compressed.\n\nIn addition to CD+G and software-based karaoke, microphone-based karaoke players enjoy popularity mainly in North America and some Asian countries such as the Philippines. Microphone-based karaoke players only need to be connected to a TV\u2014and in some cases to a power outlet; in other cases they run on batteries. These devices often support advanced features, such as pitch correction and special sound effects. Some companies offer karaoke content for paid download to extend the song library in microphone-based karaoke systems.\n\nCD+G, DVD, VCD and microphone-based players are most popular for home use. Due to song selection and quality of recordings, CD+G is the most popular format for English and Spanish. It is also important to note that CD+G has limited graphical capabilities, whereas VCD and DVD usually have a moving picture or video background. VCD and DVD are the most common format for Asian singers due to music availability and largely due to the moving picture/video background.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n== Terms ==\n\n;J\u016bhachiban\n: ([[wiktionary:\u5341\u516b\u756a|\u5341\u516b\u756a]]. also ''ohako'').

A karaoke box is a small or medium-sized room containing karaoke equipment rented by the hour or half-hour, providing a more intimate atmosphere. Karaoke venues of this type are often dedicated businesses, some with multiple floors and a variety of amenities including food service, but hotels and business facilities sometimes provide karaoke boxes as well. In [[South Korea]], karaoke boxes are called ''norebangs''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.exploringkorea.com/karaoke-in-korea/|title=Karaoke in Korea \u2013 Exploring Korea|date=11 July 2011|newspaper=Exploring Korea|access-date=22 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119184544/http://www.exploringkorea.com/karaoke-in-korea/|archivedate=19 November 2016}}</ref> In Taiwan and China, a karaoke establishment is called a KTV.\n\nIn some [[dim sum|traditional Chinese restaurants]], there are so-called \"mahjong-karaoke rooms\" where the elderly play [[mahjong]] while teenagers sing karaoke. The result is fewer complaints about boredom, but more noise. [[Noise regulation]]s can be an issue, especially when karaoke is brought into residential areas.\n\nViolent reactions to karaoke singing have made headlines in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, with reports of killings by listeners disturbed by the singing. In the Philippines, at least half a dozen killings of people singing \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\" caused newspapers there to label the phenomenon \"[[My Way killings]]\"; some bars refuse to allow the song, and some singers refrain from vocalizing it among strangers.<ref name=noss>Onishi, Norimitsu, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/world/asia/07karaoke.html?hpw=&pagewanted=print \"Sinatra Song Often Strikes Deadly Chord\"], 7 February 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Most of these establishments allow patrons to sing for free, with the expectation that sufficient revenue will be made selling food and drink to the singers. Less commonly, the patron wishing to sing must pay a small fee for each song they sing. Both are financially beneficial for the establishment by not having to pay a professional singer or a cabaret tax which is usually applied to any entertainment of more than 1 person.\n\nMany establishments offer karaoke on a weekly schedule, while some have shows every night. Such establishments commonly invest more in both equipment and song discs, and are often extremely popular, with an hour or more wait between a singer's opportunities to take the stage (called the ''rotation'').\n\nPrivate karaoke rooms, similar to Asia's karaoke boxes, are commonplace in communities such as [[Toronto]], Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City and San Francisco. Toronto's [[Koreatown]] is one example of an area where popularity is growing to the point that private karaoke rooms require reservations on the weekends.\n\nKaraoke is very popular in [[Scotland]] with dedicated karaoke venues in most reasonably large towns. [[Aberdeen]] is home to a number of notable karaoke bars including Wagleys, The Spirit Level, Bardot's Karaoke Bar, Sing City.\n\nThroughout much of North America, live band karaoke is also popular. With [[live band karaoke]], singers sing with a live band instead of the prerecorded backing track.\n\nRock critic [[Rob Sheffield]] claims that the 1986 music video for the song \"[[Wild Wild Life]]\" by the [[Talking Heads]] was the first depiction of karaoke in American popular culture. The video features a variety of characters taking turns singing portions of the song to an audience at a bar.<ref name=\"sheffield\">{{cite book | title=Turn Around Bright Eyes: The Rituals of Love and Karaoke | publisher=HarperCollins | author=Sheffield, Rob | year=2013 | location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/turnaroundbright0000shef/page/288 288] | isbn=978-0062207623 | url=https://archive.org/details/turnaroundbright0000shef/page/288 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Room 601, Karaoke Kan, Tokyo.jpg|right|thumb|The karaoke box at Karaoke Kan (Tokyo) where Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson sang in ''Lost in Translation.'']] Karaoke made a brief appearance in Sofia Coppola's 2003 movie ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'', and it was, three years before, the primary focus of [[Bruce Paltrow]]'s 2000 film ''[[Duets (film)|Duets]],'' written by John Bynum and starring Paltrow's daughter [[Gwyneth Paltrow|Gwyneth]] and [[Huey Lewis]], \"anchor-man\" of [[Huey Lewis and the News]].\n\nAlso popular among the international performing arts community in Europe, a group of Finnish producers organized an international karaoke competition called KWC (Karaoke World Championships).

The term noraebang is a Korean compound word, blending norae ([[Hangul]]: \ub178\ub798, English: song) and bang ([[Hangul]]: \ubc29, English: room). It is the regional equivalent to the [[Karaoke box]] in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://musicaroo.com/noraebang-korean-karaoke-box/|title=Noraebang: The Korean Karaoke Box|date=13 February 2017|website=Musicaroo}}</ref>\n\nSinging is an important part of social life in Korea, where people will perform, and be persuaded to perform, an impromptu song at virtually any social occasion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Donald |date=2000 |title=Culture and Customs of Korea|url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00clar |url-access=registration }}</ref> As such, noraebangs are popular and widespread, often identifiable by bright neon signs with musical notes or microphones.<ref>[http://traveltips.usatoday.com/things-see-seoul-korea-11625.html \"Things to See & Do in Seoul, Korea\"] ''USA Today'' <!-- retrieved 7 December 2015 --></ref>\n\nOften the last stop after a night of alcohol-lined entertainment for youths and businesspeople alike,<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/off-track-planet/karaoke-seoul_b_4144228.html \"How to Karaoke Like a Boss in Seoul\"] ''HuffPost'' 29 October 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.koreanzbc.co.nz/en/-business-in-korea/doing-business-in-korea \"Doing Business in Korea\"] ''Korean New Zealand Business Council <!-- retrieved 7 December 2015 --></ref> noraebangs are also a favorite family pastime, and many are surprisingly dry venues.<ref>[http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/People/view?articleId=120631 \"Singin\u2019 in the room noraebang nights\"] ''Korea.net'' 16 July 2014</ref> People also frequent noraebangs as a form of stress relief, and some noraebangs cater to those who seek to sing alone.<ref>[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140212001033 \"Uniquely Korean \u2013 Noraebang: Singing relieves stress, smoothes relationships\"] ''The Korea Herald'', 2 December 2014</ref>\n\n=== The Philippines ===\n\nKaraoke has become a pastime activity in the Philippines especially when entertaining friends at home. The 'minus-one' music on tapes during the late 1960s with prevailing songs such as [[the Beatles]] pop songs had become favorite songs. Singing contests during town festivals would attract contestants who carry with them cassette tapes with instrumental versions of their songs to use during their renditions.\n\nSharp Corporation produced a karaoke party system, HK-Z20, with double cassette decks, one for synchronizing/recording and one for continuous playback. This model became a popular device and had been exported to other countries.\n\nOne long-running popular device from the 1990s has been the MagicSing, a plug and play microphone that houses about 2000+ songs and with extendable song chips in it and connected directly to a TV unit. This device also provides singing scores, and later models (some now known as WOW MagicSing) have a recording feature.\n\nKaraoke in the Philippines is also known for the [[My Way killings]], a number of fatal disputes which arose due to the singing of the song \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\", popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]], in karaoke or \"videoke\" bars. A ''[[The New York Times]]'' article estimated the number of killings to be about six up to 2010.<ref name=noss/> Another source estimated at least 12 between 2002 and 2012.<ref name=ibtimes>Palash, Ghosh, [http://www.ibtimes.com/karaoke-killings-bizarre-phenomenon-east-asia-781429 \"Karaoke Killings: A Bizarre Phenomenon In East Asia\"], 10 September 2012, ''International Business Times''.

A number of Filipino migrants brought with them their own 'minus-one' music from cassette music tapes and video tapes purchased mainly in the Philippines. A number of Philippine-imported karaoke units with two cassette drives were used in private households. Video TV tapes, mainly consisted of popular and contemporary songs rendered by Filipino artists, and with a mix of English and Tagalog songs were soon used. Projected lyrics on TV screens became very common as the main source of karaoke renditions. These tapes were soon replaced by CD+Gs, but a plug-n-play karaoke microphone that housed a factory built-in songchip loaded with hundreds of karaoke songs quickly became a favourite. This unit would usually be purchased in the Philippines and brought into Australia, becoming a common household item and is popularly used during gatherings.\n\nCommercially, karaoke was first introduced into Australia in 1989 by Robin Hemmings who had seen karaoke operating in Fiji. Prior to this, karaoke was generally unknown to the broader population. Hemmings, of Adelaide, South Australia, offered systems manufactured by Pioneer which used 12in (30&nbsp;cm) double-sided laser discs containing a maximum of 24 songs with accompanying video track and subtitled lyrics.\n\nDespite some initial resistance, Adelaide hoteliers The Booze Brothers offered limited access to their hotels and the karaoke phenomenon was born. Hemmings business, Karaoke Hire Systems, operated seven machines on a casual rental basis to numerous hotels, clubs and private parties in and around Adelaide with an additional machine on snow-season lease at Jindabyne, NSW. Each system came complete with up to 24 discs containing a maximum of 576 music video tracks. In Adelaide, karaoke reached its zenith in 1991 with virtually every hotel offering at least one karaoke night per week with many having undertaken alterations to their premises with the addition of purpose built stages and sound systems. Karaoke rental suppliers had proliferated during this period and Hemmings is known to have sold his business in late 1991 as a going concern.\n\nKaraoke's popularity in Adelaide waned from mid 1992 and was virtually extinguished by early 1993. Despite periodic attempts by hoteliers and clubs to revitalise karaoke, it has never managed to re-establish its former popularity.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, a number of karaoke bars sprouted in Sydney with karaoke boxes frequented by Japanese students and tourists and a few locals, especially on Thursday nights and weekends. A number of clubs such as RSL, League Clubs and restaurants and bars mainly feature karaoke nights to entice more customers and to entertain guests. Sunfly Karaoke is probably the major karaoke brand in Australia as well as the UK.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n=== Production methods ===\n[[File:Kumyoung vivaus feeltong.jpg|right|200px|thumb|<br />[[Karaoke box|Computer Music Player]] by [[Keumyoung Group|Kumyoung]] in South Korea]]\n\nKaraoke is very popular in Asian countries, and many artists distribute a karaoke track at the same time the song is released. The most common form of karaoke nowadays{{when|date=January 2018}} is released in [[MIDI]] format with on-screen lyrics on a DVD background video.\n\nIn Europe and North America, karaoke tracks are almost never done by the original artist, but are re-recorded by other musicians.\n\nSouth Korean firms T.J. Media and [[Keumyoung Group|Kumyoung]] produce digital music content in MIDI format and manufacture [[MIDI|computer music players]] for the Asian market.\n\n=== Contests ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nSince the rise of karaoke around the world, karaoke contests have become a phenomenon of mainstream culture, giving non-professional singers opportunity to showcase their talent, win prizes, and at times, travel the world. Contest participants are usually rated 50% by customer votes and 50% by judges' votes, but this may vary, depending on the venue and the level of competition.\n\n[[Karaoke World Championships|Karaoke World Championship]] is one of the most popular karaoke contests and has been around since 2003. In September 2011, Karaoke World Championships took place in Killarney, Ireland.\n\n=== World records ===\n\nAs of 2009, the world record for the most people singing karaoke was at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]] in the United States.

The Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen dynasty ===\n[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Hohenstaufen-ruled Holy Roman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2Zsef |date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAlbert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.\n\nInstead, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The rise of the [[Free imperial city|cities]] and the emergence of the new [[Burgher (title)|burgher]] class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.<ref name=\"Rothstein1995\">{{cite book|author=Stanley William Rothstein|title=Class, Culture, and Race in American Schools: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0W8-Xsg_ssC&pg=PA9|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29102-9|pages=9\u2013}}</ref> Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\nIn the 12th century the [[Hanseatic League]] established itself as a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant [[guild]]s of towns and cities in the empire and  all over northern and central Europe. It dominated marine trade in the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and along the connected navigable rivers. Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]], had only a limited degree of political autonomy. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with military means, if necessary. This culminated in [[Second Danish-Hanseatic War|a war]] with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark from 1361 to 1370. The league declined after 1450.<ref>Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229 |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=13 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>Istvan Szepesi, \"Reflecting the Nation: The Historiography of Hanseatic Institutions.\" ''Waterloo Historical Review'' 7 (2015).

This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite journal|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Deutschland im XVI.

This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\").\nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495 by Maximillian I. The Reichskammergericht and the Auclic Council were the two highest judicial instances in the Old Empire. The Imperial Chamber court's composition was determined by both the Holy Roman Emperor and the subject states of the Empire. Within this court, the Emperor appointed the chief justice, always a highborn aristocrat, several divisional chief judges, and some of the other puisne judges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|title=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|website=reichskammergericht.de|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The Aulic Council held standing over many judicial disputes of state, both in concurrence with the Imperial Chamber court and exclusively on their own. The provinces Imperial Chamber Court extended to breaches of the public peace, cases of arbitrary distraint or imprisonment, pleas which concerned the treasury, violations of the Emperor's decrees or the laws passed by the Imperial Diet, disputes about property between [[Imperial Estate|immediate tenants of the Empire]] or the subjects of different rulers, and finally suits against immediate tenants of the Empire, with the exception of criminal charges and matters relating to imperial fiefs, which went to the [[Aulic Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-194658|title=Chisholm, Hugh, (22 Feb. 1866\u201329 Sept. 1924), Editor of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (10th, 11th and 12th editions)|website=WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u194658|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\nThroughout the first half of its history the Holy Roman Empire was reigned by a [[Itinerant court|travelling court]]. Kings and emperors toured between the numerous [[Kaiserpfalz]]es (Imperial palaces), usually resided for several weeks or months and furnished local legal matters, law and administration. Most rulers maintained one or a number of favourites Imperial palace sites, where they would advance development and spent most of their time: Charlemagne ([[Aachen]] from 794), Frederick II ([[Palermo]] 1220\u20131254), Wittelsbacher ([[Munich]] 1328\u20131347 and 1744\u20131745), Habsburger ([[Prague]] 1355\u20131437 and 1576\u20131611) and ([[Vienna]] 1438\u20131576, 1611\u20131740 and 1745\u20131806.<ref name=\"cantor\"/><ref name=\"BibliothekEhlers2016\">{{cite book|author=Caspar Ehlers, Helmut Flachenecker, Bernd P\u00e4ffgen, Rudolf Schieffer|title=Die deutschen K\u00f6nigspfalzen.

Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follows:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;\n* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;\n* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.</ref>\n\nA credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follows:<ref>Whaley, vol. II, p. 351.</ref>\n\n* 9 million Austrian subjects (including Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia);\n* 4 million Prussian subjects;\n* 14\u201315 million inhabitants for the rest of the Empire.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\nLargest cities or towns of the Empire by year:\n* '''1050''': [[Regensburg]] 40,000 people.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a \"normal year\". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion. For the first time, the permanent nature of the division between the Christian Churches of the empire was more or less assumed.<ref>Whaley (2012), vol. I, p. 624\u2013625.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a [[History of the Jews in Germany#In the Holy Roman Empire|Jewish minority]] existed in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Holy Roman Empire}}\n* [[List of German monarchs]]\n* [[Carolingian Empire]]\n* [[Family tree of the German monarchs]]\n* [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*[[Eamon Duffy|Duffy, Eamon]]. 1997.

The Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen dynasty ===\n[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Hohenstaufen-ruled Holy Roman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2Zsef |date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAlbert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.\n\nInstead, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The rise of the [[Free imperial city|cities]] and the emergence of the new [[Burgher (title)|burgher]] class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.<ref name=\"Rothstein1995\">{{cite book|author=Stanley William Rothstein|title=Class, Culture, and Race in American Schools: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0W8-Xsg_ssC&pg=PA9|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29102-9|pages=9\u2013}}</ref> Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\nIn the 12th century the [[Hanseatic League]] established itself as a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant [[guild]]s of towns and cities in the empire and  all over northern and central Europe. It dominated marine trade in the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and along the connected navigable rivers. Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]], had only a limited degree of political autonomy. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with military means, if necessary. This culminated in [[Second Danish-Hanseatic War|a war]] with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark from 1361 to 1370. The league declined after 1450.<ref>Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229 |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=13 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>Istvan Szepesi, \"Reflecting the Nation: The Historiography of Hanseatic Institutions.\" ''Waterloo Historical Review'' 7 (2015).

This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite journal|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Deutschland im XVI.

This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\").\nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495 by Maximillian I. The Reichskammergericht and the Auclic Council were the two highest judicial instances in the Old Empire. The Imperial Chamber court's composition was determined by both the Holy Roman Emperor and the subject states of the Empire. Within this court, the Emperor appointed the chief justice, always a highborn aristocrat, several divisional chief judges, and some of the other puisne judges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|title=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|website=www.reichskammergericht.de|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The Aulic Council held standing over many judicial disputes of state, both in concurrence with the Imperial Chamber court and exclusively on their own. The provinces Imperial Chamber Court extended to breaches of the public peace, cases of arbitrary distraint or imprisonment, pleas which concerned the treasury, violations of the Emperor's decrees or the laws passed by the Imperial Diet, disputes about property between [[Imperial Estate|immediate tenants of the Empire]] or the subjects of different rulers, and finally suits against immediate tenants of the Empire, with the exception of criminal charges and matters relating to imperial fiefs, which went to the [[Aulic Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-194658|title=Chisholm, Hugh, (22 Feb. 1866\u201329 Sept. 1924), Editor of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (10th, 11th and 12th editions)|website=WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u194658|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\nThroughout the first half of its history the Holy Roman Empire was reigned by a [[Itinerant court|travelling court]]. Kings and emperors toured between the numerous [[Kaiserpfalz]]es (Imperial palaces), usually resided for several weeks or months and furnished local legal matters, law and administration. Most rulers maintained one or a number of favourites Imperial palace sites, where they would advance development and spent most of their time: Charlemagne ([[Aachen]] from 794), Frederick II ([[Palermo]] 1220\u20131254), Wittelsbacher ([[Munich]] 1328\u20131347 and 1744\u20131745), Habsburger ([[Prague]] 1355\u20131437 and 1576\u20131611) and ([[Vienna]] 1438\u20131576, 1611\u20131740 and 1745\u20131806.<ref name=\"cantor\"/><ref name=\"BibliothekEhlers2016\">{{cite book|author=Caspar Ehlers, Helmut Flachenecker, Bernd P\u00e4ffgen, Rudolf Schieffer|title=Die deutschen K\u00f6nigspfalzen.

Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follows:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;\n* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;\n* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.</ref>\n\nA credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follows:<ref>Whaley, vol.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a \"normal year\". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion. For the first time, the permanent nature of the division between the Christian Churches of the empire was more or less assumed.<ref>Whaley (2012), vol. I, p. 624\u2013625.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a [[History of the Jews in Germany#In the Holy Roman Empire|Jewish minority]] existed in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Holy Roman Empire}}\n* [[List of German monarchs]]\n* [[Carolingian Empire]]\n* [[Family tree of the German monarchs]]\n* [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*[[Eamon Duffy|Duffy, Eamon]]. 1997.

In high favour during the [[Tudor period]], the Royal English Standard was a flag that was of a separate design and purpose to the [[Royal Banner of England|Royal Banner]]. It featured [[St George's Cross]] at its head, followed by a number of heraldic [[Heraldic badge|device]]s, a supporter, [[badge]]s or [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s, with a [[motto]]\u2014but it did not bear a [[coat of arms]]. The Royal Standard changed its composition frequently from reign to reign, but retained the motto ''[[Dieu et mon droit]]'', meaning God and my right; which was divided into two bands: ''Dieu et mon'' and ''Droyt''.<ref>Boutell's Heraldry: Frederic Warne & Co Ltd. 1973. (p252). {{ISBN|0-7232-1708-4}}.</ref>\n\nThe standard was equivalent to the modern headquarters flag and played a significant role in the medieval army. Beneath it was pitched the tent of the leader; behind it his retainers would follow; around it they would gather after a charge to regroup; under it they would make their last stand in battle. During the Tudor period the standing army came into being and the standard ceased to be use as an instrument of war.

Richard III. act v, sc.3.</small>}}</center>\n\nThe [[medieval]] standard was usually about eight feet long, but [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[herald]]s determined different lengths, according to the rank of the nobility. \"The Great Standard to be sette before the Kinges pavilion or tent \u2013 not to be borne in battle\" \u2013 was 33-foot long. A duke's standard was 21-foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12-foot long. These standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed.<ref>Stephen Friar: ''Heraldry'' (1992), p.225. {{ISBN|0-7509-1085-2}}.</ref> The [[St George's Cross|St. George]] in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national identity. This badge or banner of England, at the head of the standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the standard.<ref>Charles Hassler: ''The Royal Arms'' (1980), p.31. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nThere were three main types of heraldic flag.<ref>Boutell's Heraldry (1973) {{ISBN|0723217084}}.</ref>\n* A '''pennon''' was small, pointed or swallow-tailed at the fly, charged with the badge or other armorial device of the knight who bore it.\n* A '''banner''' was square or oblong (depth greater than breadth), charged with the arms of the owner with no other device, borne by [[knight banneret]]s, ranking higher than other knights, and also by barons, princes and the sovereign.\n* A '''standard''' was a narrow and tapering (sometimes swallow-tailed) flag, of considerable length (depending on the rank of the owner), generally used only for pageantry, and particularly to display the supporter, badges and livery colours. Mottoes were often introduced bendwise across these standards.\n\n===Badges===\n[[File:White Hart Badge of Richard II.svg|150px|thumb|right|The [[White Hart|white hart]] badge of King [[Richard II]].]]\n{{Main|Royal Badges of England}}\n<center>{{cquote|''Might I but know thee by thy Household Badge''.....{{pad|1em}}<small>Shakespeare. 2 Henry VI, V. i</small>}}</center>\n[[Heraldic badge|Badges]] may possibly have preceded [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s. The Norman kings and their sons may have originally used lions as badges of kingship. The lion was a Royal Badge long before heraldic records, as [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] gave a shield of golden lions to his son-in-law [[Geoffrey of Anjou]] in 1127.\n\nThe seals of [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] included many devices regarded as badges. [[Stephen of England|Stephen I]] used a ''sagittary'' (centaur) as a badge. Badges were widely used and borne by the first five [[Plantagenet]]s, notably the ''planta genista'' (broom plant) from which their name derived; a star and crescent interpreted by some as a sun and moon; the ''genet'' of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]; the rose and thistle of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the white hart of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]]. The [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were the last to bear personal badges, ceasing with [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the [[Royal Badges of England|royal badges]] afterward became more akin to national emblems, evolving into our modern versions.<ref>Charles Hasler: ''The Royal Arms'', pp.3\u201311. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nAll sorts of devices were used on standards, generally a beast badge, a plant badge or instead of the latter a simple object (such as a knot). Sometimes the crest was used, but invariably the largest and most dominant object on a standard was one of the supporters. The whole banner was usually fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of the ''[[bordure]] [[compony]]''.  Except in funerals, these standards were not used after the [[Tudor period]], probably because of the creation of a [[standing army]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|A.C. Fox-Davies]]: ''[[The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Armory|The Art of Heraldry]]'' (1904/1986). {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|250px|thumb|right|Coat of arms of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], depicting both the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] and the [[White Greyhound of Richmond|white greyhound]] as supporters.]]\n{{main|Royal Supporters of England}}\n\n[[Supporters]] are figures of living creatures each side of an armorial shield, appearing to support it. The origin of supporters can be traced to their usages in tournaments, on Standards, and where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection. Medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. The Royal Supporters of the monarchs of England are a menagerie of real and imaginary beasts, including the lion, leopard, panther, and tiger, the antelope, greyhound, a cock and bull, eagle, red and gold dragons, and since 1603 the current unicorn.<ref>A.C. Fox-Davies: ''The Art of Heraldry'' (1904/1986), chapter XXX, p.300. {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Livery colours===\nThe term [[livery]] is derived from the French ''livr\u00e9e'' from the [[Latin]] ''liberare'', meaning to liberate or bestow, originally implying the dispensing of food, provisions and clothing &c to retainers. In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was then applied to the uniforms and other devices, worn by those who accepted the privileges and obligations of ''embracery'', or livery and maintenance.<ref>Friar. p.216.</ref> The royal liveries of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]s were white and red; those of the [[House of Lancaster]] were white and blue, the colours of the [[House of York]] were murrey (dark red) and blue. The liveries of the [[House of Tudor]] were white and green; those of the [[House of Stuart]] \u2013 and of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] \u2013 were yellow and red. In all subsequent reigns, they have been scarlet and blue.\n\n===Motto===\n{{Main|Dieu et mon droit}}\n'''Dieu et mon droit''' (originally ''Dieu et mon droyt''; French: 'God and my right'), as seen on Royal standards since [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], is said to have first been adopted as the royal motto by [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] in the 15th century, and consistently so used by most later English (and British) kings, with few exceptions.

King [[Philip II of France]].]]\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\nThe '''royal standards of England''' were narrow, tapering swallow-tailed [[heraldic flag]]s, of considerable length, used mainly for mustering troops in battle, in [[procession|pageant]]s and at funerals, by the [[List of English monarchs|monarchs of England]]. In high favour during the [[Tudor period]], the Royal English Standard was a flag that was of a separate design and purpose to the [[Royal Banner of England|Royal Banner]]. It featured [[St George's Cross]] at its head, followed by a number of heraldic [[Heraldic badge|device]]s, a supporter, [[badge]]s or [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s, with a [[motto]]\u2014but it did not bear a [[coat of arms]]. The Royal Standard changed its composition frequently from reign to reign, but retained the motto ''[[Dieu et mon droit]]'', meaning God and my right; which was divided into two bands: ''Dieu et mon'' and ''Droyt''.<ref>Boutell's Heraldry: Frederic Warne & Co Ltd. 1973. (p252). {{ISBN|0-7232-1708-4}}.</ref>\n\nThe standard was equivalent to the modern headquarters flag and played a significant role in the medieval army. Beneath it was pitched the tent of the leader; behind it his retainers would follow; around it they would gather after a charge to regroup; under it they would make their last stand in battle. During the Tudor period the standing army came into being and the standard ceased to be use as an instrument of war. Only to be borne by those to were entitled to fly them.<ref name=\"encyclopaedia\">{{Cite book |title=An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Heraldry |last=Franklyn |first=Julian |publisher=Pergamon Press; 1st edition |year=1970 |isbn=0080132979 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaedicdic0000fran/page/313 313] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaedicdic0000fran/page/313 }}</ref>\n\n==Standards and devices==\n===Standards===\n[[File:Modlicisekrizak.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Knight's [[Pennon]]]]\n<center>{{cquote|''Advance our standards, set upon our foes Our ancient world of courage fair St. George''<br />\n''Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons''..... <small>Shakespeare. Richard III. act v, sc.3.</small>}}</center>\n\nThe [[medieval]] standard was usually about eight feet long, but [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[herald]]s determined different lengths, according to the rank of the nobility. \"The Great Standard to be sette before the Kinges pavilion or tent \u2013 not to be borne in battle\" \u2013 was 33-foot long. A duke's standard was 21-foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12-foot long. These standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed.<ref>Stephen Friar: ''Heraldry'' (1992), p.225. {{ISBN|0-7509-1085-2}}.</ref> The [[St George's Cross|St. George]] in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national identity. This badge or banner of England, at the head of the standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the standard.<ref>Charles Hassler: ''The Royal Arms'' (1980), p.31. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nThere were three main types of heraldic flag.<ref>Boutell's Heraldry (1973) {{ISBN|0723217084}}.</ref>\n* A '''pennon''' was small, pointed or swallow-tailed at the fly, charged with the badge or other armorial device of the knight who bore it.\n* A '''banner''' was square or oblong (depth greater than breadth), charged with the arms of the owner with no other device, borne by [[knight banneret]]s, ranking higher than other knights, and also by barons, princes and the sovereign.\n* A '''standard''' was a narrow and tapering (sometimes swallow-tailed) flag, of considerable length (depending on the rank of the owner), generally used only for pageantry, and particularly to display the supporter, badges and livery colours. Mottoes were often introduced bendwise across these standards.\n\n===Badges===\n[[File:White Hart Badge of Richard II.svg|150px|thumb|right|The [[White Hart|white hart]] badge of King [[Richard II]].]]\n{{Main|Royal Badges of England}}\n<center>{{cquote|''Might I but know thee by thy Household Badge''.....{{pad|1em}}<small>Shakespeare. 2 Henry VI, V. i</small>}}</center>\n[[Heraldic badge|Badges]] may possibly have preceded [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s. The Norman kings and their sons may have originally used lions as badges of kingship. The lion was a Royal Badge long before heraldic records, as [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] gave a shield of golden lions to his son-in-law [[Geoffrey of Anjou]] in 1127.\n\nThe seals of [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] included many devices regarded as badges. [[Stephen of England|Stephen I]] used a ''sagittary'' (centaur) as a badge. Badges were widely used and borne by the first five [[Plantagenet]]s, notably the ''planta genista'' (broom plant) from which their name derived; a star and crescent interpreted by some as a sun and moon; the ''genet'' of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]; the rose and thistle of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the white hart of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]]. The [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were the last to bear personal badges, ceasing with [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the [[Royal Badges of England|royal badges]] afterward became more akin to national emblems, evolving into our modern versions.<ref>Charles Hasler: ''The Royal Arms'', pp.3\u201311. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nAll sorts of devices were used on standards, generally a beast badge, a plant badge or instead of the latter a simple object (such as a knot). Sometimes the crest was used, but invariably the largest and most dominant object on a standard was one of the supporters. The whole banner was usually fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of the ''[[bordure]] [[compony]]''.  Except in funerals, these standards were not used after the [[Tudor period]], probably because of the creation of a [[standing army]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|A.C. Fox-Davies]]: ''[[The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Armory|The Art of Heraldry]]'' (1904/1986). {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|250px|thumb|right|Coat of arms of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], depicting both the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] and the [[White Greyhound of Richmond|white greyhound]] as supporters.]]\n{{main|Royal Supporters of England}}\n\n[[Supporters]] are figures of living creatures each side of an armorial shield, appearing to support it. The origin of supporters can be traced to their usages in tournaments, on Standards, and where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection. Medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. The Royal Supporters of the monarchs of England are a menagerie of real and imaginary beasts, including the lion, leopard, panther, and tiger, the antelope, greyhound, a cock and bull, eagle, red and gold dragons, and since 1603 the current unicorn.<ref>A.C. Fox-Davies: ''The Art of Heraldry'' (1904/1986), chapter XXX, p.300. {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Livery colours===\nThe term [[livery]] is derived from the French ''livr\u00e9e'' from the [[Latin]] ''liberare'', meaning to liberate or bestow, originally implying the dispensing of food, provisions and clothing &c to retainers. In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was then applied to the uniforms and other devices, worn by those who accepted the privileges and obligations of ''embracery'', or livery and maintenance.<ref>Friar. p.216.</ref> The royal liveries of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]s were white and red; those of the [[House of Lancaster]] were white and blue, the colours of the [[House of York]] were murrey (dark red) and blue. The liveries of the [[House of Tudor]] were white and green; those of the [[House of Stuart]] \u2013 and of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] \u2013 were yellow and red. In all subsequent reigns, they have been scarlet and blue.\n\n===Motto===\n{{Main|Dieu et mon droit}}\n'''Dieu et mon droit''' (originally ''Dieu et mon droyt''; French: 'God and my right'), as seen on Royal standards since [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], is said to have first been adopted as the royal motto by [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] in the 15th century, and consistently so used by most later English (and British) kings, with few exceptions.

The [[Hiroshima Museum of Art]], which has a large collection of French [[renaissance]] art, opened in 1978.  The [[Hiroshima Prefectural Art Museum]] opened in 1968 and is located near [[Shukkei-en]] gardens.  The [[Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art]], which opened in 1989, is located near [[Hijiyama]] Park.  Festivals include [[Hiroshima Flower Festival]] and [[Hiroshima International Animation Festival]].\n\n[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]], which includes the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]], draws many visitors from around the world, especially for the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony]], an annual commemoration held on the date of the atomic bombing. The park also contains a large collection of monuments, including the [[Children's Peace Monument]], the [[Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims]] and many others.\n\n[[Hiroshima Castle|Hiroshima's rebuilt castle]] (nicknamed ''Rij\u014d'', meaning ''[[Koi]] Castle'') houses a [[museum]] of life in the [[Edo period]]. [[Hiroshima Gokoku Shrine]] is within the walls of the castle. Other attractions in Hiroshima include [[Shukkei-en]], Fud\u014din, [[Mitaki-dera]], and [[Hijiyama Park]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Okonomiyaki 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A man making an [[okonomiyaki]] at a restaurant in Hiroshima]]\n\nHiroshima is known for [[okonomiyaki]], a savory ([[umami]]) pancake cooked on an iron plate, usually in front of the customer. It is cooked with various ingredients, which are layered rather than mixed as done with the [[Osaka]] version of okonomiyaki. The layers are typically egg, cabbage, [[bean sprout]]s (moyashi), sliced pork/bacon with optional items (mayonnaise, fried squid, octopus, cheese, [[mochi]], [[kimchi]], etc.), and noodles ([[soba]], [[udon]]) topped with another layer of egg and a generous dollop of okonomiyaki sauce (Carp and Otafuku are two popular brands). The amount of cabbage used is usually 3 to 4 times the amount used in the Osaka style. It starts piled very high and is generally pushed down as the cabbage cooks. The order of the layers may vary slightly depending on the chef's style and preference, and ingredients will vary depending on the preference of the customer.\n\n===Sports===\nHiroshima has several professional sports clubs. The city's main [[association football]] club is [[Sanfrecce Hiroshima]], who play at the [[Hiroshima Big Arch]]. As Toyo Kogyo Soccer Club, they won the [[Japan Soccer League]] five times between 1965 and 1970 and the [[Emperor's Cup]] in [[1965 Emperor's Cup|1965]], [[1967 Emperor's Cup|1967]] and [[1969 Emperor's Cup|1969]]. After adopting their current name in 1992, the club won the [[J.League]] in [[2012 J.League Division 1|2012]] and [[2013 J.League Division 1|2013]]. The city's main women's football club is [[Angeviolet Hiroshima]]. Defunct clubs include [[Rijo Shukyu FC]], who won the Emperor's Cup in 1924 and 1925, and [[\u1ebcfini Hiroshima SC]].\n\n[[Hiroshima Toyo Carp]] are the city's major [[baseball]] club, and play at the [[Mazda Zoom-Zoom Stadium Hiroshima]]. Members of the [[Central League]], the club won the [[Japan Series]] in 1979, 1980 and 1984. Other sports clubs include [[Hiroshima Dragonflies]] ([[basketball]]), [[Hiroshima Maple Reds]] ([[handball]]) and [[JT Thunders]] ([[volleyball]]).\n\nThe [[Woodone Open Hiroshima]] was part of the [[Japan Golf Tour]] between 1973 and 2007. The city also hosted the [[1994 Asian Games]], using the Big Arch stadium, which is now used for the annual [[Mikio Oda Memorial International Amateur Athletic Game]]. The now-called [[Hiroshima Prefectural Sports Center]] was one of the host arenas of the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]] (basketball).\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n=== Health care ===\n====Hospitals====\n* Hiroshima City Hospital\n* Hiroshima City Asa Hospital\n* Hiroshima City Funairi Hospital\n* Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital\n* Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital\n* Hiroshima University Hospital\n* Japan Post Hiroshima Hospital\n* JR Hiroshima Hospital\n\n===Media===\nThe [[Chugoku Shimbun|''Ch\u016bgoku Shimbun'']] is the local newspaper serving Hiroshima.

Statistics released by the nation's tourist agency revealed that around 363,000 visitors went to the metropolis during 2012, with Americans making up the vast majority of that figure, followed by Australians and Chinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidejapantours.com/japan-news/3306/hiroshima-increasingly-popular-with-tourists/|title=Hiroshima increasingly popular with tourists {{!}} Inside Japan Tours|website=insidejapantours.com|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref> \n\n==Education==\n[[File:HiroshimaUniv SatakeMemorialHall.jpg|thumb|Satake Memorial Hall at Hiroshima University (in Higashihiroshima City)]]\n\n[[Hiroshima University]] was established in 1949, as part of a national restructuring of the education system.

But, in 1972 the relocation of Hiroshima University has decided from urban areas of Hiroshima City to wider campus in [[Higashihiroshima]] City. By 1995 almost all campuses were relocated to [[Higashihiroshima]]. But, School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Graduate School in these fields in Kasumi Campus and Law School and Center for Research on Regional Economic System in Higashi-Senda Campus are still in Hiroshima City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/category_view.php?category_child_id=2&category_id=8&template_id=14&lang=en |title=History of Hiroshima University |publisher=Hiroshima University |accessdate=2007-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629051712/http://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/category_view.php?category_child_id=2&category_id=8&template_id=14&lang=en |archivedate=2007-06-29 }}</ref>\n\nNotable art institutions include the [[Elisabeth University of Music]] and [[Actor\u2019s School Hiroshima]].\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan}}\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\nHiroshima has six overseas [[sister cities]]:<ref name=\"Hiroshima\">{{cite web|url=http://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/shimin/kokusai/shimai/top-e.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503070024/http://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/shimin/kokusai/shimai/top-e.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-05-03 |title=Introduction to our Sister and Friendship Cities |publisher=City.hiroshima.jp |accessdate=2010-05-10 }}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|US}} [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], United States (1959)\n* {{flagdeco|RUS}} [[Volgograd]], Russia (1972)<ref name=\"Volgograd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.volgadmin.ru/EN2/Municipality/FriendlyRelationship.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220234719/http://www.volgadmin.ru/EN2/Municipality/FriendlyRelationship.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-12-20 |title=Friendly relationship at Official website of Volgograd |publisher=Volgadmin.ru |date=1994-12-01 |accessdate=2011-06-13 }}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|DEU}} [[Hanover]], Germany (1983)<ref name=\"Hanover\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hannover.de/Leben-in-der-Region-Hannover/Politik/St%C3%A4dte-Regionspartnerschaften/St%C3%A4dtepartnerschaften-der-Landeshauptstadt-Hannover |title=Twinnings of the City of Hannover |publisher=Presse- und \u00d6ffentlichkeitsarbeit der Landeshauptstadt Hannover |website=Hanover.de \u2013 Offizielles Portal der Landeshauptstadt und der Region Hannover |language=German |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} [[Chongqing]], People's Republic of China (1986)\n* {{flagdeco|ROK}} [[Daegu]], South Korea (1997)\n* {{flagdeco|CAN}} [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada (1998)\n\nWithin Japan, Hiroshima has a similar relationship with [[Nagasaki]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n|title=Hiroshima and Nagasaki: The Physical, Medical, and Social Effects of the Atomic Bombings\n|last1=Ishikawa|first1=Eisei\n|first2=David L.|last2=Swain\n|publisher=Basic Books\n|year=1981}}\n* {{Cite book\n|author=Kowner, Rotem\n|authorlink=Rotem Kowner\n|year=2002\n|chapter=Hiroshima\n|editor1=M.

The [[Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art]], which opened in 1989, is located near [[Hijiyama]] Park.  Festivals include [[Hiroshima Flower Festival]] and [[Hiroshima International Animation Festival]].\n\n[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]], which includes the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]], draws many visitors from around the world, especially for the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony]], an annual commemoration held on the date of the atomic bombing. The park also contains a large collection of monuments, including the [[Children's Peace Monument]], the [[Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims]] and many others.\n\n[[Hiroshima Castle|Hiroshima's rebuilt castle]] (nicknamed ''Rij\u014d'', meaning ''[[Koi]] Castle'') houses a [[museum]] of life in the [[Edo period]].

It is cooked with various ingredients, which are layered rather than mixed as done with the [[Osaka]] version of okonomiyaki. The layers are typically egg, cabbage, [[bean sprout]]s (moyashi), sliced pork/bacon with optional items (mayonnaise, fried squid, octopus, cheese, [[mochi]], [[kimchi]], etc.), and noodles ([[soba]], [[udon]]) topped with another layer of egg and a generous dollop of okonomiyaki sauce (Carp and Otafuku are two popular brands). The amount of cabbage used is usually 3 to 4 times the amount used in the Osaka style. It starts piled very high and is generally pushed down as the cabbage cooks. The order of the layers may vary slightly depending on the chef's style and preference, and ingredients will vary depending on the preference of the customer.\n\n===Sports===\nHiroshima has several professional sports clubs. The city's main [[association football]] club is [[Sanfrecce Hiroshima]], who play at the [[Hiroshima Big Arch]]. As Toyo Kogyo Soccer Club, they won the [[Japan Soccer League]] five times between 1965 and 1970 and the [[Emperor's Cup]] in [[1965 Emperor's Cup|1965]], [[1967 Emperor's Cup|1967]] and [[1969 Emperor's Cup|1969]]. After adopting their current name in 1992, the club won the [[J.League]] in [[2012 J.League Division 1|2012]] and [[2013 J.League Division 1|2013]]. The city's main women's football club is [[Angeviolet Hiroshima]]. Defunct clubs include [[Rijo Shukyu FC]], who won the Emperor's Cup in 1924 and 1925, and [[\u1ebcfini Hiroshima SC]].\n\n[[Hiroshima Toyo Carp]] are the city's major [[baseball]] club, and play at the [[Mazda Zoom-Zoom Stadium Hiroshima]]. Members of the [[Central League]], the club won the [[Japan Series]] in 1979, 1980 and 1984. Other sports clubs include [[Hiroshima Dragonflies]] ([[basketball]]), [[Hiroshima Maple Reds]] ([[handball]]) and [[JT Thunders]] ([[volleyball]]).\n\nThe [[Woodone Open Hiroshima]] was part of the [[Japan Golf Tour]] between 1973 and 2007. The city also hosted the [[1994 Asian Games]], using the Big Arch stadium, which is now used for the annual [[Mikio Oda Memorial International Amateur Athletic Game]]. The now-called [[Hiroshima Prefectural Sports Center]] was one of the host arenas of the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]] (basketball).\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n=== Health care ===\n====Hospitals====\n* Hiroshima City Hospital\n* Hiroshima City Asa Hospital\n* Hiroshima City Funairi Hospital\n* Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital\n* Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital\n* Hiroshima University Hospital\n* Japan Post Hiroshima Hospital\n* JR Hiroshima Hospital\n\n===Media===\nThe [[Chugoku Shimbun|''Ch\u016bgoku Shimbun'']] is the local newspaper serving Hiroshima.

But, in 1972 the relocation of Hiroshima University has decided from urban areas of Hiroshima City to wider campus in [[Higashihiroshima]] City. By 1995 almost all campuses were relocated to [[Higashihiroshima]].
