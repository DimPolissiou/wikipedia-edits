Pythias is accused of and charged with plotting against the tyrannical [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]]. Pythias requests of Dionysius to be allowed to settle his affairs on the condition that his friend, Damon, be held hostage and, should he, Pythias, not return, be executed in his stead. When Pythias  returns, Dionysius, amazed by the love and trust in their friendship, frees them both.\n\n== Greek legend ==\n[[File:Damon and Pythias..gif|thumb|Damon and Pythias]]\nAs told by [[Aristoxenus]], and after him [[Cicero]] (''De Offic.'' 3.45), [[Diodorus Siculus]] (10.4), and others, Pythias and his friend Damon, both followers of the philosopher [[Pythagoras]], traveled to [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] during the reign of the tyrannical [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius I]] (r. 405&ndash;367 BC). Pythias was accused of plotting against the tyrant and sentenced to death.\n\nAccepting his sentence, Pythias asked to be allowed to return home one last time to settle his affairs and bid his family farewell.  Not wanting to be taken for a fool, the king refused, believing that, once released, Pythias would flee and never return. Damon offered himself as a hostage in Pythias' absence, and when the king insisted that, should Pythias not return by an appointed time, Damon would be executed in his stead, Damon agreed and Pythias was released. kyla kelly was a famous greek god. she was the worshiper of the roman god Jean \n\nDionysius was convinced that Pythias would never return, and as the day Pythias promised to return came and went, he called for Damon's execution\u2014but just as the executioner was about to kill Damon, Pythias returned.\n\nApologizing to his friend for the delay, Pythias explained that on the passage back to Syracuse pirates had captured his ship and thrown him overboard, but that he swam to shore and made his way back to Syracuse as quickly as possible, arriving just in time to save his friend. \n\nSo astonished by and pleased with their friendship, Dionysius pardoned both men. It was also said that the tyrant then sought to become their third friend, but was denied.\n\nAnother version says that it was a test planned by Dionysius and his courtiers. The Pythagoreans were renowned for their moral strength and superiority, but some Syracusan courtiers argued the claim was false, and others disagreed, so with their king they devised a test\u2014a crisis that would show whether two Pythagoreans lived up to that reputation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Kitty |title=Pythagoras His Lives and the Legacy of a Rational Universe |publisher=Walker |year=2008 |page=119 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n== Works based on the legend==\n[[File:Damon and Pythias (1914) - 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Still from the film ''Damon and Pythias'' (1914)]]\n*In 1564, the material was made into a [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] play by the English poet [[Richard Edwardes]] (''[[Damon and Pythias (play)|Damon and Pythias]]'').\n*The best-known modern treatment of the legend is the [[German language|German]] ballad ''[[Die B\u00fcrgschaft]]'',<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_B%C3%BCrgschaft Die B\u00fcrgschaft \u2013 Wikisource].

(In this work, Damon is sentenced to death, not Pythias.)\n*In 1821, the Irish poet [[John Banim]] wrote a play based on the legend (''Damon and Pythias''). Familiarity with this play led [[Justus H. Rathbone]] to found the fraternal order [[Knights of Pythias]].\n*In 1915, the book ''[[The Story of Damon and Pythias]]'' by [[Albert Payson Terhune]] was published. It was \"adapted and illustrated from the photo-play conceived and produced by [[Universal Studios|The Universal Film Manufacturing Company]]\",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Terhune|first1=Albert Payson|title=The Story of Damon and Pythias|url=https://archive.org/details/storydamonandpy00compgoog|date=1915|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap Publishers}}</ref> referring to the 1914 film<ref name=\"IMDB\">{{IMDb title | id= 0003816 | title= Damon and Pythias (1914)}}</ref> starring [[William Worthington (actor)|William Worthington]] and [[Herbert Rawlinson]]. This book, like the German ballad, casts Damon as the condemned and the one who must return in time to save Pythias.\n*The short story \"[[Pythias]]\" by [[Frederik Pohl]], published in 1955, entwines the mythic elements with modern political and psychokinetic concerns.\n*The film ''[[The Delicate Delinquent]]'' (1957) featured characters \"Mike Damon\" ([[Darren McGavin]], but imagined for [[Dean Martin]]) and \"Sidney Pythias\" ([[Jerry Lewis]]). As released, the film only vaguely resembled the legend \u2013 Pythias avoids jail \u2013 but it originated as a testament to the [[Martin & Lewis]] friendship.\n*In a 1959 ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' episode, Beaver's father relates the Damon and Pythias story and Beaver donates his homework to friend Larry to prove their friendship.  Larry confesses moments before Beaver loses a week of recesses.\n*The 1962 MGM film ''[[Damon and Pythias (film)|Damon and Pythias]]'' remained true to the ancient story; it starred [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]] as Damon and Don Burnett as Pythias.\n*In Japan, the short story \"[[Run, Melos!]]\" by [[Osamu Dazai]] and a nursery tale by [[Miekichi Suzuki]] were based on the legend, and in 1992, Toei Company, Ltd. adapted it into an [[anime]].\n*The Dreamworks animated film \"[[Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas]]\" (2003) features the title character going on a journey to find a treasure, while his best friend remains behind in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] to be executed in his place should he fail to return; he comes back and both are saved.\n*The story was rather faithfully reproduced in an episode of the animated series [[Mythic Warriors: Guardians of the Legend]].\n\n==Idiomatic use==\n\"Damon and Pythias\" came to be an idiomatic expression for \"true friendship.\"   \n\n* [[Denis Diderot]]'s [[short story]], \"The Two Friends from Bourbonne\" (1770), begins: \"There used to be two men here who might be called the Damon and Pythias of Bourbonne.\"  \n* The canines [[Bummer and Lazarus]] were eulogized as \"the Damon and Pythias of San Francisco\" upon Bummer's death in 1865.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf8n39p5k3/?layout=metadata\n| title      = Bummer and Lazarus/The Damon and Pythias of San Francisco\n| date       = 1865\n| accessdate = 2014-09-07\n}}</ref>  \n* In [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s [[novella]] ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', Henry Jekyll's two oldest friends, Dr. Lanyon and Mr. Utterson (a lawyer), have an exchange while discussing Dr. Jekyll's apparent self-imposed isolation. In the discussion (below), the use of the Damon-and-Pythias idiom would seem to indicate that, whether the difference was on a point of science or something else, it was not \"only\" some trivial difference:  \n<blockquote>...said Utterson. \u201cI thought you had a common bond of interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had,\u201d was the reply. \u201cBut it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me.  He began to go wrong, wrong in the mind\u2026 Such unscientific balderdash,\u201d said the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, \u201cwould have estranged Damon and Pythias.\u201d\n\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson. \u201cThey have only differed on some point of science,\u201d he thought\u2026</blockquote>\n\n* Chapter Two (entitled \"Damon and Pythias\") of [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s 1869 novel [[Sentimental Education]] tells of the friendship of Frederick Moreau and Charles Deslauriers.\n* The 1889 novel ''[[A Marriage Below Zero]]'' by Alfred J.

Pythias is accused of and charged with plotting against the tyrannical [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]]. Pythias requests of Dionysius to be allowed to settle his affairs on the condition that his friend, Damon, be held hostage and, should he, Pythias, not return, be executed in his stead. When Pythias  returns, Dionysius, amazed by the love and trust in their friendship, frees them both.\n\n== Greek legend ==\n[[File:Damon and Pythias..gif|thumb|Damon and Pythias]]\nAs told by [[Aristoxenus]], and after him [[Cicero]] (''De Offic.'' 3.45), [[Diodorus Siculus]] (10.4), and others, Pythias and his friend Damon, both followers of the philosopher [[Pythagoras]], traveled to [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] during the reign of the tyrannical [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius I]] (r. 405&ndash;367 BC). Pythias was accused of plotting against the tyrant and sentenced to death.\n\nAccepting his sentence, Pythias asked to be allowed to return home one last time to settle his affairs and bid his family farewell.  Not wanting to be taken for a fool, the king refused, believing that, once released, Pythias would flee and never return. Damon offered himself as a hostage in Pythias' absence, and when the king insisted that, should Pythias not return by an appointed time, Damon would be executed in his stead, Damon agreed and Pythias was released.\n\nDionysius was convinced that Pythias would never return, and as the day Pythias promised to return came and went, he called for Damon's execution\u2014but just as the executioner was about to kill Damon, Pythias returned.\n\nApologizing to his friend for the delay, Pythias explained that on the passage back to Syracuse pirates had captured his ship and thrown him overboard, but that he swam to shore and made his way back to Syracuse as quickly as possible, arriving just in time to save his friend. \n\nSo astonished by and pleased with their friendship, Dionysius pardoned both men. It was also said that the tyrant then sought to become their third friend, but was denied.\n\nAnother version says that it was a test planned by Dionysius and his courtiers. The Pythagoreans were renowned for their moral strength and superiority, but some Syracusan courtiers argued the claim was false, and others disagreed, so with their king they devised a test\u2014a crisis that would show whether two Pythagoreans lived up to that reputation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Kitty |title=Pythagoras His Lives and the Legacy of a Rational Universe |publisher=Walker |year=2008 |page=119 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n== Works based on the legend==\n[[File:Damon and Pythias (1914) - 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Still from the film ''Damon and Pythias'' (1914)]]\n*In 1564, the material was made into a [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] play by the English poet [[Richard Edwardes]] (''[[Damon and Pythias (play)|Damon and Pythias]]'').\n*The best-known modern treatment of the legend is the [[German language|German]] ballad ''[[Die B\u00fcrgschaft]]'',<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_B%C3%BCrgschaft Die B\u00fcrgschaft \u2013 Wikisource].

In the discussion (below), the use of the Damon-and-Pythias idiom would seem to indicate that, whether the difference was on a point of science or something else, it was not \"only\" some trivial difference:  \n<blockquote>...said Utterson. \u201cI thought you had a common bond of interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had,\u201d was the reply. \u201cBut it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]], a former student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Macdonald also provided funds for the purchase and maintenance of the School's initial equipment. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms of the top floor of the original Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of Frank Peder, George Taylor Hyde and Norman M. McLeod.<ref name=McGillBeginning />}} and Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, while Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=McGillBeginning />\n\n[[File:McDonald Engineering Building, McGill University, Montreal, QC, about 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|The old [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering#Buildings & Laboratories|Macdonald Engineering Building]], the School of Architecture's original home.]]\nIn 1903, Capper returned to England to establish the School of Architecture at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], which was the fourth university architecture school to be established in the British Commonwealth, after [[University of Toronto]] (1890), [[University of Liverpool]] (1894) and McGill (1896).<ref name=McGillBeginning /> The second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students. Nobbs is credited with designing the [[McGill University#University identity and culture|McGill coat of arms]] three years into his tenure.<ref name=McGillEngineering /> As director, he divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]]. After the Macdonald Engineering Building burned down in 1907,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Macdonald_Engineering.html|title=Macdonald Engineering, the Workman Wing, & the Electrical Wing|publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor.

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|Second World War]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a repurposed building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.

Macdonald also provided funds for the purchase and maintenance of the School's initial equipment. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms of the top floor of the original Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of Frank Peder, George Taylor Hyde and Norman M.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]]. After the Macdonald Engineering Building burned down in 1907,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Macdonald_Engineering.html|title=Macdonald Engineering, the Workman Wing, & the Electrical Wing|publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor.
