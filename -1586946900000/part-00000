Born in [[Leicester]] and of Nigerian descent, he was [[Cap (sport)|capped]] four times for [[England national football team|England]]. Dublin started his career as a [[centre back]] with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], but made his name at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] as a [[centre-forward]]. He then went on to other clubs which include [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\nDublin is also an amateur percussionist, and invented a percussion instrument called \"The Dube\". In 2011, he accompanied [[Ocean Colour Scene]] in a gig at the [[University of East Anglia]], [[Norwich]]. In 2015, he joined the presenting team on the [[BBC One]] daytime show ''[[Homes Under the Hammer]]''.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Norwich City===\nWhilst at school in Leicestershire, Dublin played for several Leicestershire youth teams including [[Wigston]] Fields and [[Thurmaston]] Magpies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubwebsite.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/dublin-urges-football-hopefuls-to-listen-and-learn/|title=Dublin urges football hopefuls to listen and learn|date=11 June 2011|access-date=8 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223050/http://www.clubwebsite.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/dublin-urges-football-hopefuls-to-listen-and-learn/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Dublin then went on to begin his professional footballing career with Norwich City after leaving school in 1985, but he never made a first-team appearance and was released from the club in 1988.\n\n===Cambridge United===\nIn August 1988, he joined Cambridge United on a free transfer,<ref>{{cite news |title=I'm not Dublin your money; Roy won't give Dion any special wage deal |first=John |last=Gardner |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I'M+NOT+DUBLIN+YOUR+MONEY%3B+Roy+won't+give+Dion+any+special+wage+deal.-a060939083 |work=Daily Record |publisher=The Free Library |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref> as a centre-half, which had been his position at Norwich City. However, his new club recognised that Dublin had greater potential as a striker.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} His prolific goalscoring helped United to successive promotions. During the [[1988\u201389 in English football|1988\u201389]] season, Dublin was then loaned out for a short spell to Barnet. The [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season saw Cambridge promoted from the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] via the [[Football League Two play-offs#1990|play-offs]], when Dublin became the first ever scorer in a Wembley play-off final.\n\nIn the [[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391]] season, the club were champions of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], and the club also reached the quarter-final of the [[FA Cup]] in both seasons, with Dublin scoring at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1991.<ref name=91-champions>{{cite web |url=https://www.theleaguepaper.com/features/4412/where-are-they-now-cambridge-uniteds-div-3-championship-199091/ |title=Where Are They Now?

He has since spoken many times of his affection for Cambridge United.\n\n===Manchester United===\nHaving seen Dublin in a cup tie, Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson]] signed him for \u00a31&nbsp;million on 7 August 1992, fighting off competition from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-united-sign-pounds-1m-dublin-1538789.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Football: United sign pounds 1m Dublin | first=Rupert | last=Metcalf | date=7 August 1992 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> Dublin was something of a surprise purchase for United,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} after Ferguson had tried to sign [[Alan Shearer]] from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] but lost out to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccer365.com/match_reports/story_30709235013.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014121541/http://www.soccer365.com/match_reports/story_30709235013.php |archivedate=14 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHe scored in United's fourth Premier League game of the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]], a last minute winner in United's first Premier league victory \u2013 1\u20130 against Southampton at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Dublin delivers perfect finish for United |first=Owen |last=Slot |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dublin-delivers-perfect-finish-for-united-1542456.html |work=The Independent |date=25 August 1992 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref> However, on 2 September, he suffered a broken leg against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in a 1\u20130 win at [[Old Trafford]], after a tackle by [[Eric Young (footballer, born 1960)|Eric Young]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Dublin facing five months out with broken leg |first=Derick |last=Allsop |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dublin-facing-five-months-out-with-broken-leg-1549138.html |work=The Independent |date=3 September 1992 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref> and was out of action for six months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dion Dublin Q & A |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dion+Dublin+Q+%26+A.-a061109439 |work=Daily Mirror |date=10 March 1997 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref> By the time he had recovered, however, United had signed [[Eric Cantona]] and the Frenchman was firmly established as first choice strike partner to [[Mark Hughes]]. United won the league that season for the first time since 1967, but Dublin failed to make the 10 Premier League appearances required to automatically gain a title winner's medal. However, he was given a medal as a result of special dispensation from the Premier League.\n\nIn the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] season, Dublin regained his fitness, but his first team chances were restricted by the successful partnership of Cantona and Hughes. In December 1993, Ferguson agreed a deal with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] manager [[Howard Kendall]], that would have seen Dublin moving to [[Goodison Park]], but a member of Everton's board of directors, apparently feeling that Dublin was not worth the money Kendall had offered United, intervened to prevent the transfer going through \u2013 this dispute sparked Kendall's resignation as manager. Dublin would remain a United player for another nine months, but never managed to claim a regular place in the first team.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/howard-kendall-bolt-from-the-blue-1935322.html]</ref>\n\nHe managed five league appearances that season, scoring once in a 3\u20132 home win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in early April, his goal helping secure a vital victory in the title run-in during a spell when United started to drop points and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] were closing in on them.<ref>{{cite news |title=United stay clear of rampant Rovers: Ince relieves fraying Old Trafford nerves \u2013 Dalglish's men keep up the pressure as Oldham and Everton drop closer to relegation |first=Joe |last=Lovejoy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--race-for-the-championship-united-stay-clear-of-rampant-rovers-ince-relieves-fraying-old-trafford-nerves--dalglishs-men-keep-up-the-pressure-as-oldham-and-everton-drop-closer-to-relegation-1368092.html |work=The Independent |date=5 April 1994 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref> He also managed a further goal in the [[Football League Cup]] second round first leg, as United were beaten 2\u20131 by [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] at the [[Victoria Ground]]. The goal against Oldham was the only competitive goal that Dublin scored for United at Old Trafford. He was left out of the [[FA Cup]] winning team, and failed to make enough appearances to merit another Premier League title winners medal, and in September 1994, he was sold to Coventry City for \u00a32&nbsp;million - a record signing for Coventry City at the time - and also one of the largest fees received by Manchester United.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dublin moves to Coventry |first=Mark |last=Burton |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dublin-moves-to-coventry-1447962.html |work=The Independent |date=10 September 1994 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/no-headline-present-1.485716|title=No Headline Present|website=HeraldScotland}}</ref>\n\n===Coventry City===\nIn four-and-a-half years with Coventry, Dublin established himself as one of the Premier League's top [[strikers]] and during the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398 season]] won the first of his four England full caps. That season, he equalled the Coventry City record for most goals in a top division season with 23 goals in all competitions.\n\nFollowing Phil Neal's departure in 1995, the arrival of [[Ron Atkinson]] and [[Gordon Strachan]] would see Dublin fit into an attacking team in the typical Atkinson mould. It included the likes of [[Noel Whelan (footballer)|Noel Whelan]], [[John Salako]] and [[Darren Huckerby]] to add to the already attack minded [[Peter Ndlovu]]. The addition of [[Gary McAllister]], following Euro 96, should have provided mid table stability but the team's defensive frailties often undermined Dublin's scoring at the other end. This culminated in possibly one of the greatest escapes in Premiership history in May 1997. Sitting second from bottom, Coventry City needed favourable results elsewhere whilst needing an away win at White Hart Lane. This game followed on from an away win at Anfield (Dublin scoring in the dying seconds) and a home win against Chelsea. But at Tottenham Hotspur that afternoon, Dublin scored in the first half before [[Paul Williams (footballer, born 1971)|Paul Williams]] netted to secure an unlikely 2\u20131 win. The game reached a nerve-racking climax which included a memorable late save from City keeper [[Steve Ogrizovic]].\n\nThe following season the Sky Blues improved at home and enjoyed a season of mid table security. Dublin formed an impressive partnership with [[Darren Huckerby]] which not only produced some memorable goals but also propelled the Sky Blues to the FA Cup Sixth Round against Sheffield United; a game they narrowly lost in a penalty shoot out. The 1997\u201398 season also saw Dublin share elite status as the Premier League's top scorer with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn's]] [[Chris Sutton]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool's]] [[Michael Owen]] \u2013 each Englishman scoring 18 league goals. During this season, Blackburn manager [[Roy Hodgson]] tabled a bid which Dublin rejected. He remained at [[Highfield Road]] and contributed to Coventry's best finish to date in the Premiership (11th).\n\n===Aston Villa===\nDublin was controversially excluded from the England [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] squad, despite being the Premier League's joint top-scorer in the 1997\u201398 season, alongside [[Michael Owen]] and [[Chris Sutton]]. However, his exploits at club level were still attracting significant attention and in the autumn of 1998, he chose to move to Aston Villa for \u00a35.75&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dublin becomes a Villan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/208618.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 November 1998 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref> In his first four games for the club, he would score 7 goals including a memorable hat-trick against Southampton in only his second game for the Villans.

It marked a return, almost 20 years after leaving, for Dublin to the club where he began his career. He made his debut on 23 September 2006 when he came on as substitute against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. He scored his first competitive goal in Norwich City colours in a 3\u20133 draw against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 14 October 2006 at [[Loftus Road]]. [[Steve Wilson (football commentator)|Steve Wilson]] cited Dublin as the main inspiration behind [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]]'s 4\u20131 FA Cup 3rd Round win at Tamworth, in which the striker scored two goals and set up numerous chances for other teammates.\n\nDublin was an important figure in Norwich securing safety from relegation to League One and the supporters recognised his contribution by voting him in second place in the [[Norwich City player of the year]] award, and on 23 May 2007 he ended speculation about his future by signing a new one-year contract at Norwich, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2007\u201308 season. On 2 September 2007, Dublin, whilst a pundit on the Aston Villa v [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] game, said that this season would be his last as a footballer, citing the fact that his 'bones have started to talk to him' as the reason, meaning that he did not think his body can handle another season.\n\n{{Quote box |width=100% |align=left |quote=\"It was incredible at Hillsborough.

United won the league that season for the first time since 1967, but Dublin failed to make the 10 Premier League appearances required to automatically gain a title winner's medal. However, he was given a medal as a result of special dispensation from the Premier League.\n\nIn the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] season, Dublin regained his fitness, but his first team chances were restricted by the successful partnership of Cantona and Hughes. In December 1993, Ferguson agreed a deal with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] manager [[Howard Kendall]], that would have seen Dublin moving to [[Goodison Park]], but a member of Everton's board of directors, apparently feeling that Dublin was not worth the money Kendall had offered United, intervened to prevent the transfer going through \u2013 this dispute sparked Kendall's resignation as manager. Dublin would remain a United player for another nine months, but never managed to claim a regular place in the first team.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/howard-kendall-bolt-from-the-blue-1935322.html]</ref>\n\nHe managed five league appearances that season, scoring once in a 3\u20132 home win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in early April, his goal helping secure a vital victory in the title run-in during a spell when United started to drop points and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] were closing in on them.<ref>{{cite news |title=United stay clear of rampant Rovers: Ince relieves fraying Old Trafford nerves \u2013 Dalglish's men keep up the pressure as Oldham and Everton drop closer to relegation |first=Joe |last=Lovejoy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--race-for-the-championship-united-stay-clear-of-rampant-rovers-ince-relieves-fraying-old-trafford-nerves--dalglishs-men-keep-up-the-pressure-as-oldham-and-everton-drop-closer-to-relegation-1368092.html |work=The Independent |date=5 April 1994 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref> He also managed a further goal in the [[Football League Cup]] second round first leg, as United were beaten 2\u20131 by [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] at the [[Victoria Ground]].

He was left out of the [[FA Cup]] winning team, and failed to make enough appearances to merit another Premier League title winners medal, and in September 1994, he was sold to Coventry City for \u00a32&nbsp;million - a record signing for Coventry City at the time - and also one of the largest fees received by Manchester United.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dublin moves to Coventry |first=Mark |last=Burton |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dublin-moves-to-coventry-1447962.html |work=The Independent |date=10 September 1994 |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/no-headline-present-1.485716|title=No Headline Present|website=HeraldScotland}}</ref>\n\n===Coventry City===\nIn four-and-a-half years with Coventry, Dublin established himself as one of the Premier League's top [[strikers]] and during the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398 season]] won the first of his four England full caps. That season, he equalled the Coventry City record for most goals in a top division season with 23 goals in all competitions.\n\nFollowing Phil Neal's departure in 1995, the arrival of [[Ron Atkinson]] and [[Gordon Strachan]] would see Dublin fit into an attacking team in the typical Atkinson mould. It included the likes of [[Noel Whelan (footballer)|Noel Whelan]], [[John Salako]] and [[Darren Huckerby]] to add to the already attack minded [[Peter Ndlovu]]. The addition of [[Gary McAllister]], following Euro 96, should have provided mid table stability but the teams defensive frailties often undermined Dublin's scoring at the other end. This culminated in possibly one of the greatest escapes in Premiership history in May 1997. Sitting second from bottom, Coventry City needed favourable results elsewhere whilst needing an away win at White Hart Lane. This game followed on from an away win at Anfield (Dublin scoring in the dying seconds) and a home win against Chelsea. But at Tottenham Hotspur that afternoon, Dublin scored in the first half before [[Paul Williams (footballer, born 1971)|Paul Williams]] netted to secure an unlikely 2\u20131 win. The game reached a nerve-racking climax which included a memorable late save from City keeper [[Steve Ogrizovic]].\n\nThe following season the Sky Blues improved at home and enjoyed a season of mid table security. Dublin formed an impressive partnership with [[Darren Huckerby]] which not only produced some memorable goals but also propelled the Sky Blues to the FA Cup Sixth Round against Sheffield United; a game they narrowly lost in a penalty shoot out. The 1997\u201398 season also saw Dublin share elite status as the Premier League's top scorer with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn's]] [[Chris Sutton]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool's]] [[Michael Owen]] \u2013 each Englishman scoring 18 league goals. During this season, Blackburn manager [[Roy Hodgson]] tabled a bid which Dublin rejected. He remained at [[Highfield Road]] and contributed to Coventry's best finish to date in the Premiership (11th).\n\n===Aston Villa===\nDublin was controversially excluded from the England [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] squad, despite being the Premier League's joint top-scorer in the 1997\u201398 season, alongside [[Michael Owen]] and [[Chris Sutton]].

It was formerly a village, and has previously been called Lessendon, Lassendene and L\u00e6xadyne. Lexden is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\nLexden is approximately one mile west of central Colchester.  It is home to a public house, the Crown; and St Leonard's Church ([[Church of England]]).  The Leonard in question is [[Saint Leonard of Noblac]], the patron saint of prisoners.\n\nLexden's original name, L\u00e6xadyne, is [[Old English]] for \"Leaxa's valley\".  It is referred to as the  \"Hundred of LASSENDENE\" in the Domesday Book.\n\nIt is now cut into two-halves by a modern bypass, Spring Lane. Within the space of a few hundred yards there are two 400-year-old watermills, (both now private residences), a 100-year-old iron bridge over the River Colne, two local nature reserves and several interesting walks.\n\nThe area is covered by the Lexden ward and elects 2 councillors to sit on [[Colchester Borough Council]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Jaqueline Court, Lexden - geograph.org.uk - 1502167.jpg|thumb|right|Jaqueline Court, a 17th century house in Lexden Road.]]\nThe site on which Lexden now stands was crossed by the fortifications of [[iron age]] Colchester, the remains of the earthen ramparts can be seen at Bluebottle Grove, [[Lexden Park]] and alongside Straight Road.<ref>http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.12127</ref> A number of burial mounds or [[tumuli]] remain, notably '''Lexden Tumulus''' in Fitzwalter Road which is reputed to be the burial place of [[Cunobelinus]] or [[Cymbeline]], the king of the [[Catuvellauni]].<ref>http://unlockingessex.essexcc.gov.uk/custom_pages/monument_detail.asp?content_page_id=89&monument_id=34083&content_parents=48,175{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The '''Lexden Medallion''' was found when the tumulus was excavated in 1924 and is now in the [[Colchester Castle]] Museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colchestermuseums.org.uk/castle/castle_topten4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224020334/http://www.colchestermuseums.org.uk/castle/castle_topten4.html |archivedate=24 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Another tumulus is '''The Mount''' in Marlowe Way, in which some fragments of Roman pottery and tiles have been found.<ref>http://unlockingessex.essexcc.gov.uk/custom_pages/monument_detail.asp?kids=1&monument_id=34055{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe parish church was founded early in the 12th Century and a number of houses of medieval origins survive in Lexden Road (the A1124).

A Parliamentarian fort was built on Great Broom Heath (now called [[Hilly Fields, Colchester|Hilly Fields]]) which overlooks the town.<ref>http://www.lexdenhistory.org.uk/\n</ref> During the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] of 1665 to 1666, the burial ground for Colchester was near The Mount<ref>http://cat.essex.ac.uk/reports/EAS-report-0010.pdf</ref>\n.\n\nDuring the 18th Century a number of large houses were built including Lexden Park on the corner of Church Road, and the Manor House was rebuilt.  The main road became a [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] in 1707 and a cottage used as a [[toll house]] survives. Lexden Heath was a large area of [[common land]] used for grazing, horse races and military camps; it was [[inclosure|inclosed]] by Act of Parliament in 1821. This enlarged the estate of the lord of the manor, the Reverend John Rawstorn Papillon, who was an acquaintance of [[Jane Austen]] and whose niece married Jane's brother Henry.<ref>http://www.janeaustensoci.freeuk.com/pages/branches/cambridge_connections.htm\n</ref> Straight Road was created at this time to make a way across the new inclosures to the hamlet of '''Shrub End''', which became a separate parish in 1845.\n\nThe small and decrepit medieval church of St Leonard was demolished in 1820 and a new church was built slightly to the south, designed in the [[Early English Period|Early English]] style by M. G. Thompson. A larger chancel was added in 1892. A [[Methodist]] chapel was built in Straight Road in 1859 and a mission hall (now Lexden Evangelical Church) in 1885.\n\nA National Day and Sunday School was built in Spring Lane in 1817 and enlarged several times until replaced by Lexden Council School (now Lexden Primary) in 1925. Lexden Park House became the Endsleigh private school in 1955 and then the Endsleigh Annex of the Colchester Institute until 1990.<ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22020</ref> The house itself was converted to apartments and the gardens became a local nature reserve.<ref>http://www.wildessex.net/sites/Lexden%20Park.htm</ref> The Avenue of Remembrance was built in 1929 to relieve traffic on the London Road and as a memorial to the fallen of Colchester in [[World War I]].<ref>http://www.lexdenhistory.org.uk/\n</ref>\n\n[[Charles Henry Harrod]], a businessman involved in retail trade who founded the highly successful Harrods store in London, was born in Lexden.\n\n==Education==\nIn Lexden, there is one private school, Holmwood House School, which was founded in 1922 and has around three hundred pupils from reception to year eight.

It was formerly a village, and has previously been called Lessendon, Lassendene and L\u00e6xadyne. Lexden is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\nLexden is approximately one mile west of central Colchester.  It is home to a public house, the Crown; and St Leonard's Church ([[Church of England]]).  The Leonard in question is [[Saint Leonard of Noblac]], the patron saint of prisoners.\n\nLexden's original name, L\u00e6xadyne, is [[Old English]] for \"Leaxa's valley\".  It is referred to as the  \"Hundred of LASSENDENE\" in the Domesday Book.\n\nIt is now cut into two-halves by a modern bypass, Spring Lane. Within the space of a few hundred yards there are two 400-year-old watermills, (both now private residences), a 100-year-old iron bridge over the River Colne, two local nature reserves and several interesting walks.\n\nThe area is covered by the Lexden ward and elects 2 councillors to sit on [[Colchester Borough Council]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Jaqueline Court, Lexden - geograph.org.uk - 1502167.jpg|thumb|right|Jaqueline Court, a 17th century house in Lexden Road.]]\nThe site on which Lexden now stands was crossed by the fortifications of [[iron age]] Colchester, the remains of the earthen ramparts can be seen at Bluebottle Grove, [[Lexden Park]] and alongside Straight Road.<ref>http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.12127</ref> A number of burial mounds or [[tumuli]] remain, notably '''Lexden Tumulus''' in Fitzwalter Road which is reputed to be the burial place of [[Cunobelinus]] or [[Cymbeline]], the king of the [[Catuvellauni]].<ref>http://unlockingessex.essexcc.gov.uk/custom_pages/monument_detail.asp?content_page_id=89&monument_id=34083&content_parents=48,175{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The '''Lexden Medallion''' was found when the tumulus was excavated in 1924 and is now in the [[Colchester Castle]] Museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colchestermuseums.org.uk/castle/castle_topten4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224020334/http://www.colchestermuseums.org.uk/castle/castle_topten4.html |archivedate=24 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Another tumulus is '''The Mount''' in Marlowe Way, in which some fragments of Roman pottery and tiles have been found.<ref>http://unlockingessex.essexcc.gov.uk/custom_pages/monument_detail.asp?kids=1&monument_id=34055{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe parish church was founded early in the 12th Century and a number of houses of medieval origins survive in Lexden Road (the A1124).  Parts of The Sun Inn date from 1542<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.camulos.com/inns/inns5nto5s.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708113545/http://www.camulos.com/inns/inns5nto5s.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but it has recently become a private house.\n\nIn 1648, Lexden was the headquarters of Lord-General [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] during the [[Siege of Colchester]], and his army camped on Lexden Heath. A Parliamentarian fort was built on Great Broom Heath (now called [[Hilly Fields, Colchester|Hilly Fields]]) which overlooks the town.<ref>http://www.lexdenhistory.org.uk/\n</ref> During the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] of 1665 to 1666, the burial ground for Colchester was near The Mount<ref>http://cat.essex.ac.uk/reports/EAS-report-0010.pdf</ref>\n.\n\nDuring the 18th Century a number of large houses were built including Lexden Park on the corner of Church Road, and the Manor House was rebuilt.  The main road became a [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] in 1707 and a cottage used as a [[toll house]] survives. Lexden Heath was a large area of [[common land]] used for grazing, horse races and military camps; it was [[inclosure|inclosed]] by Act of Parliament in 1821. This enlarged the estate of the lord of the manor, the Reverend John Rawstorn Papillon, who was an acquaintance of [[Jane Austen]] and whose niece married Jane's brother Henry.<ref>http://www.janeaustensoci.freeuk.com/pages/branches/cambridge_connections.htm\n</ref> Straight Road was created at this time to make a way across the new inclosures to the hamlet of '''Shrub End''', which became a separate parish in 1845.\n\nThe small and decrepit medieval church of St Leonard was demolished in 1820 and a new church was built slightly to the south, designed in the [[Early English Period|Early English]] style by M. G. Thompson. A larger chancel was added in 1892. A [[Methodist]] chapel was built in Straight Road in 1859 and a mission hall (now Lexden Evangelical Church) in 1885.\n\nA National Day and Sunday School was built in Spring Lane in 1817 and enlarged several times until replaced by Lexden Council School (now Lexden Primary) in 1925. Lexden Park House became the Endsleigh private school in 1955 and then the Endsleigh Annex of the Colchester Institute until 1990.<ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22020</ref> The house itself was converted to apartments and the gardens became a local nature reserve.<ref>http://www.wildessex.net/sites/Lexden%20Park.htm</ref> The Avenue of Remembrance was built in 1929 to relieve traffic on the London Road and as a memorial to the fallen of Colchester in [[World War I]].<ref>http://www.lexdenhistory.org.uk/\n</ref>\n\n[[Charles Henry Harrod]], a businessman involved in retail trade who founded the highly successful Harrods store in London, was born in Lexden.\n\n==Education==\nIn Lexden, there is one private school, Holmwood House School, which was founded in 1922 and has around three hundred pupils from reception to year eight.
