It runs parallel to the north coast, with extensions to the northwest, the [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] Island, and to the southeast, the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula (with its ''Sierra de Saman\u00e1''). Its highest mountain is [[Diego de Ocampo]], close to Santiago, with 1,249 m. There are several small plains between this range and the Atlantic Ocean. Rivers are short and most of them flow to the north.\n* The ''[[Cibao]]'' Valley (Dominican Republic) is the largest and the most important valley of the country. This long valley stretches from North Haiti, where is called ''[[Plain]]e du Nord'', to Saman\u00e1 Bay. It can be divided in two sections: the northwestern part is the ''Yaque del Norte Valley'' (or ''L\u00ednea Noroeste'') and the eastern ''Yuna Valley'' (or ''Vega Real'', English: ''Royal Valley''). The ''Vega Real'' is the most fertile area in the country, with a high population density.\n* The ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' (also called ''Sierra del Cibao'') is the island's most rugged and imposing feature and is known in Haiti as the ''Massif du Nord'' (\"Northern Massif\").  ALSO IT IS THE BEST PLACE THANKYOU.The highest mountains of the West Indies are in this range: [[Pico Duarte]], 3,098 m, and others above 3,000 m. Near the center of the island, this range turns southward and is called ''Sierra de Ocoa'', finishing near the city of Azua de Compostela, on the Caribbean coast. Another branch, ''Cordillera Oriental'' or ''Sierra del Seibo'', is separated from the main chain by a [[Karst topography|karst]]ic region (''Los Haitises'') and with a west\u2013east direction; it is located south of Saman\u00e1 Bay.\n* The ''San Juan Valley'' and ''[[Plain]] of Azua'' are big valleys south of the ''Cordillera Central'' with altitude from 0 to 600 m.\n* The ''Sierra de Neiba'', with Mount Neiba the highest mountain with 2,279 m. An extension to the southeast of ''Sierra de Neiba'' is the ''Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda'' (''Loma Bus\u00fa'', 1,350 m).\n* The ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' or ''Neiba Valley'' is a remarkable valley, with a west\u2013east direction, of low altitude (on average 50 m with some points below sea level) and with a great salt lake: the ''[[Enriquillo Lake]]''.\n* The ''Sierra de Bahoruco'', called ''Massif de la Selle'' in Haiti. This southern group of mountains have a geology very different from the rest of the island.\n* ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (in English, \"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is in the southeast of the island (and of the Dominican Republic).

This long valley stretches from North Haiti, where is called ''[[Plain]]e du Nord'', to Saman\u00e1 Bay. It can be divided in two sections: the northwestern part is the ''Yaque del Norte Valley'' (or ''L\u00ednea Noroeste'') and the eastern ''Yuna Valley'' (or ''Vega Real'', English: ''Royal Valley''). The ''Vega Real'' is the most fertile area in the country, with a high population density.\n* The ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' (also called ''Sierra del Cibao'') is the island's most rugged and imposing feature and is known in Haiti as the ''Massif du Nord'' (\"Northern Massif\").  The highest mountains of the West Indies are in this range: [[Pico Duarte]], 3,098 m, and others above 3,000 m. Near the center of the island, this range turns southward and is called ''Sierra de Ocoa'', finishing near the city of Azua de Compostela, on the Caribbean coast. Another branch, ''Cordillera Oriental'' or ''Sierra del Seibo'', is separated from the main chain by a [[Karst topography|karst]]ic region (''Los Haitises'') and with a west\u2013east direction; it is located south of Saman\u00e1 Bay.\n* The ''San Juan Valley'' and ''[[Plain]] of Azua'' are big valleys south of the ''Cordillera Central'' with altitude from 0 to 600 m.\n* The ''Sierra de Neiba'', with Mount Neiba the highest mountain with 2,279 m. An extension to the southeast of ''Sierra de Neiba'' is the ''Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda'' (''Loma Bus\u00fa'', 1,350 m).\n* The ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' or ''Neiba Valley'' is a remarkable valley, with a west\u2013east direction, of low altitude (on average 50 m with some points below sea level) and with a great salt lake: the ''[[Enriquillo Lake]]''.\n* The ''Sierra de Bahoruco'', called ''Massif de la Selle'' in Haiti. This southern group of mountains have a geology very different from the rest of the island.\n* ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (in English, \"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is in the southeast of the island (and of the Dominican Republic). It is a large [[prairie]] east of [[Santo Domingo]].\n\n[[File:Beach Barahona 2001.jpg|thumb|center|400px|A beach in the Barahona province]]\n\n== Rivers and lakes ==\nThe 8 longest rivers of the Dominican Republic are:<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = De la Fuente\n  | first = Santiago\n  | title = Geograf\u00eda Dominicana\n  | publisher = Editora Colegial Quisqueyana\n  | year = 1976\n  | location = Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n  | pages = 110\u2013114 }}</ref>\n# ''[[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]]''.
