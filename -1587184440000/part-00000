The first shopping mall of the enclosed, automobile-centred design type was [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], opened in 1964. For shopping malls [[Area code 905|surrounding the city of Toronto]], please see the template at the bottom of this article.\n\n==Major shopping centres==\nThese shopping centres each have over a hundred stores and are anchored by multiple department stores. They are also the five largest malls in Toronto. Each provides thousands of automobile parking spaces. With the exception of [[Sherway Gardens]], all of these malls have direct pedestrian connections with the [[Toronto subway]] system, though Sherway Gardens has bus connections through the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]'s [[Toronto Transit Commission bus system|bus network]] and [[MiWay]] of [[Mississauga]]. Yorkdale is Toronto's first major shopping centre and was the world's largest when it was first opened. The Toronto Eaton Centre is the most visited shopping mall in North America, given its downtown location and direct access to two subway stations.

These shopping centres typically provide a surrounding free parking lot. Most of these are located in the former suburbs of Toronto, where land was available for parking. There are only three shopping malls of this type within [[Old Toronto|Toronto's pre-1998 city limits]]: Galleria Shopping Centre (at Dufferin Street and Dupont Street), Dufferin Mall (on Dufferin Street south of Bloor Street and north of College Street), and Gerrard Square (on Gerrard Street East east of Pape Avenue).

It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained. The protective group, benzyl, was then removed with [[boron trichloride]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained.

It was founded by the Oregon Province, [[Society of Jesus]], in 1956 and uses a [[Jesuit]], [[college-preparatory]] curriculum. It is [[coeducation]]al and enrolls approximately 1,300 students of all faiths.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe school was the 43rd [[List of Jesuit secondary schools in the United States|Jesuit high school]] to be established in the United States. Though it was not finally established until 1956, the process of founding a Jesuit high school in Portland began in 1907, when property was purchased by the parish of St. Ignatius and set aside for a future high school. A lay appeal to the Jesuit Provincial for a high school in 1929 came to nothing. In 1954 the Holy Cross Fathers of Portland announced the closing of Columbia Prep and a plan for the Jesuits to take over the premises was discussed, but again dropped. Finally in 1955 the Jesuit [[Provincial Superior]] was asked by the Archbishop to set up a school. Hillsdale Dairy Farm, a {{convert|55|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot to the west, some 15 minutes drive from downtown Portland, was purchased for $165,000. Jesuit and Holy Cross priests raised pledges of $117,000 by Wednesday of the first week of a fund-raising campaign in [[church (building)|church]]es, and hundreds of thousands more by door-to-door canvassing. Jesuit High School opened for freshmen boys on September 10, 1956 and girls have been admitted since 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jesuitportland.org/userlogin.cfm?pp=522&userrequest=YES&keyrequest=NO&userpage=522|title=Jesuit High School : A Catholic College Preparatory High School in the Jesuit Tradition: Member Login|website=www.jesuitportland.org|access-date=2016-03-12}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe demographic breakdown of the 1,280 students enrolled in 2013-14 was:<ref name=\"ed.gov\"/>\n*Native American/Alaskan - 0.2%\n*Black - 3.4%\n*Hispanic - 4.6%\n*Multiracial - 7.2%\n*Asian/Pacific islanders - 10.2%\n*White - 74.4%\n\n==Academics==\nJesuit High School has been accredited through [[Northwest Accreditation Commission]] since 1961.<ref name=\"naas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.advanc-ed.org/oasis2/u/par/accreditation/summary?institutionId=52277|title=AdvancED - Institution Summary|work=advanc-ed.org|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989 and 1998, Jesuit High School was honored in the [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program]], the highest honor a school can receive in the United States.<ref name=\"blueribbon\">[http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf Archived: Blue Ribbon Schools Program, Schools Recognized 1982-1983 Through 1999-2002 (PDF)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055622/http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nOn June 20, 2007, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' rated Jesuit the number one high school athletic program in the nation, citing success both on and off the field.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/highschool/06/18/top.10/index.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com - Nation's Top 10 athletic programs - Jun 19, 2007 | date=June 19, 2007 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2005-2006 academic year, Jesuit won seven state championships in various sports and activities.

It was founded by the Oregon Province, [[Society of Jesus]], in 1956 and uses a [[Jesuit]], [[college-preparatory]] curriculum. It is [[coeducation]]al and enrolls approximately 1,300 students of all faiths.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe school was the 43rd [[List of Jesuit secondary schools in the United States|Jesuit high school]] to be established in the United States. Though it was not finally established until 1956, the process of founding a Jesuit high school in Portland began in 1907, when property was purchased by the parish of St. Ignatius and set aside for a future high school. A lay appeal to the Jesuit Provincial for a high school in 1929 came to nothing. In 1954 the Holy Cross Fathers of Portland announced the closing of Columbia Prep and a plan for the Jesuits to take over the premises was discussed, but again dropped. Finally in 1955 the Jesuit [[Provincial Superior]] was asked by the Archbishop to set up a school. Hillsdale Dairy Farm, a {{convert|55|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot to the west, some 15 minutes drive from downtown Portland, was purchased for $165,000. Jesuit and Holy Cross priests raised pledges of $117,000 by Wednesday of the first week of a fund-raising campaign in [[church (building)|church]]es, and hundreds of thousands more by door-to-door canvassing. Jesuit High School opened for freshmen boys on September 10, 1956 and girls have been admitted since 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jesuitportland.org/userlogin.cfm?pp=522&userrequest=YES&keyrequest=NO&userpage=522|title=Jesuit High School : A Catholic College Preparatory High School in the Jesuit Tradition: Member Login|website=www.jesuitportland.org|access-date=2016-03-12}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe demographic breakdown of the 1,280 students enrolled in 2013-14 was:<ref name=\"ed.gov\"/>\n*Native American/Alaskan - 0.2%\n*Black - 3.4%\n*Hispanic - 4.6%\n*Multiracial - 7.2%\n*Asian/Pacific islanders - 10.2%\n*White - 74.4%\n\n==Academics==\nJesuit High School has been accredited through [[Northwest Accreditation Commission]] since 1961.<ref name=\"naas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.advanc-ed.org/oasis2/u/par/accreditation/summary?institutionId=52277|title=AdvancED - Institution Summary|work=advanc-ed.org|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989 and 1998, Jesuit High School was honored in the [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program]], the highest honor a school can receive in the United States.<ref name=\"blueribbon\">[http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf Archived: Blue Ribbon Schools Program, Schools Recognized 1982-1983 Through 1999-2002 (PDF)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055622/http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nOn June 20, 2007, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' rated Jesuit the number one high school athletic program in the nation, citing success both on and off the field.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/highschool/06/18/top.10/index.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com - Nation's Top 10 athletic programs - Jun 19, 2007 | date=June 19, 2007 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2005-2006 academic year, Jesuit won seven state championships in various sports and activities.

The four classifications were [[Chelonia (order)|Chelonia]], [[Sauria]], [[Ophidia]] and [[Batrachia]]. However, even-though he classified Batrachia as a sub-class of Reptilia, Brongniart noticed a huge difference in the anatomy of Batrachia compared to the rest of the class. This problem was resolved in 1804 by [[Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille|Pierre Latreille]] by replacing Batrachia into a class called [[Amphibian|Amphibians]], and the rest of the Reptilia grouping was retained. Therefore, Batrachians is the only group that is no longer recognized as reptiles as they are amphibians.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Georges Cuvie, Carte geognostique des environs de Paris - David Rumsey.jpg|thumb|Paris Map that Brongniart and Cuvier used to study the strata around Paris area]]\nThe most significant work for Brongniart was ''[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6467343s/f17.image.texteImage Essai sur la g\u00e9ographie min\u00e9ralogique des environs de Paris]'' in collaboration with [[Georges Cuvier]] on studies of geology around Paris in 1811. At the time, Cuvier was trying figure out the periods the fossils are from and to reconstruct the extinct mammals based on the periods they are from. Their paper \"''Essai sur la g\u00e9ographie min\u00e9ralogique des environs de Paris\"'' identified nine formations that had been formed over a very long period of time. The formations, starting with the oldest, were called the Chalk, Argile Plastique, Calcaire grossier, Calcaire silicieux, Formation gypseuse, Sabels et Gres marins, Gres sans coquilliers, Terrain d\u2019eau douce, and Limon d\u2019aterrissement. Brongniart found that some of the [https://geolmaps.com/products/books-france-3?variant=7384205492260 strata] had marine mollusk fossils, and some had fresh water mollusk fossils. He used the alternation of these marine and fresh water layers to disproved the theory that strata was deposited by a shrinking ocean.The paper was first read to the public on April, 1808 but was extended in June, 1808 and later on 1811. They were the among the first people to study the earth by its fossil content instead of relying on the characteristics of rocks. During the collaboration, they also found evidences against Abraham Werner's Neptunism. The results triggered Cuvier into creating catastrophism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=A Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|year=1981|isbn=0-87196-396-5|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> \n\nAnother significant contribution in stratigraphy was using the fossil content in the strata he examined in Paris to identify strata in other locations instead of depth or lithology, as rocks can\u2019t be expected to have the exact same characteristics or depth if deposited under different conditions. \n\nIn 1822, Brongniart published the first full length study of trilobites in which he classified a variety from Europe and North America and tried to group them based on age.

He also made an extensive study of [[trilobite]]s and made pioneering contributions to [[stratigraphy]] by developing fossil markers for dating strata.\n\nIn 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\n==Work==\nIn his early ages, Brongniart focused on the studies of reptiles and published ''Essai dune classification naturally des reptiles'' in 1800, which he compared the anatomy of reptiles in order to classify them into different groups. The four classifications were [[Chelonia (order)|Chelonia]], [[Sauria]], [[Ophidia]] and [[Batrachia]]. However, even-though he classified Batrachia as a sub-class of Reptilia, Brongniart noticed a huge difference in the anatomy of Batrachia compared to the rest of the class. This problem was resolved in 1804 by [[Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille|Pierre Latreille]] by replacing Batrachia into a class called [[Amphibian|Amphibians]], and the rest of the Reptilia grouping was retained. Therefore, Batrachians is the only group that is no longer recognized as reptiles as they are amphibians.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Georges Cuvie, Carte geognostique des environs de Paris - David Rumsey.jpg|thumb|Paris Map that Brongniart and Cuvier used to study the strata around Paris area]]\nThe most significant work for Brongniart was ''[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6467343s/f17.image.texteImage Essai sur la g\u00e9ographie min\u00e9ralogique des environs de Paris]'' in collaboration with [[Georges Cuvier]] on studies of geology around Paris in 1811. At the time, Cuvier was trying figure out the periods the fossils are from and to reconstruct the extinct mammals based on the periods they are from. Their paper \"''Essai sur la g\u00e9ographie min\u00e9ralogique des environs de Paris\"'' identified nine formations that had been formed over a very long period of time. The formations, starting with the oldest, were called the Chalk, Argile Plastique, Calcaire grossier, Calcaire silicieux, Formation gypseuse, Sabels et Gres marins, Gres sans coquilliers, Terrain d\u2019eau douce, and Limon d\u2019aterrissement. Brongniart found that some of the [https://geolmaps.com/products/books-france-3?variant=7384205492260 strata] had marine mollusk fossils, and some had fresh water mollusk fossils. He used the alternation of these marine and fresh water layers to disproved the theory that strata was deposited by a shrinking ocean.The paper was first read to the public on April, 1808 but was extended in June, 1808 and later on 1811. They were the among the first people to study the earth by its fossil content instead of relying on the characteristics of rocks. During the collaboration, they also found evidences against Abraham Werner's Neptunism. The results triggered Cuvier into creating catastrophism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=A Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|year=1981|isbn=0-87196-396-5|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> \n\nAnother significant contribution in stratigraphy was using the fossil content in the strata he examined in Paris to identify strata in other locations instead of depth or lithology, as rocks can\u2019t be expected to have the exact same characteristics or depth if deposited under different conditions. \n\nIn 1822, Brongniart published the first full length study of trilobites in which he classified a variety from Europe and North America and tried to group them based on age.

Just three km from the Port of Limay, the Arsenal is strategically situated near the [[Petron Corporation|Petron]] Bataan Refinery, the Bataan Combined Cycle Power Plant, the [[National Power Corporation]] Plant, the Petro-Chemical Complex, and the [[Freeport Area of Bataan|Freeport Area]] at [[Mariveles, Bataan]]. To sustain its operations, the GA presently maintains and operates 124 buildings and structures sprawled over 70 hectares of land.\n\nA creation of [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 1884 which was signed into law on June 22, 1957, the Arsenal is a line bureau under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]]. However, it was only about a decade later, on March 7, 1967, that a presidential proclamation on its present site at [[Limay, Bataan]] was declared. Accordingly, on October 12, 1967, the ground breaking materialized at the spot where the statue of [[Antonio Luna|General Antonio Luna]] now stands. Site preparations were subsequently undertaken by the 514th and 564th Engineering Construction Battalions of the 51st Engineering Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Construction of essential buildings and facilities then followed along with training abroad of selected military and newly hired civilian personnel on the manufacture of small arms ammunition (SAA).\n\nOn August 15, 1971, or fourteen (14) years after the enactment of Republic Act 1884, the first SAA cartridge rolled out of the GA's production assembly line. Three years later, the integrated SAA manufacture began, with all the components - case, primer, propellant powder, and bullet assembled into a complete cartridge - manufactured in the arsenal.\n\nAs a strategic resource, the arsenal is envisioned to be a center for defense industries to meet domestic requirements and supply the world market. In line with this vision, the GA explored in the early 1980s, the possibility of exporting excess production, improving ammunition technology and expanding the capability for weapons production as called for in its charter. However, the impediments under the then existing laws prevented any real progress in this direction.\n\n==Modernization==\n[[File:GA Marine Scout Sniper Rifle Variant 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|GA-made [[Marine Scout Sniper Rifle|Marine Scout Sniper Rifles]] on display.]]\n\nOn February 23, 1995, Republic Act 7898, otherwise known as the [[AFP Modernization Act]], was enacted. Republic Act 7898 likewise provides for the modernization of the Government Arsenal for the development of production capabilities to enhance self-sufficiency in defense requirements. Specifically, Section 12 of this Act mandates that \"the government arsenal shall be utilized in the production of basic weapons, ammunition and other munitions for the use of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP), and for the sale and export of products in excess of AFP/PNP requirements.\" Furthermore, the GA is authorized to use such production facilities as it may own or be provided under the law or as it may arrange under joint venture, co-production or similar arrangements with local and foreign entities.\n\nAs part of the modernization effort, the arsenal, through the Department of National Defense, issued an invitation to bid for a Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 in August 2009.<ref name=\"bid\">{{cite web |title=Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB): Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 |url=http://www.dnd.gov.ph/DNDWEBPAGE_files/dndbac/ITB/ITEABSep09/ITAEB%20GA.pdf |publisher=Department of National Defense |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2009-12-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  This marks a significant expansion of existing production lines.\n\nAs of the most recent supplemental bulletin for the bid,<ref name=\"supp\">{{cite web |title=Supplemental bid bulletin Nr.

Just three km from the Port of Limay, the Arsenal is strategically situated near the [[Petron Corporation|Petron]] Bataan Refinery, the Bataan Combined Cycle Power Plant, the [[National Power Corporation]] Plant, the Petro-Chemical Complex, and the [[Freeport Area of Bataan|Freeport Area]] at [[Mariveles, Bataan]]. To sustain its operations, the GA presently maintains and operates 124 buildings and structures sprawled over 70 hectares of land.\n\nA creation of [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 1884 which was signed into law on June 22, 1957, the Arsenal is a line bureau under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]]. However, it was only about a decade later, on March 7, 1967, that a presidential proclamation on its present site at [[Limay, Bataan]] was declared. Accordingly, on October 12, 1967, the ground breaking materialized at the spot where the statue of [[Antonio Luna|General Antonio Luna]] now stands. Site preparations were subsequently undertaken by the 514th and 564th Engineering Construction Battalions of the 51st Engineering Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Construction of essential buildings and facilities then followed along with training abroad of selected military and newly hired civilian personnel on the manufacture of small arms ammunition (SAA).\n\nOn August 15, 1971, or fourteen (14) years after the enactment of Republic Act 1884, the first SAA cartridge rolled out of the GA's production assembly line. Three years later, the integrated SAA manufacture began, with all the components - case, primer, propellant powder, and bullet assembled into a complete cartridge - manufactured in the arsenal.\n\nAs a strategic resource, the arsenal is envisioned to be a center for defense industries to meet domestic requirements and supply the world market. In line with this vision, the GA explored in the early 1980s, the possibility of exporting excess production, improving ammunition technology and expanding the capability for weapons production as called for in its charter. However, the impediments under the then existing laws prevented any real progress in this direction.\n\n==Modernization==\n[[File:GA Marine Scout Sniper Rifle Variant 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|GA-made [[Marine Scout Sniper Rifle|Marine Scout Sniper Rifles]] on display.]]\n\nOn February 23, 1995, Republic Act 7898, otherwise known as the [[AFP Modernization Act]], was enacted. Republic Act 7898 likewise provides for the modernization of the Government Arsenal for the development of production capabilities to enhance self-sufficiency in defense requirements. Specifically, Section 12 of this Act mandates that \"the government arsenal shall be utilized in the production of basic weapons, ammunition and other munitions for the use of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP), and for the sale and export of products in excess of AFP/PNP requirements.\" Furthermore, the GA is authorized to use such production facilities as it may own or be provided under the law or as it may arrange under joint venture, co-production or similar arrangements with local and foreign entities.\n\nAs part of the modernization effort, the arsenal, through the Department of National Defense, issued an invitation to bid for a Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 in August 2009.<ref name=\"bid\">{{cite web |title=Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB): Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 |url=http://www.dnd.gov.ph/DNDWEBPAGE_files/dndbac/ITB/ITEABSep09/ITAEB%20GA.pdf |publisher=Department of National Defense |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2009-12-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  This marks a significant expansion of existing production lines.\n\nAs of the most recent supplemental bulletin for the bid,<ref name=\"supp\">{{cite web |title=Supplemental bid bulletin Nr.

The revised system uses simplified alphanumeric designations that make reference to the ammunition's caliber and type for ease of identification while avoiding unnecessary complications caused by the use of mixed English & SI units and designations based on different foreign code systems.<ref name=\"G.A.
