In 2019, it was ranked seventh in the world on the  [[List of most visited art museums]].<ref>The [[Art Newspaper]] annual art museum visitor survey, 2019, published 9 April 2020</ref>  \n\nUnlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] bought 38 paintings from the heirs of [[John Julius Angerstein]] in 1824. After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, notably Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]], and by private donations, which today account for two-thirds of the collection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gentili|Barcham|Whiteley|2000|p=7}}</ref> The collection is small compared with many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting \"from [[Giotto]] to [[Paul C\u00e9zanne|C\u00e9zanne]]\"<ref>Chilvers, Ian (2003). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists''. Oxford Oxford University Press, p. 413.

''From Giotto to C\u00e9zanne: A Concise History of Painting''. London: Thames and Hudson</ref> are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition,<ref>{{Harvnb|Potterton|1977|p=8}}</ref> but this is no longer the case.\n\nThe present building, the third to house the National Gallery, was designed by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] from 1832 to 1838. Only the facade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. Wilkins's building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the [[Tate Britain|Tate Gallery]] for British art in 1897.\n\nThe Sainsbury Wing, a 1991 extension to the west by [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]], is a notable example of [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernist]] architecture in Britain. The current Director of the National Gallery is [[Gabriele Finaldi]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Call for a National Gallery===\n[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus.jpg|alt=Realistic painting of a robed figure, arms extended, standing outside on a small platform among people doing various things such as talking to each other, but most of whom are looking at him.|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'' by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], from the collection of [[John Julius Angerstein]]. This became the founding collection of the National Gallery in 1824.

The Bavarian royal collection (now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich) opened to the public in 1779, that of the [[House of Medici|Medici]] in [[Florence]] around 1789 (as the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]]), and the Museum Fran\u00e7ais at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793.<ref name=\"Taylor1\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|1999|pp=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], however, did not emulate the continental model, and the British [[Royal Collection]] remains in the sovereign's possession today. In 1777 the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature, when the descendants of Sir [[Robert Walpole]] put his collection up for sale. The MP [[John Wilkes]] argued for the government to buy this \"invaluable treasure\" and suggested that it be housed in \"a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Moore |title = Sir Robert Walpole's pictures in Russia |work=Magazine Antiques |date=2 October 1996 |url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016151632/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 October 2007 |accessdate=14 October 2007 }}</ref> Nothing came of Wilkes's appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by [[Catherine the Great]]; it is now to be found in the [[State Hermitage Museum]] in [[St Petersburg]].\n\nA plan to acquire 150 paintings from the [[Orl\u00e9ans collection]], which had been brought to London for sale in 1798, also failed, despite the interest of both the King and the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Penny|2008|p=466}}</ref> The twenty-five paintings from that collection now in the Gallery, including \"NG1\", arrived later by a variety of routes. In 1799 the dealer Noel Desenfans offered a ready-made national collection to the British government; he and his partner Sir [[Francis Bourgeois]] had assembled it for the king of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], before the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] in 1795 abolished Polish independence.<ref name=\"Taylor1\"/> This offer was declined and Bourgeois bequeathed the collection to his old school, [[Dulwich College]], on his death. The collection opened in 1814 in Britain's first purpose-built public gallery, the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]. The Scottish dealer William Buchanan and the collector Joseph Count Truchsess, both formed art collections expressly as the basis for a future national collection, but their respective offers (both made in 1803) were also declined.<ref name=\"Taylor1\" />\n\nFollowing the Walpole sale many artists, including [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] and [[John Flaxman]], had made renewed calls for the establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The [[British Institution]], founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre,<ref>Fullerton, Peter (1979). ''Some aspects of the early years of the British Institution for Promoting the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom 1805\u20131825''. MA dissertation, Courtauld Institute of Art., p. 37</ref> some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=45}}</ref> One of the Institution's founding members, Sir [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|George Beaumont, Bt]], would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.\n\nIn 1823 another major art collection came on the market, which had been assembled by the recently deceased [[John Julius Angerstein]]. Angerstein was a Russian-born \u00e9migr\u00e9 banker based in London; his collection numbered 38 paintings, including works by [[Raphael]] and [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]'s ''[[Marriage \u00e0-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage \u00e0-la-mode]]'' series. On 1 July 1823 [[George Agar-Ellis, 1st Baron Dover|George Agar Ellis]], a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician, proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that it purchase the collection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=51}}</ref> The appeal was given added impetus by Beaumont's offer, which came with two conditions: that the government buy Angerstein's collection, and that a suitable building was to be found. The unexpected repayment of a war debt by [[Austria]] finally moved the government to buy Angerstein's collection, for \u00a357,000.\n\n===Foundation and early history===\n[[File:National Gallery at 100 Pall Mall.jpg|alt=Drawing of a three storied building, seen from the street. Women in long dresses date the picture.|thumb|right|upright|100 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], the home of the National Gallery from 1824 to 1834]]\n\nThe National Gallery opened to the public on 10 May 1824, housed in Angerstein's former townhouse at No. 100 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. Angerstein's paintings were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend [[William Holwell Carr]]'s bequest of 35 paintings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crookham|2009|p=43}}</ref> Initially the Keeper of Paintings, [[William Seguier]], bore the burden of managing the Gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.\n\nThe National Gallery at [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] was frequently overcrowded and hot and its diminutive size in comparison with the Louvre in Paris was a cause of national embarrassment. But Agar Ellis, by then a trustee of the Gallery, appraised the site for being \"in the very gangway of London\"; this was seen as necessary for the Gallery to fulfil its social purpose.<ref name=\"Taylor2\"/> [[Subsidence]] in No. 100 caused the Gallery to move briefly to No. 105 Pall Mall, which the novelist [[Anthony Trollope]] described as a \"dingy, dull, narrow house, ill-adapted for the exhibition of the treasures it held\".<ref name=\"Taylor2\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|1999|pp=36\u20137}}</ref> This in turn had to be demolished for the opening of a road to [[Carlton House Terrace]].<ref name=\"Survey\">[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=68408 'Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery', ''Survey of London: volume 20: St Martin-in-the-Fields, pt III: Trafalgar Square & Neighbourhood''] (1940), pp. 15\u201318. Date accessed: 15 December 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1832 construction began on a new building by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] on the site of the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]] in [[Charing Cross]], in an area that had been transformed over the 1820s into [[Trafalgar Square]]. The location was a significant one, between the wealthy [[West End of London|West End]] and poorer areas to the east.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacGregor|2004|p=30}}</ref> The argument that the collection could be accessed by people of all [[social classes]] outstripped other concerns, such as the pollution of central London or the failings of Wilkins's building, when the prospect of a move to [[South Kensington]] was mooted in the 1850s. According to the Parliamentary Commission of 1857, \"The ''existence'' of the pictures is not the end purpose of the collection, but the means only to give the people an ennobling enjoyment\".<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Langmuir|2005|p=11}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1837 until 1868 the [[Royal Academy]] was housed in the east wing of the building.\n\n=== Growth under Eastlake and his successors ===\n15th- and 16th-century Italian paintings were at the core of the National Gallery and for the first 30 years of its existence the Trustees' independent acquisitions were mainly limited to works by [[High Renaissance]] masters. Their conservative tastes resulted in several missed opportunities and the management of the Gallery later fell into complete disarray, with no acquisitions being made between 1847 and 1850.<ref>Robertson, David (2004). \"Eastlake, Sir Charles Lock (1793\u20131865)\", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> A critical [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] report in 1851 called for the appointment of a director, whose authority would surpass that of the trustees. Many thought the position would go to the German [[art historian]] [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]], whom the Gallery had consulted on previous occasions about the lighting and display of the collections. However, the man preferred for the job by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] and the Prime Minister, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], was the Keeper of Paintings at the Gallery, Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]]. Eastlake, who was President of the Royal Academy, played an essential role in the foundation of the [[Arundel Society]] and knew most of London's leading art experts.\n\n[[File:Piero della Francesca - Battesimo di Cristo (National Gallery, London).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Baptism of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]], one of Eastlake's purchases]]\n\nThe new director's taste was for the [[Early Renaissance painting|Northern and Early Italian Renaissance]] masters or \"primitives\", who had been neglected by the Gallery's acquisitions policy but were slowly gaining recognition from connoisseurs. He made annual tours to the continent and to Italy in particular, seeking out appropriate paintings to buy for the Gallery. In all, he bought 148 pictures abroad and 46 in Britain,<ref>''Grove Dictionary of Art'', Vol. 9, p. 683</ref> among the former such seminal works as [[Paolo Uccello]]\u2019s ''Battle of San Romano''. Eastlake also amassed a private art collection during this period, consisting of paintings that he knew did not interest the trustees. His ultimate aim, however, was for them to enter the National Gallery; this was duly arranged upon his death by his friend and successor as director, [[William Boxall]], and his widow [[Elizabeth Eastlake|Lady Eastlake]].\n\nThe Gallery's lack of space remained acute in this period. In 1845 a large bequest of British paintings was made by [[Robert Vernon (art patron)|Robert Vernon]]; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so they were displayed first in Vernon's town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at [[Marlborough House]].<ref name=\"BakerHenry\">Baker, Christopher and Henry, Tom (2001). \"A short history of the National Gallery\" in ''The National Gallery: Complete Illustrated Catalogue''. London: National Gallery Company, pp. x\u2013xix</ref> The Gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as [[J. M. W. Turner]] was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crookham|2012|p=56}}</ref> [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], the Gallery's Keeper and Secretary, worked with [[John Ruskin]] to bring the bequest together. The stipulation in Turner's will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|pp=72\u20133}}</ref> is still honoured in Room 15 of the Gallery, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to [[Tate Britain]] completed in 1985.\n\nThe third director, Sir [[Frederick William Burton]], laid the foundations of the collection of 18th-century art and made several outstanding purchases from English private collections. The acquisition in 1885 of two paintings from [[Blenheim Palace]], Raphael's ''[[Ansidei Madonna]]'' and Van Dyck's ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles I]]'', with a record-setting grant of \u00a387,500 from the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], brought the Gallery's \"golden age of collecting\" to an end, as its annual purchase grant was suspended for several years thereafter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=87\u20139}}</ref> When the Gallery purchased Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|Ambassadors]]'' from the [[William Pleydell-Bouverie, 5th Earl of Radnor|Earl of Radnor]] in 1890, it did so with the aid of private individuals for the first time in its history.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=93}}</ref> In 1897 the formation of the National Gallery of British Art, known unofficially from early in its history as the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]], allowed some British works to be moved off-site, following the precedent set by the Vernon collection and the Turner Bequest. Works by artists born after 1790 were moved to the new gallery on [[Millbank]], which allowed [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[John Constable|Constable]] to remain in Trafalgar Square.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:RokebyVenus.jpg|alt=Realistic painting of a nude woman seen from behind, reclining on a couch. She is looking at her reflection in a mirror held by a winged child.|thumb|right|''Venus at her Mirror'' (''[[The Rokeby Venus]]'') by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nThe agricultural crisis at the turn of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings, but the British national collections were priced out of the market by American plutocrats.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=107}}</ref> This prompted the foundation of the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]], a society of subscribers dedicated to stemming the flow of artworks to the United States. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez's]] ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' in 1906, followed by Holbein's ''Portrait of [[Christina of Denmark]]'' in 1909. However, despite the crisis in aristocratic fortunes, the following decade was one of several great bequests from private collectors. In 1909 the industrialist Dr [[Ludwig Mond]] gave 42 Italian renaissance paintings, including the ''[[Mond Crucifixion]]'' by Raphael, to the Gallery.<ref>[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/mond_bequest/default.htm The Mond Bequest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102111149/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/mond_bequest/default.htm |date=2 November 2005 }} (Official NG website)</ref> Other bequests of note were those of [[George Salting]] in 1910, [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1916 and Sir [[Hugh Lane]] in 1917; the last of these was one of the Gallery's more controversial bequests.\n\nIn a rare example of the political protest for which Trafalgar Square is famous occurring in the National Gallery, the ''Rokeby Venus'' was damaged on 10 March 1914 by [[Mary Richardson]], a campaigner for [[women's suffrage]], in protest against the arrest of [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellinis]], causing the Gallery to close until the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], when the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] called for an end to violent acts drawing attention to their plight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Spalding|1998|p=39}}</ref>\n\nThe reception of Impressionist art at the Gallery got off to an exceptionally stormy start. In 1906, Sir Hugh Lane promised 39 paintings, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s ''[[The Umbrellas (Renoir painting)|Umbrellas]]'', to the National Gallery on his death, unless a suitable building could be built in [[Dublin]]. Although eagerly accepted by the director [[Charles Holroyd]], they were received with extreme hostility by the Trustees; [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] wrote that \"I would as soon expect to hear of a Mormon service being conducted in St. Paul's Cathedral as to see the exhibition of the works of the modern French Art-rebels in the sacred precincts of Trafalgar Square\".<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=131}}</ref> Perhaps as a result of such attitudes, Lane amended his will with a codicil that the works should only go to Ireland, but crucially this was never witnessed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=132}}</ref> Lane died on board the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' in 1915, and a dispute began which was not resolved until 1959. Part of the collection is now on permanent loan to [[Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane|Dublin City Gallery (\"The Hugh Lane\")]] and other works rotate between London and Dublin every few years.\n\nA fund for the purchase of modern paintings established by [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] in 1923 bought [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat's]] ''[[Bathers at Asni\u00e8res]]'' and other notable modern works for the nation;<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=131}}</ref> in 1934 these transferred to the National Gallery from the Tate.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:The Evacuation of Paintings From London during the Second World War HU36302.jpg|thumb|left|Paintings being evacuated from the National Gallery during the Second World War]]\n\nShortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]] the paintings were evacuated to various locations in [[Wales]], including [[Penrhyn Castle]], the university colleges of [[Bangor University|Bangor]] and [[Aberystwyth University|Aberystwyth]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=25}}</ref> In 1940, during the [[Battle of France]], a more secure home was sought, and there were discussions about moving the paintings to Canada. This idea was firmly rejected by [[Winston Churchill]], who wrote in a telegram to the director [[Kenneth Clark]], \"bury them in caves or in cellars, but not a picture shall leave these islands\".<ref>{{Harvnb|MacGregor|2004|p=43}}</ref> Instead a slate quarry at Manod, near [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] in North Wales, was requisitioned for the Gallery's use. In the seclusion afforded by the paintings' new location, the Keeper (and future director) [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] began to compile scholarly catalogues on the collection, helped by the fact that the Gallery's library was also stored in the quarry. The move to Manod confirmed the importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity, something the Gallery's conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=79}}</ref> This eventually resulted in the first air-conditioned gallery opening in 1949.<ref name=\"BakerHenry\" />\n\nFor the course of the war [[Myra Hess]], and other musicians, such as [[Moura Lympany]], gave daily lunch-time recitals in the empty building, to raise public morale at a time when every concert hall in London was closed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=35}}</ref> A number of art exhibitions were held at the Gallery as a complement to the recitals.

The art critic [[Herbert Read]], writing that year, called the National Gallery \"a defiant outpost of culture right in the middle of a bombed and shattered metropolis\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=99}}</ref> The paintings returned to Trafalgar Square in 1945.\n\n===Post-war developments===\n{{multiple image |direction = vertical |width = 230\n|align=right\n|image1=Titian - Diana and Actaeon - Google Art Project.jpg\n|alt1=Painting of a man happening upon a group of nude women, bathing in a grotto-like space.\n|caption1=[[Titian]]\u2019s ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'', bought in 2008, jointly with the [[National Gallery of Scotland]]\n|image2=TitianDianaCallistoEdinburgh.jpg\n|alt2=Painting of two groups of mostly nude women; on the right, the goddess Diana points accusingly at a woman in the left group who lies on the floor in a state of distress.\n|caption2=Titian's ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', bought in 2012, jointly with the National Gallery of Scotland\n}}\n\nIn the post-war years, acquisitions have become increasingly difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for [[Old Masters]] \u2013 and even more so for the [[Impressionists]] and [[Post-impressionism|Post-impressionists]] \u2013 have risen beyond its means. Some of the Gallery's most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without the major public appeals backing them, including ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (bought in 1962) and [[Titian]]\u2019s ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' (1972). The Gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of \u00a350&nbsp;million from Sir [[Paul Getty]], enabling many major purchases to be made.<ref name=\"BakerHenry\"/> In April 1985 [[John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover|Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover]] and his brothers, the Hon. [[Simon Sainsbury]] and Sir [[Timothy Sainsbury]], had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=429}}</ref>\n\nThe directorship of [[Neil MacGregor]] saw a major rehang at the Gallery, dispensing with the classification of paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art historical values since the 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=435}}</ref> In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 [[Italian Baroque]] paintings from Sir [[Denis Mahon]]. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a [[Guercino]] from Mahon's collection for \u00a3200.

They usually hold the position of associate artist for two years and are given an exhibition in the National Gallery at the end of their tenure.\n\nThe respective remits of the National and Tate Galleries, which had long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection were given to the Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and others.

Nash's popularity was waning by this time, however, and the commission was awarded to [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], who was involved in the selection of the site and submitted some drawings at the last moment.<ref name=\"Summerson\">{{Harvnb|Summerson|1962|pp=208\u20139}}.

M.

({{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=401}}) Wilkins hoped for more land to the south, but was denied it as building there would have obscured the view of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].}} To exacerbate matters, there was a public right of way through the site to these buildings, which accounts for the access porticoes on the eastern and western sides of the fa\u00e7ade. These had to incorporate columns from the demolished [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]] and their relative shortness result in an elevation that was deemed excessively low, and a far cry from the commanding focal point that was desired for the northern end of the Square. Also recycled are the sculptures on the fa\u00e7ade, originally intended for Nash's [[Marble Arch]] but abandoned due to his financial problems.{{NoteTag|They are as follows: above the main entrance, a blank roundel (originally to feature the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] face) flanked by two female figures (personifications of Europe and Asia/India, sites of his campaigns) and high up on the eastern fa\u00e7ade, [[Minerva]] by [[John Flaxman]], originally [[Britannia]].}} The eastern half of the building housed the [[Royal Academy]] until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the Gallery.\n\nThe building was the object of public ridicule before it had even been completed, as a version of the design had been leaked to the ''Literary Gazette'' in 1833.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=60}}</ref>\nTwo years before completion, its infamous \"pepperpot\" elevation appeared on the frontispiece of ''Contrasts'' (1836), an influential tract by the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothicist]] [[Augustus Pugin|A.

Ornately decorated in comparison with the rooms by Wilkins, it nonetheless worsened the cramped conditions inside the building as it was built over the original entrance hall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=384\u20135}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, several attempts were made either to completely remodel the National Gallery (as suggested by Sir [[Charles Barry]] in 1853), or to move it to more capacious premises in [[Kensington]], where the air was also cleaner. In 1867 Barry's son [[Edward Middleton Barry]] proposed to replace the Wilkins building with a massive classical building with four domes. The scheme was a failure and contemporary critics denounced the exterior as \"a strong plagiarism upon [[St Paul's Cathedral]]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|Hyde|1982|pp=116\u20137}}</ref>\n\nWith the demolition of the workhouse, however, Barry was able to build the Gallery's first sequence of grand architectural spaces, from 1872 to 1876. Built to a polychrome [[Neo-Renaissance]] design, the Barry Rooms were arranged on a [[Greek cross]]-plan around a huge central octagon. Though it compensated for the underwhelming architecture of the Wilkins building, Barry's new wing was disliked by Gallery staff, who considered its monumental aspect to be in conflict with its function as exhibition space. Also, the decorative programme of the rooms did not take their intended contents into account; the ceiling of the 15th- and 16th-century Italian gallery, for instance, was inscribed with the names of British artists of the 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=396}}</ref> However, despite these failures, the Barry Rooms provided the Gallery with a strong axial groundplan; this was to be followed by all subsequent additions to the Gallery for a century, resulting in a building of clear symmetry.\n\nPennethorne's gallery was demolished for the next phase of building, a scheme by Sir [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]] extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the [[John Dibblee Crace|Crace]] family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic, Lord Leighton]]\u2019s painting of ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna|Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence]]'' (1853\u20131855), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=399}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nGaler\u00eda Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 178.JPG|The Barry Rooms (1872\u20131876), designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry|E.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Barry]]\nB\u00f3veda de la sala 36, Galer\u00eda Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 165-167 HDR.JPG|The dome of Room 34, the central octagon of the Barry Rooms\nStaircase hall of the National Gallery, London.jpg|The Staircase Hall (1884\u20131887), designed by [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]], in a photograph of 2007.

The use of dark marble for doorcases was also continued, giving the extensions a degree of internal consistency with the older rooms. The classical style was still in use at the National Gallery in 1929, when a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style gallery was built, funded by the art dealer and Trustee [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Lord Duveen]]. However, it was not long before the 20th-century reaction against Victorian attitudes became manifest at the Gallery. From 1928 to 1952 the landing floors of Taylor's entrance hall were relaid with a new series of [[mosaic]]s by [[Boris Anrep]], who was friendly with the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. These mosaics can be read as a satire on 19th-century conventions for the decoration of public buildings, as typified by the [[Albert Memorial]]'s ''[[Frieze of Parnassus]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=404\u20135}}</ref> The central mosaic depicting ''The Awakening of the Muses'' includes portraits of [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Greta Garbo]], subverting the high moral tone of its Victorian forebears. In place of Christianity's seven virtues, Anrep offered his own set of ''Modern Virtues'', including \"Humour\" and \"Open Mind\"; the allegorical figures are again portraits of his contemporaries, including Winston Churchill, [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|2004|p=54}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century the Gallery's late Victorian interiors fell out of fashion.<ref>See for example National Gallery (corporate author) (1974).

In the older rooms, the original classical details were effaced by partitions, daises and suspended ceilings, the aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from contemplation of the paintings. But the Gallery's commitment to modernism was short-lived: by the 1980s Victorian style was no longer considered anathema, and a restoration programme began to restore the 19th- and early-20th-century interiors to their purported original appearance. This began with the refurbishment of the Barry Rooms in 1985\u20136. From 1996 to 1999 even the North Galleries, by then considered to \"lack a positive architectural character\" were remodelled in a classical style, albeit a simplified one.<ref name=\"Gaskell\"/>\n\n===Sainsbury Wing and later additions===\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name = Sainsbury Wing\n| image = National Gallery London Sainsbury Wing 2006-04-17.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| caption = The Sainsbury Wing, as built, seen from Trafalgar Square\n| built = 1988\u20131991\n| architect = Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Associates\n| architecture = [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernist]]\n| designation1 = Grade I\n| designation1_offname = Sainsbury Wing at the National&nbsp;Gallery\n| designation1_date = 9 May 2018\n| designation1_number = 1451082<ref name=\"NHLE Sainsbury Wing\">{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1451082|desc= Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery |access-date = 11 May 2018 |fewer-links=x}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe most important addition to the building in recent years has been the Sainsbury Wing, designed by the postmodernist architects [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]] to house the collection of Renaissance paintings, and built in 1991.

The design that won the most votes was by the firm [[Ahrends, Burton and Koralek]], who then modified their proposal to include a tower, similar to that of the Rogers scheme.

However, in 1985 it became possible to devote the extension entirely to the Gallery's uses, due to a donation of almost \u00a350&nbsp;million from [[John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover|Lord Sainsbury]] and his brothers [[Simon Sainsbury|Simon]] and Sir [[Tim Sainsbury]]. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in the earlier competition.\n\n[[File:Galer\u00eda Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 173.JPG|thumb|left|The main [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of the Sainsbury Wing]]\nIn contrast with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale of many of the paintings{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir [[John Soane]]'s toplit galleries for the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the church interiors of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (the stone dressing is in ''pietra serena'', the grey stone local to Florence){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of [[false perspective]], as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by [[Cima da Conegliano|Cima]] of ''The Incredulity of St Thomas''. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the [[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]] in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.\n\nFollowing the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, the Gallery is currently engaged in a masterplan to convert the vacated office space on the ground floor into public space. The plan will also fill in disused courtyards and make use of land acquired from the adjoining [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] in St Martin's Place, which it gave to the National Gallery in exchange for land for its 2000 extension. The first phase, the East Wing Project designed by Jeremy Dixon and [[Edward Jones (English architect)|Edward Jones]], opened to the public in 2004. This provided a new ground level entrance from Trafalgar Square, named in honour of Sir [[Paul Getty]]. The main entrance was also refurbished, and reopened in September 2005. Possible future projects include a \"West Wing Project\" roughly symmetrical with the East Wing Project, which would provide a future ground level entrance, and the public opening of some small rooms at the far eastern end of the building acquired as part of the swap with the National Portrait Gallery. This might include a new public staircase in the bow on the eastern fa\u00e7ade. No timetable has been announced for these additional projects.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|left|The restoration of [[Titian]]'s ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' from 1967 to 1968 was a controversial restoration at the National Gallery, due to concern that the painting's [[wikt:tonality|tonality]] had been thrown out of balance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bomford|1997|p=72}}</ref>]]\n\nOne of the most persistent criticisms of the National Gallery, apart from those who criticise inadequacies of the building, has been of its conservation policy. The Gallery's detractors accused it of having had an over-zealous approach to restoration. The first cleaning operation at the National Gallery began in 1844 after Eastlake's appointment as Keeper, and was the subject of attacks in the press after the first three paintings to receive the treatment \u2013 a [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], a [[Aelbert Cuyp|Cuyp]] and a [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]] \u2013 were unveiled to the public in 1846.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bomford|1997|p=7}}</ref> The Gallery's most virulent critic was J. Morris Moore, who wrote a series of letters to ''[[The Times]]'' under the pseudonym \"Verax\" savaging the institution's cleanings. While an 1853 Parliamentary [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] set up to investigate the matter cleared the Gallery of any wrongdoing, criticism of its methods has been erupting sporadically ever since from some in the art establishment.\n\n[[File:Vignetta-Punch-Restauro.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An 1847 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] depicting the restoration controversy then ongoing]]\n\nThe last major outcry against the use of radical conservation techniques at the National Gallery was seventy-one years ago in the immediate post-war years, following a restoration campaign by Chief Restorer Helmut Ruhemann while the paintings were in Manod Quarry. When the cleaned pictures were exhibited to the public in 1946 there followed a furore with parallels to that of a century earlier. The principal criticism was that the extensive removal of [[varnish]], which was used in the 19th century to protect the surface of paintings but which darkened and discoloured them with time, may have resulted in the loss of \"harmonising\" glazes added to the paintings by the artists themselves. The opposition to Ruhemann's techniques was led by [[Ernst Gombrich]], a professor at the [[Warburg Institute]] who in later correspondence with a restorer described being treated with \"offensive superciliousness\" by the National Gallery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Walden|2004|p=176}}</ref> A 1947 commission concluded that no damage had been done in the recent cleanings.\n\n[[File:George Bellows - Men of the Docks - 1912 - The National Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[George Bellows]]: ''[[Men of the Docks]]'' (1912)]]\nThe National Gallery has also been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's decision in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the [[Venice|Venetian]] school as works by [[Giorgione]] (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity of his paintings) made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, the attribution of a 17th-century painting of ''Samson and Delilah'' (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested by a group of art historians, who believe that the National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those who were involved in the purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afterrubens.org/home.asp|title=AfterRubens.org: The Strange Story of the Samson and Delilah|access-date=17 March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211004735/http://afterrubens.org/home.asp|archive-date=11 February 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe National Gallery was sponsored by the Italian arms manufacturer Finmeccanica between October 2011 and October 2012.

Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900.{{NoteTag|Sculptures and applied art are in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the British Museum houses earlier art, non-Western art, prints and drawings, and art of a later date is at [[Tate Modern]].

In 2019, it was ranked seventh in the world on the  [[List of most visited art museums]].<ref>The [[Art Newspaper]] annual art museum visitor survey, 2019, published 9 April 2020</ref>  \n\nUnlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] bought 38 paintings from the heirs of [[John Julius Angerstein]] in 1824. After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, notably Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]], and by private donations, which today account for two-thirds of the collection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gentili|Barcham|Whiteley|2000|p=7}}</ref> The collection is small compared with many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting \"from [[Giotto]] to [[Paul C\u00e9zanne|C\u00e9zanne]]\"<ref>Chilvers, Ian (2003). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists''. Oxford Oxford University Press, p. 413. The formula was used by [[Michael Levey]], later the Gallery's eleventh director, for the title of a popular survey of European painting: Levey, Michael (1972). ''From Giotto to C\u00e9zanne: A Concise History of Painting''. London: Thames and Hudson</ref> are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition,<ref>{{Harvnb|Potterton|1977|p=8}}</ref> but this is no longer the case.\n\nThe present building, the third to house the National Gallery, was designed by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] from 1832 to 1838. Only the facade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. Wilkins's building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the [[Tate Britain|Tate Gallery]] for British art in 1897.\n\nThe Sainsbury Wing, a 1991 extension to the west by [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]], is a notable example of [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernist]] architecture in Britain. The current Director of the National Gallery is [[Gabriele Finaldi]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Call for a National Gallery===\n[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus.jpg|alt=Realistic painting of a robed figure, arms extended, standing outside on a small platform among people doing various things such as talking to each other, but most of whom are looking at him.|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'' by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], from the collection of [[John Julius Angerstein]].

The painting has the [[accession number (library science)|accession number]] NG1, making it officially the first painting to enter the Gallery.]]\n\nThe late 18th century saw the nationalisation of royal or princely art collections across mainland Europe. The Bavarian royal collection (now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich) opened to the public in 1779, that of the [[House of Medici|Medici]] in [[Florence]] around 1789 (as the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]]), and the Museum Fran\u00e7ais at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793.<ref name=\"Taylor1\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|1999|pp=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], however, did not emulate the continental model, and the British [[Royal Collection]] remains in the sovereign's possession today. In 1777 the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature, when the descendants of Sir [[Robert Walpole]] put his collection up for sale. The MP [[John Wilkes]] argued for the government to buy this \"invaluable treasure\" and suggested that it be housed in \"a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Moore |title = Sir Robert Walpole's pictures in Russia |work=Magazine Antiques |date=2 October 1996 |url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016151632/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 October 2007 |accessdate=14 October 2007 }}</ref> Nothing came of Wilkes's appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by [[Catherine the Great]]; it is now to be found in the [[State Hermitage Museum]] in [[St Petersburg]].\n\nA plan to acquire 150 paintings from the [[Orl\u00e9ans collection]], which had been brought to London for sale in 1798, also failed, despite the interest of both the King and the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Penny|2008|p=466}}</ref> The twenty-five paintings from that collection now in the Gallery, including \"NG1\", arrived later by a variety of routes. In 1799 the dealer Noel Desenfans offered a ready-made national collection to the British government; he and his partner Sir [[Francis Bourgeois]] had assembled it for the king of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], before the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] in 1795 abolished Polish independence.<ref name=\"Taylor1\"/> This offer was declined and Bourgeois bequeathed the collection to his old school, [[Dulwich College]], on his death. The collection opened in 1814 in Britain's first purpose-built public gallery, the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]. The Scottish dealer William Buchanan and the collector Joseph Count Truchsess, both formed art collections expressly as the basis for a future national collection, but their respective offers (both made in 1803) were also declined.<ref name=\"Taylor1\" />\n\nFollowing the Walpole sale many artists, including [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] and [[John Flaxman]], had made renewed calls for the establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The [[British Institution]], founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre,<ref>Fullerton, Peter (1979). ''Some aspects of the early years of the British Institution for Promoting the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom 1805\u20131825''. MA dissertation, Courtauld Institute of Art., p. 37</ref> some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=45}}</ref> One of the Institution's founding members, Sir [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|George Beaumont, Bt]], would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.\n\nIn 1823 another major art collection came on the market, which had been assembled by the recently deceased [[John Julius Angerstein]]. Angerstein was a Russian-born \u00e9migr\u00e9 banker based in London; his collection numbered 38 paintings, including works by [[Raphael]] and [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]'s ''[[Marriage \u00e0-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage \u00e0-la-mode]]'' series. On 1 July 1823 [[George Agar-Ellis, 1st Baron Dover|George Agar Ellis]], a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician, proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that it purchase the collection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=51}}</ref> The appeal was given added impetus by Beaumont's offer, which came with two conditions: that the government buy Angerstein's collection, and that a suitable building was to be found. The unexpected repayment of a war debt by [[Austria]] finally moved the government to buy Angerstein's collection, for \u00a357,000.\n\n===Foundation and early history===\n[[File:National Gallery at 100 Pall Mall.jpg|alt=Drawing of a three storied building, seen from the street. Women in long dresses date the picture.|thumb|right|upright|100 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], the home of the National Gallery from 1824 to 1834]]\n\nThe National Gallery opened to the public on 10 May 1824, housed in Angerstein's former townhouse at No. 100 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. Angerstein's paintings were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend [[William Holwell Carr]]'s bequest of 35 paintings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crookham|2009|p=43}}</ref> Initially the Keeper of Paintings, [[William Seguier]], bore the burden of managing the Gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.\n\nThe National Gallery at [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] was frequently overcrowded and hot and its diminutive size in comparison with the Louvre in Paris was a cause of national embarrassment. But Agar Ellis, by then a trustee of the Gallery, appraised the site for being \"in the very gangway of London\"; this was seen as necessary for the Gallery to fulfil its social purpose.<ref name=\"Taylor2\"/> [[Subsidence]] in No. 100 caused the Gallery to move briefly to No. 105 Pall Mall, which the novelist [[Anthony Trollope]] described as a \"dingy, dull, narrow house, ill-adapted for the exhibition of the treasures it held\".<ref name=\"Taylor2\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|1999|pp=36\u20137}}</ref> This in turn had to be demolished for the opening of a road to [[Carlton House Terrace]].<ref name=\"Survey\">[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=68408 'Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery', ''Survey of London: volume 20: St Martin-in-the-Fields, pt III: Trafalgar Square & Neighbourhood''] (1940), pp. 15\u201318. Date accessed: 15 December 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1832 construction began on a new building by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] on the site of the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]] in [[Charing Cross]], in an area that had been transformed over the 1820s into [[Trafalgar Square]]. The location was a significant one, between the wealthy [[West End of London|West End]] and poorer areas to the east.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacGregor|2004|p=30}}</ref> The argument that the collection could be accessed by people of all [[social classes]] outstripped other concerns, such as the pollution of central London or the failings of Wilkins's building, when the prospect of a move to [[South Kensington]] was mooted in the 1850s. According to the Parliamentary Commission of 1857, \"The ''existence'' of the pictures is not the end purpose of the collection, but the means only to give the people an ennobling enjoyment\".<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Langmuir|2005|p=11}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1837 until 1868 the [[Royal Academy]] was housed in the east wing of the building.\n\n=== Growth under Eastlake and his successors ===\n15th- and 16th-century Italian paintings were at the core of the National Gallery and for the first 30 years of its existence the Trustees' independent acquisitions were mainly limited to works by [[High Renaissance]] masters. Their conservative tastes resulted in several missed opportunities and the management of the Gallery later fell into complete disarray, with no acquisitions being made between 1847 and 1850.<ref>Robertson, David (2004). \"Eastlake, Sir Charles Lock (1793\u20131865)\", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> A critical [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] report in 1851 called for the appointment of a director, whose authority would surpass that of the trustees. Many thought the position would go to the German [[art historian]] [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]], whom the Gallery had consulted on previous occasions about the lighting and display of the collections. However, the man preferred for the job by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] and the Prime Minister, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], was the Keeper of Paintings at the Gallery, Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]]. Eastlake, who was President of the Royal Academy, played an essential role in the foundation of the [[Arundel Society]] and knew most of London's leading art experts.\n\n[[File:Piero della Francesca - Battesimo di Cristo (National Gallery, London).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Baptism of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]], one of Eastlake's purchases]]\n\nThe new director's taste was for the [[Early Renaissance painting|Northern and Early Italian Renaissance]] masters or \"primitives\", who had been neglected by the Gallery's acquisitions policy but were slowly gaining recognition from connoisseurs. He made annual tours to the continent and to Italy in particular, seeking out appropriate paintings to buy for the Gallery. In all, he bought 148 pictures abroad and 46 in Britain,<ref>''Grove Dictionary of Art'', Vol. 9, p. 683</ref> among the former such seminal works as [[Paolo Uccello]]\u2019s ''Battle of San Romano''. Eastlake also amassed a private art collection during this period, consisting of paintings that he knew did not interest the trustees. His ultimate aim, however, was for them to enter the National Gallery; this was duly arranged upon his death by his friend and successor as director, [[William Boxall]], and his widow [[Elizabeth Eastlake|Lady Eastlake]].\n\nThe Gallery's lack of space remained acute in this period. In 1845 a large bequest of British paintings was made by [[Robert Vernon (art patron)|Robert Vernon]]; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so they were displayed first in Vernon's town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at [[Marlborough House]].<ref name=\"BakerHenry\">Baker, Christopher and Henry, Tom (2001). \"A short history of the National Gallery\" in ''The National Gallery: Complete Illustrated Catalogue''. London: National Gallery Company, pp. x\u2013xix</ref> The Gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as [[J. M. W. Turner]] was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crookham|2012|p=56}}</ref> [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], the Gallery's Keeper and Secretary, worked with [[John Ruskin]] to bring the bequest together. The stipulation in Turner's will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|pp=72\u20133}}</ref> is still honoured in Room 15 of the Gallery, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to [[Tate Britain]] completed in 1985.\n\nThe third director, Sir [[Frederick William Burton]], laid the foundations of the collection of 18th-century art and made several outstanding purchases from English private collections. The acquisition in 1885 of two paintings from [[Blenheim Palace]], Raphael's ''[[Ansidei Madonna]]'' and Van Dyck's ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles I]]'', with a record-setting grant of \u00a387,500 from the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], brought the Gallery's \"golden age of collecting\" to an end, as its annual purchase grant was suspended for several years thereafter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=87\u20139}}</ref> When the Gallery purchased Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|Ambassadors]]'' from the [[William Pleydell-Bouverie, 5th Earl of Radnor|Earl of Radnor]] in 1890, it did so with the aid of private individuals for the first time in its history.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=93}}</ref> In 1897 the formation of the National Gallery of British Art, known unofficially from early in its history as the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]], allowed some British works to be moved off-site, following the precedent set by the Vernon collection and the Turner Bequest. Works by artists born after 1790 were moved to the new gallery on [[Millbank]], which allowed [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[John Constable|Constable]] to remain in Trafalgar Square.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:RokebyVenus.jpg|alt=Realistic painting of a nude woman seen from behind, reclining on a couch. She is looking at her reflection in a mirror held by a winged child.|thumb|right|''Venus at her Mirror'' (''[[The Rokeby Venus]]'') by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nThe agricultural crisis at the turn of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings, but the British national collections were priced out of the market by American plutocrats.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=107}}</ref> This prompted the foundation of the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]], a society of subscribers dedicated to stemming the flow of artworks to the United States. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez's]] ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' in 1906, followed by Holbein's ''Portrait of [[Christina of Denmark]]'' in 1909. However, despite the crisis in aristocratic fortunes, the following decade was one of several great bequests from private collectors. In 1909 the industrialist Dr [[Ludwig Mond]] gave 42 Italian renaissance paintings, including the ''[[Mond Crucifixion]]'' by Raphael, to the Gallery.<ref>[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/mond_bequest/default.htm The Mond Bequest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102111149/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/mond_bequest/default.htm |date=2 November 2005 }} (Official NG website)</ref> Other bequests of note were those of [[George Salting]] in 1910, [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1916 and Sir [[Hugh Lane]] in 1917; the last of these was one of the Gallery's more controversial bequests.\n\nIn a rare example of the political protest for which Trafalgar Square is famous occurring in the National Gallery, the ''Rokeby Venus'' was damaged on 10 March 1914 by [[Mary Richardson]], a campaigner for [[women's suffrage]], in protest against the arrest of [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellinis]], causing the Gallery to close until the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], when the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] called for an end to violent acts drawing attention to their plight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Spalding|1998|p=39}}</ref>\n\nThe reception of Impressionist art at the Gallery got off to an exceptionally stormy start. In 1906, Sir Hugh Lane promised 39 paintings, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s ''[[The Umbrellas (Renoir painting)|Umbrellas]]'', to the National Gallery on his death, unless a suitable building could be built in [[Dublin]]. Although eagerly accepted by the director [[Charles Holroyd]], they were received with extreme hostility by the Trustees; [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] wrote that \"I would as soon expect to hear of a Mormon service being conducted in St. Paul's Cathedral as to see the exhibition of the works of the modern French Art-rebels in the sacred precincts of Trafalgar Square\".<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=131}}</ref> Perhaps as a result of such attitudes, Lane amended his will with a codicil that the works should only go to Ireland, but crucially this was never witnessed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=132}}</ref> Lane died on board the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' in 1915, and a dispute began which was not resolved until 1959. Part of the collection is now on permanent loan to [[Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane|Dublin City Gallery (\"The Hugh Lane\")]] and other works rotate between London and Dublin every few years.\n\nA fund for the purchase of modern paintings established by [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] in 1923 bought [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat's]] ''[[Bathers at Asni\u00e8res]]'' and other notable modern works for the nation;<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=131}}</ref> in 1934 these transferred to the National Gallery from the Tate.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:The Evacuation of Paintings From London during the Second World War HU36302.jpg|thumb|left|Paintings being evacuated from the National Gallery during the Second World War]]\n\nShortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]] the paintings were evacuated to various locations in [[Wales]], including [[Penrhyn Castle]], the university colleges of [[Bangor University|Bangor]] and [[Aberystwyth University|Aberystwyth]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=25}}</ref> In 1940, during the [[Battle of France]], a more secure home was sought, and there were discussions about moving the paintings to Canada. This idea was firmly rejected by [[Winston Churchill]], who wrote in a telegram to the director [[Kenneth Clark]], \"bury them in caves or in cellars, but not a picture shall leave these islands\".<ref>{{Harvnb|MacGregor|2004|p=43}}</ref> Instead a slate quarry at Manod, near [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] in North Wales, was requisitioned for the Gallery's use. In the seclusion afforded by the paintings' new location, the Keeper (and future director) [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] began to compile scholarly catalogues on the collection, helped by the fact that the Gallery's library was also stored in the quarry. The move to Manod confirmed the importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity, something the Gallery's conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=79}}</ref> This eventually resulted in the first air-conditioned gallery opening in 1949.<ref name=\"BakerHenry\" />\n\nFor the course of the war [[Myra Hess]], and other musicians, such as [[Moura Lympany]], gave daily lunch-time recitals in the empty building, to raise public morale at a time when every concert hall in London was closed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=35}}</ref> A number of art exhibitions were held at the Gallery as a complement to the recitals.

The art critic [[Herbert Read]], writing that year, called the National Gallery \"a defiant outpost of culture right in the middle of a bombed and shattered metropolis\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bosman|2008|p=99}}</ref> The paintings returned to Trafalgar Square in 1945.\n\n===Post-war developments===\n{{multiple image |direction = vertical |width = 230\n|align=right\n|image1=Titian - Diana and Actaeon - Google Art Project.jpg\n|alt1=Painting of a man happening upon a group of nude women, bathing in a grotto-like space.\n|caption1=[[Titian]]\u2019s ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'', bought in 2008, jointly with the [[National Gallery of Scotland]]\n|image2=TitianDianaCallistoEdinburgh.jpg\n|alt2=Painting of two groups of mostly nude women; on the right, the goddess Diana points accusingly at a woman in the left group who lies on the floor in a state of distress.\n|caption2=Titian's ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', bought in 2012, jointly with the National Gallery of Scotland\n}}\n\nIn the post-war years, acquisitions have become increasingly difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for [[Old Masters]] \u2013 and even more so for the [[Impressionists]] and [[Post-impressionism|Post-impressionists]] \u2013 have risen beyond its means. Some of the Gallery's most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without the major public appeals backing them, including ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (bought in 1962) and [[Titian]]\u2019s ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' (1972). The Gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of \u00a350&nbsp;million from Sir [[Paul Getty]], enabling many major purchases to be made.<ref name=\"BakerHenry\"/> In April 1985 [[John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover|Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover]] and his brothers, the Hon. [[Simon Sainsbury]] and Sir [[Timothy Sainsbury]], had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=429}}</ref>\n\nThe directorship of [[Neil MacGregor]] saw a major rehang at the Gallery, dispensing with the classification of paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art historical values since the 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=435}}</ref> In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 [[Italian Baroque]] paintings from Sir [[Denis Mahon]]. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a [[Guercino]] from Mahon's collection for \u00a3200.

They usually hold the position of associate artist for two years and are given an exhibition in the National Gallery at the end of their tenure.\n\nThe respective remits of the National and Tate Galleries, which had long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection were given to the Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and others.

Nash's popularity was waning by this time, however, and the commission was awarded to [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], who was involved in the selection of the site and submitted some drawings at the last moment.<ref name=\"Summerson\">{{Harvnb|Summerson|1962|pp=208\u20139}}.

M. Barry's extension, whereas [[St George's Barracks, London|St George's Barracks]] stayed until 1911, supposedly because of the need for troops to be at hand to quell disturbances in Trafalgar Square. ({{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=401}}) Wilkins hoped for more land to the south, but was denied it as building there would have obscured the view of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].}} To exacerbate matters, there was a public right of way through the site to these buildings, which accounts for the access porticoes on the eastern and western sides of the fa\u00e7ade. These had to incorporate columns from the demolished [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]] and their relative shortness result in an elevation that was deemed excessively low, and a far cry from the commanding focal point that was desired for the northern end of the Square. Also recycled are the sculptures on the fa\u00e7ade, originally intended for Nash's [[Marble Arch]] but abandoned due to his financial problems.{{NoteTag|They are as follows: above the main entrance, a blank roundel (originally to feature the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] face) flanked by two female figures (personifications of Europe and Asia/India, sites of his campaigns) and high up on the eastern fa\u00e7ade, [[Minerva]] by [[John Flaxman]], originally [[Britannia]].}} The eastern half of the building housed the [[Royal Academy]] until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the Gallery.\n\nThe building was the object of public ridicule before it had even been completed, as a version of the design had been leaked to the ''Literary Gazette'' in 1833.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=60}}</ref>\nTwo years before completion, its infamous \"pepperpot\" elevation appeared on the frontispiece of ''Contrasts'' (1836), an influential tract by the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothicist]] [[Augustus Pugin|A.

Ornately decorated in comparison with the rooms by Wilkins, it nonetheless worsened the cramped conditions inside the building as it was built over the original entrance hall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=384\u20135}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, several attempts were made either to completely remodel the National Gallery (as suggested by Sir [[Charles Barry]] in 1853), or to move it to more capacious premises in [[Kensington]], where the air was also cleaner. In 1867 Barry's son [[Edward Middleton Barry]] proposed to replace the Wilkins building with a massive classical building with four domes. The scheme was a failure and contemporary critics denounced the exterior as \"a strong plagiarism upon [[St Paul's Cathedral]]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|Hyde|1982|pp=116\u20137}}</ref>\n\nWith the demolition of the workhouse, however, Barry was able to build the Gallery's first sequence of grand architectural spaces, from 1872 to 1876. Built to a polychrome [[Neo-Renaissance]] design, the Barry Rooms were arranged on a [[Greek cross]]-plan around a huge central octagon. Though it compensated for the underwhelming architecture of the Wilkins building, Barry's new wing was disliked by Gallery staff, who considered its monumental aspect to be in conflict with its function as exhibition space. Also, the decorative programme of the rooms did not take their intended contents into account; the ceiling of the 15th- and 16th-century Italian gallery, for instance, was inscribed with the names of British artists of the 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=396}}</ref> However, despite these failures, the Barry Rooms provided the Gallery with a strong axial groundplan; this was to be followed by all subsequent additions to the Gallery for a century, resulting in a building of clear symmetry.\n\nPennethorne's gallery was demolished for the next phase of building, a scheme by Sir [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]] extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the [[John Dibblee Crace|Crace]] family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic, Lord Leighton]]\u2019s painting of ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna|Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence]]'' (1853\u20131855), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|p=399}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nGaler\u00eda Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 178.JPG|The Barry Rooms (1872\u20131876), designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry|E.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Barry]]\nB\u00f3veda de la sala 36, Galer\u00eda Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 165-167 HDR.JPG|The dome of Room 34, the central octagon of the Barry Rooms\nStaircase hall of the National Gallery, London.jpg|The Staircase Hall (1884\u20131887), designed by [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]], in a photograph of 2007.

The use of dark marble for doorcases was also continued, giving the extensions a degree of internal consistency with the older rooms. The classical style was still in use at the National Gallery in 1929, when a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style gallery was built, funded by the art dealer and Trustee [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Lord Duveen]]. However, it was not long before the 20th-century reaction against Victorian attitudes became manifest at the Gallery. From 1928 to 1952 the landing floors of Taylor's entrance hall were relaid with a new series of [[mosaic]]s by [[Boris Anrep]], who was friendly with the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. These mosaics can be read as a satire on 19th-century conventions for the decoration of public buildings, as typified by the [[Albert Memorial]]'s ''[[Frieze of Parnassus]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Conlin|2006|pp=404\u20135}}</ref> The central mosaic depicting ''The Awakening of the Muses'' includes portraits of [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Greta Garbo]], subverting the high moral tone of its Victorian forebears. In place of Christianity's seven virtues, Anrep offered his own set of ''Modern Virtues'', including \"Humour\" and \"Open Mind\"; the allegorical figures are again portraits of his contemporaries, including Winston Churchill, [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|2004|p=54}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century the Gallery's late Victorian interiors fell out of fashion.<ref>See for example National Gallery (corporate author) (1974).

In the older rooms, the original classical details were effaced by partitions, daises and suspended ceilings, the aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from contemplation of the paintings. But the Gallery's commitment to modernism was short-lived: by the 1980s Victorian style was no longer considered anathema, and a restoration programme began to restore the 19th- and early-20th-century interiors to their purported original appearance. This began with the refurbishment of the Barry Rooms in 1985\u20136. From 1996 to 1999 even the North Galleries, by then considered to \"lack a positive architectural character\" were remodelled in a classical style, albeit a simplified one.<ref name=\"Gaskell\"/>\n\n===Sainsbury Wing and later additions===\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name = Sainsbury Wing\n| image = National Gallery London Sainsbury Wing 2006-04-17.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| caption = The Sainsbury Wing, as built, seen from Trafalgar Square\n| built = 1988\u20131991\n| architect = Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Associates\n| architecture = [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernist]]\n| designation1 = Grade I\n| designation1_offname = Sainsbury Wing at the National&nbsp;Gallery\n| designation1_date = 9 May 2018\n| designation1_number = 1451082<ref name=\"NHLE Sainsbury Wing\">{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1451082|desc= Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery |access-date = 11 May 2018 |fewer-links=x}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe most important addition to the building in recent years has been the Sainsbury Wing, designed by the postmodernist architects [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]] to house the collection of Renaissance paintings, and built in 1991.

The Gallery had long sought expansion into this space{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and in 1982 a competition was held to find a suitable architect; the shortlist included a radical [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] proposal by [[Richard Rogers]], among others. The design that won the most votes was by the firm [[Ahrends, Burton and Koralek]], who then modified their proposal to include a tower, similar to that of the Rogers scheme. The proposal was dropped after the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] compared the design to a \"monstrous [[carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend\",<ref>{{cite web\n |url = http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html \n |title = A speech by HRH The Prince of Wales at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace \n |access-date=16 June 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html \n |archivedate=27 September 2007 \n}}</ref> The term \"monstrous carbuncle\", for a modern building that clashes with its surroundings, has since become commonplace.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4285069.stm |title = Prince's new architecture blast |access-date=16 June 2007 |date=21 February 2005 |work=BBC News }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1162818.stm |title=No cash for 'highest slum' |access-date=16 June 2007 | date=9 February 2001 |work=BBC News }}</ref>\n\nOne of the conditions of the 1982 competition was that the new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space. However, in 1985 it became possible to devote the extension entirely to the Gallery's uses, due to a donation of almost \u00a350&nbsp;million from [[John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover|Lord Sainsbury]] and his brothers [[Simon Sainsbury|Simon]] and Sir [[Tim Sainsbury]]. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in the earlier competition.\n\n[[File:Galer\u00eda Nacional, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 173.JPG|thumb|left|The main [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of the Sainsbury Wing]]\nIn contrast with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale of many of the paintings{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir [[John Soane]]'s toplit galleries for the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the church interiors of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (the stone dressing is in ''pietra serena'', the grey stone local to Florence){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of [[false perspective]], as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by [[Cima da Conegliano|Cima]] of ''The Incredulity of St Thomas''. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the [[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]] in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.\n\nFollowing the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, the Gallery is currently engaged in a masterplan to convert the vacated office space on the ground floor into public space. The plan will also fill in disused courtyards and make use of land acquired from the adjoining [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] in St Martin's Place, which it gave to the National Gallery in exchange for land for its 2000 extension. The first phase, the East Wing Project designed by Jeremy Dixon and [[Edward Jones (English architect)|Edward Jones]], opened to the public in 2004. This provided a new ground level entrance from Trafalgar Square, named in honour of Sir [[Paul Getty]]. The main entrance was also refurbished, and reopened in September 2005. Possible future projects include a \"West Wing Project\" roughly symmetrical with the East Wing Project, which would provide a future ground level entrance, and the public opening of some small rooms at the far eastern end of the building acquired as part of the swap with the National Portrait Gallery. This might include a new public staircase in the bow on the eastern fa\u00e7ade. No timetable has been announced for these additional projects.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|left|The restoration of [[Titian]]'s ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' from 1967 to 1968 was a controversial restoration at the National Gallery, due to concern that the painting's [[wikt:tonality|tonality]] had been thrown out of balance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bomford|1997|p=72}}</ref>]]\n\nOne of the most persistent criticisms of the National Gallery, apart from those who criticise inadequacies of the building, has been of its conservation policy. The Gallery's detractors accused it of having had an over-zealous approach to restoration. The first cleaning operation at the National Gallery began in 1844 after Eastlake's appointment as Keeper, and was the subject of attacks in the press after the first three paintings to receive the treatment \u2013 a [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], a [[Aelbert Cuyp|Cuyp]] and a [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]] \u2013 were unveiled to the public in 1846.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bomford|1997|p=7}}</ref> The Gallery's most virulent critic was J. Morris Moore, who wrote a series of letters to ''[[The Times]]'' under the pseudonym \"Verax\" savaging the institution's cleanings. While an 1853 Parliamentary [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] set up to investigate the matter cleared the Gallery of any wrongdoing, criticism of its methods has been erupting sporadically ever since from some in the art establishment.\n\n[[File:Vignetta-Punch-Restauro.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An 1847 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] depicting the restoration controversy then ongoing]]\n\nThe last major outcry against the use of radical conservation techniques at the National Gallery was seventy-one years ago in the immediate post-war years, following a restoration campaign by Chief Restorer Helmut Ruhemann while the paintings were in Manod Quarry. When the cleaned pictures were exhibited to the public in 1946 there followed a furore with parallels to that of a century earlier. The principal criticism was that the extensive removal of [[varnish]], which was used in the 19th century to protect the surface of paintings but which darkened and discoloured them with time, may have resulted in the loss of \"harmonising\" glazes added to the paintings by the artists themselves. The opposition to Ruhemann's techniques was led by [[Ernst Gombrich]], a professor at the [[Warburg Institute]] who in later correspondence with a restorer described being treated with \"offensive superciliousness\" by the National Gallery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Walden|2004|p=176}}</ref> A 1947 commission concluded that no damage had been done in the recent cleanings.\n\n[[File:George Bellows - Men of the Docks - 1912 - The National Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[George Bellows]]: ''[[Men of the Docks]]'' (1912)]]\nThe National Gallery has also been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's decision in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the [[Venice|Venetian]] school as works by [[Giorgione]] (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity of his paintings) made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, the attribution of a 17th-century painting of ''Samson and Delilah'' (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested by a group of art historians, who believe that the National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those who were involved in the purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afterrubens.org/home.asp|title=AfterRubens.org: The Strange Story of the Samson and Delilah|access-date=17 March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211004735/http://afterrubens.org/home.asp|archive-date=11 February 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe National Gallery was sponsored by the Italian arms manufacturer Finmeccanica between October 2011 and October 2012.
