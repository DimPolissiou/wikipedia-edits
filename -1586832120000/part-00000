It is attached to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\nThe unit's heritage stems from World War II, with the creation of the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]] in October 1941. 9 Para SF, raised in 1966 as '''9th Parachute Commando Battalion''', is the oldest among the eight Para SF units of the Indian Army.\n\n==History==\n\nThe parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to The Parachute Regiment|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190919/http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when [[Maratha Light Infantry|21 Maratha Light Infantry]] was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft.

The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army. The bodies of the three terrorists aged between 16 and 19 were in the custody of the Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|title=Court of inquiry ordered into terror attack on army camp in Samba - Times of India|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929133303/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|archivedate=29 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAuthorities moved commandos of 1 Para (SF) in helicopters to the shootout site. The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

Although this is also a training phase, this is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake various different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics; [[close quarter battle]] (CQB) training; urban warfare; counter-terrorism; unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the [[Indian Defense Forces|Indian defense forces]].\n\n==== Training centers and courses ====\n* Commando Training Camp, [[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n* 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan\n* [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir\n* Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, [[Kochi]]\n* Counter insurgency, at the [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram\n* [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Indian Special Forces Training School]], Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; \n* Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra\n\n==== 90-day probation ====\nSome of the training during the 90 day selection includes:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'.

It starts with a 10&nbsp;km speed march with 30&nbsp;kg battle loads and an additional 40&nbsp;kg each. This is followed by various exercises included lifting buddies over long periods. This is followed by weight shifting. Weight shifting has three rounds, where various kinds of weights have to be shifted such as 40 litres of jerry cans, tyre trucks and wooden logs up to 85&nbsp;kg in weight.<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Will Power {{!}} India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDgSuxw4ZA|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> During the 11th hour, trial by water is conducted<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Physical And Mental Strength - India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJNuutHuuM&t=46s|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> - simulated drowning, allowing only the bare minimum oxygen over a long period of time. This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs. This is all done at the last stage of the stress test under lack to sleep and extreme fatigue mainly to test mental endurance of the probationers under such conditions and how they react. The 36 hours stress test also sees many probationers leave.\n* Day 56: The Para SF 100&nbsp;km endurance run is a must for all probationers. With 10&nbsp;kg battle load and personal weapon of 7&nbsp;kg they have to run 100&nbsp;km. The time taken averages 13 to 15 hours. A known route the Para SF have used for this run is the hilly route between Rampur and Dakkal.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997. It is thought that the [[French Foreign Legion]] also has approached CIJWS regarding the courses taught by them.

It is attached to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\nThe unit's heritage stems from World War II, with the creation of the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]] in October 1941. 9 Para SF, raised in 1966 as '''9th Parachute Commando Battalion''', is the oldest among the eight Para SF units of the Indian Army.\n\n==History==\n\nThe parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to The Parachute Regiment|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190919/http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when [[Maratha Light Infantry|21 Maratha Light Infantry]] was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft.

The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army. The bodies of the three terrorists aged between 16 and 19 were in the custody of the Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|title=Court of inquiry ordered into terror attack on army camp in Samba - Times of India|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929133303/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|archivedate=29 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAuthorities moved commandos of 1 Para (SF) in helicopters to the shootout site. The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

Although this is also a training phase, this is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake various different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics; [[close quarter battle]] (CQB) training; urban warfare; counter-terrorism; unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the [[Indian Defense Forces|Indian defense forces]].\n\n==== Training centers and courses ====\n* Commando Training Camp, [[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n* 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan\n* [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir\n* Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, [[Kochi]]\n* Counter insurgency, at the [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram\n* [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Indian Special Forces Training School]], Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; \n* Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra\n\n==== 90-day probation ====\nSome of the training during the 90 day selection includes:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'.

It starts with a 10&nbsp;km speed march with 30&nbsp;kg battle loads and an additional 40&nbsp;kg each. This is followed by various exercises included lifting buddies over long periods. This is followed by weight shifting. Weight shifting has three rounds, where various kinds of weights have to be shifted such as 40 litres of jerry cans, tyre trucks and wooden logs up to 85&nbsp;kg in weight.<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Will Power {{!}} India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDgSuxw4ZA|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> During the 11th hour, trial by water is conducted<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Physical And Mental Strength - India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJNuutHuuM&t=46s|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> - simulated drowning, allowing only the bare minimum oxygen over a long period of time. This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs. This is all done at the last stage of the stress test under lack to sleep and extreme fatigue mainly to test mental endurance of the probationers under such conditions and how they react. The 36 hours stress test also sees many probationers leave.\n* Day 56: The Para SF 100&nbsp;km endurance run is a must for all probationers. With 10&nbsp;kg battle load and personal weapon of 7&nbsp;kg they have to run 100&nbsp;km. The time taken averages 13 to 15 hours. A known route the Para SF have used for this run is the hilly route between Rampur and Dakkal.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997. It is thought that the [[French Foreign Legion]] also has approached CIJWS regarding the courses taught by them.

The story is the continued adventures of [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]] and his [[dragon (Inheritance)|dragon]] [[Saphira]], centering on their journey to the realm of the [[Ellesm\u00e9ra|Elves]] in order to further Eragon's training as a [[Dragon Rider (Inheritance Cycle)|Dragon Rider]]. Other plots in the story focus on [[Roran Garrowsson|Roran]], [[Eragon]]'s cousin, who leads the inhabitants of [[Carvahall]] to Surda to join the Varden, and [[Nasuada]] as she takes on her father's role as leader of the Varden. ''Eldest'' ends at the Battle of the Burning Plains, where Eragon faces a new Dragon Rider, Murtagh, and a new dragon, [[Thorn (Inheritance)|Thorn]].\n\nReviews pointed out the similarities between ''Eldest'' and other works such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref name=\"Amazon\"/> while praising the themes of the book, such as friendship and honor.<ref name=\"Themes\"/> Several of these reviews commented on the style and genre of ''Eldest'',<ref name=\"BookBrowse\"/> while others considered the possibility of a [[film adaptation]] similar to the first film.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/>\n\n== Plot synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Eldest'' begins three days after the events of the preceding novel, ''[[Eragon]]'', in the dwarf city of Tronjheim, inside of a hollowed mountain named [[Du Weldenvarden|Farthen D\u00fbr]]. Farthen D\u00fbr is in the southeastern part of [[Alaga\u00ebsia]], the fictional continent where the ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' takes place. Throughout the novel, the protagonists travel to many different places: Ellesm\u00e9ra, the elven capital city in the forest [[Du Weldenvarden]], on the northern portion of Alaga\u00ebsia; Carvahall, a small town located on the northwestern part of Alaga\u00ebsia in Palancar Valley; and Aberon, the capital of Surda, in the southern portion of Alaga\u00ebsia.\n\n=== Characters ===\n{{main|List of the Inheritance Cycle characters}}\nThe story is told in third-person through protagonists [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]], [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Major characters|Roran]], and [[Nasuada]]. Eragon is nearly always accompanied by his dragon [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Saphira|Saphira]]. Due to the multiple points-of-view, multiple stories take place concurrently, and the protagonist characters do not meet often. Several other characters return from ''[[Eragon]]'', including [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Major characters|Arya]] (the elf warrior, daughter of the elven queen), [[List of the Inheritance Cycle characters#Orik|Orik]], [[Roran]] (Eragon's cousin and a major character), [[Ajihad]] (the leader of the Varden, who dies and is replaced by his daughter Nasuada), and [[Angela (Inheritance)|Angela]] (the herbalist).  Some new characters are introduced in ''Eldest'', such as [[Oromis]] and his dragon [[Glaedr]]. [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Murtagh|Murtagh]] appears briefly as a minor protagonist but then reappears later as a primary antagonist with his dragon, [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Thorn|Thorn]].\n\n=== Plot summary ===\n''Eldest'' begins as [[Ajihad]], the king of the rebel Varden force, is ambushed and killed, with [[Characters in the Inheritance Cycle#Murtagh|Murtagh]] gone while The Twins and Murtagh are assumed dead. At his funeral, Ajihad's daughter [[Nasuada]] is elected to command the Varden. The protagonists Eragon and Saphira then decide to travel to the forest [[Du Weldenvarden]] to become trained as a [[Dragon Rider (Inheritance Cycle)|Dragon Rider]] by the elves. The dwarf king, Hrothgar, decides to adopt Eragon to his clan, '''[[Dwarf clans in Inheritance Cycle#D\u00fbrgrimst Ingeitum|D\u00fbrgrimst Ingeitum]]''', and have his now foster brother, Orik, accompany him to the forest. Once there, Eragon meets [[Oromis]], The Cripple Who Is Whole, and his Dragon [[Glaedr]], a dragon with a missing front leg, and the only Dragon and Rider secretly alive besides Eragon, Saphira and [[Galbatorix]] and his forcibly bonded dragon Shruikan. Oromis and Glaedr, however, are both crippled, and so cannot fight Galbatorix and must hide to avoid Galbatorix hunting them down. Eragon and Saphira are taught the use of logic, magic theory, scholarship, and combat, among other things.\n\nMeanwhile, Eragon's cousin Roran, is planning to marry Katrina, daughter of Sloan the butcher. While the village is at peace, they are unexpectedly attacked by Galbatorix's soldiers and the Ra'zac, the strangers who had killed Roran's father, Garrow. The village metalsmith, Horst, equips his sons along with Roran with equipment. Roran takes a hammer and attacks the soldiers. The Ra'zac and most of the soldiers escape, saying that they want information from Roran. The entire village then sets up defenses, and during a second invasion, the Ra'zac escape again. One night, Roran wakes up to find Katrina being attacked by the Ra'zac, who sneaked into the house. Roran then takes off the cloth around the Ra'zac's face and sees that they are monsters, not humans. A Ra'zac bites Roran, leaving a serious injury, and leave with Katrina captured. While Roran is chasing them, Sloan, the village butcher and Katrina's father, betrays the village and joins the Ra'zac. However, Roran sees Ra'zac striking Sloan before he falls unconscious. The Ra'zac escape with their steeds, the Lethrblaka, who were originally their parents.\n\nMeanwhile, Nasuada chooses to move the Varden from Tronjheim to Surda to mount an attack on the Empire. The Varden, who are effectively refugees, suffer financial troubles, until Nasuada learns that the magicians can create an expensive lace with magic, and sell it at extremely low rates. One night when Nasuada is in her room, a character named Elva saves her from an assassination attempt. Elva is enchanted, and locates the assailant, who is killed after unwillingly surrendering information to Varden magicians about a subversive group based in Surda called the Black Hand, who is plotting to kill Nasuada. Nasuada later attends a meeting with key figures in Surda's government to discuss a potential upcoming battle against the Empire. They learn that the conflict is coming sooner than they initially suspected, and mobilize forces to attack, as well as sending for help from the dwarves.\n\nIn the meantime, Eragon continues his training, but is discouraged when the scar on his back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya for most of the book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaet\u00ed Bl\u00f6dhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy of a poem he wrote and presented for the Agaet\u00ed Bl\u00f6dhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.\n\nMeanwhile, Roran is planning to rescue Katrina. He decides that the only solution is to join the Varden in Surda, and so he convinces almost the entire village to travel there. The villagers reach Narda, where they pay for barges to sail to Teirm. In Teirm, Roran meets Jeod, Brom's friend, who tells him about Eragon and that he now is a Dragon Rider. Roran is stunned that his cousin is a Dragon Rider, and he asks Jeod for help to reach the Varden. Jeod decides to go with them and he gathers a group of his friends to steal a ship called the Dragon Wing. The villagers are chased by a group of Galbatorix's boats, but they force themselves into the gigantic whirlpool, the Boar's eye, so that they can trap the enemy ships.\n\nMeanwhile, Eragon arrives at the Varden's camp, who are under attack by an army of one hundred thousand of Galbatorix's soldiers. A group of Urgals join the Varden, and Eragon is able to repel the opposing army with help from the dwarves' reinforcements. Eventually, a Dragon Rider appears in favor of the Empire. The hostile Dragon Rider kills the dwarf king [[Hrothgar (Inheritance)|Hrothgar]], and soon begins to fight with Eragon. The Dragon Rider is soon unmasked by Eragon and is revealed to be Murtagh, his old friend. Murtagh tells Eragon that he was kidnapped and forced into loyalty by Galbatorix after a dragon hatched for him, whom he named Thorn. Murtagh outmatches Eragon, but shows mercy due to their old friendship. Before leaving, Murtagh reveals that Eragon is his brother, and takes Eragon's sword Zar'roc, which he believes to be his inheritance. Ultimately, Galbatorix's army is forced to retreat due to heavy losses, after the arrival of the dwarves and the villagers of Carvahall and the departure of Murtagh and Thorn. Roran manages to defeat the Twins by bashing them in the heads with his hammer, thus enhancing his title of Roran Stronghammer. In the end, Eragon reunites with Roran and Eragon decides to help Roran rescue Katrina from the Ra'zac in Dras-Leona.\n\n== Critical reaction ==\n''Eldest'' received generally negative reviews, and it was met with criticism similar to ''Eragon'' for its derivative nature. ''School Library Journal'' noted that ''Eldest'' lacked originality, but would still find reception among fans. It also acknowledged that themes of ''Eldest'' are based generally on the works of other writers.<ref name=\"Amazon\">{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/037582670X | title = Reviews of Eldest | work = Amazon.com | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref> ''BookBrowse'' also criticized ''Eldest'', but said, as ''School Library Journal'' noted, that nothing the reviewers can say will stop some children from reading the book.<ref name=\"BookBrowse\">{{cite web | url = http://www.bookbrowse.com/reviews/index.cfm?book_number=1636 | title = BookBrowse reviews of Eldest | work = BookBrowse | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref> ''Entertainment Weekly'' rated ''Eldest'' as one of the worst five books of 2005, calling it a \"700-page drag.\"<ref name=\"Weekly\">{{Cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1142746,00.html | title = Books: The 5 Worst | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate = 2007-09-23 | first=Jennifer | last=Reese | date=2005-12-22}}</ref> ''The Boston Globe'' gave a negative review for ''Eldest'', criticizing the very low points and for \"drama that rises to a wet pop.\"<ref name=\"BookBrowse\"/> ''The Christian Science Monitor'' gave ''Eldest'' a C+ grade.

The main reason of this was for its dull pace.

My own personal perspective is that until we sort of figure out what happens in the third book. Evidentially<!--sic-->, I asked Christopher... about that and he was not volunteering much of what was going to happen. I think it's very important to see where this ends up; how it's resolved. I think until you kind of have an understanding of what the third piece of that puzzle is, it's kind of hard to look at that second book, of course I read it, it's very much a transitional story element. I think one would be best off to write the third film first, and then, being happy with that, going back to the second one and doing all the set-up work that will pay off in the third. Then probably filming two and three together as they did with ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''; as one production.\"\n\nThat means, given the time frame, it might still be another year before there are actually are scripts for both films and these things can move ahead.

The story is the continued adventures of [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]] and his [[dragon (Inheritance)|dragon]] [[Saphira]], centering on their journey to the realm of the [[Ellesm\u00e9ra|Elves]] in order to further Eragon's training as a [[Dragon Rider (Inheritance Cycle)|Dragon Rider]]. Other plots in the story focus on [[Roran Garrowsson|Roran]], [[Eragon]]'s cousin, who leads the inhabitants of [[Carvahall]] to Surda to join the Varden, and [[Nasuada]] as she takes on her father's role as leader of the Varden. ''Eldest'' ends at the Battle of the Burning Plains, where Eragon faces a new Dragon Rider, Murtagh, and a new dragon, [[Thorn (Inheritance)|Thorn]].\n\nReviews pointed out the similarities between ''Eldest'' and other works such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref name=\"Amazon\"/> while praising the themes of the book, such as friendship and honor.<ref name=\"Themes\"/> Several of these reviews commented on the style and genre of ''Eldest'',<ref name=\"BookBrowse\"/> while others considered the possibility of a [[film adaptation]] similar to the first film.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/>\n\n== Plot synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Eldest'' begins three days after the events of the preceding novel, ''[[Eragon]]'', in the dwarf city of Tronjheim, inside of a hollowed mountain named [[Du Weldenvarden|Farthen D\u00fbr]]. Farthen D\u00fbr is in the southeastern part of [[Alaga\u00ebsia]], the fictional continent where the ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' takes place. Throughout the novel, the protagonists travel to many different places: Ellesm\u00e9ra, the elven capital city in the forest [[Du Weldenvarden]], on the northern portion of Alaga\u00ebsia; Carvahall, a small town located on the northwestern part of Alaga\u00ebsia in Palancar Valley; and Aberon, the capital of Surda, in the southern portion of Alaga\u00ebsia.\n\n=== Characters ===\n{{main|List of the Inheritance Cycle characters}}\nThe story is told in third-person through protagonists [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]], [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Major characters|Roran]], and [[Nasuada]]. Eragon is nearly always accompanied by his dragon [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Saphira|Saphira]]. Due to the multiple points-of-view, multiple stories take place concurrently, and the protagonist characters do not meet often. Several other characters return from ''[[Eragon]]'', including [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Major characters|Arya]] (the elf warrior, daughter of the elven queen), [[List of the Inheritance Cycle characters#Orik|Orik]], [[Roran]] (Eragon's cousin and a major character), [[Ajihad]] (the leader of the Varden, who dies and is replaced by his daughter Nasuada), and [[Angela (Inheritance)|Angela]] (the herbalist).  Some new characters are introduced in ''Eldest'', such as [[Oromis]] and his dragon [[Glaedr]]. [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Murtagh|Murtagh]] appears briefly as a minor protagonist but then reappears later as a primary antagonist with his dragon, [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Thorn|Thorn]].\n\n=== Plot summary ===\n''Eldest'' begins as [[Ajihad]], the king of the rebel Varden force, is ambushed and killed, with [[Characters in the Inheritance Cycle#Murtagh|Murtagh]] gone while The Twins and Murtagh are assumed dead. At his funeral, Ajihad's daughter [[Nasuada]] is elected to command the Varden. The protagonists Eragon and Saphira then decide to travel to the forest [[Du Weldenvarden]] to become trained as a [[Dragon Rider (Inheritance Cycle)|Dragon Rider]] by the elves. The dwarf king, Hrothgar, decides to adopt Eragon to his clan, '''[[Dwarf clans in Inheritance Cycle#D\u00fbrgrimst Ingeitum|D\u00fbrgrimst Ingeitum]]''', and have his now foster brother, Orik, accompany him to the forest. Once there, Eragon meets [[Oromis]], The Cripple Who Is Whole, and his Dragon [[Glaedr]], a dragon with a missing front leg, and the only Dragon and Rider secretly alive besides Eragon, Saphira and [[Galbatorix]] and his forcibly bonded dragon Shruikan. Oromis and Glaedr, however, are both crippled, and so cannot fight Galbatorix and must hide to avoid Galbatorix hunting them down. Eragon and Saphira are taught the use of logic, magic theory, scholarship, and combat, among other things.\n\nMeanwhile, Eragon's cousin Roran, is planning to marry Katrina, daughter of Sloan the butcher. While the village is at peace, they are unexpectedly attacked by Galbatorix's soldiers and the Ra'zac, the strangers who had killed Roran's father, Garrow. The village metalsmith, Horst, equips his sons along with Roran with equipment. Roran takes a hammer and attacks the soldiers. The Ra'zac and most of the soldiers escape, saying that they want information from Roran. The entire village then sets up defenses, and during a second invasion, the Ra'zac escape again. One night, Roran wakes up to find Katrina being attacked by the Ra'zac, who sneaked into the house. Roran then takes off the cloth around the Ra'zac's face and sees that they are monsters, not humans. A Ra'zac bites Roran, leaving a serious injury, and leave with Katrina captured. While Roran is chasing them, Sloan, the village butcher and Katrina's father, betrays the village and joins the Ra'zac. However, Roran sees Ra'zac striking Sloan before he falls unconscious. The Ra'zac escape with their steeds, the Lethrblaka, who were originally their parents.\n\nMeanwhile, Nasuada chooses to move the Varden from Tronjheim to Surda to mount an attack on the Empire. The Varden, who are effectively refugees, suffer financial troubles, until Nasuada learns that the magicians can create an expensive lace with magic, and sell it at extremely low rates. One night when Nasuada is in her room, a character named Elva saves her from an assassination attempt. Elva is enchanted, and locates the assailant, who is killed after unwillingly surrendering information to Varden magicians about a subversive group based in Surda called the Black Hand, who is plotting to kill Nasuada. Nasuada later attends a meeting with key figures in Surda's government to discuss a potential upcoming battle against the Empire. They learn that the conflict is coming sooner than they initially suspected, and mobilize forces to attack, as well as sending for help from the dwarves.\n\nIn the meantime, Eragon continues his training, but is discouraged when the scar on his back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya for most of the book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaet\u00ed Bl\u00f6dhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy of a poem he wrote and presented for the Agaet\u00ed Bl\u00f6dhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.\n\nMeanwhile, Roran is planning to rescue Katrina. He decides that the only solution is to join the Varden in Surda, and so he convinces almost the entire village to travel there. The villagers reach Narda, where they pay for barges to sail to Teirm. In Teirm, Roran meets Jeod, Brom's friend, who tells him about Eragon and that he now is a Dragon Rider. Roran is stunned that his cousin is a Dragon Rider, and he asks Jeod for help to reach the Varden. Jeod decides to go with them and he gathers a group of his friends to steal a ship called the Dragon Wing. The villagers are chased by a group of Galbatorix's boats, but they force themselves into the gigantic whirpool, the Boar's eye, so that they can trap the enemy ships.\n\nMeanwhile, Eragon arrives at the Varden's camp, who are under attack by an army of one hundred thousand of Galbatorix's soldiers. A group of Urgals join the Varden, and Eragon is able to repel the opposing army with help from the dwarves' reinforcements. Eventually, a Dragon Rider appears in favor of the Empire. The hostile Dragon Rider kills the dwarf king [[Hrothgar (Inheritance)|Hrothgar]], and soon begins to fight with Eragon. The Dragon Rider is soon unmasked by Eragon and is revealed to be Murtagh, his old friend. Murtagh tells Eragon that he was kidnapped and forced into loyalty by Galbatorix after a dragon hatched for him, whom he named Thorn. Murtagh outmatches Eragon, but shows mercy due to their old friendship. Before leaving, Murtagh reveals that Eragon is his brother, and takes Eragon's sword Zar'roc, which he believes to be his inheritance. Ultimately, Galbatorix's army is forced to retreat due to heavy losses, after the arrival of the dwarves and the villagers of Carvahall and the departure of Murtagh and Thorn. Roran manages to defeat the Twins by bashing them in the heads with his hammer, thus enhancing his title of Roran Stronghammer. In the end, Eragon reunites with Roran and Eragon decides to help Roran rescue Katrina from the Ra'zac in Dras-Leona.\n\n== Critical reaction ==\n''Eldest'' received generally negative reviews, and it was met with criticism similar to ''Eragon'' for its derivative nature. ''School Library Journal'' noted that ''Eldest'' lacked originality, but would still find reception among fans. It also acknowledged that themes of ''Eldest'' are based generally on the works of other writers.<ref name=\"Amazon\">{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/037582670X | title = Reviews of Eldest | work = Amazon.com | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref> ''BookBrowse'' also criticized ''Eldest'', but said, as ''School Library Journal'' noted, that nothing the reviewers can say will stop some children from reading the book.<ref name=\"BookBrowse\">{{cite web | url = http://www.bookbrowse.com/reviews/index.cfm?book_number=1636 | title = BookBrowse reviews of Eldest | work = BookBrowse | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref> ''Entertainment Weekly'' rated ''Eldest'' as one of the worst five books of 2005, calling it a \"700-page drag.\"<ref name=\"Weekly\">{{Cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1142746,00.html | title = Books: The 5 Worst | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate = 2007-09-23 | first=Jennifer | last=Reese | date=2005-12-22}}</ref> ''The Boston Globe'' gave a negative review for ''Eldest'', criticizing the very low points and for \"drama that rises to a wet pop.\"<ref name=\"BookBrowse\"/> ''The Christian Science Monitor'' gave ''Eldest'' a C+ grade.

The main reason of this was for its dull pace.

I think until you kind of have an understanding of what the third piece of that puzzle is, it's kind of hard to look at that second book, of course I read it, it's very much a transitional story element. I think one would be best off to write the third film first, and then, being happy with that, going back to the second one and doing all the set-up work that will pay off in the third. Then probably filming two and three together as they did with ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''; as one production.\"\n\nThat means, given the time frame, it might still be another year before there are actually are scripts for both films and these things can move ahead.

Both players hold an Italian citizenship as they have relatives that are Italian, allowing them to be eligible to play for Italy.

An Italian player deserves to play for the national team while someone who wasn't born in Italy, even if they have relatives, I don't think they deserve to.\" Conte's response to the use of foreign-born players was, \"If [[Mauro Camoranesi]] [who was born in Argentina] was allowed to help Italy win the 2006 World Cup, then why can't \u00c9der and Franco V\u00e1zquez lead the Azzurri to glory in next year's European Championship?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/italy/story/2363437/antonio-conte-defends-use-of-foreign-born-players-on-italy-squad|title=Antonio Conte defends use of foreign-born players on Italy squad|publisher=ESPN FC|date=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn late May 2016, Conte was criticised in the North American media for his omission of Andrea Pirlo and [[Sebastian Giovinco]] from Italy's 30-player shortlist for its Euro 2016 squad, and for his comments regarding the quality of their league, [[Major League Soccer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzettaworld.com/azzurri/mls-critical-conte-squad/?refresh_ce-cp|title=Conte criticised after MLS jibe|work=La Gazzetta dello Sport|first=Niall|last=Mooney|date=26 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}</ref> Conte had stated in a press conference, \"When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/italy/story/2879294/andrea-pirlo-and-sebastian-giovinco-omitted-from-italy-squad-due-to-mls-play-antonio-conte|title=MLS play cost Andrea Pirlo, Sebastian Giovinco their Italy chance \u2013 Conte|publisher=ESPN FC|first=Ben|last=Gladwell|date=24 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 2016, while his team were leading 4\u20130 against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], Conte waved up the home crowd, asking them to make more noise to support Chelsea. However, media reports claimed his actions were meant to antagonise Mourinho and humiliate the visiting team. Conte refuted these claims, saying, \"I've been a player too and I know how to behave. I always show great respect for everyone, including Manchester United. There was no incident, it was just a normal thing to do. I wasn't mocking anyone, I wouldn't do that.

It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within [[American English]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Michael |year=2005 |chapter=New York Talk |title=American Voices |editor1-first=Walt |editor1-last=Wolfram |editor2-first=Ben |editor2-last=Ward |pages=82\u201387 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-2109-5}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional New York area accent is characterized as [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], so that the sound {{IPA|[\u0279]}} does not appear at the end of a [[syllable]] or immediately before a [[consonant]]; therefore the pronunciation of the city name as \"New Yawk.\"<ref name=NYT19930214/> There is no {{IPA|[\u0279]}} in words like ''park'' {{IPA|[p\u0251\u0259k]}} or {{IPA|[p\u0252\u0259k]}} (with vowel backed and [[vowel breaking|diphthongized]] due to the low-back chain shift), ''butter'' {{IPA|[b\u028c\u027e\u0259]}}, or ''here'' {{IPA|[hi\u0259]}}. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[\u0254]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[\u0254r]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]] English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like \"girl\" and of words like \"oil\" became a diphthong {{IPA|[\u025c\u026a]}}. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced \"goil\" and ''oil'' is pronounced \"erl\"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like \"Joizey\" (Jersey), \"Toidy-Toid Street\" (33rd St.) and \"terlet\" (toilet).<ref name=NYT19930214/> The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s [[sitcom|television sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]'' was an example of having used this pattern of speech.\n\nThe classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on [[middle class|middle]] and working-class New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,<ref name=NYT19930214/> and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as it has been in the past.<ref name=\"NYT19930214\">{{cite news |last=Sontag |first=Deborah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D61438F937A25751C0A965958260 |title=Oy Gevalt!

In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[\u0254]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[\u0254r]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]] English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like \"girl\" and of words like \"oil\" became a diphthong {{IPA|[\u025c\u026a]}}. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced \"goil\" and ''oil'' is pronounced \"erl\"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like \"Joizey\" (Jersey), \"Toidy-Toid Street\" (33rd St.) and \"terlet\" (toilet).<ref name=NYT19930214/> The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s [[sitcom|television sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]'' was an example of having used this pattern of speech.\n\nThe classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on [[middle class|middle]] and working-class New Yorkers.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 17 October 2015. It is written by [[Jamie Mathieson]] and [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by [[Edward Bazalgette|Ed Bazalgette]].\n\nIn the episode, the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) have 24 hours to train a group of weak [[Viking]] villagers for a war against aliens called the Mire shortly after the Mire slaughtered all of the village's warriors and a woman called [[Ashildr]] ([[Maisie Williams]]) subsequently declared war.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] are taken to a village by some [[Viking]]s. The Doctor claims to be [[Odin]], but the villagers are not fooled. Suddenly, a figure of Odin appears in the sky, offering to take the warriors to [[Valhalla]], and a squad of warriors in armoured suits materialise, shooting the warriors with weapons that appear to disintegrate them. Clara and [[Ashildr]], a woman from the village, are also struck. The squad soon disappears.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30855131741).jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Mire, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nClara and Ashildr find themselves on a spacecraft with the other Vikings. The men are killed and drained of their adrenaline and testosterone, while Clara and Ashildr meet Odin, the leader of the Mire species that pride themselves on their merciless conquests. Before Clara can stop her, Ashildr declares war on the Mire, and Odin grants them 24 hours to prepare. On Earth, Clara brings the Doctor up to speed. He recognises the villagers are too weak to fight, and devises a plan using Ashildr's storytelling skills and a supply of [[electric eel]]s.\n\nWhen the Mire arrive, they find the villagers celebrating. The Mire's confusion gives the Doctor time to stun them with electricity and pull one of the helmets off with an [[electromagnet]]. The Doctor modifies this and has Ashildr wear it, allowing her to envision an articulated puppet as a dragon, which is broadcast to the other Mire and scares them off. Odin vows to attack again, but the Doctor threatens to send video footage of the [[rout]] captured by Clara's phone to the universe unless they leave Earth. Odin and the Mire peacefully depart.\n\nThe village celebrates its victory until they find Ashildr died from the helmet's use. The Doctor is frustrated until he remembers why he took the form of Caecilius:{{refn|group=N|A sculptor from [[Pompeii]] whose life is saved by the [[Tenth Doctor]] in the 2008 episode \"[[The Fires of Pompeii]]\"}} to always save someone, no matter what. He \"breaks the rules\" and modifies two chips from the Mire's helmets, one which he implants in Ashildr, and the other he gives to her father for later use. The chip rapidly regenerates Ashildr's body and she regains consciousness.\n\nAs they leave, the Doctor tells Clara he fears he gave Ashildr a fate worse than death as the chip will never fail, effectively making her immortal and alone. He provided the second chip in hope she would give it to one she cares for.\n\n===Continuity===\nAfter meeting the Vikings, the Doctor produces a yo-yo in an attempt to impress them with \"magic\". A former companion, [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]], believes a yo-yo is magical when the [[Fourth Doctor]] provides her one to play with (''[[The Robots of Death]]'', 1977).

He further went on to say that the episode \"taps into a very traditional vein but again slyly transcends it, and achieves that holy grail of TV drama \u2013 unpredictability\", also claiming that \"everything that is meant to be funny is funny and the sad moments are sad\", while praising the episode's direction as \"impeccable\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mulkern|first1=Patrick|title=The Girl Who Died review: Maisie Williams and the Vikings conquer Doctor Who|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-17/the-girl-who-died-review-maisie-williams-and-the-vikings-conquer-doctor-who|website=Radio Times|publisher=Patrick Mulkern|accessdate=18 October 2015}}</ref> Scott Collura of [[IGN]] also lavished praise onto the episode, awarding it a score of 8.8/10, deemed by the site as \"great\".

He summarised his review by stating \"Doctor Who continues its strong season with the much-anticipated arrival of Maisie Williams as \"The Girl Who Died.\" While the revelation of who her character actually is may come as something of a letdown for longtime fans, the episode itself and its bigger thematic touches more than make up for that\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> Catherine Gee of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' also enjoyed the episode, calling it \"fast paced\" and claiming that it \"set up all the right ingredients for something big next week\".

He called the episode \"fantastically funny whenever it wants to be\", but also heavily praised the subplot of the Doctor's face, calling the reveal \"wonderfully simple\". He closed his review by labeling the episode \"a damn triumph. More than that, it's a triumph because it feels so resolutely like a ''Doctor Who'' episode\", and stated that the episode \"remembers that what motivates the Doctor's decisions are fundamentally the same emotions that we all feel, and that's what makes this such a brilliant hour of television\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Morgan Jeffery of [[Digital Spy]] also praised the episode, calling it \"unlike anything you've seen before\". He called the episode \"fast-paced, with sharp, funny dialogue and some great clowning from Peter Capaldi\" and further praising Williams' as \"nicely ethereal in the part, without ever overplaying the character's enigmatic nature\". He closed his review by saying \"while Doctor Who shouldn't be like this every week, the show's boundless variety has always been its biggest selling point, and it's refreshing to see 'The Girl Who Died' break the mould and dare to be entirely unpredictable and different\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nKaite Welsh of ''[[IndieWire]]'' also acclaimed the episode, awarding it an A++ grade, the highest score available. She said that the episode marked the \"fifth stellar episode in a row\", and that it represented \"the show doing historical episodes as they're meant to be done.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 17 October 2015. It is written by [[Jamie Mathieson]] and [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by [[Edward Bazalgette|Ed Bazalgette]].\n\nIn the episode, the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) have 24 hours to train a group of weak [[Viking]] villagers for a war against aliens called the Mire shortly after the Mire slaughtered all of the village's warriors and a woman called [[Ashildr]] ([[Maisie Williams]]) subsequently declared war.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] are taken to a village by some [[Viking]]s. The Doctor claims to be [[Odin]], but the villagers are not fooled. Suddenly, a figure of Odin appears in the sky, offering to take the warriors to [[Valhalla]], and a squad of warriors in armoured suits materialise, shooting the warriors with weapons that appear to disintegrate them. Clara and [[Ashildr]], a woman from the village, are also struck. The squad soon disappears.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30855131741).jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Mire, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nClara and Ashildr find themselves on a spacecraft with the other Vikings. The men are killed and drained of their adrenaline and testosterone, while Clara and Ashildr meet Odin, the leader of the Mire species that pride themselves on their merciless conquests. Before Clara can stop her, Ashildr declares war on the Mire, and Odin grants them 24 hours to prepare. On Earth, Clara brings the Doctor up to speed. He recognises the villagers are too weak to fight, and devises a plan using Ashildr's storytelling skills and a supply of [[electric eel]]s.\n\nWhen the Mire arrive, they find the villagers celebrating. The Mire's confusion gives the Doctor time to stun them with electricity and pull one of the helmets off with an [[electromagnet]]. The Doctor modifies this and has Ashildr wear it, allowing her to envision an articulated puppet as a dragon, which is broadcast to the other Mire and scares them off. Odin vows to attack again, but the Doctor threatens to send video footage of the [[rout]] captured by Clara's phone to the universe unless they leave Earth. Odin and the Mire peacefully depart.\n\nThe village celebrates its victory until they find Ashildr died from the helmet's use. The Doctor is frustrated until he remembers why he took the form of Caecilius:{{refn|group=N|A sculptor from [[Pompeii]] whose life is saved by the [[Tenth Doctor]] in the 2008 episode \"[[The Fires of Pompeii]]\"}} to always save someone, no matter what. He \"breaks the rules\" and modifies two chips from the Mire's helmets, one which he implants in Ashildr, and the other he gives to her father for later use. The chip rapidly regenerates Ashildr's body and she regains consciousness.\n\nAs they leave, the Doctor tells Clara he fears he gave Ashildr a fate worse than death as the chip will never fail, effectively making her immortal and alone. He provided the second chip in hope she would give it to one she cares for.\n\n===Continuity===\nAfter meeting the Vikings, the Doctor produces a yo-yo in an attempt to impress them with \"magic\". A former companion, [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]], believes a yo-yo is magical when the [[Fourth Doctor]] provides her one to play with (''[[The Robots of Death]]'', 1977).

He summarised his review by stating \"Doctor Who continues its strong season with the much-anticipated arrival of Maisie Williams as \"The Girl Who Died.\" While the revelation of who her character actually is may come as something of a letdown for longtime fans, the episode itself and its bigger thematic touches more than make up for that\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> Catherine Gee of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' also enjoyed the episode, calling it \"fast paced\" and claiming that it \"set up all the right ingredients for something big next week\".

He called the episode \"fantastically funny whenever it wants to be\", but also heavily praised the subplot of the Doctor's face, calling the reveal \"wonderfully simple\". He closed his review by labeling the episode \"a damn triumph. More than that, it's a triumph because it feels so resolutely like a ''Doctor Who'' episode\", and stated that the episode \"remembers that what motivates the Doctor's decisions are fundamentally the same emotions that we all feel, and that's what makes this such a brilliant hour of television\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Morgan Jeffery of [[Digital Spy]] also praised the episode, calling it \"unlike anything you've seen before\". He called the episode \"fast-paced, with sharp, funny dialogue and some great clowning from Peter Capaldi\" and further praising Williams' as \"nicely ethereal in the part, without ever overplaying the character's enigmatic nature\". He closed his review by saying \"while Doctor Who shouldn't be like this every week, the show's boundless variety has always been its biggest selling point, and it's refreshing to see 'The Girl Who Died' break the mould and dare to be entirely unpredictable and different\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nKaite Welsh of ''[[IndieWire]]'' also acclaimed the episode, awarding it an A++ grade, the highest score available. She said that the episode marked the \"fifth stellar episode in a row\", and that it represented \"the show doing historical episodes as they're meant to be done.
