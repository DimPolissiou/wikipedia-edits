She waits, wondering who it may be.\n\nA smuggling van carrying a ton of drugs and a group of smugglers are captured by Inspector Bejoy and his team. The drugs belong to Adaikalam, who none of the police officers have seen nor know how he looks. Adaikalam's brother Anbu plans to capture the five police officials, kill them, and take their drugs back from them. He announces a group of henchmen to kill the five police men and assured lifetime settlement for them. According to Anbu's plan, all of the police officials in the city get high and unconscious after consuming poisoned drinks at a higher official's retirement party. Bejoy, who avoided the drinks as he was under medication, escapes from the plan and tries to save the lives of all the unconscious officials without letting the media or anyone else from the outside finding out. He convinces Dilli, an ex-prisoner who happened to be there with him as he was detained for looking suspicious (and being the only one who can drive the lorry) to help him save the officers' lives by promising him that he will help him meet his daughter Amudha for the first time the next morning with the help of a lorry borrowed from Kamatchi, a caterer at the Inspector General of Police's mansion. As Kamatchi has good knowledge of routes and roads, Dilli tells him to come with them as well. Dilli, Bejoy, and Kamatchi together load the unconscious bodies of the officials onto the lorry and get them to the hospital as soon as possible without letting the gangsters get their bodies.\n\nAs Anbu enlists money as the reward for catching the policemen, gangsters from Anbu's gangs try to hunt down where the policemen and Bejoy are. They are guided by Paalpandi, a corrupt cop (recruited by Stephen Raj, Zonal Head of Narcotics Division working for Anbu) who is acting unconscious while giving information about the location of the lorry to the gangs.\n\nMeanwhile, at commissioner's office, the drugs are hidden along with Adaikalam's men who are under custody. As Anbu and his gang would take the drugs and free Adaikalam's men, Bejoy orders constable Napoleon and a group of college students detained due to drunken driving, to close all the possible exits and to try and keep the gangsters outside the commisoner's office at the cost of their own lives while they wait for higher officials.\n\nDilli, Bejoy and Kamatchi come across the various gangs, who are fighting for who will capture the five policemen, only to be killed by Dilli. Back at the building Napoleon is told by Bejoy to negotiate a deal with the captured men of Adaikalam to call Anbu, and inform him that Napoleon will release the men in return they go away and leave him and the students unharmed. But it is then revealed that Adaikalam is among those who are captured, so they don't release them. Adaikalam tries to guide Anbu into the commissioner's office, but one of the students purposely blasts loud music to keep him from hearing Adaikalam. Anbu manages to climb up to the roof and break into the building, but he is subdued by the students and tied up.\n\nDilli and Kamatchi manage to transfer the unconscious officers to a school bus from the hospital, so that they can continue to the commissoner's office. Paalpandi then convinces them that he is alright, so they take him with them. However, they come across another gang who beats up Bejoy and Paalpandi stabs Dilli twice in the back. Dilli still manages to kill Paalpandi and the gangsters, while rescuing Bejoy and proceeding to the building. Anbu's gang outside the building manage to catch a student, and under the order of Anbu, they kill him. Napoleon bludgeons and kills Anbu with a fire extinguisher, to which Adaikalam swears he will kill all of them and their families. Dilli, Bejoy and Kamatchi make it to the building. Dilli alone enters the building through a secret underground passage and sends the students out through the secret passage, while he and Napoleon go to burn up all the drugs.The Duo reach the drug stored room, but to their surprise they also find a confiscated high power Gatling gun. Instead of just burning the drugs, Napolean decide to eliminate all the drug dealing rowdies. They reach the ground floor as the goons break in. Dilli uses the gun to kill nearly all of Anbu's gang outside the building. All the police are resuscitated and Bejoy finds the moles in his department. Stephen raj is incriminated and all injured are moved to the Government Hospital overnight. Bejoy thanks Dilli, and promises him that he will soon arrange a good life for him and his daughter. The Doctor from Dilli\u2018s prison brings Dilli\u2019s daughter Amudha to the spot, and they meet with tears of joy. Dilli, Amudha and Kamatchi leave for Dilli\u2019s village.\n\nOne of the captured men tells Adaikalam that Dilli, who had no connection with the gangs, was the prime reason for all of their losses, to which Adaikalam responds by saying that he does, leaving open the possibility for a sequel.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Karthi]] as Dilli\n* [[Narain (actor)|Narain]] as Inspector Bejoy\n* [[Dheena (actor)|Dheena]] as Kamatchi<!--Dheena is credited after Narain and before George Maryan, let's keep it this way.-->\n* [[George Maryan]] as Constable Napoleon\n* [[Arjun Das]] as Anbu\n* [[Ramana (actor)|Ramana]] as Tips (member of Anbu's gang)\n* [[Harish Uthaman]] as Adaikalam\n* [[Hareesh Peradi]] as Stephen Raj\n* [[Malavika Avinash]] as Nalini, Probation officer at Puzhal Jail\n* \"Black Sheep\" Deepthi as Thamizh \n* Baby Monica as Amudha, Dilli's daughter\n* Kanna Ravi as Ajhas Ahmed\n* [[Amzath Khan]] as Ram\n* [[Krishnamoorthy (actor)|Krishnamoorthy]] as Muthu\n* [[Chetan (actor)|Chetan]] as Dr. Amudhan\n* Arun Alexander as Paalpandi\n* [[Vatsan Chakravarthy]] as a college student\n* Lallu as a college student\n* Udayaraj as a college student\n* Kishore Rajkumar as a college student\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Lokesh Kanagaraj]], initially chose [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] to play the lead role.

She waits, wondering who it may be.\n\nA smuggling van carrying a ton of drugs and a group of smugglers are captured by Inspector Bejoy and his team. The drugs belong to Adaikalam, who none of the police officers have seen nor know how he looks. Adaikalam's brother Anbu plans to capture the five police officials, kill them, and take their drugs back from them. He announces a group of henchmen to kill the five police men and assured lifetime settlement for them. According to Anbu's plan, all of the police officials in the city get high and unconscious after consuming poisoned drinks at a higher official's retirement party. Bejoy, who avoided the drinks as he was under medication, escapes from the plan and tries to save the lives of all the unconscious officials without letting the media or anyone else from the outside finding out. He convinces Dilli, an ex-prisoner who happened to be there with him as he was detained for looking suspicious (and being the only one who can drive the lorry) to help him save the officers' lives by promising him that he will help him meet his daughter Amudha for the first time the next morning with the help of a lorry borrowed from Kamatchi, a caterer at the Inspector General of Police's mansion. As Kamatchi has good knowledge of routes and roads, Dilli tells him to come with them as well. Dilli, Bejoy, and Kamatchi together load the unconscious bodies of the officials onto the lorry and get them to the hospital as soon as possible without letting the gangsters get their bodies.\n\nAs Anbu enlists money as the reward for catching the policemen, gangsters from Anbu's gangs try to hunt down where the policemen and Bejoy are. They are guided by Paalpandi, a corrupt cop (recruited by Stephen Raj, Zonal Head of Narcotics Division working for Anbu) who is acting unconscious while giving information about the location of the lorry to the gangs.\n\nMeanwhile, at commissioner's office, the drugs are hidden along with Adaikalam's men who are under custody. As Anbu and his gang would take the drugs and free Adaikalam's men, Bejoy orders constable Napoleon and a group of college students detained due to drunken driving, to close all the possible exits and to try and keep the gangsters outside the commisoner's office at the cost of their own lives while they wait for higher officials.\n\nDilli, Bejoy and Kamatchi come across the various gangs, who are fighting for who will capture the five policemen, only to be killed by Dilli. Back at the building Napoleon is told by Bejoy to negotiate a deal with the captured men of Adaikalam to call Anbu, and inform him that Napoleon will release the men in return they go away and leave him and the students unharmed. But it is then revealed that Adaikalam is among those who are captured, so they don't release them. Adaikalam tries to guide Anbu into the commissioner's office, but one of the students purposely blasts loud music to keep him from hearing Adaikalam. Anbu manages to climb up to the roof and break into the building, but he is subdued by the students and tied up.\n\nDilli and Kamatchi manage to transfer the unconscious officers to a school bus from the hospital, so that they can continue to the commissoner's office. Paalpandi then convinces them that he is alright, so they take him with them. However, they come across another gang who beats up Bejoy and Paalpandi stabs Dilli twice in the back. Dilli still manages to kill Paalpandi and the gangsters, while rescuing Bejoy and proceeding to the building. Anbu's gang outside the building manage to catch a student, and under the order of Anbu, they kill him. Napoleon bludgeons and kills Anbu with a fire extinguisher, to which Adaikalam swears he will kill all of them and their families. Dilli, Bejoy and Kamatchi make it to the building. Dilli alone enters the building through a secret underground passage and sends the students out through the secret passage, while he and Napoleon go to burn up all the drugs.The Duo reach the drug stored room, but to their surprise they also find a confiscated high power Gatling gun. Instead of just burning the drugs, Napolean decide to eliminate all the drug dealing rowdies. They reach the ground floor as the goons break in. Dilli uses the gun to kill nearly all of Anbu's gang outside the building. All the police are resuscitated and Bejoy finds the moles in his department. Stephen raj is incriminated and all injured are moved to the Government Hospital overnight. Bejoy thanks Dilli, and promises him that he will soon arrange a good life for him and his daughter. The Doctor from Dilli\u2018s prison brings Dilli\u2019s daughter Amudha to the spot, and they meet with tears of joy. Dilli, Amudha and Kamatchi leave for Dilli\u2019s village.\n\nOne of the captured men tells Adaikalam that Dilli, who had no connection with the gangs, was the prime reason for all of their losses, to which Adaikalam responds by saying that he does, leaving open the possibility for a sequel.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Karthi]] as Dilli\n* [[Narain (actor)|Narain]] as Inspector Bejoy\n* [[Dheena (actor)|Dheena]] as Kamatchi<!--Dheena is credited after Narain and before George Maryan, let's keep it this way.-->\n* [[George Maryan]] as Constable Napoleon\n* [[Arjun Das]] as Anbu\n* [[Ramana (actor)|Ramana]] as Tips (member of Anbu's gang)\n* [[Harish Uthaman]] as Adaikalam\n* [[Hareesh Peradi]] as Stephen Raj\n* [[Malavika Avinash]] as Nalini, Probation officer at Puzhal Jail\n* \"Black Sheep\" Deepthi as Thamizh \n* Baby Monica as Amudha, Dilli's daughter\n* Kanna Ravi as Ajhas Ahmed\n* [[Amzath Khan]] as Ram\n* [[Krishnamoorthy (actor)|Krishnamoorthy]] as Muthu\n* [[Chetan (actor)|Chetan]] as Dr. Amudhan\n* Arun Alexander as Paalpandi\n* [[Vatsan Chakravarthy]] as a college student\n* Lallu as a college student\n* Udayaraj as a college student\n* Kishore Rajkumar as a college student\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Lokesh Kanagaraj]], initially chose [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] to play the lead role.

Highlighted are the [[Nucleobase|nucleobases]] (green) and the ribose-phosphate backbone (blue). This is a single strand of RNA that folds back upon itself. ]]\n\n'''Ribonucleic acid''' ('''RNA''') is a [[polymer]]ic molecule essential in various biological roles in [[Genetic code|coding]], [[Translation (biology)|decoding]], [[Regulatory RNA|regulation]] and [[RNA splicing|expression]] of [[gene]]s. RNA and [[DNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s, and, along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s, constitute the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the [[nucleobase|nitrogenous bases]] of [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].\n\nSome RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on [[ribosome]]s. This process uses [[transfer RNA]] ('''''tRNA''''') molecules to deliver [[amino acid]]s to the ribosome, where [[ribosomal RNA]] ('''''rRNA''''') then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.\n\n==Comparison with DNA==\n[[File:50S-subunit of the ribosome 3CC2.png|thumb|Three-dimensional representation of the [[50S]] ribosomal subunit.

RNA and [[DNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s, and, along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s, constitute the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the [[nucleobase|nitrogenous bases]] of [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].\n\nSome RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on [[ribosome]]s. This process uses [[transfer RNA]] ('''''tRNA''''') molecules to deliver [[amino acid]]s to the ribosome, where [[ribosomal RNA]] ('''''rRNA''''') then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.\n\n==Comparison with DNA==\n[[File:50S-subunit of the ribosome 3CC2.png|thumb|Three-dimensional representation of the [[50S]] ribosomal subunit.

The experimental [[British Rail APT-E|APT-E]] achieved a new British railway speed record on 10 August 1975 when it reached {{convert|152.3|mph}}, only to be bested by the service prototype [[British Rail Class 370|APT-P]] at {{convert|162.2|mph}} in December 1979, a record that stood for 23 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDevelopment of the service prototypes dragged on, and by the late 1970s the design had been under construction for a decade and the trains were still not ready for service. The election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] brought matters to a head and she alluded to funding cuts for the project. Facing the possibility of cancellation, BR management decided to put the prototypes into service, with the first runs along the [[London]]-[[Glasgow]] route taking place in December 1981. The result was a [[media circus]] when every problem large or small received front-page coverage and the entire project derided as an example of BR's incompetence. The trains were withdrawn from service again by the end of the month, to the great amusement of the press.\n\nThe problems were eventually solved and the trains quietly reintroduced in 1984 with much greater success. By this time the competing [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]], powered by a conventional diesel engine and lacking the APT's tilt and performance, had gone through development and testing at a rapid rate and was now forming the backbone of BR's passenger service. All support for the APT project collapsed as anyone in authority distanced themselves from what was being derided as a failure. Plans for a production version, APT-S, were abandoned, and the three APT-Ps ran for just over a year before being withdrawn again over the winter of 1985/6. Two of the three sets were broken up, and parts of the third sent to the [[National Railway Museum]] where it joined the APT-E. The patents for the APT's tilt system were sold to [[Fiat Ferroviaria]].\n\nIn spite of the APT's troubled history, the design was highly influential and directly inspired other successful trains. The considerable work on electrification that was carried out hand-in-hand with APT was put to good use with newer non-tilting designs like the [[British Rail Class 91]]. More recently, the APT's tilt system was returned to the WCML on the [[British Rail Class 390]], based on the Fiat car design and built by [[Alstom]]. Other features pioneered on APT, such as the [[hydrokinetic brake|hydrokinetic braking]] used to stop the train within existing separations, have not been adopted.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|British Rail APT-E|British Rail Class 370}}\n{{See also|InterCity 125|British Rail Classes 253, 254 and 255}}\n\n[[File:Driving cab of Advanced Passenger Train.jpg|thumb|right|Driving controls of the Advanced Passenger Train (APT-P) at [[Crewe Heritage Centre]].]]\n\n=== BR research ===\n[[File:GBR rail passengers by year 1830-2015.png|thumb|360px|The period after nationalisation was marked with rapidly falling ridership levels.]]\n\nFollowing nationalisation of the UK's railways in 1948, [[British Rail]] faced significant losses in passengers as the car rapidly became more popular through the 1950s and 60s. By 1970, passenger numbers were roughly half what they had been immediately before [[World War II]]. In an attempt to maintain some level of profitability, the government commissioned a report that resulted in the abandonment of many lines as part of the 1963 \"[[Beeching cuts|Beeching Axe]]\". In spite of this significant restructuring, the company was still built on lines that were pre-war, with routings dating into the 1800s. Maintaining the network was a constant problem and derailments became increasingly common.\n\nIn 1962 Dr. Sydney Jones was hired away from the weapons department at [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|R.A.E. Farnborough]] with the eventual aim of having him take over as BR's research lead from Colin Ingles, who retired in 1964.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=19}} Looking into the derailment problem, they found that much of the problem could be traced to a problem known as [[hunting oscillation]]. This was well known in the railway world, but tended to happen only at high speeds. On the BR network, especially on freight cars with worn wheels, it was being seen at speeds as low as {{convert|20|mph}}.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=20}} Jones was convinced that hunting oscillation was an effect similar to the problem of [[aeroelastic flutter]] encountered in [[aerodynamics]], and decided to hire someone from the aeronautics field to investigate it.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=19}}\n\nIn October 1962, Alan Wickens was given the position. Wickens was a dynamics expert who had previously worked at [[Armstrong Whitworth]] on the [[Sea Slug (missile)|Sea Slug missile]] and then for a period at [[Canadair]] in Montreal before returning to the UK and joining the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel missile]] project.{{efn|The National Railway Museum site has the section header entitled \"Blue Streak\", a contemporary weapon system, but the text clearly states he worked on Blue Steel.}} When the follow-on Blue Steel II was cancelled in favour of the US designed [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]], Wickens left [[Avro|A. V. Roe]] because he \"saw the writing on the wall\". He answered an ad for BR, and during the interview he replied that he had no knowledge of, and little interest in, railway bogie design. It was later revealed this was the reason he was hired.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}\n\nOver the next several years, Wickens' team carried out what is considered to be the most detailed study of the dynamics of steel wheels on rails ever conducted. Starting with incomplete work by F.W. Carter from 1930, the team studied conventional two-axle bogies and quickly discovered that, as Jones had suspected, the problem was dynamic instability. Out of this work came the concept of a critical speed at which point hunting would become a problem.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} This work was then extended to the unique two-axle bogieless car designs used on the BR freight network, where the problem was further modified by the dynamics of the entire vehicle.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=19}}\n\nWickens concluded that a properly damped suspension system could eliminate the problem, and set about to demonstrate this. By 1964 this work had produced the first [[High Speed Freight Vehicle]], HSFV-1, a bogieless freight car capable of travelling safely at speeds up to {{convert|140|mph|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} The same work suggested there was no practical upper limit to the achievable speeds in terms of dynamics, and that any limitations on maximum performance would be due to other factors like traction or wear on the lines. Eventually a series of six HSFV designs would be tested until 1976,{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=36}} and the last, HSFV-6, entered service that year.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=37}}\n\n===Cant and tilting trains===\n[[File:Railway superelevation at Dunbar, July 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Superelevation was applied to portions of the BR network, although the angle was limited. Here, a [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]], based on APT technology, rounds a canted turn on the [[East Coast Main Line]].]]\n\nDuring this period, BR's Passenger Business division produced a report suggesting rail could compete with road and air, but only if trains were faster. Studying the increase in ridership due to the introduction of the [[British Rail Class 55]] \"Deltic\" engines on the [[East Coast Main Line]], and the effects of electrification on the WCML which improved journey times 20 to 30%, they concluded that every {{convert|1|mph}} increase in speed would result in a 1% increase in passengers. This basic rule was apparently proven in Japan, when the Tokyo-Osaka [[shinkansen]] line was operating from 1964 to huge success.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\nThe shinkansen provided a smooth ride at speeds as high as {{convert|125|mph|0|abbr=on}} by laying new lines dedicated to high speed travel. BR's most used route, the WCML, had in the order of 6 million passengers a year between [[London]] and [[Manchester]],{{Dubious|date=April 2018}} a far cry from the Tokyo-Osaka's 120 million. Funding for a new line for high speed use was highly unlikely given these passenger levels.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} This presented a problem for any sort of high-speed operation on the route because the existing line contained many turns and curves, and rounding these at high speed would cause lateral forces that would make walking difficult, and throw items off tables onto the floor.\n\nOne solution to this problem is to tilt the rails into the turns, an effect known as ''[[superelevation]]''. This has the effect of making the lateral forces more inline with the floor, reducing sideways forces. The problem is that this approach only matches the forces perfectly at a single speed; traffic moving slower than the design speed would feel as if it is tipping over into the inside of the turn, while those moving faster than the design speed would still feel leftover centrifugal force. Long experience had shown that the maximum amount of ''cant'' applied to lines with mixed traffic was 6.5 degrees, which would be effective at speeds into the {{convert|100|mph|0|abbr=on}} range, but began to demonstrate [[cant deficiency]] at speeds above {{convert|125|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marquis |first=Brian |title=Cant Deficiency, Curving Speeds and Tilt |publisher=US DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center |url=http://www.highspeed-rail.org/Documents/PRIIA%20305%20DocSpec%20and%20other%20NGEC%20Documents/305%20PRIIA%20Tilt%20presentation.pdf |accessdate=29 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929162445/http://www.highspeed-rail.org/Documents/PRIIA%20305%20DocSpec%20and%20other%20NGEC%20Documents/305%20PRIIA%20Tilt%20presentation.pdf |archive-date=29 September 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe other solution to this problem is to have the train car bodies tilt instead of the rails. [[Talgo]] introduced the first practical design for a tilting carriage in the late 1950s. This consisted of a single bogie placed between the train cars with the car bodies suspended from an A-frame centered on the bogie with a pivot near the top. When the train rounded a bend, the centrifugal forces caused the car body to swing out like a pendulum, reaching the proper tilt angle naturally. However, this system had a distinct delay between entering the curve and the body swinging out, and then swung past this angle and then oscillated briefly until settling at the right angle. When traversing a series of curves, like in a switchyard, it tended to swing about alarmingly. Although a number of semi-experimental designs of the 1970s made use of it, like the [[UAC TurboTrain]], the concept was not widely used.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n===APT's origins===\nIn 1964, a number of BR's formerly dispersed research groups were organised into the new [[British Rail Research Division|Derby Research Division]]. It was here that the final work on Wickens' HSFV was being developed.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=28}}\n\nIn 1965, Wickens had hired an intern, Dutch engineer A.J. Ispeert, and had him do some early work on active tilt systems.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}} These would replace the passive pendulum-like Talgo system with a system using [[hydraulic cylinder]]s that would quickly drive the car to the proper angle and hold it there without any swinging. A major advantage for BR use was that the center of rotation could be through the middle of the car, instead of the top, meaning the total movement would fit within the smaller British [[loading gauge]].{{sfn|Wickens|2002}} Ispeert returned a report on the concept in August 1966.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=28}}\n\nWickens noted that BR's single-axle suspension system would have less drag at high speed, and that its lighter weight would make it more stable at high speeds than conventional dual-axle bogies. In November 1966 he wrote a report calling for a two-year programme to build and test a High Speed Passenger Vehicle,{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=28}} essentially an experimental car like [[High Speed Freight Vehicle|HSFV-1]] but for passenger use instead of freight. The original plans called for a single dummy body and two bogies to test the suspension and tilting system at high speed. They set the maximum tilt angle at 9 degrees, which could be added to any cant in the underlying railbed.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}\n\nThe design programme was organised under Mike Newman, while Alastair Gilchrist headed the research side. Newman noted that a single car was unlikely to answer practical questions like how the train would operate as a complete unit, and that a dummy body would not answer the question of whether the tilt mechanism could really be built under the floor without projecting into the cabin. Accordingly, later that same November, Newman and Wickens drew up plans for a complete experimental train with the design goal to be not only to study the tilt system, but do so on actual lines.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=28}}\n\nWickens took the plans to Sydney Jones, who immediately took up the idea. They set the performance goal at the nicely rounded figure of {{convert|250|kph|0|abbr=on}}. In keeping with BR management goals to provide quicker travel times rather than just faster speeds, they also required the train to round corners 40% faster.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=29}} They named the proposal the Advanced Passenger Train. Jones took the proposal to the BR chairman, Stanley Raymond, who liked the idea. However, the board was unable to provide enough funding to develop it, and encouraged Jones to approach the [[Ministry of Transport (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Transport]] for additional funding.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}\n\nJones did so, and spent the next two years walking the corridors of [[Whitehall]] when one civil servant after another agreed that it was a great idea but that it was really the job of someone else to approve it. In spite of being repeatedly put off, Jones persisted, especially with Government Chief Scientist, [[Solly Zuckerman]],{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} to arrange a stable funding system for the entire topic of railway research. This was finalised as the Joint Programme between the Ministry of Transport and the British Railways Board, sharing the costs 50:50. The Programme would run sixteen years from January 1969 to March 1985. The first two programmes were APT and the Train Control Project.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sam |last=Wise |title=British Railways Research, the first hundred years |url=https://www.york.ac.uk/media/workingwiththeuniversity/documents/cpd/sectorscourses/Gilchrist.pdf |journal=Institute of Railway Studies |date=2000 |page=76 |access-date=8 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215222902/https://www.york.ac.uk/media/workingwiththeuniversity/documents/cpd/sectorscourses/Gilchrist.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Finalising the design===\nAnother of Jones' many goals for the APT was that it would not cause additional wear on the lines. Instantaneous loads on the railbed vary with the square of speed, so a faster train would greatly increase road wear. Offsetting this effect required the train to meet stringent weight limits, and eliminated the possibility of using conventional [[diesel engine]]s, which were simply too heavy. The team selected [[gas turbine]] power as the solution, initially considering the [[Rolls-Royce Dart]].{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\nWhen the funding was secured a number of design notes were still not finalised, so the timeline was stretched into July 1971 to provide extra time for the project definition stage. By May 1969 these issues had been decided and the final design emerged. The experimental train would have four cars; two power cars placed at either end, and two passenger cars between them filled with experimental measurement and recording systems. During the time Jones was arranging funding, an experimental engine built by [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] for trucks became available, which was designed to be much less expensive. The Dart was dropped, and power would be supplied by four {{convert|300|hp}} [[Leyland 2S/350 gas turbine]]s in each power car, along with a fifth turbine connected to a generator to power the equipment in the passenger cars. {{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=32}} During the testing period the engines were progressively upgraded to {{convert|330|hp}}.{{sfn|Williams|1985|p=480}}\n\nAfter many months studying various transmission systems, with time on the definition phase ending they finally decided to use an electric transmission, like a diesel-electric locomotive.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=32}} Finally, due to schedule pressure, it was decided not to use a single articulated bogie between the cars, and two conventional bogies would be used on each car.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=32}} Jim Wildhamer, recently hired from [[Westland Helicopters]], designed a space-frame body for the power cars based on welded steel tube instead of the semi-monocoque construction used on the passenger cars.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\nContracts for the various parts of the design were sent out in July 1969. [[Hawker Siddeley Dynamics]] won the contract for the suspensions and braking systems, [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] and [[English Electric]] won the contract for the trailer cars, and by this time Leyland had already been selected for the engines.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}} Over time a number of these contracts were withdrawn and the teams took the design in-house, cancelling the suspensions contract with Hawker Siddeley in February 1970. Design of the bogies was taken over with the physical construction contracted to British Rail Engineering, while the power car construction was let to [[Metro-Cammell]].{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\nWhile this work was underway, work on an experiential facility for the design also started. Sited behind the main offices at the Derby labs, Kelvin House, the new facilities included a roller rig for testing the engines, a brake dynamometer and various test rigs for testing the suspension and tilt systems. The new lab was opened on 26 October 1970. Additionally, a {{convert|13.25|mile}} section of track between [[Melton Mowbray]] and Edwalton was purchased as a test track. This was originally the main line to [[Nottingham]], but now redundant after the Beeching Axe. This contained a {{convert|3|mile}} straight section, many curves, and several tight tunnels that would be useful for aerodynamics tests. A set of maintenance buildings was built along this line at Old Dalby, and the line as a whole became known as the [[Old Dalby Test Track]].{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\n===POP===\nAlthough construction of the train was relatively straightforward, a number of more serious problems appeared in the power and control systems. Thus the decision was made to build two additional power cars as unfinished frameworks with no power. These cars would instead be hauled by conventional locomotives to provide data on the tilting and braking systems as well as the dynamics of the vehicles. A contract for the additional two cars was sent out on 14 April 1970, and ran for the first time in September 1971. The name \"POP\" was assigned, an acronym for \"power-zero-power\", indicating the two power car layout with no passenger cars in the middle.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\nThe selection of a space frame design for the power cars turned out to be fortunate, as during construction the engineers concluded that the packaging of the various elements within the car would render it dynamically unstable. They needed more room to spread the parts out, so the decision was made to roughly double the length of the power cars. This turned out to be easy to do; the frameworks already under construction at Metro-Cammell simply had additional sections of steel tube inserted and construction was barely affected.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\nThe POP cars were skinless, topped with a space frame holding ballast to simulate the various parts of the prospective design. The \"POP\" acronym was soon rendered inaccurate when a passenger car was added to make a three-car train, at which time the power cars were also given bodies. The POP underwent a number of changes, notably trialling different bogie designs, over its lifetime.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}\n\n===APT-E===\n{{main|British Rail APT-E}}\n[[Image:APT-E.png|thumb|right|APT-E Power Car PC2 and Trailer Car TC1]]\n\nWhile POP was proving the basic concepts, construction of the test train continued at the Derby lab. The set was sufficiently complete by late 1971 for an official naming ceremony, where it became the [[British Rail APT-E|APT-E]] (for Experimental). It made its first low-speed run from Derby to Duffield on 25 July 1972. Upon reaching Duffield, the [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|ASLEF]] union immediately \"blacked\" it, forbidding their members from doing any work involving the train. Their complaint was that the APT-E had a single operator's chair, which they took as evidence that BR was moving to single operator trains. A friendly inspector helped the team move the train back to Derby at night. This resulted in a one-day national strike that cost more than the entire APT-E project.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\nBy this point the POP had demonstrated a number of problems, and the engineers took the opportunity to start a major overhaul of the design. The main problem was the design of the non-driven bogies, which were not stable and could not be used for high speed runs. One power car was retained at the lab while the other and the two passenger cars were sent to the nearby [[Derby Works]] for modification. The main changes were to stiffen the power cars and replace the suspect bogies with a version of the powered bogie with the motors removed. Other changes included the removal of the ceramic [[recuperator]]s from the turbines for reliability reasons, although this dramatically increased fuel use, and the addition of a small seating area to the passenger car for VIP use.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}}\n\nContract negotiations over high speed rail had concluded in the summer of 1973, just in time for the modified three-car APT-E to emerge from the shop in August 1973. The train then started a testing series lasting eight months, covering details of the suspension, braking, curve performance and drag. However, reliability was a serious problem and it returned to the shops for a second overhaul in March 1974. Among the many changes for this round was the switching of the turbines formerly dedicated to power delivery for the passenger cars to add additional power to the traction motors, while at the same time replacing all of the turbines with an upgraded {{convert|330|hp}} version, improving total power per car from {{convert|1200|to|1650|hp}}. Other changes included new motor bearings and the return and similar modification of the second power car, formerly used at the lab.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}}\n\nThe rebuilt four car train returned to service in June 1974. On 10 August 1975 it hit {{convert|152.3|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=BBCcoverarticle>{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/travel/story/tilting_train/index.shtml |title = To tilt or not to tilt |publisher = [[BBC News]] |accessdate = 3 September 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208064717/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/travel/story/tilting_train/index.shtml |archive-date = 8 February 2007 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> on the [[Western Region of British Railways|Western Region]] between Swindon and Reading, setting the UK record.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}} It then set the route record from Leicester to [[London St. Pancras]] in 58 minutes 30 seconds on 30 October 1975, at an average speed of just over {{convert|101|mph}} through this twisty route.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}} It was also tested extensively on the [[Midland Main Line]] out of St. Pancras and on the Old Dalby Test Track, where in January 1976 it attained a speed of {{convert|143.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nAPT-E testing ended in 1976, and the single train was sent directly to the [[National Railway Museum]] in [[York]] on 11 June 1976.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}} During its testing it covered approximately {{convert|23500|miles}}, ending a career that is considered a success, but the train could not be said to have been extensively tested; in three years it covered less distance than the average family car would in that period.

Jones found an ally in Graham Calder, who had been promoted to become BR's chief mechanical engineer (CME) in 1971. At the time they envisioned building two new experimental trains; one was essentially a stretched version of the APT-E with turbine power, and the other was similar, but powered by [[Overhead line|overhead electrical lines]] via [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] (pan).{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}}\n\nAs data flowed in from the POP and APT-E, a number of changes to the design were being made. Among the more problematic changes was Leyland's exit from the turbine market, having concluded that the concept of a turbine powered truck was not economically feasible. The company agreed to continue supporting the project anyway, including the release of a more powerful {{convert|350|hp}} version, but made it clear a production design would have to find another solution. In November 1972, the plans changed to build four electric versions for operation on the WCML, and another two turbine versions. From that point the turbine versions fell progressively further behind, and were eventually cancelled.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}}\n\nThis may have been a blessing in disguise; the [[1973 oil crisis]] caused fuel prices to rise as much as three times, and turbine engines were notoriously thirsty; the TurboTrain used between 50 and 100% more fuel than conventional sets running on the same routes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Maurer |first=Charles |title=120-mph train |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CwEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59  |journal=Popular Science |date=July 1975 |issue=July 1975 |pages=59\u201361}}</ref> Leyland's use of a recuperator improved this considerably, but proved a maintenance problem.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n===Design review===\nWith the decision to move primarily to electrification made in November 1972, Jones began building a larger management team to carry the design forward to service. This resulted in the April 1973 transfer of the design from the research division to the Office of the Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineer. A review was carried out by a joint team from the two divisions, led by David Boocock.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}}\n\nAs a result of this review a number of additional changes were made to the design. A major problem was the recent discovery that the overhead lines on the WCML were subject to the creation of large waves in the lines at speeds over {{convert|200|km/h}}. This was not a problem for two trains following each other with a spacing of several kilometers, but was a serious problem for a single train with pantographs at both ends. The obvious solution was to use a single pantograph at the front or back and then run the power between the cars, but this was outlawed by concerns over the presence of 25&nbsp;kV power on the passenger cars.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}}{{efn|Sources disagree on the nature of the problem of running power along the train. Wickens states this was a safety concern,{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} while Williams states it was due to the difficulty of designing a coupling between the cars that could handle the case of the two cars being at different tilt angles - only the center of the cars would remain at the same relative alignment, not the top or bottom. These may not be different issues; because the only point that was guaranteed to be at the same angle between two cars were the shared bogies at either end, the power cabling would have to either run under the cars, or from the roof down to the bogies and back up again repeatedly, which would carry the cabling though the passenger compartment.}}\n\nSome consideration was given to placing both engines back-to-back at one end of the train, but concerns were raised over excessive buckling forces when pushing the train at high speeds with the tilt feature active. So, finally, the design team chose to place the engines back-to-back in the centre of the train.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}} The two engines would be identical and both would carry a pantograph to pick up power, but in normal operation only the rear of the two engines would raise its pantograph, and the other engine would be fed power through a coupling along the roof. Power was converted to [[direct current]] by ASEA [[thyristor]]s, supplying four {{convert|1|MW|hp}} DC traction motors mounted in each power car. The traction motors were moved from the bogies to inside the car body, thereby reducing unsprung weight. The motors transmitted their power through internal gearboxes, cardan shafts and [[Quill drive|quill final drives]].\n\nOther changes suggested by experience on APT-E included changes to the vertical suspension from conventional hydraulic shock absorbers to air bags, which would both improve the ride quality and have lower maintenance requirements. For service reasons, the power cars were redesigned to have their own bogies in a Bo-Bo arrangement, so they could be easily removed from the train, unlike the former articulated design that connected adjacent cars together and made it difficult to split the train apart. The passenger cars retained the articulated design, but a number of changes were made due to experience on APT-E. Finally, a system that would cause the tilt system to fail into the upright position was desired, as APT-E had failed into a tilted position on several occasions.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}}\n\nAs part of the same review, the team noticed that a slight reduction in maximum speed would greatly simplify a number of design points, and eliminated the need for the hydrokinetic brakes. However, the decision was made to go ahead with the original specification in order to provide the maximum possible speed. The government agreed to pay 80% of the cost of eight trains.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n===HST vs. APT===\n[[File:Intercity 125 2169045.jpg|thumb|In contrast to APT, HST was a huge success and remains in service to this day.]]\n\nIt was during this time that other groups within BR began to agitate against APT, saying it was simply too large a step to make in a single design. They proposed building a much simpler design, powered by conventional diesels and lacking tilt, but capable of speeds of up to {{convert|125|mph|abbr=on}} and able to run anywhere on the BR network. This emerged in 1970 as the [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] (HST), and development proceeded rapidly.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10710F73D5416768FDDA90A94D1405B808BF1D3 |title = Trains in Europe Fast and Growing |author = Edward Burks |work=[[The New York Times]]|date = 20 September 1970 | accessdate = 29 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BRB_APT004.pdf | title= Tomorrow's Train, Today | publisher=Railways Archive |accessdate=18 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAs the APT programme continued, management began infighting and a round of [[empire building]] followed. Experienced engineering resources were withheld from the APT project, using them instead to press ahead as swiftly as possible with what they saw as a conventional rival to APT.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_WP001.pdf |title=New opportunities for the railways: the privatisation of British Rail |publisher=Railway Archive | page=8 |accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> As it appeared the HST would be a relatively sure bet, BR's board of directors dithered on the APT project, eventually cutting the number of trains to four. This was later cut to three by the government in a 1974 round of budget cuts.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n===APT-P===\n[[Image:APTP Driving Trailer Second.png|thumb|right|APT-P Driving Trailer Second (DTS) unit, in revised APT branding, with a black \"mask\" around the driver's window]]\n[[Image:APTP Non Driving Motor.png|thumb|right|APT-P Non-Driving Motor (NDM) unit, with Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph]]\n\nAlthough the centre-motor layout was the simplest in terms of solving the immediate technical problems, it would cause significant problems in operational terms. There was a passage through the power cars that connected the two halves of the train, but it was noisy, cramped and not permitted for passengers. Instead, each end of the train now required its own dining car and similar facilities. The split design also presented problems in the stations, where only the two ends of the platforms could now be used, whereas normal equipment could park with the locomotives off the end of the platform.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}}\n\nAlthough all auxiliary equipment such as lighting, air conditioning and air compressors was powered by motor alternators driven from the 25&nbsp;kV overhead line, it was recognised that if there were a power failure, conditions in the passenger vehicles would quickly become unbearable and even unsafe. Each driving van trailer i.e. the leading and trailing vehicles, was equipped with a diesel-alternator generator capable of supplying the minimum requirement of auxiliary power. The diesel-alternators were started using air motors powered from the train's air system, since the APT carried few batteries.\n\nThe APT was designed for faster running than existing trains on the same track. At the APT's design speeds, it was not possible for the operator to read the speed limits on trackside signs in time to slow down if needed. Instead, a new system using a transponder-based cab display was introduced called \"C-APT\". A radio signal from the train caused a track-mounted transponder to return the local speed limit. These sealed, unpowered transponders were placed at intervals of no more than 1&nbsp;km. Approaching speed restrictions were provided at the appropriate distance, along with an audible alert; failure to acknowledge these alerts would result in an automatic brake application. C-APT was driven by a redundant onboard computer system using [[Intel 4004]] microprocessors. The track units were essentially the same as the modern French [[Balise]] beacons.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.apt-p.com/aptcapt.htm | title = Control APT (C-APT) | author = R G Latham | date = 14 July 2005 | accessdate = 18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe hydrokinetic brake system was successful and reliable on the APT-E and was retained for the APT-P with a number of design improvements from the lessons learnt on APT-E. However, as an energy-cutting measure, the hydraulically actuated friction brakes used for low speed were modified to be fed by a passive hydraulic intensifier rather than a hydraulic power pack.\n\n===Service testing===\n[[File:Carlisle InterCity APT.jpg|thumb|An APT-P at {{rws|Carlisle}} in 1983]]\n\nAlthough APT-P used much of the technology developed on the APT-E, construction of the first APT-P was delayed several times. The first power car was delivered from the Derby locomotive works in June 1977, and the first passenger cars on 7 June 1978, a year late. The first complete train was not ready until May 1979.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} It entered testing soon after, and set the UK speed record at {{convert|162.2|mph}} in December 1979,{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} a record that stood for 23 years. Two additional examples were delivered, each with minor changes, one in late 1979, and the last in 1980. Initially proposed in the 1960s, and given the go-ahead in the early 1970s, the design was now significantly late.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\nLong delays in the production of the prototype meant that the brake units had to be stored for an extended period before being installed. The change from oil to water-glycol mix required the cylinders to be covered internally with an anti-corrosion coating, which broke down during storage. In testing the cylinders repeatedly failed, and the loss of pressure caused the train to take nearly as long to slow from 25&nbsp;mph to a standstill as it did to slow from 125&nbsp;mph to 25&nbsp;mph. During commissioning, because of this and other development issues, every axle on the trains was modified and exchanged.\n\nThe compressed air systems that actuated the brakes and powered the doors and other moving parts was another source of problems. The air piping would normally be run in such a way that there were natural low points where water condensing out of the air would collect and could be removed. On APT these runs were tortuous, and resulted in numerous points where the water would collect, and in cold weather, freeze. The commissioning team found a Westinghouse designed solution that would eliminate the water being produced by the compressors, but the design team would not accept the solution. They stated that the problem would not occur with a full train formation, as opposed to the shorter formation used in commissioning.\n\nFinally, it was only discovered at the APT-P commissioning stage that parts of the WCML had been built in such a way that, if two APT-P trains with their tilt systems failed and the carriages stuck in the inward tilted position met, they would strike one another. The railway had not been built with tilting trains in mind, and the [[Loading gauge|dynamic envelopes]] were too small for a tilted APT. The effect was not seen with conventional trains since, without tilt, their movements stayed well within the dynamic envelope.\n\nAdding to the problems, in 1980 another reorganisation resulted in the disbanding of the APT team, leaving responsibility for the project spread across several divisions.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n==In service==\n\n===Queasy rider===\nWhile the commissioning team continued to report, and solve, problems in the APT design, BR management was under increasing pressure from the press. By the early 1980s the project had been running for over a decade and the trains were still not in service. ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' lampooned it with a timetable proclaiming \"The APT arriving at Platform 4 is fifteen years late\".<ref name=laughing/> Press pressure led to political pressure which led to management pressure, and the APT team was told to put the train into operation in spite of its ongoing problems.\n\nThis led to one of the most infamous events in rail history. On 7 December 1981 the press was invited aboard APT for its first official run from Glasgow to London, during which it set a schedule record at 4 hours 15 minutes. The press proved uninterested in this success. Instead, they focused on a distinct sickening sensation from the tilt system, and nicknamed APT the \"queasy rider\". They also reported that the stewardess, Marie Docherty, suggested the solution was to \"just stand with your feet apart.\" BR engineers did little to address the problem when one publicly suggested that the reporters were simply too drunk on BR's free alcohol. On its return trip from London the next day, one of the coaches became stuck in a rotated position when the tilt system failed, and this was heavily reported in the press.<ref name = BBCcoverarticle/> Two days later, the temperature dipped and the water in the hydrokinetic brakes froze, forcing the train to end service in [[Crewe]].<ref>{{cite news|title=APT - The lean machine|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1695589.stm|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=BBC News|date=7 December 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202041403/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1695589.stm|archive-date=2 December 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAPT became the focus of a storm of negative press reporting, with every failure extensively reported on and continued claims that the entire project was a [[white elephant]]. For instance, when it was learned that only two of the three APT-Ps was in operation and the third would be out of service for overhaul and maintenance, the press dubbed it the \"Accident Prone Train\".<ref name=laughing/> This was not helped by the fact that BR also ran a second train 15 minutes behind it in case it failed. And since the train was mixed among existing traffic, speed was limited to 125&nbsp;mph instead of its full speed.<ref name=laughing/>\n\nBR, desperate for some good publicity, hired former [[Blue Peter]] presenter [[Peter Purves]] to make the journey from Glasgow. On arrival at [[Euston railway station|Euston]], Purves claimed to have had an \"excellent breakfast in the most delightful surroundings\", and when asked about the train, said \"it's smooth, it's quiet, and an altogether delightful experience.\" However, as the last statement was uttered there was a slight shudder visible, and the sound of rattling dishes was clearly audible.<ref name=laughing>{{cite journal |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35061511 |title=APT tilting train: The laughing stock that changed the world |first=Justin |last=Parkinson |journal=BBC News Magazine |date=18 December 2015 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425023722/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35061511 |archive-date=25 April 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOver the next month the air system proved perfectly capable of freezing up even on a full length train.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Doors repeatedly stuck, and the brake system could not be trusted{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. The trains were withdrawn from service at the end of the month.\n\n===Further development===\nIn 1981, BR hired the consulting firm Ford & Dain Partners to produce a report on the APT project and make any suggestions to improve it. It produced an interim report in November 1981, and a final version that December.<ref>{{cite techreport |title= Advanced Passenger Train: interim report by Ford and Dain Partners |date=November 1981 |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/record?catid=8412824}}</ref><ref>{{cite techreport |title= Review of the Advanced Passenger Train: final report by Ford and Dain Partners |date= December 1981 |url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11183015 |accessdate= 9 February 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161104011058/http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11183015 |archivedate= 4 November 2016 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Their reports first suggested that the technical aspects of the design were largely complete, although they drew attention to the braking system, but that the management structure was a serious problem and there had to be a single manager in charge of the entire project. This resulted in the appointment of John Mitchell to the position of manager of the APT.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}} Matters immediately improved.\n\nAmong the improvements was a fix for the motion sickness being experienced by passengers. The commissioning team had been well aware of this problem before it entered service, but this was not mentioned to the press when it was noticed on the public runs. The problem was due to two effects. One was that the control system did not respond instantly, so the cars tended to not respond when the curve first started, and then reacted rapidly to make up for this lag. The fix for this was to take information on the tilt from the car in front, giving the system the slight time advantage it needed. The other problem was similar to [[sea sickness]], but in reverse. Sea sickness is caused when the body's [[equilibrioception]] system can feel movement, but inside a closed room this movement cannot be seen. On APT, one could easily see the tilting as the train entered turns, but there was no perception of this motion. The end result was the same, a confusion between the visual and the equilibrioception system. The solution was almost trivial; slightly reducing the amount of tilt to be deliberately less than needed resulted in a small amount of leftover centrifugal force that was perceived by the equilibrioception system as being perfectly natural, which proved to cure the effect.\n\nThis also led to a further embarrassing discovery. The work that suggested the amount of tilt needed to reduce the lateral forces to acceptable levels was eventually traced to a short series of studies carried out by a steam train on a branch line in northern Wales in 1949. A series of updated studies carried out in 1983 demonstrated less tilt was needed, about six degrees. This was within the range possible through superelevation, which suggested tilting might not be needed at all.<ref name=flop/>\n\n===Re-entry, demise===\nThe APT-P trains were quietly reintroduced into service in mid-1984, but not mentioned as such on any of the timetables; passengers would find out if they were taking APT only when it arrived at the platform. These trains proved to work well, the problems having apparently been corrected. However, the political and managerial will to continue the project and build the projected 140&nbsp;mph capable APT-S production vehicles had evaporated.\n\nMeanwhile, HST entered service as the [[InterCity 125]] in 1976 and proved to be an all-round success. Its diesel operation and slightly lower speeds also meant it could operate more of BR's network. Pressure to abandon APT in favour of HST was continual. Supporters of the APT were increasingly isolated, and the system was removed from service in the winter of 1985/6. This was made formal in 1987, when the trains were broken up and sent to museums.\n\nOne APT-P set was kept at Glasgow Shields depot and found use once or twice as an \"[[multiple unit|EMU]]\" to take journalists from Glasgow Central to [[Anderston railway station]] and back, for the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]]. A second APT-P was stored in a siding behind Crewe Works. The \"Glasgow\" APT-P and the third APT-P were scrapped very quietly without publicity.\n\n==Examination==\nThe failure of the APT project saw extensive reporting in the 1980s, and has remained a topic of some discussion since then. Writers generally agree that the technical aspects of the design were largely solved by the time of their second service introduction, and put most of the blame for the delays on the shifting management structures and infighting within BR between APT and HST. There have also been concerns that carrying out development within BR was a major problem of its own, because this meant their industrial partners had no buy-in and their years of practical experience were being ignored.<ref name=flop/>\n\nThe development timeline is also a topic of considerable discussion. It is useful to contrast the APT project with the Canadian [[LRC (train)|LRC]]; LRC began development at the same time as APT, developed a unique active tilting system of its own, and entered production in the late 1970s. Like APT, LRC also faced teething problems that took some time before they were solved, and was subject to some press chiding over these failures. Unlike APT, LRC had no competition and management was in a hurry to remove the [[UAC TurboTrain|Turbo]] from service. The system was given the time it needed to mature with no serious possibility of cancellation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Litvak |first1=Isaiah |last2=Maule |first2=Christopher |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s2W2GAAACAAJ |title=The Light-Rapid Comfortable (LRC) Train and the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) |publisher=University of Toronto/York University Joint Program in Transportation |year=1982 }}</ref>\n\nThe slow pace of APT development has been blamed on the shoestring budget of \u00a350 million over 15 years, although the press of the era dismissed this as too high.<ref name=flop/> This number has been compared to the roughly \u00a3100 million spent by [[British Leyland]] to develop the [[Austin Mini Metro]], a project that was technically trivial in comparison to APT.<ref name=flop/>\n\n==Legacy==\nAlan Williams<ref name= williams>Williams (1985)</ref> notes that work continued on a new variant, the APT-U (APT-Update). This was essentially APT-P with the tilt system made optional and the engines repositioned at either end of the train with power couplings running between them. That project was later retitled [[InterCity 225]] (IC225), perhaps to distance it from the bad publicity surrounding the APT-P. The [[British Rail Mark 4|Mark 4]] coach design that was introduced as part of the new IC225 sets for the [[East Coast Main Line]] electrification allowed the retrofitting of the tilt mechanism, although this was never implemented. The [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]] locomotives that power the IC225s had design features \"imported wholesale\" from the APT-P power cars, including body- rather than bogie-mounted traction motors to reduce unsprung load, and having the transformer below rather than on top of the underframe to reduce the centre of gravity. Unlike the APT-P power cars, though, they were never intended to tilt.<ref>\"The Design and Development of the Class 91 Locomotive\", P J Donnison and G R West, Main Line Railway Electrification Conference 1989 - Proceedings of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, 1989.</ref><ref>\"The design, manufacture and assembly of the British Rail Class 91, 25 kV 225 km/h locomotive\", M L Broom and G W Smart, Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers Vol. 205, 1990.</ref>\n \nIn 1976 [[Fiat Ferroviaria]] built the ETR 401 trainset, a tilting train using an active system with 10 degrees of tilting that used gyroscopes to detect the corner in its early phases in order to have a more punctual and comfortable inclination: this is why the FIAT project has been successful since the '70s. In 1982 FIAT bought some APT patents that were used to improve their technology for the ETR 450 trainsets.  .<ref name=manufacturer>{{Cite web |url=https://www.smartrailworld.com/the-twisting-and-turning-tale-of-britains-tilting-trains |title=The twisting and turning tale of Britain's tilting trains. |access-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026054400/https://www.smartrailworld.com/the-twisting-and-turning-tale-of-britains-tilting-trains |archive-date=26 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{efn|The name \"pendolino\" refers to pendulum, a name given to the class during the ETR 401 era, but no longer accurate given that that type of suspension system was abandoned.}}\n\nThe introduction of the Squadron fleet designated APT-S did not occur as had been originally envisaged. The APT project succumbed to an insufficient political will in the United Kingdom to persist in solving the teething difficulties experienced with the many immature technologies necessary for a ground breaking project of this nature.

The WCML contained many curves, and the APT pioneered the concept of active tilting to address these, a feature that has since been copied on designs around the world. The experimental [[British Rail APT-E|APT-E]] achieved a new British railway speed record on 10 August 1975 when it reached {{convert|152.3|mph}}, only to be bested by the service prototype [[British Rail Class 370|APT-P]] at {{convert|162.2|mph}} in December 1979, a record that stood for 23 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDevelopment of the service prototypes dragged on, and by the late 1970s the design had been under construction for a decade and the trains were still not ready for service. The election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] brought matters to a head and she alluded to funding cuts for the project. Facing the possibility of cancellation, BR management decided to put the prototypes into service, with the first runs along the [[London]]-[[Glasgow]] route taking place in December 1981. The result was a [[media circus]] when every problem large or small received front-page coverage and the entire project derided as an example of BR's incompetence. The trains were withdrawn from service again by the end of the month, to the great amusement of the press.\n\nThe problems were eventually solved and the trains quietly reintroduced in 1984 with much greater success. By this time the competing [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]], powered by a conventional diesel engine and lacking the APT's tilt and performance, had gone through development and testing at a rapid rate and was now forming the backbone of BR's passenger service. All support for the APT project collapsed as anyone in authority distanced themselves from what was being derided as a failure. Plans for a production version, APT-S, were abandoned, and the three APT-Ps ran for just over a year before being withdrawn again over the winter of 1985/6. Two of the three sets were broken up, and parts of the third sent to the [[National Railway Museum]] where it joined the APT-E. The patents for the APT's tilt system were sold to [[Fiat Ferroviaria]].\n\nIn spite of the APT's troubled history, the design was highly influential and directly inspired other successful trains. The considerable work on electrification that was carried out hand-in-hand with APT was put to good use with newer non-tilting designs like the [[British Rail Class 91]]. More recently, the APT's tilt system was returned to the WCML on the [[British Rail Class 390]], based on the Fiat car design and built by [[Alstom]]. Other features pioneered on APT, such as the [[hydrokinetic brake|hydrokinetic braking]] used to stop the train within existing separations, have not been adopted.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|British Rail APT-E|British Rail Class 370}}\n{{See also|InterCity 125|British Rail Classes 253, 254 and 255}}\n\n[[File:Driving cab of Advanced Passenger Train.jpg|thumb|right|Driving controls of the Advanced Passenger Train (APT-P) at [[Crewe Heritage Centre]].]]\n\n=== BR research ===\n[[File:GBR rail passengers by year 1830-2015.png|thumb|360px|The period after nationalisation was marked with rapidly falling ridership levels.]]\n\nFollowing nationalisation of the UK's railways in 1948, [[British Rail]] faced significant losses in passengers as the car rapidly became more popular through the 1950s and 60s. By 1970, passenger numbers were roughly half what they had been immediately before [[World War II]]. In an attempt to maintain some level of profitability, the government commissioned a report that resulted in the abandonment of many lines as part of the 1963 \"[[Beeching cuts|Beeching Axe]]\". In spite of this significant restructuring, the company was still built on lines that were pre-war, with routings dating into the 1800s. Maintaining the network was a constant problem and derailments became increasingly common.\n\nIn 1962 Dr. Sydney Jones was hired away from the weapons department at [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|R.A.E. Farnborough]] with the eventual aim of having him take over as BR's research lead from Colin Ingles, who retired in 1964.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=19}} Looking into the derailment problem, they found that much of the problem could be traced to a problem known as [[hunting oscillation]]. This was well known in the railway world, but tended to happen only at high speeds. On the BR network, especially on freight cars with worn wheels, it was being seen at speeds as low as {{convert|20|mph}}.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=20}} Jones was convinced that hunting oscillation was an effect similar to the problem of [[aeroelastic flutter]] encountered in [[aerodynamics]], and decided to hire someone from the aeronautics field to investigate it.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=19}}\n\nIn October 1962, Alan Wickens was given the position. Wickens was a dynamics expert who had previously worked at [[Armstrong Whitworth]] on the [[Sea Slug (missile)|Sea Slug missile]] and then for a period at [[Canadair]] in Montreal before returning to the UK and joining the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel missile]] project.{{efn|The National Railway Museum site has the section header entitled \"Blue Streak\", a contemporary weapon system, but the text clearly states he worked on Blue Steel.}} When the follow-on Blue Steel II was cancelled in favour of the US designed [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]], Wickens left [[Avro|A. V. Roe]] because he \"saw the writing on the wall\". He answered an ad for BR, and during the interview he replied that he had no knowledge of, and little interest in, railway bogie design. It was later revealed this was the reason he was hired.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}\n\nOver the next several years, Wickens' team carried out what is considered to be the most detailed study of the dynamics of steel wheels on rails ever conducted. Starting with incomplete work by F.W. Carter from 1930, the team studied conventional two-axle bogies and quickly discovered that, as Jones had suspected, the problem was dynamic instability. Out of this work came the concept of a critical speed at which point hunting would become a problem.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} This work was then extended to the unique two-axle bogieless car designs used on the BR freight network, where the problem was further modified by the dynamics of the entire vehicle.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=19}}\n\nWickens concluded that a properly damped suspension system could eliminate the problem, and set about to demonstrate this. By 1964 this work had produced the first [[High Speed Freight Vehicle]], HSFV-1, a bogieless freight car capable of travelling safely at speeds up to {{convert|140|mph|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} The same work suggested there was no practical upper limit to the achievable speeds in terms of dynamics, and that any limitations on maximum performance would be due to other factors like traction or wear on the lines. Eventually a series of six HSFV designs would be tested until 1976,{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=36}} and the last, HSFV-6, entered service that year.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=37}}\n\n===Cant and tilting trains===\n[[File:Railway superelevation at Dunbar, July 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Superelevation was applied to portions of the BR network, although the angle was limited. Here, a [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]], based on APT technology, rounds a canted turn on the [[East Coast Main Line]].]]\n\nDuring this period, BR's Passenger Business division produced a report suggesting rail could compete with road and air, but only if trains were faster. Studying the increase in ridership due to the introduction of the [[British Rail Class 55]] \"Deltic\" engines on the [[East Coast Main Line]], and the effects of electrification on the WCML which improved journey times 20 to 30%, they concluded that every {{convert|1|mph}} increase in speed would result in a 1% increase in passengers. This basic rule was apparently proven in Japan, when the Tokyo-Osaka [[shinkansen]] line was operating from 1964 to huge success.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\nThe shinkansen provided a smooth ride at speeds as high as {{convert|125|mph|0|abbr=on}} by laying new lines dedicated to high speed travel. BR's most used route, the WCML, had in the order of 6 million passengers a year between [[London]] and [[Manchester]],{{Dubious|date=April 2018}} a far cry from the Tokyo-Osaka's 120 million. Funding for a new line for high speed use was highly unlikely given these passenger levels.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} This presented a problem for any sort of high-speed operation on the route because the existing line contained many turns and curves, and rounding these at high speed would cause lateral forces that would make walking difficult, and throw items off tables onto the floor.\n\nOne solution to this problem is to tilt the rails into the turns, an effect known as ''[[superelevation]]''. This has the effect of making the lateral forces more inline with the floor, reducing sideways forces. The problem is that this approach only matches the forces perfectly at a single speed; traffic moving slower than the design speed would feel as if it is tipping over into the inside of the turn, while those moving faster than the design speed would still feel leftover centrifugal force. Long experience had shown that the maximum amount of ''cant'' applied to lines with mixed traffic was 6.5 degrees, which would be effective at speeds into the {{convert|100|mph|0|abbr=on}} range, but began to demonstrate [[cant deficiency]] at speeds above {{convert|125|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marquis |first=Brian |title=Cant Deficiency, Curving Speeds and Tilt |publisher=US DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center |url=http://www.highspeed-rail.org/Documents/PRIIA%20305%20DocSpec%20and%20other%20NGEC%20Documents/305%20PRIIA%20Tilt%20presentation.pdf |accessdate=29 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929162445/http://www.highspeed-rail.org/Documents/PRIIA%20305%20DocSpec%20and%20other%20NGEC%20Documents/305%20PRIIA%20Tilt%20presentation.pdf |archive-date=29 September 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe other solution to this problem is to have the train car bodies tilt instead of the rails. [[Talgo]] introduced the first practical design for a tilting carriage in the late 1950s. This consisted of a single bogie placed between the train cars with the car bodies suspended from an A-frame centered on the bogie with a pivot near the top. When the train rounded a bend, the centrifugal forces caused the car body to swing out like a pendulum, reaching the proper tilt angle naturally. However, this system had a distinct delay between entering the curve and the body swinging out, and then swung past this angle and then oscillated briefly until settling at the right angle. When traversing a series of curves, like in a switchyard, it tended to swing about alarmingly. Although a number of semi-experimental designs of the 1970s made use of it, like the [[UAC TurboTrain]], the concept was not widely used.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n===APT's origins===\nIn 1964, a number of BR's formerly dispersed research groups were organised into the new [[British Rail Research Division|Derby Research Division]]. It was here that the final work on Wickens' HSFV was being developed.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=28}}\n\nIn 1965, Wickens had hired an intern, Dutch engineer A.J. Ispeert, and had him do some early work on active tilt systems.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}} These would replace the passive pendulum-like Talgo system with a system using [[hydraulic cylinder]]s that would quickly drive the car to the proper angle and hold it there without any swinging. A major advantage for BR use was that the center of rotation could be through the middle of the car, instead of the top, meaning the total movement would fit within the smaller British [[loading gauge]].{{sfn|Wickens|2002}} Ispeert returned a report on the concept in August 1966.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=28}}\n\nWickens noted that BR's single-axle suspension system would have less drag at high speed, and that its lighter weight would make it more stable at high speeds than conventional dual-axle bogies. In November 1966 he wrote a report calling for a two-year programme to build and test a High Speed Passenger Vehicle,{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=28}} essentially an experimental car like [[High Speed Freight Vehicle|HSFV-1]] but for passenger use instead of freight. The original plans called for a single dummy body and two bogies to test the suspension and tilting system at high speed. They set the maximum tilt angle at 9 degrees, which could be added to any cant in the underlying railbed.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}\n\nThe design programme was organised under Mike Newman, while Alastair Gilchrist headed the research side. Newman noted that a single car was unlikely to answer practical questions like how the train would operate as a complete unit, and that a dummy body would not answer the question of whether the tilt mechanism could really be built under the floor without projecting into the cabin. Accordingly, later that same November, Newman and Wickens drew up plans for a complete experimental train with the design goal to be not only to study the tilt system, but do so on actual lines.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=28}}\n\nWickens took the plans to Sydney Jones, who immediately took up the idea. They set the performance goal at the nicely rounded figure of {{convert|250|kph|0|abbr=on}}. In keeping with BR management goals to provide quicker travel times rather than just faster speeds, they also required the train to round corners 40% faster.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=29}} They named the proposal the Advanced Passenger Train. Jones took the proposal to the BR chairman, Stanley Raymond, who liked the idea. However, the board was unable to provide enough funding to develop it, and encouraged Jones to approach the [[Ministry of Transport (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Transport]] for additional funding.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}\n\nJones did so, and spent the next two years walking the corridors of [[Whitehall]] when one civil servant after another agreed that it was a great idea but that it was really the job of someone else to approve it. In spite of being repeatedly put off, Jones persisted, especially with Government Chief Scientist, [[Solly Zuckerman]],{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} to arrange a stable funding system for the entire topic of railway research. This was finalised as the Joint Programme between the Ministry of Transport and the British Railways Board, sharing the costs 50:50. The Programme would run sixteen years from January 1969 to March 1985. The first two programmes were APT and the Train Control Project.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sam |last=Wise |title=British Railways Research, the first hundred years |url=https://www.york.ac.uk/media/workingwiththeuniversity/documents/cpd/sectorscourses/Gilchrist.pdf |journal=Institute of Railway Studies |date=2000 |page=76 |access-date=8 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215222902/https://www.york.ac.uk/media/workingwiththeuniversity/documents/cpd/sectorscourses/Gilchrist.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Finalising the design===\nAnother of Jones' many goals for the APT was that it would not cause additional wear on the lines. Instantaneous loads on the railbed vary with the square of speed, so a faster train would greatly increase road wear. Offsetting this effect required the train to meet stringent weight limits, and eliminated the possibility of using conventional [[diesel engine]]s, which were simply too heavy. The team selected [[gas turbine]] power as the solution, initially considering the [[Rolls-Royce Dart]].{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\nWhen the funding was secured a number of design notes were still not finalised, so the timeline was stretched into July 1971 to provide extra time for the project definition stage. By May 1969 these issues had been decided and the final design emerged. The experimental train would have four cars; two power cars placed at either end, and two passenger cars between them filled with experimental measurement and recording systems. During the time Jones was arranging funding, an experimental engine built by [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] for trucks became available, which was designed to be much less expensive. The Dart was dropped, and power would be supplied by four {{convert|300|hp}} [[Leyland 2S/350 gas turbine]]s in each power car, along with a fifth turbine connected to a generator to power the equipment in the passenger cars. {{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=32}} During the testing period the engines were progressively upgraded to {{convert|330|hp}}.{{sfn|Williams|1985|p=480}}\n\nAfter many months studying various transmission systems, with time on the definition phase ending they finally decided to use an electric transmission, like a diesel-electric locomotive.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=32}} Finally, due to schedule pressure, it was decided not to use a single articulated bogie between the cars, and two conventional bogies would be used on each car.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=32}} Jim Wildhamer, recently hired from [[Westland Helicopters]], designed a space-frame body for the power cars based on welded steel tube instead of the semi-monocoque construction used on the passenger cars.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\nContracts for the various parts of the design were sent out in July 1969. [[Hawker Siddeley Dynamics]] won the contract for the suspensions and braking systems, [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] and [[English Electric]] won the contract for the trailer cars, and by this time Leyland had already been selected for the engines.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}} Over time a number of these contracts were withdrawn and the teams took the design in-house, cancelling the suspensions contract with Hawker Siddeley in February 1970. Design of the bogies was taken over with the physical construction contracted to British Rail Engineering, while the power car construction was let to [[Metro-Cammell]].{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\nWhile this work was underway, work on an experiential facility for the design also started. Sited behind the main offices at the Derby labs, Kelvin House, the new facilities included a roller rig for testing the engines, a brake dynamometer and various test rigs for testing the suspension and tilt systems. The new lab was opened on 26 October 1970. Additionally, a {{convert|13.25|mile}} section of track between [[Melton Mowbray]] and Edwalton was purchased as a test track. This was originally the main line to [[Nottingham]], but now redundant after the Beeching Axe. This contained a {{convert|3|mile}} straight section, many curves, and several tight tunnels that would be useful for aerodynamics tests. A set of maintenance buildings was built along this line at Old Dalby, and the line as a whole became known as the [[Old Dalby Test Track]].{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\n===POP===\nAlthough construction of the train was relatively straightforward, a number of more serious problems appeared in the power and control systems. Thus the decision was made to build two additional power cars as unfinished frameworks with no power. These cars would instead be hauled by conventional locomotives to provide data on the tilting and braking systems as well as the dynamics of the vehicles. A contract for the additional two cars was sent out on 14 April 1970, and ran for the first time in September 1971. The name \"POP\" was assigned, an acronym for \"power-zero-power\", indicating the two power car layout with no passenger cars in the middle.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\nThe selection of a space frame design for the power cars turned out to be fortunate, as during construction the engineers concluded that the packaging of the various elements within the car would render it dynamically unstable. They needed more room to spread the parts out, so the decision was made to roughly double the length of the power cars. This turned out to be easy to do; the frameworks already under construction at Metro-Cammell simply had additional sections of steel tube inserted and construction was barely affected.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=33}}\n\nThe POP cars were skinless, topped with a space frame holding ballast to simulate the various parts of the prospective design. The \"POP\" acronym was soon rendered inaccurate when a passenger car was added to make a three-car train, at which time the power cars were also given bodies. The POP underwent a number of changes, notably trialling different bogie designs, over its lifetime.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}}\n\n===APT-E===\n{{main|British Rail APT-E}}\n[[Image:APT-E.png|thumb|right|APT-E Power Car PC2 and Trailer Car TC1]]\n\nWhile POP was proving the basic concepts, construction of the test train continued at the Derby lab. The set was sufficiently complete by late 1971 for an official naming ceremony, where it became the [[British Rail APT-E|APT-E]] (for Experimental). It made its first low-speed run from Derby to Duffield on 25 July 1972. Upon reaching Duffield, the [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|ASLEF]] union immediately \"blacked\" it, forbidding their members from doing any work involving the train. Their complaint was that the APT-E had a single operator's chair, which they took as evidence that BR was moving to single operator trains. A friendly inspector helped the team move the train back to Derby at night. This resulted in a one-day national strike that cost more than the entire APT-E project.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\nBy this point the POP had demonstrated a number of problems, and the engineers took the opportunity to start a major overhaul of the design. The main problem was the design of the non-driven bogies, which were not stable and could not be used for high speed runs. One power car was retained at the lab while the other and the two passenger cars were sent to the nearby [[Derby Works]] for modification. The main changes were to stiffen the power cars and replace the suspect bogies with a version of the powered bogie with the motors removed. Other changes included the removal of the ceramic [[recuperator]]s from the turbines for reliability reasons, although this dramatically increased fuel use, and the addition of a small seating area to the passenger car for VIP use.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}}\n\nContract negotiations over high speed rail had concluded in the summer of 1973, just in time for the modified three-car APT-E to emerge from the shop in August 1973. The train then started a testing series lasting eight months, covering details of the suspension, braking, curve performance and drag. However, reliability was a serious problem and it returned to the shops for a second overhaul in March 1974. Among the many changes for this round was the switching of the turbines formerly dedicated to power delivery for the passenger cars to add additional power to the traction motors, while at the same time replacing all of the turbines with an upgraded {{convert|330|hp}} version, improving total power per car from {{convert|1200|to|1650|hp}}. Other changes included new motor bearings and the return and similar modification of the second power car, formerly used at the lab.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}}\n\nThe rebuilt four car train returned to service in June 1974. On 10 August 1975 it hit {{convert|152.3|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=BBCcoverarticle>{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/travel/story/tilting_train/index.shtml |title = To tilt or not to tilt |publisher = [[BBC News]] |accessdate = 3 September 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208064717/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/travel/story/tilting_train/index.shtml |archive-date = 8 February 2007 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> on the [[Western Region of British Railways|Western Region]] between Swindon and Reading, setting the UK record.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}} It then set the route record from Leicester to [[London St. Pancras]] in 58 minutes 30 seconds on 30 October 1975, at an average speed of just over {{convert|101|mph}} through this twisty route.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}} It was also tested extensively on the [[Midland Main Line]] out of St. Pancras and on the Old Dalby Test Track, where in January 1976 it attained a speed of {{convert|143.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nAPT-E testing ended in 1976, and the single train was sent directly to the [[National Railway Museum]] in [[York]] on 11 June 1976.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}} During its testing it covered approximately {{convert|23500|miles}}, ending a career that is considered a success, but the train could not be said to have been extensively tested; in three years it covered less distance than the average family car would in that period.

Jones found an ally in Graham Calder, who had been promoted to become BR's chief mechanical engineer (CME) in 1971. At the time they envisioned building two new experimental trains; one was essentially a stretched version of the APT-E with turbine power, and the other was similar, but powered by [[Overhead line|overhead electrical lines]] via [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] (pan).{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}}\n\nAs data flowed in from the POP and APT-E, a number of changes to the design were being made. Among the more problematic changes was Leyland's exit from the turbine market, having concluded that the concept of a turbine powered truck was not economically feasible. The company agreed to continue supporting the project anyway, including the release of a more powerful {{convert|350|hp}} version, but made it clear a production design would have to find another solution. In November 1972, the plans changed to build four electric versions for operation on the WCML, and another two turbine versions. From that point the turbine versions fell progressively further behind, and were eventually cancelled.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=34}}\n\nThis may have been a blessing in disguise; the [[1973 oil crisis]] caused fuel prices to rise as much as three times, and turbine engines were notoriously thirsty; the TurboTrain used between 50 and 100% more fuel than conventional sets running on the same routes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Maurer |first=Charles |title=120-mph train |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CwEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59  |journal=Popular Science |date=July 1975 |issue=July 1975 |pages=pp.&nbsp;59\u201361}}</ref> Leyland's use of a recuperator improved this considerably, but proved a maintenance problem.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n===Design review===\nWith the decision to move primarily to electrification made in November 1972, Jones began building a larger management team to carry the design forward to service. This resulted in the April 1973 transfer of the design from the research division to the Office of the Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineer. A review was carried out by a joint team from the two divisions, led by David Boocock.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}}\n\nAs a result of this review a number of additional changes were made to the design. A major problem was the recent discovery that the overhead lines on the WCML were subject to the creation of large waves in the lines at speeds over {{convert|200|km/h}}. This was not a problem for two trains following each other with a spacing of several kilometers, but was a serious problem for a single train with pantographs at both ends. The obvious solution was to use a single pantograph at the front or back and then run the power between the cars, but this was outlawed by concerns over the presence of 25&nbsp;kV power on the passenger cars.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}}{{efn|Sources disagree on the nature of the problem of running power along the train. Wickens states this was a safety concern,{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} while Williams states it was due to the difficulty of designing a coupling between the cars that could handle the case of the two cars being at different tilt angles - only the center of the cars would remain at the same relative alignment, not the top or bottom. These may not be different issues; because the only point that was guaranteed to be at the same angle between two cars were the shared bogies at either end, the power cabling would have to either run under the cars, or from the roof down to the bogies and back up again repeatedly, which would carry the cabling though the passenger compartment.}}\n\nSome consideration was given to placing both engines back-to-back at one end of the train, but concerns were raised over excessive buckling forces when pushing the train at high speeds with the tilt feature active. So, finally, the design team chose to place the engines back-to-back in the centre of the train.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}} The two engines would be identical and both would carry a pantograph to pick up power, but in normal operation only the rear of the two engines would raise its pantograph, and the other engine would be fed power through a coupling along the roof. Power was converted to [[direct current]] by ASEA [[thyristor]]s, supplying four {{convert|1|MW|hp}} DC traction motors mounted in each power car. The traction motors were moved from the bogies to inside the car body, thereby reducing unsprung weight. The motors transmitted their power through internal gearboxes, cardan shafts and [[Quill drive|quill final drives]].\n\nOther changes suggested by experience on APT-E included changes to the vertical suspension from conventional hydraulic shock absorbers to air bags, which would both improve the ride quality and have lower maintenance requirements. For service reasons, the power cars were redesigned to have their own bogies in a Bo-Bo arrangement, so they could be easily removed from the train, unlike the former articulated design that connected adjacent cars together and made it difficult to split the train apart. The passenger cars retained the articulated design, but a number of changes were made due to experience on APT-E. Finally, a system that would cause the tilt system to fail into the upright position was desired, as APT-E had failed into a tilted position on several occasions.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}}\n\nAs part of the same review, the team noticed that a slight reduction in maximum speed would greatly simplify a number of design points, and eliminated the need for the hydrokinetic brakes. However, the decision was made to go ahead with the original specification in order to provide the maximum possible speed. The government agreed to pay 80% of the cost of eight trains.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n===HST vs. APT===\n[[File:Intercity 125 2169045.jpg|thumb|In contrast to APT, HST was a huge success and remains in service to this day.]]\n\nIt was during this time that other groups within BR began to agitate against APT, saying it was simply too large a step to make in a single design. They proposed building a much simpler design, powered by conventional diesels and lacking tilt, but capable of speeds of up to {{convert|125|mph|abbr=on}} and able to run anywhere on the BR network. This emerged in 1970 as the [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] (HST), and development proceeded rapidly.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10710F73D5416768FDDA90A94D1405B808BF1D3 |title = Trains in Europe Fast and Growing |author = Edward Burks |work=[[The New York Times]]|date = 20 September 1970 | accessdate = 29 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BRB_APT004.pdf | title= Tomorrow's Train, Today | publisher=Railways Archive |accessdate=18 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAs the APT programme continued, management began infighting and a round of [[empire building]] followed. Experienced engineering resources were withheld from the APT project, using them instead to press ahead as swiftly as possible with what they saw as a conventional rival to APT.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_WP001.pdf |title=New opportunities for the railways: the privatisation of British Rail |publisher=Railway Archive | page=8 |accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> As it appeared the HST would be a relatively sure bet, BR's board of directors dithered on the APT project, eventually cutting the number of trains to four. This was later cut to three by the government in a 1974 round of budget cuts.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n===APT-P===\n[[Image:APTP Driving Trailer Second.png|thumb|right|APT-P Driving Trailer Second (DTS) unit, in revised APT branding, with a black \"mask\" around the driver's window]]\n[[Image:APTP Non Driving Motor.png|thumb|right|APT-P Non-Driving Motor (NDM) unit, with Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph]]\n\nAlthough the centre-motor layout was the simplest in terms of solving the immediate technical problems, it would cause significant problems in operational terms. There was a passage through the power cars that connected the two halves of the train, but it was noisy, cramped and not permitted for passengers. Instead, each end of the train now required its own dining car and similar facilities. The split design also presented problems in the stations, where only the two ends of the platforms could now be used, whereas normal equipment could park with the locomotives off the end of the platform.{{sfn|Gilchrist|2006|p=35}}\n\nAlthough all auxiliary equipment such as lighting, air conditioning and air compressors was powered by motor alternators driven from the 25&nbsp;kV overhead line, it was recognised that if there were a power failure, conditions in the passenger vehicles would quickly become unbearable and even unsafe. Each driving van trailer i.e. the leading and trailing vehicles, was equipped with a diesel-alternator generator capable of supplying the minimum requirement of auxiliary power. The diesel-alternators were started using air motors powered from the train's air system, since the APT carried few batteries.\n\nThe APT was designed for faster running than existing trains on the same track. At the APT's design speeds, it was not possible for the operator to read the speed limits on trackside signs in time to slow down if needed. Instead, a new system using a transponder-based cab display was introduced called \"C-APT\". A radio signal from the train caused a track-mounted transponder to return the local speed limit. These sealed, unpowered transponders were placed at intervals of no more than 1&nbsp;km. Approaching speed restrictions were provided at the appropriate distance, along with an audible alert; failure to acknowledge these alerts would result in an automatic brake application. C-APT was driven by a redundant onboard computer system using [[Intel 4004]] microprocessors. The track units were essentially the same as the modern French [[Balise]] beacons.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.apt-p.com/aptcapt.htm | title = Control APT (C-APT) | author = R G Latham | date = 14 July 2005 | accessdate = 18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe hydrokinetic brake system was successful and reliable on the APT-E and was retained for the APT-P with a number of design improvements from the lessons learnt on APT-E. However, as an energy-cutting measure, the hydraulically actuated friction brakes used for low speed were modified to be fed by a passive hydraulic intensifier rather than a hydraulic power pack.\n\n===Service testing===\n[[File:Carlisle InterCity APT.jpg|thumb|An APT-P at {{rws|Carlisle}} in 1983]]\n\nAlthough APT-P used much of the technology developed on the APT-E, construction of the first APT-P was delayed several times. The first power car was delivered from the Derby locomotive works in June 1977, and the first passenger cars on 7 June 1978, a year late. The first complete train was not ready until May 1979.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} It entered testing soon after, and set the UK speed record at {{convert|162.2|mph}} in December 1979,{{sfn|Wickens|1988}} a record that stood for 23 years. Two additional examples were delivered, each with minor changes, one in late 1979, and the last in 1980. Initially proposed in the 1960s, and given the go-ahead in the early 1970s, the design was now significantly late.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\nLong delays in the production of the prototype meant that the brake units had to be stored for an extended period before being installed. The change from oil to water-glycol mix required the cylinders to be covered internally with an anti-corrosion coating, which broke down during storage. In testing the cylinders repeatedly failed, and the loss of pressure caused the train to take nearly as long to slow from 25&nbsp;mph to a standstill as it did to slow from 125&nbsp;mph to 25&nbsp;mph. During commissioning, because of this and other development issues, every axle on the trains was modified and exchanged.\n\nThe compressed air systems that actuated the brakes and powered the doors and other moving parts was another source of problems. The air piping would normally be run in such a way that there were natural low points where water condensing out of the air would collect and could be removed. On APT these runs were tortuous, and resulted in numerous points where the water would collect, and in cold weather, freeze. The commissioning team found a Westinghouse designed solution that would eliminate the water being produced by the compressors, but the design team would not accept the solution. They stated that the problem would not occur with a full train formation, as opposed to the shorter formation used in commissioning.\n\nFinally, it was only discovered at the APT-P commissioning stage that parts of the WCML had been built in such a way that, if two APT-P trains with their tilt systems failed and the carriages stuck in the inward tilted position met, they would strike one another. The railway had not been built with tilting trains in mind, and the [[Loading gauge|dynamic envelopes]] were too small for a tilted APT. The effect was not seen with conventional trains since, without tilt, their movements stayed well within the dynamic envelope.\n\nAdding to the problems, in 1980 another reorganisation resulted in the disbanding of the APT team, leaving responsibility for the project spread across several divisions.{{sfn|Wickens|1988}}\n\n==In service==\n\n===Queasy rider===\nWhile the commissioning team continued to report, and solve, problems in the APT design, BR management was under increasing pressure from the press. By the early 1980s the project had been running for over a decade and the trains were still not in service. ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' lampooned it with a timetable proclaiming \"The APT arriving at Platform 4 is fifteen years late\".<ref name=laughing/> Press pressure led to political pressure which led to management pressure, and the APT team was told to put the train into operation in spite of its ongoing problems.\n\nThis led to one of the most infamous events in rail history. On 7 December 1981 the press was invited aboard APT for its first official run from Glasgow to London, during which it set a schedule record at 4 hours 15 minutes. The press proved uninterested in this success. Instead, they focused on a distinct sickening sensation from the tilt system, and nicknamed APT the \"queasy rider\". They also reported that the stewardess, Marie Docherty, suggested the solution was to \"just stand with your feet apart.\" BR engineers did little to address the problem when one publicly suggested that the reporters were simply too drunk on BR's free alcohol. On its return trip from London the next day, one of the coaches became stuck in a rotated position when the tilt system failed, and this was heavily reported in the press.<ref name = BBCcoverarticle/> Two days later, the temperature dipped and the water in the hydrokinetic brakes froze, forcing the train to end service in [[Crewe]].<ref>{{cite news|title=APT - The lean machine|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1695589.stm|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=BBC News|date=7 December 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202041403/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1695589.stm|archive-date=2 December 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAPT became the focus of a storm of negative press reporting, with every failure extensively reported on and continued claims that the entire project was a [[white elephant]]. For instance, when it was learned that only two of the three APT-Ps was in operation and the third would be out of service for overhaul and maintenance, the press dubbed it the \"Accident Prone Train\".<ref name=laughing/> This was not helped by the fact that BR also ran a second train 15 minutes behind it in case it failed. And since the train was mixed among existing traffic, speed was limited to 125&nbsp;mph instead of its full speed.<ref name=laughing/>\n\nBR, desperate for some good publicity, hired former [[Blue Peter]] presenter [[Peter Purves]] to make the journey from Glasgow. On arrival at [[Euston railway station|Euston]], Purves claimed to have had an \"excellent breakfast in the most delightful surroundings\", and when asked about the train, said \"it's smooth, it's quiet, and an altogether delightful experience.\" However, as the last statement was uttered there was a slight shudder visible, and the sound of rattling dishes was clearly audible.<ref name=laughing>{{cite journal |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35061511 |title=APT tilting train: The laughing stock that changed the world |first=Justin |last=Parkinson |journal=BBC News Magazine |date=18 December 2015 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425023722/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35061511 |archive-date=25 April 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOver the next month the air system proved perfectly capable of freezing up even on a full length train.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Doors repeatedly stuck, and the brake system could not be trusted{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. The trains were withdrawn from service at the end of the month.\n\n===Further development===\nIn 1981, BR hired the consulting firm Ford & Dain Partners to produce a report on the APT project and make any suggestions to improve it. It produced an interim report in November 1981, and a final version that December.<ref>{{cite techreport |title= Advanced Passenger Train: interim report by Ford and Dain Partners |date=November 1981 |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/record?catid=8412824}}</ref><ref>{{cite techreport |title= Review of the Advanced Passenger Train: final report by Ford and Dain Partners |date= December 1981 |url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11183015 |accessdate= 9 February 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161104011058/http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11183015 |archivedate= 4 November 2016 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Their reports first suggested that the technical aspects of the design were largely complete, although they drew attention to the braking system, but that the management structure was a serious problem and there had to be a single manager in charge of the entire project. This resulted in the appointment of John Mitchell to the position of manager of the APT.{{sfn|Wickens|2002}} Matters immediately improved.\n\nAmong the improvements was a fix for the motion sickness being experienced by passengers. The commissioning team had been well aware of this problem before it entered service, but this was not mentioned to the press when it was noticed on the public runs. The problem was due to two effects. One was that the control system did not respond instantly, so the cars tended to not respond when the curve first started, and then reacted rapidly to make up for this lag. The fix for this was to take information on the tilt from the car in front, giving the system the slight time advantage it needed. The other problem was similar to [[sea sickness]], but in reverse. Sea sickness is caused when the body's [[equilibrioception]] system can feel movement, but inside a closed room this movement cannot be seen. On APT, one could easily see the tilting as the train entered turns, but there was no perception of this motion. The end result was the same, a confusion between the visual and the equilibrioception system. The solution was almost trivial; slightly reducing the amount of tilt to be deliberately less than needed resulted in a small amount of leftover centrifugal force that was perceived by the equilibrioception system as being perfectly natural, which proved to cure the effect.\n\nThis also led to a further embarrassing discovery. The work that suggested the amount of tilt needed to reduce the lateral forces to acceptable levels was eventually traced to a short series of studies carried out by a steam train on a branch line in northern Wales in 1949. A series of updated studies carried out in 1983 demonstrated less tilt was needed, about six degrees. This was within the range possible through superelevation, which suggested tilting might not be needed at all.<ref name=flop/>\n\n===Re-entry, demise===\nThe APT-P trains were quietly reintroduced into service in mid-1984, but not mentioned as such on any of the timetables; passengers would find out if they were taking APT only when it arrived at the platform. These trains proved to work well, the problems having apparently been corrected. However, the political and managerial will to continue the project and build the projected 140&nbsp;mph capable APT-S production vehicles had evaporated.\n\nMeanwhile, HST entered service as the [[InterCity 125]] in 1976 and proved to be an all-round success. Its diesel operation and slightly lower speeds also meant it could operate more of BR's network. Pressure to abandon APT in favour of HST was continual. Supporters of the APT were increasingly isolated, and the system was removed from service in the winter of 1985/6. This was made formal in 1987, when the trains were broken up and sent to museums.\n\nOne APT-P set was kept at Glasgow Shields depot and found use once or twice as an \"[[multiple unit|EMU]]\" to take journalists from Glasgow Central to [[Anderston railway station]] and back, for the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]]. A second APT-P was stored in a siding behind Crewe Works. The \"Glasgow\" APT-P and the third APT-P were scrapped very quietly without publicity.\n\n==Examination==\nThe failure of the APT project saw extensive reporting in the 1980s, and has remained a topic of some discussion since then. Writers generally agree that the technical aspects of the design were largely solved by the time of their second service introduction, and put most of the blame for the delays on the shifting management structures and infighting within BR between APT and HST. There have also been concerns that carrying out development within BR was a major problem of its own, because this meant their industrial partners had no buy-in and their years of practical experience were being ignored.<ref name=flop/>\n\nThe development timeline is also a topic of considerable discussion. It is useful to contrast the APT project with the Canadian [[LRC (train)|LRC]]; LRC began development at the same time as APT, developed a unique active tilting system of its own, and entered production in the late 1970s. Like APT, LRC also faced teething problems that took some time before they were solved, and was subject to some press chiding over these failures. Unlike APT, LRC had no competition and management was in a hurry to remove the [[UAC TurboTrain|Turbo]] from service. The system was given the time it needed to mature with no serious possibility of cancellation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Litvak |first1=Isaiah |last2=Maule |first2=Christopher |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s2W2GAAACAAJ |title=The Light-Rapid Comfortable (LRC) Train and the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) |publisher=University of Toronto/York University Joint Program in Transportation |year=1982 }}</ref>\n\nThe slow pace of APT development has been blamed on the shoestring budget of \u00a350 million over 15 years, although the press of the era dismissed this as too high.<ref name=flop/> This number has been compared to the roughly \u00a3100 million spent by [[British Leyland]] to develop the [[Austin Mini Metro]], a project that was technically trivial in comparison to APT.<ref name=flop/>\n\n==Legacy==\nAlan Williams<ref name= williams>Williams (1985)</ref> notes that work continued on a new variant, the APT-U (APT-Update). This was essentially APT-P with the tilt system made optional and the engines repositioned at either end of the train with power couplings running between them. That project was later retitled [[InterCity 225]] (IC225), perhaps to distance it from the bad publicity surrounding the APT-P. The [[British Rail Mark 4|Mark 4]] coach design that was introduced as part of the new IC225 sets for the [[East Coast Main Line]] electrification allowed the retrofitting of the tilt mechanism, although this was never implemented. The [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]] locomotives that power the IC225s had design features \"imported wholesale\" from the APT-P power cars, including body- rather than bogie-mounted traction motors to reduce unsprung load, and having the transformer below rather than on top of the underframe to reduce the centre of gravity. Unlike the APT-P power cars, though, they were never intended to tilt.<ref>\"The Design and Development of the Class 91 Locomotive\", P J Donnison and G R West, Main Line Railway Electrification Conference 1989 - Proceedings of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, 1989.</ref><ref>\"The design, manufacture and assembly of the British Rail Class 91, 25 kV 225 km/h locomotive\", M L Broom and G W Smart, Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers Vol. 205, 1990.</ref>\n \nIn 1976 [[Fiat Ferroviaria]] built the ETR 401 trainset, a tilting train using an active system with 10 degrees of tilting that used gyroscopes to detect the corner in its early phases in order to have a more punctual and comfortable inclination: this is why the FIAT project has been successful since the '70s. In 1982 FIAT bought some APT patents that were used to improve their technology for the ETR 450 trainsets.  .<ref name=manufacturer>{{Cite web |url=https://www.smartrailworld.com/the-twisting-and-turning-tale-of-britains-tilting-trains |title=The twisting and turning tale of Britain's tilting trains. |access-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026054400/https://www.smartrailworld.com/the-twisting-and-turning-tale-of-britains-tilting-trains |archive-date=26 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{efn|The name \"pendolino\" refers to pendulum, a name given to the class during the ETR 401 era, but no longer accurate given that that type of suspension system was abandoned.}}\n\nThe introduction of the Squadron fleet designated APT-S did not occur as had been originally envisaged. The APT project succumbed to an insufficient political will in the United Kingdom to persist in solving the teething difficulties experienced with the many immature technologies necessary for a ground breaking project of this nature.

The memorial contains the largest Soviet cemetery in Berlin, which is also the largest Russian cemetery in Europe outside of Russia.\n\n[[Sch\u00f6nholzer Heide]] was a popular recreation area in the 19th century. During [[World War II|the Second World War]] the area was turned into a work camp. After the war, the north-western part of the area was used to build the third largest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] war memorial in Berlin, together with [[Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park)|the memorials in Treptower Park]] and [[Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten)|Tiergarten.]]\n\nA group of Soviet architects consisting of K. Solovyov, M. Belaventsev, V. Korolyov and the sculptor Ivan Pershudchev made the plan for the cemetery, where 13,200 of the 80,000 Soviet soldiers that had fallen during the [[Battle of Berlin]], would be buried. On a wall around the memorial there are 100 bronze tablets where the names, ranks and birth dates of the soldiers it was possible to identify are written. This group constitutes about one-fifth of the fallen soldiers.\n\nOn both sides of the main axis, which at its one end sits a 33.5 meter tall [[obelisk]] made of [[syenite]], there are placed 8 burial chambers where 1182 soldiers are buried. Under the Honor Hall inside the obelisk there are buried two Soviet [[colonel]]s.\n\nA statue of the personification of Mother Russia is situated in front of the obelisk and constitutes the main focal point of the memorial. On the statue's base, which is made out of black [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], sit 42 bronze tablets on which the names of fallen officers are inscribed.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Overview to the alle leading to the memorial.JPG|The main entrance. \nFile:Main portal.Sch\u00f6nholzer Heide.Soviet War Memorial.JPG|Detail from the main entrance to the monument.

As many classify the work of Carrasquilla as Costumbrist, so De On\u00eds classifies him.<ref name=\"De On\u00eds 5\"/>\n\n== Context ==\n\n[[Image:TomasCarrasquillabyMelitonRodriguez1928Medellin.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Don Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla in 1929, a picture by [[:es:Wikipedia:Melit\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez|Melit\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]].]]\n\nCarrasquilla's life straddled two centuries, becoming a link between two epochs in [[History of Colombia|Colombia's history]]. When he was born in 1858, the country was called the Republic of New Granada, newly independent of Spain. In his work ''La Marqueza de Yolomb\u00f3'', Carrasquilla described how the most simple people of the end of the 18th century saw the events that broke the Colombia's political dependence on Spain.\n\nHe was also a citizen of the once-called [[United States of Colombia]] (1863\u20131886), a time when the [[Paisa Region]] saw the colonization of the current coffee areas. He also saw the Colombian [[industrial revolution]] at the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Thousand Days War]], and many other changes in his country.\n\nThe Colombian civil wars of the 19th century were the reason why Carrasquilla could not finish his studies of Law at the [[University of Antioquia]].\n\nOne of those civil wars was reflected in his works ''Luterito'' and ''El Padre Casaf\u00fas'' (in English, \"''The Reverend Casaf\u00fas''\"). Those books were set in the context of the civil war of 1876, started by the Conservative partisans of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] against the Liberal government of president [[Aquileo Parra]], who intended to secularize the education. The story develops in the town of [[Ca\u00f1asgordas]], where a group of fighters prepare themselves to \"defend the Faith.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Carrasquilla|first=Tom\u00e1s|title=Luterito: A las matronas peidrasgorde\u00f1as, al Batall\u00f3n P\u00edo IX, Cuentos de Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla|page=158|publisher= Bedout|location= Medell\u00edn|year= 1970}}</ref> In this case, Carrasquilla's work is an approach to the deepest feelings of people during historical events.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== First years ===\n\nCarrasquilla was born in [[Santo Domingo, Antioquia|Santo Domingo]], an Andean town north-east of [[Medell\u00edn]], on the Antioquean Mountain. He was the son of Isaza Carrasquilla and Ecilda Naranjo Moreno. His family owned some gold mines, and this allowed him to live well enough and dedicate himself to writing. One of his friends, also born in Santo Domingo, was the writer Francisco de Paula Rend\u00f3n.\n\nAt the age of 15, he moved to Medell\u00edn to finish his secondary education at the [[University of Antioquia]]; he continued his study of law there. He had to abandon his law studies in 1877 because of the start of the civil war.\n\nHe returned to Santo Domingo, where he worked as a tailor and did some jobs in the municipality. Carlos Eugenio Restrepo invited him to the ''Caf\u00e9 Literario'' (\"literary caf\u00e9\"), where he had to write a story in order to be admitted. He wrote ''Sim\u00f3n el Mago'' (\"''Simon the Mage''\"), one of his most popular stories. ''Sim\u00f3n'' was published in 1890, and brought to the cinema by Colombian director [[V\u00edctor Gaviria]] in 1993.\n\n=== Writer ===\n\n[[Image:Tomas Carrasquilla-Busto-Medellin.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Bust of Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla in the Little Paisa Town Park in Medell\u00edn.]]\n\nIn 1896, Carrasquilla traveled to [[Bogot\u00e1]] for the publication of his first novel, ''Frutos de Mi Tierra'' (\"''Fruits of my Land''\"), written to demonstrate that any subject can be the matter of a story, which was very well received by critics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} On that trip, he came to know [[Jos\u00e9 Asunci\u00f3n Silva]], to whom he would some years later dedicate the essay \"For the Poet.\"\n\nHe returned to Antioquia and had an accident, falling from a horse, which made him stay in Medell\u00edn for a time. When he returned to Santo Domingo, he dedicated himself to writing, until 1904, when he lost his fortune due to the Banco Popular bankruptcy.

When he was born in 1858, the country was called the Republic of New Granada, newly independent of Spain. In his work ''La Marqueza de Yolomb\u00f3'', Carrasquilla described how the most simple people of the end of the 18th century saw the events that broke the Colombia's political dependence on Spain.\n\nHe was also a citizen of the once-called [[United States of Colombia]] (1863\u20131886), a time when the [[Paisa Region]] saw the colonization of the current coffee areas. He also saw the Colombian [[industrial revolution]] at the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Thousand Days War]], and many other changes in his country.\n\nThe Colombian civil wars of the 19th century were the reason why Carrasquilla could not finish his studies of Law at the [[University of Antioquia]].\n\nOne of those civil wars was reflected in his works ''Luterito'' and ''El Padre Casaf\u00fas'' (in English, \"''The Reverend Casaf\u00fas''\"). Those books were set in the context of the civil war of 1876, started by the Conservative partisans of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] against the Liberal government of president [[Aquileo Parra]], who intended to secularize the education.

He was the son of Isaza Carrasquilla and Ecilda Naranjo Moreno. His family owned some gold mines, and this allowed him to live well enough and dedicate himself to writing. One of his friends, also born in Santo Domingo, was the writer Francisco de Paula Rend\u00f3n.\n\nAt the age of 15, he moved to Medell\u00edn to finish his secondary education at the [[University of Antioquia]]; he continued his study of law there. He had to abandon his law studies in 1877 because of the start of the civil war.\n\nHe returned to Santo Domingo, where he worked as a tailor and did some jobs in the municipality. Carlos Eugenio Restrepo invited him to the ''Caf\u00e9 Literario'' (\"literary caf\u00e9\"), where he had to write a story in order to be admitted. He wrote ''Sim\u00f3n el Mago'' (\"''Simon the Mage''\"), one of his most popular stories. ''Sim\u00f3n'' was published in 1890, and brought to the cinema by Colombian director [[V\u00edctor Gaviria]] in 1993.\n\n=== Writer ===\n\n[[Image:Tomas Carrasquilla-Busto-Medellin.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Bust of Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla in the Little Paisa Town Park in Medell\u00edn.]]\n\nIn 1896, Carrasquilla traveled to [[Bogot\u00e1]] for the publication of his first novel, ''Frutos de Mi Tierra'' (\"''Fruits of my Land''\"), written to demonstrate that any subject can be the matter of a story, which was very well received by critics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} On that trip, he came to know [[Jos\u00e9 Asunci\u00f3n Silva]], to whom he would some years later dedicate the essay \"For the Poet.\"\n\nHe returned to Antioquia and had an accident, falling from a horse, which made him stay in Medell\u00edn for a time. When he returned to Santo Domingo, he dedicated himself to writing, until 1904, when he lost his fortune due to the Banco Popular bankruptcy. He then gained work as a storekeeper in a [[Sons\u00f3n]] gold mine until 1909.\n\nAfter Carrasquilla returned to Medell\u00edn, he had a very lively social and cultural life, associating with young intellectuals like [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez (writer)|Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez Ochoa]], who became one of his best friend for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"otraparte\"/> Gonz\u00e1lez was one of Carrasquilla's biggest admirers.

But soon thereafter, he moved to Bogot\u00e1, where he worked for the Ministry of Public Works until 1919.<ref name=\"udea\"/>\n\nReturning to Medell\u00edn, he continued studying literature, and in 1928 published ''La Marqueza de Yolomb\u00f3'' (\"''The Marchioness of Yolomb\u00f3\"''), one of the best-known works of Colombian literature.<ref group=\"nb\">''La Marqueza de Yolomb\u00f3'' was made into a television series in the 1980s.</ref>\n\n=== Last years ===\n\nThe writer stayed in Medell\u00edn when his health began to decay and he started to go blind. In 1934, surgery gave him back limited vision; his blindness was not an obstacle to his writing, however, as he began to dictate his works.\n\nIn 1935, Carrasquilla was decorated with the [[Colombian military decorations#Order of Boyaca (Orden de Boyac\u00e1)|Cross of Boyac\u00e1]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia-sa.com/departamentos/antioquia/personas2antioquia-in.html|title=Important Figures and Outstanding People Born in Antioquia, Colombia|publisher=Colombia-sa|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref> an award that gives the recipient the same privileges as the president or ex-president of Colombia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=47439|title=Colombian President, Armed Forces Honor Chairman|last=Kozaryn|first=Linda D.|date=13 September 2007|location=Cartegena, Colombia|publisher=American Forces Press Service|work=United States Department of Defense|accessdate=24 August 2010|quote=The defense minister awarded Pace the Cross of Boyaca, the highest military award that can be conferred on a Colombian or foreign officer.

This recognition gave him national fame, and attracted international critics, who admired his work and rescued his name from near-anonymity.\n\nIn December 1940, Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla died among a large group of friends and admirers, who called him \"''Don'' Tom\u00e1s\" or \"''Maestro'' Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla.\"\n\n== Between Costumbrism and Modernism ==\n\n[[Image:Biblioteca Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla- Medellin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[La Quintana|Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla Library]] in Medell\u00edn.]]\n\nCarrasquilla is usually seen as a [[Costumbrismo|Costumbrist]] author, due to the cultural context of his world. The traditional details of the simple folk and the descriptions of scenery in his work are characteristic of Costumbrismo, which was developed in Spain and Latin America during the 19th century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Soria|first=Andr\u00e9s|encyclopedia=Gran Enciclopedia Rialp|title=Costumbrismo I.

In Colombia, Modernism had authors, journalists, artists, and photographers like [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez (writer)|Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Le\u00f3n de Greiff|Greiff]], [[Ricardo Rend\u00f3n|Rend\u00f3n]], and [[Leo Matiz|Matiz]]. Modernism developed as a counter against Costumbrismo. According to [[Federico de On\u00eds]], Carrasquilla knew, and even shared, the new tendencies of Modernism; for example, he gave support to ''Los Panidas'', but kept his own style and originality.<ref name=\"De On\u00eds 8-9\">{{cite book |title= Cuentos de Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla | chapter= Prologue |last=De On\u00eds |first= Federico |date=15 May 1970 |publisher= Bedout |location= Medell\u00edn |isbn= |pages=8\u20139 |language= Spanish}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=Strictly speaking, he was always an independent writer, and his biggest merit and originality manifest themselves in his ability to remain free from direct imitation of any influence, although all those he received are latent in his work.|sign=Frederico de On\u00eds|source=Prologue, ''Cuentos de Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla''<ref name=\"De On\u00eds 8-9\"/>}}\n\nIn this sense, the classification of Carrasquilla as a Costumbrista is not exact. According to De On\u00eds, Carrasquilla's work departs from the static Costumbrismo of the 19th century, that described through description of detail :\n\n{{quote|text=His literary work is equal and diverse; diverse, unlike the work of Costumbrists of the 19th century that described their paintings, scenery and characters using the same pattern; equal, in that his work always permeates the substance of Antioqu\u00eda, and this unique external reality is always seen through his personality.|sign=Frederico de On\u00eds|source=Prologue, ''Cuentos de Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla''<ref name=\"De On\u00eds 8-9\"/>}}\n\nFor Colombian journalist Carlos Uribe de los R\u00edos, Carrasquilla's classification as a Costumbrist author caused him a long marginalization within Colombian literature:\n\n{{quote|text=Carrasquilla was looked down by some [[Bogot\u00e1|Bogotanean]] writers of his time, who considered him as a provincial.

''Don'' Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla was a writer able to harvest simple and straightforward anecdotes from everyday life, and to transform them in perplexing, intense and beautiful stories. He was a master of detail, of description in filigree, of the appropriated word, with the advantage of knowing how to maintain the constant interest of the reader.
