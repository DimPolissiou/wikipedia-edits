The protocol is standardized in [[IEC 61158]] and is suitable for both hard and soft [[real-time computing]] requirements in automation technology.\n\nThe goal during development of EtherCAT was to apply Ethernet for automation applications requiring short data update times (also called cycle times; \u2264 100 \u03bcs) with low communication [[jitter]] (for precise [[synchronization]] purposes; \u2264 1 \u03bcs) and reduced hardware costs.\n\n==EtherCAT features==\n===Functional principle ===\n[[File:EthercatOperatingPrinciple.webm|thumb|Frame processing]]\n\nWith EtherCAT, the standard Ethernet packet or [[Ethernet frame|frame]] (according to [[IEEE 802.3]]) is no longer received, interpreted, and copied as process data at every node. The EtherCAT slave devices read the data addressed to them while the telegram passes through the device,  processing data \"on the fly\". Similarly, input data are inserted while the telegram passes through. A frame is not completely received before being processed; instead processing starts as soon as possible. Sending is also conducted with a minimum delay of small bit times. Typically the entire [[computer network|network]] can be addressed with just one frame.<ref>{{Citation|last=EtherCATGroup|title=EtherCAT Functional Principle (3D)|date=2012-02-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HJq62qP9M|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\n'''ISO/OSI Reference Model'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n<!--|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | OSI Model-->\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[OSI Model|ISO/OSI Layer]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | EtherCAT\n\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" | Host<br />layers\n| style=\"background:#d8ec9b;\" | 7.&nbsp;[[Application layer|Application]]\n| style=\"background:#d8ec9c; vertical-align: top;\" | [[HTTP]]*, [[FTP]]*\n| style=\"background:#d8ec9c; vertical-align: top;\" |\n* Cyclic Data Exchange\n* Mailbox Acyclic Data Access\n\n|-\n| style=\"background:#d8ec9b;\" | 6.&nbsp;[[Presentation layer|Presentation]]\n| style=\"background:#d8ec9b; vertical-align: top;\" | &mdash;\n| style=\"background:#d8ec9b; vertical-align: top;\" | &mdash;\n|-\n| style=\"background:#d8ec9b;\" | 5.

It may consist of several sub-telegrams, each serving a particular memory area of the [[logic]]al process [[image]]s that can be up to 4 [[gigabyte]]s in size. The data sequence is independent of the physical order of the nodes in the network; addressing can be in any order. [[Broadcast]], [[multicast]] and communication between slaves is possible, but must be initiated by the master device. If IP [[routing]] is required, the EtherCAT protocol can be inserted into [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]] datagrams. This also enables any control with Ethernet protocol stack to address EtherCAT systems.\n\n===Performance===\nShort cycle times can be achieved since the host [[microprocessor]]s in the slave devices are not involved in the processing of the Ethernet packets to transfer the process images. All process data communication is handled in the slave controller hardware. Combined with the functional principle this makes EtherCAT a high performance distributed I/O system: Process data exchange with 1000 distributed [[Digital data|digital]] I/O takes about 30 \u03bcs, which is typical for a transfer of 125 [[byte]] over 100Mbit/s Ethernet. Data for and from 100 [[Servomechanism|servo]] axis can be updated with up to 10&nbsp;kHz. Typical network update rates are 1\u201330&nbsp;kHz, but EtherCAT can be used with slower cycle times, too, if the DMA load is too high.\n\nThe bandwidth utilization is maximized, as each node and each data do not require a separate frame. Thus, extremely short cycle times of \u2264 100 \u03bcs are achievable. By using the full-duplex features of [[100BASE-TX]], effective data rates of more than 100 Mbit/s (> 90% user data rate of 2x100 Mbit/s) can be achieved.\n\nThe EtherCAT technology principle is scalable and not bound to 100 Mbit/s. A future extension to [[Gigabit]] Ethernet is possible, but is not in preparation at the moment since the EtherCAT performance is sufficient at 100 Mbit/s.\n\n=== Topology ===\nUsing full-[[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]] Ethernet physical layers, the EtherCAT slave controllers close an open [[Computer port (software)|port]] automatically and return the Ethernet frame if no [[Downstream (computer science)|downstream]] device is detected. Slave devices may have one, two, or more ports. Due to these features EtherCAT enables a multitude of [[network topologies]], including line, tree, ring, star, or any combination thereof. The protocol also enables a multitude of communication features such as cable redundancy, Hot Connect of segments, change of devices during operation, or even master redundancy with Hot Standby.\n\nThus the combination of the topology variations and different network architectures, e.g. sub-ordinated or neighboring control systems with consistent synchronization, enables numerous possibilities. Additional [[switches]] are not required. The physics of Ethernet allow a cable length of up to 100&nbsp;m (300&nbsp;ft) between two nodes, so the E-bus ([[LVDS]]) is only intended for use as the physical layer for modular devices. For each cable path, the signal variant can be chosen individually. For higher distances, or the complete [[galvanic isolation]] between two slaves, [[fiber optic]] cables are used. With single-mode fiber, distances up to 20&nbsp;km between two nodes can be bridged. Since a total of 65,535 nodes per network segment can be connected, the network extension is nearly unlimited.\n\n=== Synchronization ===\nFor synchronization a distributed clock mechanism is applied, which leads to very low jitter, significantly less than 1 \u03bcs, even if the communication cycle jitters, which is equivalent to the IEEE 1588 [[Precision Time Protocol]] standard (PTP). Therefore, EtherCAT does not require special hardware in the master device and can be implemented in software on any standard Ethernet MAC, even without dedicated communication coprocessor.\n\nThe typical process of establishing a distributed clock is initiated by the master by sending a broadcast to all slaves to a certain address. Upon reception of this message, all slaves will [[Latch (electronic)|latch]] the value of their internal clock twice, once when the message is received and once when it returns (remember EtherCAT has a [[ring topology]]). The master can then read all latched values and calculate the delay for each slave. This process can be repeated as many times as required to reduce [[jitter]] and average out values. Total delays are calculated for each slave depending on their position in the slave-ring and will be uploaded to an offset register. Finally the master issues a broadcast readwrite on the system clock, which will make the first slave the reference clock and forcing all other slaves to set their internal clock appropriately with the now known offset.\n\nTo keep the clocks synchronised after initialization, the master or slave must regularly send out the broadcast again to counter any effects of speed difference between the internal clocks of each slave. Each slave should adjust the speed of their internal clock or implement an internal correction mechanism whenever they have to adjust.\n\nThe system clock is specified as a 64 bit counter with a base unit of 1ns starting at January 1, 2000, 0:00.\n\n=== Diagnosis ===\nThe fast, precise detection of disturbances is one of many diagnostic features of EtherCAT.\n\nBit errors during transmission are detected reliably by the analysis of the [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] check sum: the 32 bit CRC polynomial has a minimum [[Hamming distance]] of 4. Besides the [[error detection]] and localization protocol, the transmission physics and topology of the EtherCAT system allow individual quality monitoring of every single transmission path. The automated analysis of the according error counters enables the exact localization of critical network segments.\n\nMore info to follow in the chapter titled \"Monitoring\".\n\n=== Device Profiles ===\nThe device profiles describe the application parameters and functional behavior of the devices, including device-specific state machines. The following software interfaces are provided for existing device profiles. Thus, the migration to EtherCAT by adjusting the firmware and the hardware is simplified significantly. \n\n==== CAN application protocol over EtherCAT (CoE) ====\n[[CANopen]] devices and application profiles are available for an extensive selection of device categories and applications: I/O modules, drives (e.g., drive profile CiA 402 standardized as IEC 61800-7-201/301), encoders (CiA 406), proportional valves, hydraulic controllers (CiA 408), or application profiles. In this case, EtherCAT replaces CAN.\n\n==== Servodrive-Profile over EtherCAT (SoE) ====\n[[SERCOS]] interface is a powerful real-time communication interface, ideal for demanding motion control applications. The SERCOS profile for servo drives and communication technology are standardized in IEC 61800-7. This standard also contains the mapping of the SERCOS servo drive profile to EtherCAT (IEC 61800-7-304).\n\n=== Other Protocols ===\n\n==== Ethernet over EtherCAT (EoE) ====\nAny Ethernet device can be connected within the EtherCAT segment via switch ports. The Ethernet frames are [[Tunneling protocol|tunneled]] via the EtherCAT protocol, as is normal for internet protocols (e.g., [[TCP/IP]], [[VPN]], [[PPPoE]] (DSL), etc.). The EtherCAT network is fully transparent for the Ethernet devices, and the real-time features of EtherCAT are not disturbed.\n\n==== Functional Safety: Safety over EtherCAT (FSoE) ====\nIn parallel to the development of EtherCAT, a fieldbus-independent safety protocol has been developed. For EtherCAT, it is available as \"Safety over EtherCAT\" (FSoE = Fail Safe over EtherCAT). With FSoE, [[functional safety]] with EtherCAT can be realized. The protocol as well as the implementation are certified by [[T\u00dcV]] and meet the requirements of the Safety Integrity Level 3 according to [[IEC 61508]]. Since 2010, Safety over EtherCAT is internationally standardized to IEC 61784-3-12.\nEtherCAT provides a single-channel communication system for transferring safe and non-safe information. The transport medium is regarded as a black channel,<ref>Verhappen, Ian. [http://www.controlglobal.com/articles/2011/HiddenNetwork1102.html \"The Hidden Network\"], Feb 14, 2011</ref> and thus is not included in safety considerations.\n\n=== Monitoring ===\nSince EtherCAT uses standard Ethernet frames according to IEEE 802.3, any standard Ethernet tool can be used to monitor the EtherCAT communication. Additionally, there is free-of-charge parser software for [[Wireshark]] (formerly Ethereal, an open source monitoring tool) and the [[Microsoft]] network monitor, with which recorded EtherCAT data traffic can be comfortably prepared and displayed. Commercially there are monitoring solutions from Beckhoff ([https://www.beckhoff.com/twincat/ TwinCAT]), and acontis technologies ([https://acontis.com/en/ecengineer.html EC-Engineer]).\n\n=== Gateways ===\nBy using gateways, existing networks such as [[CANopen]], [[DeviceNet]], or [[Profibus]], can be integrated into the EtherCAT environment seamlessly. Furthermore, gateways provide a trip-free migration path from a traditional fieldbus to EtherCAT, reducing further investment costs.\n\nThanks to the performance of EtherCAT, communication with external [[fieldbus]] masters is as fast as with traditional cards connected via [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] or other backbone buses. Since decentralized fieldbus interfaces lead to shorter extensions, they can be operated with even higher baud rates than would have been possible with the traditional architecture.\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n=== General ===\nEtherCAT Technology Group (ETG) encourages and expects companies that develop EtherCAT products to join ETG, so that they can get an EtherCAT Vendor-ID, get access to the full documentation, to the developers forum and to the slave stack code, that Beckhoff provides free of charge to ETG members.\n\n=== Master ===\nMasters can be implemented as a software solution on any Ethernet MAC. Different manufacturers provide code for different operating systems, including several open-source projects.\n\nDue to the relocated mapping on the slave hardware, demands are reduced for CPU performance of the master. The master already contains the data as a readily sorted process image.\n\n=== Slave ===\nContrary to the operation of standard Ethernet, the slaves process the EtherCAT frames on the fly. This requires the use of hardware-integrated EtherCAT Slave Controllers (ESC) in the slaves. ESCs are also available as [[ASIC]]s or based on [[FPGA]]s. Since the beginning of 2012, standard [[microprocessors]] with EtherCAT slave interfaces are also available.\n\nFor simple devices, no additional microcontroller is required. In more complex devices, however, the communication performance of EtherCAT is nearly independent of the performance of the used controller. Thus the requirements for the microcontroller are determined by the local application, e.g. the drive control.\n\nThere is a choice of development boards, both from the EtherCAT Slave Controller suppliers and from third party vendors. There are also open-source projects for EtherCAT slave device development boards, such as SOES and ArduCAT.\n\n== Application Examples ==\nTypical application fields for EtherCAT are machine controls (e.g. semiconductor tools, metal forming, packaging, injection molding, assembly systems, printing machines, robotics). Remote controlled hump yard facilities used in the railroad industry.\n\n=== Control and regulation ===\nFor the control and regulation of physical processes, high data integrity, [[data security]], and synchronicity is required. EtherCAT has been designed especially for these kinds of applications and meets all demands for fast controls.\n\n=== Measurement systems ===\nModern [[measurement]] systems are characterized by multi-channeling, synchronicity, and accuracy. Due to the advanced protocol features of EtherCAT, efficient synchronous data throughput is assured. The network features based on Ethernet enable a measurement network with distributed measurement modules.\n\n== EtherCAT Technology Group ==\nThe EtherCAT Technology Group (ETG) was established in 2003, and is the industrial Ethernet user organization with the most members in the world today.<ref name=\"ETG Members List\">ETG Members List, https://www.ethercat.org/en/members.php</ref> A wide range of industrial controls vendors, OEMs, machine builders, and technology organizations from around the world constitute the ETG member roster.\nThe ETG offers its members implementation support and training, organizes interoperability tests (often called \"Plug Fests\"<ref>EtherCAT Plug Fests, https://www.ethercat.org/en/plug_fest.htm</ref>), and promotes the development and distribution of the technology, supported by its members and the teams working in offices in Germany, China, Japan, Korea, and North America.\nETG end users span numerous industries, with machine builders and suppliers of powerful control technology joining forces to support and promote EtherCAT technology. The variety of industries guarantees optimal preparation of EtherCAT for the widest range of applications<ref>EtherCAT Application Articles, https://www.ethercat.org/en/downloads.html?tf=Applications</ref>. System partners give qualified feedback for the simple integration of hardware and software modules in all required equipment classes.\nThe EtherCAT Conformance Test Tool (CTT),<ref>EtherCAT Conformance Test Tool, https://www.ethercat.org/en/ctt.htm</ref> developed with the assistance of ETG member companies, ensures the [[interoperability]] and protocol [[conformity]] of EtherCAT devices.\n\n== International Standardization ==\nThe EtherCAT Technology Group is an official liaison partner of the IEC ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]]) working groups for digital communication. The EtherCAT specification was published as IEC/PAS 62407<ref>IEC/PAS 62407 (Ed 1.0), ''Real-time Ethernet control automation technology (EtherCAT)''</ref> in 2005, which was removed end of 2007 since EtherCAT had been integrated into the international fieldbus standards IEC 61158<ref>IEC 61158-2 (Ed.4.0), ''Industrial communication networks - Fieldbus specifications'' - Part 2: Physical layer specification and service definition</ref><ref>IEC 61158-3/4/5/6-12 (Ed.1.0), ''Industrial communication networks - Fieldbus specifications'' - Part 3-12: Data-link layer service definition - Part 4-12: Data-link layer protocol specification - Part 5-12: Application layer service definition - Part 6-12: Application layer protocol specification -Type 12 elements (EtherCAT)</ref> and IEC 61784-2<ref>IEC 61784-2 (Ed.1.0), ''Industrial communication networks - Profiles'' - Part 2: Additional fieldbus profiles for real-time networks based on ISO/IEC 8802-3</ref> as well as into the drive profile standard IEC 61800-7.<ref>IEC 61800-7-301/304 (Ed.1.0), ''Adjustable speed electrical power drive systems'' - Part 7-301: Generic interface and use of profiles for power drive systems - Mapping of profile type 1 to network technologies - Part 7-304: Generic interface and use of profiles for power drive systems - Mapping of profile type 4 to network technologies</ref> These IEC standards have been approved unanimously in September and October 2007 and were published as IS (International Standards) later that year. In IEC 61800-7, EtherCAT is a standardized communication technology for the [[SERCOS]] and [[CANopen]] drive profiles. EtherCAT is also part of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 15745-4,<ref>ISO 15745-4:2003/Amd 2:2007, ''Industrial automation systems and integration -- Open systems application integration framework'' - Part 4: Reference description for Ethernet-based control systems</ref> the standard for [[XML]] device description. Furthermore, [[SEMI]] has added EtherCAT to its standards portfolio (E54.20)<ref>SEMI E54.20-1108 - ''Standard for Sensor/Actuator Network Communications for EtherCAT''</ref> and approved the technology for usage in semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing equipment. In April 2010, Edition 2 of IEC 61784-3<ref>IEC 61784-3 ''Industrial communication networks'' - Profiles - Part 3: Functional safety fieldbuses</ref> was accepted, which contains the Safety over EtherCAT Protocol. In September 2008, the EtherCAT Installation Profile was submitted to IEC 61784-5.<ref>IEC 61784-5 ''Industrial communication networks'' - Profiles - Part 5: Installation of fieldbuses</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation\n  | last1= B\u00fcttner| first1= H.\n  | last2= Janssen| first2= D.\n  | last3= Rostan | first3= M.\n  | title = EtherCAT - the Ethernet fieldbus\n  | journal = PC Control Magazine\n  | volume = 3  | pages = 14\u201319  | year = 2003\n  | url = https://www.pc-control.net/pdf/032003/pcc_0303_d.pdf\n  }}\n\n*{{Citation\n  | last1= Janssen| first1= D.\n  | last2= B\u00fcttner| first2= H.\n  | title = Real-time Ethernet: the EtherCAT solution\n  | journal = Computing & Control Engineering Journal\n  | volume = 15  | pages = 16\u201321  | year = 2004\n | doi= 10.1049/cce:20040104\n }}\n\n* {{Citation\n  | last1= Rostan| first1= M.\n  | title = SEMI Technical Symposium: Innovations in Semiconductor Manufacturing\n  | year = 2004\n  | place = San Francisco, CA, USA\n  | publisher = SEMI\n  | url = http://www.ethercat.org/pdf/english/Ethernet_for_Semi_0607.pdf\n  }}\n* {{Citation\n  | last1= Potra | first1= S.\n  | last2= Sebestyen| first2= G.\n  | title = EtherCAT Protocol Implementation Issues on an Embedded Linux Platform\n  | work = IEEE-TTTC International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics AQTR 2006\n  | year = 2006\n  | pages = 420\u2013425\n  | place = Cluj-Napora, Romania\n  | publisher = IEEE\n}}\n\n*{{Citation\n  | last1= Robertz | first1= S.

The data sequence is independent of the physical order of the nodes in the network; addressing can be in any order. [[Broadcast]], [[multicast]] and communication between slaves is possible, but must be initiated by the master device. If IP [[routing]] is required, the EtherCAT protocol can be inserted into [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]] datagrams.

Combined with the functional principle this makes EtherCAT a high performance distributed I/O system: Process data exchange with 1000 distributed [[Digital data|digital]] I/O takes about 30 \u03bcs, which is typical for a transfer of 125 [[byte]] over 100Mbit/s Ethernet. Data for and from 100 [[Servomechanism|servo]] axis can be updated with up to 10&nbsp;kHz. Typical network update rates are 1\u201330&nbsp;kHz, but EtherCAT can be used with slower cycle times, too, if the DMA load is too high.\n\nThe bandwidth utilization is maximized, as each node and each data do not require a separate frame. Thus, extremely short cycle times of \u2264 100 \u03bcs are achievable. By using the full-duplex features of [[100BASE-TX]], effective data rates of more than 100 Mbit/s (> 90% user data rate of 2x100 Mbit/s) can be achieved.\n\nThe EtherCAT technology principle is scalable and not bound to 100 Mbit/s. A future extension to [[Gigabit]] Ethernet is possible, but is not in preparation at the moment since the EtherCAT performance is sufficient at 100 Mbit/s.\n\n=== Topology ===\nUsing full-[[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]] Ethernet physical layers, the EtherCAT slave controllers close an open [[Computer port (software)|port]] automatically and return the Ethernet frame if no [[Downstream (computer science)|downstream]] device is detected. Slave devices may have one, two, or more ports. Due to these features EtherCAT enables a multitude of [[network topologies]], including line, tree, ring, star, or any combination thereof. The protocol also enables a multitude of communication features such as cable redundancy, Hot Connect of segments, change of devices during operation, or even master redundancy with Hot Standby.\n\nThus the combination of the topology variations and different network architectures, e.g. sub-ordinated or neighboring control systems with consistent synchronization, enables numerous possibilities. Additional [[switches]] are not required. The physics of Ethernet allow a cable length of up to 100&nbsp;m (300&nbsp;ft) between two nodes, so the E-bus ([[LVDS]]) is only intended for use as the physical layer for modular devices. For each cable path, the signal variant can be chosen individually. For higher distances, or the complete [[galvanic isolation]] between two slaves, [[fiber optic]] cables are used. With single-mode fiber, distances up to 20&nbsp;km between two nodes can be bridged. Since a total of 65,535 nodes per network segment can be connected, the network extension is nearly unlimited.\n\n=== Synchronization ===\nFor synchronization a distributed clock mechanism is applied, which leads to very low jitter, significantly less than 1 \u03bcs, even if the communication cycle jitters, which is equivalent to the IEEE 1588 [[Precision Time Protocol]] standard (PTP). Therefore, EtherCAT does not require special hardware in the master device and can be implemented in software on any standard Ethernet MAC, even without dedicated communication coprocessor.\n\nThe typical process of establishing a distributed clock is initiated by the master by sending a broadcast to all slaves to a certain address. Upon reception of this message, all slaves will [[Latch (electronic)|latch]] the value of their internal clock twice, once when the message is received and once when it returns (remember EtherCAT has a [[ring topology]]). The master can then read all latched values and calculate the delay for each slave. This process can be repeated as many times as required to reduce [[jitter]] and average out values. Total delays are calculated for each slave depending on their position in the slave-ring and will be uploaded to an offset register. Finally the master issues a broadcast readwrite on the system clock, which will make the first slave the reference clock and forcing all other slaves to set their internal clock appropriately with the now known offset.\n\nTo keep the clocks synchronised after initialization, the master or slave must regularly send out the broadcast again to counter any effects of speed difference between the internal clocks of each slave. Each slave should adjust the speed of their internal clock or implement an internal correction mechanism whenever they have to adjust.\n\nThe system clock is specified as a 64 bit counter with a base unit of 1ns starting at January 1, 2000, 0:00.\n\n=== Diagnosis ===\nThe fast, precise detection of disturbances is one of many diagnostic features of EtherCAT.\n\nBit errors during transmission are detected reliably by the analysis of the [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] check sum: the 32 bit CRC polynomial has a minimum [[Hamming distance]] of 4. Besides the [[error detection]] and localization protocol, the transmission physics and topology of the EtherCAT system allow individual quality monitoring of every single transmission path. The automated analysis of the according error counters enables the exact localization of critical network segments.\n\nMore info to follow in the chapter titled \"Monitoring\".\n\n=== Device Profiles ===\nThe device profiles describe the application parameters and functional behavior of the devices, including device-specific state machines. The following software interfaces are provided for existing device profiles. Thus, the migration to EtherCAT by adjusting the firmware and the hardware is simplified significantly. \n\n==== CAN application protocol over EtherCAT (CoE) ====\n[[CANopen]] devices and application profiles are available for an extensive selection of device categories and applications: I/O modules, drives (e.g., drive profile CiA 402 standardized as IEC 61800-7-201/301), encoders (CiA 406), proportional valves, hydraulic controllers (CiA 408), or application profiles. In this case, EtherCAT replaces CAN.\n\n==== Servodrive-Profile over EtherCAT (SoE) ====\n[[SERCOS]] interface is a powerful real-time communication interface, ideal for demanding motion control applications. The SERCOS profile for servo drives and communication technology are standardized in IEC 61800-7. This standard also contains the mapping of the SERCOS servo drive profile to EtherCAT (IEC 61800-7-304).\n\n=== Other Protocols ===\n\n==== Ethernet over EtherCAT (EoE) ====\nAny Ethernet device can be connected within the EtherCAT segment via switch ports. The Ethernet frames are [[Tunneling protocol|tunneled]] via the EtherCAT protocol, as is normal for internet protocols (e.g., [[TCP/IP]], [[VPN]], [[PPPoE]] (DSL), etc.). The EtherCAT network is fully transparent for the Ethernet devices, and the real-time features of EtherCAT are not disturbed.\n\n==== Functional Safety: Safety over EtherCAT (FSoE) ====\nIn parallel to the development of EtherCAT, a fieldbus-independent safety protocol has been developed. For EtherCAT, it is available as \"Safety over EtherCAT\" (FSoE = Fail Safe over EtherCAT). With FSoE, [[functional safety]] with EtherCAT can be realized. The protocol as well as the implementation are certified by [[T\u00dcV]] and meet the requirements of the Safety Integrity Level 3 according to [[IEC 61508]]. Since 2010, Safety over EtherCAT is internationally standardized to IEC 61784-3-12.\nEtherCAT provides a single-channel communication system for transferring safe and non-safe information. The transport medium is regarded as a black channel,<ref>Verhappen, Ian. [http://www.controlglobal.com/articles/2011/HiddenNetwork1102.html \"The Hidden Network\"], Feb 14, 2011</ref> and thus is not included in safety considerations.\n\n=== Monitoring ===\nSince EtherCAT uses standard Ethernet frames according to IEEE 802.3, any standard Ethernet tool can be used to monitor the EtherCAT communication. Additionally, there is free-of-charge parser software for [[Wireshark]] (formerly Ethereal, an open source monitoring tool) and the [[Microsoft]] network monitor, with which recorded EtherCAT data traffic can be comfortably prepared and displayed.\n\n=== Gateways ===\nBy using gateways, existing networks such as [[CANopen]], [[DeviceNet]], or [[Profibus]], can be integrated into the EtherCAT environment seamlessly. Furthermore, gateways provide a trip-free migration path from a traditional fieldbus to EtherCAT, reducing further investment costs.\n\nThanks to the performance of EtherCAT, communication with external [[fieldbus]] masters is as fast as with traditional cards connected via [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] or other backbone buses. Since decentralized fieldbus interfaces lead to shorter extensions, they can be operated with even higher baud rates than would have been possible with the traditional architecture.\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n=== General ===\nEtherCAT Technology Group (ETG) encourages and expects companies that develop EtherCAT products to join ETG, so that they can get an EtherCAT Vendor-ID, get access to the full documentation, to the developers forum and to the slave stack code, that Beckhoff provides free of charge to ETG members.\n\n=== Master ===\nMasters can be implemented as a software solution on any Ethernet MAC. Different manufacturers provide code for different operating systems, including several open-source projects.\n\nDue to the relocated mapping on the slave hardware, demands are reduced for CPU performance of the master. The master already contains the data as a readily sorted process image.\n\n=== Slave ===\nContrary to the operation of standard Ethernet, the slaves process the EtherCAT frames on the fly. This requires the use of hardware-integrated EtherCAT Slave Controllers (ESC) in the slaves. ESCs are also available as [[ASIC]]s or based on [[FPGA]]s. Since the beginning of 2012, standard [[microprocessors]] with EtherCAT slave interfaces are also available.\n\nFor simple devices, no additional microcontroller is required. In more complex devices, however, the communication performance of EtherCAT is nearly independent of the performance of the used controller. Thus the requirements for the microcontroller are determined by the local application, e.g. the drive control.\n\nThere is a choice of development boards, both from the EtherCAT Slave Controller suppliers and from third party vendors. There are also open-source projects for EtherCAT slave device development boards, such as SOES and ArduCAT.\n\n== Application Examples ==\nTypical application fields for EtherCAT are machine controls (e.g. semiconductor tools, metal forming, packaging, injection molding, assembly systems, printing machines, robotics). Remote controlled hump yard facilities used in the railroad industry.\n\n=== Control and regulation ===\nFor the control and regulation of physical processes, high data integrity, [[data security]], and synchronicity is required. EtherCAT has been designed especially for these kinds of applications and meets all demands for fast controls.\n\n=== Measurement systems ===\nModern [[measurement]] systems are characterized by multi-channeling, synchronicity, and accuracy. Due to the advanced protocol features of EtherCAT, efficient synchronous data throughput is assured. The network features based on Ethernet enable a measurement network with distributed measurement modules.\n\n== EtherCAT Technology Group ==\nThe EtherCAT Technology Group (ETG) was established in 2003, and is the industrial Ethernet user organization with the most members in the world today.<ref name=\"ETG Members List\">ETG Members List, https://www.ethercat.org/en/members.php</ref> A wide range of industrial controls vendors, OEMs, machine builders, and technology organizations from around the world constitute the ETG member roster.\nThe ETG offers its members implementation support and training, organizes interoperability tests (often called \"Plug Fests\"<ref>EtherCAT Plug Fests, https://www.ethercat.org/en/plug_fest.htm</ref>), and promotes the development and distribution of the technology, supported by its members and the teams working in offices in Germany, China, Japan, Korea, and North America.\nETG end users span numerous industries, with machine builders and suppliers of powerful control technology joining forces to support and promote EtherCAT technology. The variety of industries guarantees optimal preparation of EtherCAT for the widest range of applications<ref>EtherCAT Application Articles, https://www.ethercat.org/en/downloads.html?tf=Applications</ref>. System partners give qualified feedback for the simple integration of hardware and software modules in all required equipment classes.\nThe EtherCAT Conformance Test Tool (CTT),<ref>EtherCAT Conformance Test Tool, https://www.ethercat.org/en/ctt.htm</ref> developed with the assistance of ETG member companies, ensures the [[interoperability]] and protocol [[conformity]] of EtherCAT devices.\n\n== International Standardization ==\nThe EtherCAT Technology Group is an official liaison partner of the IEC ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]]) working groups for digital communication. The EtherCAT specification was published as IEC/PAS 62407<ref>IEC/PAS 62407 (Ed 1.0), ''Real-time Ethernet control automation technology (EtherCAT)''</ref> in 2005, which was removed end of 2007 since EtherCAT had been integrated into the international fieldbus standards IEC 61158<ref>IEC 61158-2 (Ed.4.0), ''Industrial communication networks - Fieldbus specifications'' - Part 2: Physical layer specification and service definition</ref><ref>IEC 61158-3/4/5/6-12 (Ed.1.0), ''Industrial communication networks - Fieldbus specifications'' - Part 3-12: Data-link layer service definition - Part 4-12: Data-link layer protocol specification - Part 5-12: Application layer service definition - Part 6-12: Application layer protocol specification -Type 12 elements (EtherCAT)</ref> and IEC 61784-2<ref>IEC 61784-2 (Ed.1.0), ''Industrial communication networks - Profiles'' - Part 2: Additional fieldbus profiles for real-time networks based on ISO/IEC 8802-3</ref> as well as into the drive profile standard IEC 61800-7.<ref>IEC 61800-7-301/304 (Ed.1.0), ''Adjustable speed electrical power drive systems'' - Part 7-301: Generic interface and use of profiles for power drive systems - Mapping of profile type 1 to network technologies - Part 7-304: Generic interface and use of profiles for power drive systems - Mapping of profile type 4 to network technologies</ref> These IEC standards have been approved unanimously in September and October 2007 and were published as IS (International Standards) later that year. In IEC 61800-7, EtherCAT is a standardized communication technology for the [[SERCOS]] and [[CANopen]] drive profiles. EtherCAT is also part of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 15745-4,<ref>ISO 15745-4:2003/Amd 2:2007, ''Industrial automation systems and integration -- Open systems application integration framework'' - Part 4: Reference description for Ethernet-based control systems</ref> the standard for [[XML]] device description. Furthermore, [[SEMI]] has added EtherCAT to its standards portfolio (E54.20)<ref>SEMI E54.20-1108 - ''Standard for Sensor/Actuator Network Communications for EtherCAT''</ref> and approved the technology for usage in semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing equipment. In April 2010, Edition 2 of IEC 61784-3<ref>IEC 61784-3 ''Industrial communication networks'' - Profiles - Part 3: Functional safety fieldbuses</ref> was accepted, which contains the Safety over EtherCAT Protocol. In September 2008, the EtherCAT Installation Profile was submitted to IEC 61784-5.<ref>IEC 61784-5 ''Industrial communication networks'' - Profiles - Part 5: Installation of fieldbuses</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation\n  | last1= B\u00fcttner| first1= H.\n  | last2= Janssen| first2= D.\n  | last3= Rostan | first3= M.\n  | title = EtherCAT - the Ethernet fieldbus\n  | journal = PC Control Magazine\n  | volume = 3  | pages = 14\u201319  | year = 2003\n  | url = https://www.pc-control.net/pdf/032003/pcc_0303_d.pdf\n  }}\n\n*{{Citation\n  | last1= Janssen| first1= D.\n  | last2= B\u00fcttner| first2= H.\n  | title = Real-time Ethernet: the EtherCAT solution\n  | journal = Computing & Control Engineering Journal\n  | volume = 15  | pages = 16\u201321  | year = 2004\n | doi= 10.1049/cce:20040104\n }}\n\n* {{Citation\n  | last1= Rostan| first1= M.\n  | title = SEMI Technical Symposium: Innovations in Semiconductor Manufacturing\n  | year = 2004\n  | place = San Francisco, CA, USA\n  | publisher = SEMI\n  | url = http://www.ethercat.org/pdf/english/Ethernet_for_Semi_0607.pdf\n  }}\n* {{Citation\n  | last1= Potra | first1= S.\n  | last2= Sebestyen| first2= G.\n  | title = EtherCAT Protocol Implementation Issues on an Embedded Linux Platform\n  | work = IEEE-TTTC International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics AQTR 2006\n  | year = 2006\n  | pages = 420\u2013425\n  | place = Cluj-Napora, Romania\n  | publisher = IEEE\n}}\n\n*{{Citation\n  | last1= Robertz | first1= S.

Some games will have the Karma Gaming Engine, a feature intended to provide players of all skill levels with a fair level of competition against each other by dynamically adjusting the difficulty for players based on how well they are doing in the game.

[[3D computer graphics|3D]] games will be allowed, as long as they are easy to play and easy to learn. Intellivision Entertainment is providing studios with any resources they need to develop games to put in their curated library of games. All games must have features exclusive to the console, and must be rated E or E10+ by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]], or PEGI 3 or PEGI 7 by [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]]. Intellivision Entertainment plan to release a mixture of completely new games, updated classic games and motion control games for the Amico. Updated versions of many of the popular classic Intellivision games will be available with improved graphics and sound and, unlike previous Intellivision compilations, will include some previous third-party licenses, such as ''[[Tron: Deadly Discs]]''.

Robert was their only child to survive; a younger son, Richard Henry, was born with a spinal deformity and died before his first birthday.

With a curiosity about nature, he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. Essentially a country boy, he loved the outdoors and hiking with his father on trips to Worcester and became an excellent marksman with a rifle.<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|63,64}} In 1898, his mother contracted tuberculosis and they moved back to Worcester for the clear air. On Sundays, the family attended the Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16}}\n\n===Childhood experiment===\nWith the [[electrification]] of American cities in the 1880s, the young Goddard became interested in science\u2014specifically, engineering and technology. When his father showed him how to generate static electricity on the family's carpet, the five-year-old's imagination was sparked. Robert experimented, believing he could jump higher if the [[zinc]] from a battery could be charged by scuffing his feet on the gravel walk. But, holding the zinc, he could jump no higher than usual.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp |15}}<ref name=\"isbn0-58602-966-4\">{{cite book\n|editor=Clarke, Arthur C.\n|title=The Coming of the Space Age\n|publisher=Panther Science\n|location=London\n|year=1970\n|page =[https://archive.org/details/comingofspaceage1970clar/page/119 119]\n|isbn=0-586-02966-4\n|url=https://archive.org/details/comingofspaceage1970clar|url-access=registration\n}}</ref> Goddard halted the experiments after a warning from his mother that if he succeeded, he could \"go sailing away and might not be able to come back.\"<ref name=\"Clary\">{{cite book\n  |last=Clary  |first=David A.\n  |title=Rocket Man: Robert H.

He became a thorough diarist and documenter of his work\u2014a skill that would greatly benefit his later career. These interests merged at age 16, when Goddard attempted to construct a balloon out of [[aluminum]], shaping the raw metal in his home workshop, and filling it with hydrogen. After nearly five weeks of methodical, documented efforts, he finally abandoned the project, remarking, \"... balloon will not go up. ... Aluminum is too heavy. Failior {{sic}} crowns enterprise.\" However, the lesson of this failure did not restrain Goddard's growing determination and confidence in his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|21}} He wrote in 1927, \"I imagine an innate interest in mechanical things was inherited from a number of ancestors  who were machinists.\" <ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|7}}\n\n===Cherry tree dream===\nHe became interested in space when he read [[H. G. Wells]]' science fiction classic ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' at 16 years old.<ref name=\"GoddardBio\">{{Cite web | url = http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/people/biographies/goddard.pdf | publisher = [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] | title = Goddard Biography}}.</ref> His dedication to pursuing space flight became fixed on October 19, 1899. The 17-year-old Goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs. He was transfixed by the sky, and his imagination grew. He later wrote:\n\n{{quote |On this day I climbed a tall cherry tree at the back of the barn ... and as I looked toward the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the ''possibility'' of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet. I have several photographs of the tree, taken since, with the little ladder I made to climb it, leaning against it.\nIt seemed to me then that a weight whirling around a horizontal shaft, moving more rapidly above than below, could furnish lift by virtue of the greater centrifugal force at the top of the path.\n\nI was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended. Existence at last seemed very purposive.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|26}}<ref name=\"NASA Goddard\" >{{cite web\n  | url = http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sgoddard.htm\n  | title = Robert Goddard and His Rockets\n  | publisher = NASA}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the rest of his life, he observed October 19 as \"Anniversary Day\", a private commemoration of the day of his greatest inspiration.\n\n== Education and early studies ==\n\nThe young Goddard was a thin and frail boy, almost always in fragile health. He suffered from stomach problems, pleurisy, colds, and bronchitis, and he fell two years behind his classmates. He became a voracious reader, regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16,19}}\n\n===Aerodynamics and motion===\n\nGoddard's interest in aerodynamics led him to study some of [[Samuel Langley]]'s scientific papers in the periodical ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]''. In these papers, Langley wrote that birds flap their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air. Inspired by these articles, the teenage Goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home, noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight. He noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers, which he called the birds' equivalent of [[ailerons]]. He took exception to some of Langley's conclusions and in 1901 wrote a letter to ''St. Nicholas'' magazine<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|5}} with his own ideas. The editor of  ''St. Nicholas'' declined to publish Goddard's letter, remarking that birds fly with a certain amount of intelligence and that \"machines will not act with such intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|31}} Goddard disagreed, believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence.\n\nAround this time, Goddard read [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', and found that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] applied to motion in space. He wrote later about his own tests of the Law:\n\n{{quote |I began to realize that there might be something after all to Newton's Laws. The Third Law was accordingly tested, both with devices suspended by rubber bands and by devices on floats, in the little brook back of the barn, and the said law was verified conclusively. It made me realize that if a way to navigate space were to be discovered, or invented, it would be the result of a knowledge of physics and mathematics.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}}}}\n\n===Academics===\nAs his health improved, Goddard continued his formal schooling as a 19-year-old sophomore at [[South High Community School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm|title=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Collection \u2013 Archives and Special Collections \u2013 Clark University|work=clarku.edu}}</ref> in Worcester in 1901. He excelled in his coursework, and his peers twice elected him class president. Making up for  lost time, he studied books on mathematics, astronomy, mechanics and composition from the school library.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}} At his graduation ceremony in 1904, he gave his class oration as [[valedictorian]]. In his speech, entitled \"On Taking Things for Granted\", Goddard included a section that would become emblematic of his life:\n\n<blockquote>[J]ust as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|19}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGoddard enrolled at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in 1904.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|41}} He quickly impressed the head of the physics department, A. Wilmer Duff, with his thirst for knowledge, and Duff took him on as a laboratory assistant and tutor.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|42}} At WPI, Goddard joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity and began a long courtship with high school classmate Miriam Olmstead, an honor student who had graduated with him as [[salutatorian]]. Eventually, she and Goddard were engaged, but they drifted apart and ended the engagement around 1909.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp |51}}\n\nGoddard received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in physics from Worcester Polytechnic in 1908,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics, he began his graduate studies at [[Clark University]] in Worcester in the fall of 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/library/collections/rgoddard.html | publisher =WPI George C. Gordon Library | title = Robert Goddard |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> Goddard received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in physics from Clark University in 1910, and then stayed at Clark to complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1911. He spent another year at Clark as an honorary fellow in physics, and in 1912 he accepted a research fellowship at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Frist Campus Center|Palmer Physical Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|56\u201358}}\n\n===First scientific writings===\nThe high school student summed up his ideas on space travel in a proposed article, \"The Navigation of Space,\" which he submitted to the ''Popular Science News''. The journal's editor returned it, saying that they could not use it \"in the near future.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|34}}\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Goddard wrote a paper proposing a method for balancing [[airplane]]s using gyro-stabilization. He submitted the idea to ''[[Scientific American]]'', which published the paper in 1907. Goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal of a way to automatically stabilize aircraft in flight.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} His proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional [[gyroscope]]s.\n\nWhile studying physics at WPI, ideas came to Goddard's mind that sometimes seemed impossible, but he was compelled to record them for future investigation. He wrote that \"there was something inside which simply would not stop working.\" He purchased some cloth-covered notebooks and began filling them with a variety of thoughts, mostly concerning his dream of space travel.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|11\u201313}} He considered centrifugal force, radio waves, magnetic reaction, solar energy, atomic energy, ion or electrostatic propulsion and other methods to reach space. After experimenting with solid fuel rockets he was convinced by 1909 that chemical-propellant engines were the answer.<ref name= \"Frank\" />{{rp|11\u201312}} A particularly complex concept was set down in June 1908: Sending a camera around distant planets, guided by measurements of gravity along the trajectory, and returning to earth.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|14}}\n\nHis first writing on the possibility of a liquid-fueled rocket came on February 2, 1909. Goddard had begun to study ways of increasing a rocket's efficiency using methods differing from conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]]s. He wrote in his notebook about using liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. He believed that 50 percent efficiency could be achieved with these liquid propellants (i.e., half of the heat energy of combustion converted to the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|55}}\n\n==First patents==\nIn the decades around 1910, radio was a new technology, fertile for innovation. In 1912, while working at Princeton University, Goddard investigated the effects of radio waves on insulators.<ref>Goddard, Robert H. \"On ponderomotive force upon a dielectric which carries a displacement current in a magnetic field\", ''[[Physical Review]]'', Vol. 6(2), pp. 99\u2013120 (August 1914).</ref> In order to generate radio-frequency power, he invented a vacuum tube with a beam deflection<ref>{{US patent|1159209}}</ref> that operated like a cathode-ray oscillator tube. His patent on this tube, which predated that of [[Lee De Forest]], became central in the suit between [[Arthur A. Collins]], whose small company made radio transmitter tubes, and [[AT&T]] and [[RCA]] over his use of [[vacuum tube]] technology.  Goddard accepted only a consultant's fee from Collins when the suit was dropped. Eventually the two big companies allowed the country's growing electronics industry to use the De Forest patents freely.<ref>McElroy, Gil, \"The Collins 45A \u2013 How Art Collins met Robert Goddard\", ''QST'', Vol. 81(2), pp. 44\u201346 (February 1997).</ref>\n\n===Rocket math===\nBy 1912 he had in his spare time, using calculus, developed the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. In effect he had independently developed the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] published a decade earlier in Russia. For vertical flight he included the effects of gravity and aerodynamic drag.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|136}}\n\nHis first goal was to build a [[Rocketsonde|sounding rocket]] with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that \"[I]n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|65,67,74,101}}\n\n===Fight to survive===\nIn early 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]] and had to leave his position at Princeton. He then returned to Worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery at home. His doctors did not expect him to live. He decided he should spend time outside in the fresh air and walk for exercise, and he gradually improved.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61\u201364}} When his nurse discovered some of his notes in his bed, he kept them, arguing, \"I have to live to do this work.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|66}}\n\nIt was during this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most important work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. He was afraid that nobody would be able to read his scribbling should he \nsuccumb.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n===Foundational patents===\nIn the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, [[patents]] were considered essential, not only to protect original work but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did\u2014and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote descriptions concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent lawyer in  Worcester who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|63\u201370}}\n\nIn 1914, his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered. The first, {{US patent|1102653}}, described a multi-stage rocket fueled with a solid \"explosive material.\" The second, {{US patent|1103503}}, described a rocket fueled with a [[solid fuel]] (explosive material) or with [[liquid propellant]]s (gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide). The two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry.<ref name=\"Sea and Sky: Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.seasky.org/spacexp/sky5d1.html\n  | title = Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\n  | publisher = Sea and Sky}}</ref><ref name=\"Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.russianspaceweb.com/chronology_XX.html\n  | title = Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\n  | publisher = Russian Space Web}}</ref> Overall, 214 patents were published, some posthumously by his wife.\n\n== Early rocketry research ==\n[[File:Robert Goddard footage.ogv|thumb|right|Video clips of Goddard's launches and other events in his life]]\nIn the fall of 1914, Goddard's health had improved, and he accepted a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at Clark University.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|73}} His position at Clark allowed him to further his rocketry research. He ordered numerous supplies that could be used to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests. Goddard's first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at Clark.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|74}} The launch was loud and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor, and Goddard had to reassure him that his experiments, while being serious study, were also quite harmless. After this incident, Goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab, in order to limit any disturbance.\n\nAt the Clark physics lab, Goddard conducted static tests of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about two percent of the thermal energy in their fuel into thrust and kinetic energy. At this point he applied [[de Laval nozzle]]s, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the ''internal efficiency'' of the engine: the ratio of the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.)<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|130}} By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of {{nowrap|6728 feet (2051 meters) per second}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|75}} Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion (de Laval) nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|78}}\n\nFew would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space.

Webster, the world-renowned head of Clark's physics department,  Goddard arranged for the Smithsonian to publish the paper,  ''A Method...,'' which documented his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nWhile at Clark University, Goddard did research into solar power using a parabolic dish to concentrate the Sun's rays on a machined piece of [[quartz]], that was sprayed with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which then heated water and drove an electric generator. Goddard believed his invention had overcome all the obstacles that had previously defeated other scientists and inventors, and he had his findings published in the November 1929 issue of  ''Popular Science''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 \"A New Invention To Harness The Sun\"], ''Popular Science'', November 1929.</ref>\n\n===Goddard's military rocket===\nNot all of Goddard's early work was geared towards space travel. As the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country's universities began to lend their services to the war effort. Goddard believed his rocket research could be applied to many different military applications, including mobile artillery, field weapons and naval [[torpedo]]es. He made proposals to the Navy and Army. No record exists in his papers of any interest by the Navy to Goddard's inquiry. However, Army Ordnance was quite interested, and Goddard met several times with Army personnel.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nDuring this time, Goddard was also contacted, in early 1918, by a civilian industrialist in Worcester about the possibility of manufacturing rockets for the military. However, as the businessman's enthusiasm grew, so did Goddard's suspicion. Talks eventually broke down as Goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business. However, an [[Army Signal Corps]] officer tried to make Goddard cooperate, but he was called off by General [[George Squier]] of the Signal Corps who had been contacted by Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89\u201391}} Goddard became leery of working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to \"protect his ideas.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|152}} These events led to the Signal Corps sponsoring Goddard's work during World War I.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nGoddard proposed to the Army an idea for a tube-based rocket launcher as a light infantry weapon. The launcher concept became the precursor to the [[bazooka]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|92}} The rocket-powered, recoil-free weapon was the brainchild of Goddard as a side project (under Army contract) of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his [[tenure]] at [[Clark University]], and working at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] for security reasons, designed the tube-fired rocket for military use during World War I. He and his co-worker, Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]] successfully demonstrated his rocket to the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], on November 6, 1918, using two music stands for a launch platform. The Army was impressed, but the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Compi\u00e8gne Armistice]] was signed only five days later, and further development was discontinued as World War I ended.<ref name=\"NASA \u2013 Dr. Robert H.

Goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the U.S. Government at [[Indian Head, Maryland]],<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|121}} until 1923, but his focus had turned to other research involving rocket propulsion, including work with liquid fuels and liquid oxygen.\n\nLater, the former Clark University researcher Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]], and Army officers Col. [[Leslie Skinner]] and Lt. [[Edward Uhl]] continued Goddard's work on the bazooka. A [[shaped-charge]] warhead was attached to the rocket, leading to the tank-killing weapon used in World War II and to many other powerful rocket weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|305}}\n\n== ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes'' ==\n\nIn 1919 Goddard thought that it would be premature to disclose the results of his experiments because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report, updated with footnotes, that he had submitted in late 1916.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nIn late 1919, the Smithsonian published Goddard's groundbreaking work, ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''. The report describes Goddard's mathematical theories of rocket flight, his experiments with solid-fuel rockets, and the possibilities he saw of exploring Earth's atmosphere and beyond.

Included as a [[thought experiment]] was the idea of launching a rocket to the Moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required. Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash \"just visible\" from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.<ref name=\"Method\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Goddard|editor1-first=Esther C. |editor2-first=G.

He did, though, publish and talk about the rocket principle and [[sounding rockets]], since these subjects were not too \"far out.\" In a letter to the Smithsonian, dated March 1920, he discussed: photographing the Moon and planets from rocket-powered fly-by probes, sending messages to distant civilizations on inscribed metal plates, the use of solar energy in space, and the idea of high-velocity ion propulsion.

Although Goddard's discussion of targeting the moon was only a small part of the work as a whole (eight lines on the next to last page of 69 pages), and was intended as an illustration of the possibilities rather than a declaration of intent, the papers sensationalized his ideas to the point of misrepresentation and ridicule. Even the Smithsonian had to abstain from publicity because of the amount of ridiculous correspondence received from the general public.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|113}} David Lasser, who co-founded the [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS), wrote in 1931 that Goddard was subjected in the press to the \"most violent attacks.\"<ref name=\"Lasser\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Lasser|editor1-first=David |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Godwin |title=The Conquest of Space|year=2002|publisher=Apogee Books|location=Burlington, Ontario|isbn=1-896522-92-0|page=38}}</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 1920, a front-page story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon\", reported a Smithsonian press release about a \"multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket.\" The chief application envisaged was \"the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth's atmosphere\", the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since \"the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down.\" But it also mentioned a proposal \"to [send] to the dark part of the new moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope.

After one of Goddard's experiments in 1929, a local Worcester newspaper carried the mocking headline \"Moon rocket misses target by 238,799{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;miles.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|editor=Nelson, Craig\n|title=Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon\n|publisher=\n|location=\n|year=1713\n|pages=\n|isbn=9781101057735\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWMivGgbM7kC&pg=PT96 }}\n</ref>\n\nThough the unimaginitive of the public chuckled at the \"moon man,\" his groundbreaking paper was read seriously by many rocketeers in America, Europe, and Russia who were stirred to build their own rockets. This work was his most important contribution to the quest to \"aim for the stars.\" <ref name= \"Gainor\" />{{rp|50}}\n\nGoddard worked alone with just his team of mechanics and machinists for many years.  This was a result of the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists, and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use. Goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone, except during the two World Wars, which limited the impact of much of his work. Another limiting factor was the lack of support from the American government, military and academia, all failing to understand the value of the rocket to study the atmosphere and near space, and for military applications. As Germany became ever more war-like, he refused to communicate with German rocket experimenters, though he received more and more of their correspondence.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|131}}\n\n===='A Correction'====\nForty-nine years after its editorial mocking Goddard, on July 17, 1969\u2014the day after the launch of [[Apollo 11]]\u2014''The New York Times'' published a short item under the headline \"A Correction.\" The three-paragraph statement summarized its 1920 editorial and concluded:\n<blockquote>Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.<ref>''The New York Times'', July 17, 1969, p. 43,</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==First liquid-fueled flight==\n\nGoddard began considering liquid propellants, including hydrogen and oxygen, as early as 1909. He knew that hydrogen and oxygen was the most efficient fuel/oxidizer combination. Liquid hydrogen was not readily available in 1921, however, and he selected gasoline as the safest fuel to handle.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|13}}\n\n===First static tests===\n[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Robert Goddard, bundled against the cold weather of March 16, 1926, holds the launching frame of his most notable invention \u2014 the first liquid-fueled rocket.]]\nGoddard began experimenting with liquid oxidizer, [[liquid fuel rocket]]s in September 1921, and successfully tested the first liquid propellant engine in November 1923.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|520}} It had a cylindrical [[combustion chamber]], using impinging jets to mix and atomize [[liquid oxygen]] and [[gasoline]].<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|499\u2013500}}\n\nIn 1924\u201325, Goddard had problems developing a high-pressure [[piston pump]] to send fuel to the combustion chamber. He wanted to scale up the experiments, but his funding would not allow such growth. He decided to forego the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of [[inert gas]], a technique used today. The liquid oxygen, some of which evaporated,  provided its own pressure.\n\nOn December 6, 1925, he tested the simpler pressure feed system. He conducted a static test on the firing stand at the Clark University physics laboratory. The engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack. It was a major success for Goddard, proving that a liquid fuel rocket was possible.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|140}} The test moved Goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard conducted an additional test in December, and two more in January 1926. After that, he began preparing for a possible launch of the rocket system.\n\n===First flight===\nGoddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled ([[bipropellant rocket|gasoline and liquid oxygen]]) rocket on March 16, 1926, in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]]. Present at the launch were his crew chief Henry Sachs, Esther Goddard, and Percy Roope, who was Clark's assistant professor in the physics department. Goddard's diary entry of the event was notable for its understatement:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 16. Went to Auburn with S[achs] in am. E[sther] and Mr. Roope came out at 1 p.m. Tried rocket at 2.30. It rose 41 feet & went 184 feet, in 2.5 secs., after the lower half of the nozzle burned off. Brought materials to lab. ...<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis diary entry the next day elaborated:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 17, 1926. The first flight with a rocket using liquid propellants was made yesterday at Aunt Effie's farm in Auburn. ... \nEven though the release was pulled, the rocket did not rise at first, but the flame came out, and there was a steady roar. After a number of seconds it rose, slowly until it cleared the frame, and then at express train speed, curving over to the left, and striking the ice and snow, still going at a rapid rate.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe rocket, which was later dubbed \"Nell\", rose just 41&nbsp;feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended 184 feet away in a cabbage field,<ref>{{cite book|last=Streissguth|first=Thomas|title=Rocket man: the story of Robert Goddard|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37 37]|isbn=0-87614-863-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37}}</ref> but it was an important demonstration that liquid fuels and oxidizers were possible propellants for larger rockets. The launch site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]], the [[Goddard Rocket Launching Site]].\n\nViewers familiar with more modern rocket designs may find it difficult to distinguish the rocket from its launching apparatus in the well-known picture of \"Nell\". The complete rocket is significantly taller than Goddard but does not include the pyramidal support structure which he is grasping. The rocket's [[combustion chamber]] is the small cylinder at the top; the [[nozzle]] is visible beneath it. The fuel tank, which is also part of the rocket, is the larger cylinder opposite Goddard's torso. The fuel tank is directly beneath the nozzle and is protected from the motor's exhaust by an [[asbestos]] cone. Asbestos-wrapped aluminum tubes connect the motor to the tanks, providing both support and fuel transport.<ref>[http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf NASA, ''Discover NASA and You''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221503/http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}.</ref> This layout is no longer used, since the experiment showed that this was [[Pendulum rocket fallacy|no more stable]] than placing the combustion chamber and nozzle at the base. By May, after a series of modifications to simplify the plumbing, the combustion chamber and nozzle were placed in the now classic position, at the lower end of the rocket.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|259}}\n\nGoddard determined early that fins alone were not sufficient to stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory in the face of winds aloft and other disturbing forces. He added movable vanes in the exhaust, controlled by a gyroscope, to control and steer his rocket. (The Germans used this technique in their V-2.) He also introduced the more efficient swiveling engine in several rockets, basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|263\u20136}}\n\n==Lindbergh and Goddard==\n\nAfter launch of one of Goddard's rockets in July 1929 again gained the attention of the newspapers,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9tbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wlINAAAAIBAJ&dq=rocket%20accident&pg=4275%2C2780242 \"Giant Rocket Alarms Many\"], ''St. Joseph, Missouri Gazette'', July 18, 1929.</ref> [[Charles Lindbergh]] learned of his work in a ''New York Times'' article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of [[aviation]] (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step. After checking with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|141}} Professor Goddard met the aviator soon after in his office at Clark University.<ref name=\"lehm\">{{cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Milton|date=October 4, 1963|title=How Lindbergh Gave a Lift to Rocketry|journal=LIFE Magazine|volume=55|issue=14|pages=115\u2013127|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uFIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA115|accessdate=15 Mar 2010}}</ref> Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier's interest. He discussed his work openly with Lindbergh, forming an alliance that would last for the rest of his life. While having long since become reticent to share his ideas, Goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream, and whom he felt he could trust.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBy late 1929, Goddard had been attracting additional notoriety with each rocket launch. He was finding it increasingly difficult to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard's work and lent his famous name to Goddard's work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but impossible to find following the recent [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|U.S. stock market crash]] in October 1929.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\n===Guggenheim sponsorship===\nIn the spring of 1930, Lindbergh finally found an ally in the [[Guggenheim family]]. Financier [[Daniel Guggenheim]] agreed to fund Goddard's research over the next four years for a total of $100,000 (~${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1932|r=-5}}}} today). The Guggenheim family, especially [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry Guggenheim]], would continue to support Goddard's work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to [[Roswell, New Mexico]] <ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBecause of the military potential of the rocket, Goddard, Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, the Smithsonian Institution and others tried in 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II, to convince the Army and Navy of its value. Goddard's services were offered, but there was no interest, initially. Two young, imaginative military officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with Goddard just prior to the war. The Navy beat the Army to the punch and secured his services to build variable-thrust, liquid-fueled rocket engines for jet-assisted take-off (JATO) of aircraft.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|293\u2013297}} These rocket engines were the precursors to the larger throttlable rocket plane engines that helped launch the space age.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The X-Planes|last=Miller|first=Jay|publisher=Orion Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=43,128\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAstronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] wrote that his father, Edwin Aldrin Sr. \"was an early supporter of Robert Goddard.\"  The elder Aldrin was a student of physics under Goddard at Clark, and worked with Lindbergh to obtain the help of the Guggenheims. Buzz believed that if Goddard had received military support as von Braun's team had in Germany, American rocket technology would have developed much more rapidly in World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men from Earth|last=Aldrin|first=Buzz|last2=McConnell|first2=Malcolm|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1989|isbn=0-553-05374-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/ xx,21]|url=https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/}}</ref>\n\n===Lack of vision in the United States===\nBefore World War II there was a lack of vision and serious interest in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|719,746}} Between the World Wars, the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] was the main source of funding for Goddard's research.<ref name=\"Braun\" />{{rp|46,59,60}} Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian [[Eugene Emme]], but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans.<ref name=\"Emme\" />{{rp|63}} Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he \"would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race,\" and he wondered how soon the European \"theorists\" would begin to build rockets.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|136}}\nIn 1936, the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Berlin asked Charles Lindbergh to visit Germany and learn what he could of their progress in aviation. Although the Luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower, they were silent on the subject of rocketry. When Lindbergh told Goddard of this behavior, Goddard said, \"Yes, they must have plans for the rocket. When will our own people in Washington listen to reason?\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|272}}\n\nMost of the U.S.'s largest universities were also slow to realize rocketry's potential. Just before World War II, the head of the aeronautics department at MIT, at a meeting held by the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to discuss project funding, said that the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) \"can take the Buck Rogers Job [rocket research].\"<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=Sex and Rockets|year=1999|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|page=31}}</ref> In 1941, Goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from MIT but couldn't find one who was interested.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|326}}  There were some exceptions: MIT was at least teaching basic rocketry,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|264}} and Caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics. After the war, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker of MIT, having studied Goddard's patents, stated that \"Every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a Goddard rocket.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|363}}\n\nWhile away in Roswell, Goddard was still head of the physics department at Clark University, and Clark allowed him to devote most of his time to rocket research. Likewise, the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) permitted astronomer [[Samuel Herrick (astronomer)|Samuel Herrick]] to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named [[astrodynamics]]. Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of [[celestial mechanics]] \"to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation.\" Herrick's work contributed substantially to America's readiness to control flight of Earth satellites and send men to the Moon and back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vt/viblbv00753.xml|title=Samuel Herrick Papers 1930-1974|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Roswell, New Mexico==\n[[File:RobertHGoddardRocket TopDown.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lindbergh]] took this picture of Robert H.

He had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work, and Roswell seemed ideal. Here they would not endanger anyone, would not be bothered by the curious and would experience a more moderate climate (which was also better for Goddard's health).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|177}} The locals valued personal privacy, knew Goddard desired his, and when travelers asked where Goddard's facilities were located, they would likely be misdirected.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|261}}\n\nBy September 1931, his rockets had the now familiar appearance of a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] guidance and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] over 10&nbsp;years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|193\u20135}}\n\nA temporary loss of funding from the Guggenheims, as a result of the depression, forced Goddard in spring of 1932 to return to his much-loathed professorial responsibilities at Clark University.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clary |first1=David |title=Rocket Man |date=2003 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |isbn=978-0786887057 |pages=165\u2013166}}</ref> He remained at the university until the autumn of 1934, when funding resumed.<ref name=\"The Papers of Robert H.

Goddard\"/> Upon his return to Roswell, he began work on his A series of rockets, 4 to 4.5&nbsp;meters long, and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen. The gyroscopic control system was housed in the middle of the rocket, between the propellant tanks.<ref name=\"RockDev\">{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Robert and editors Esther C. Goddard and G. Edward Pendray|title=Rocket Development|year=1961|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|xv,15\u201346}}\n\nThe A-4 used a simpler pendulum system for guidance, as the gyroscopic system was being repaired. On March 8, 1935, it flew up to 1,000 feet, then turned into the wind and, Goddard reported, \"roared in a powerful descent across the prairie, at close to, or at, the speed of sound.\" On March 28, 1935, the A-5 successfully flew vertically to an altitude of (0.91&nbsp;mi; 4,800&nbsp;ft) using his gyroscopic guidance system. It then turned to a nearly horizontal path, flew 13,000 feet and achieved a maximum speed of 550 miles per hour. Goddard was elated because the guidance system kept the rocket on a vertical path so well.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|208}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|978\u20139}}\n\nIn 1936\u20131939, Goddard began work on the K and L series rockets, which were much more massive and designed to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624&nbsp;lbs in February 1936.<ref name=\"Braun\">{{cite book|last=Von Braun|first=Wernher and Frederick I. Ordway III|title=History of Rocketry and Space Travel, revised Edition|year=1969|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Co.|location=New York|page=50}}</ref>  This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around the outside of the combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Goddard returned to a smaller design, and his L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7&nbsp;mi; 8,900&nbsp;ft), the highest of any of his rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|71\u2013148}}\n\nGoddard experimented with many of the features of today's large rockets, such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles. In November 1936, he flew the world's first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four combustion chambers, reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through. This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|96}} In July 1937 he replaced the guidance vanes with a movable tail section containing a single combustion chamber, as if on gimbals ([[thrust vectoring]]). The flight was of low altitude, but a large disturbance, probably caused by a change in the wind velocity, was corrected back to vertical. In an August test the flight path was corrected seven times by the movable tail and was captured on film by Mrs Goddard.<ref name= \"RockDev\" />{{rp|113\u2013116}}\n\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Goddard worked on the P series of rockets, which used propellant turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet. The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|187\u2013215}}\n\nWhen Goddard mentioned the need for turbopumps, Harry Guggenheim suggested that he contact pump manufacturers to aid him. None were interested, as the development cost of these miniature pumps was prohibitive. Goddard's team was therefore left on its own and from September 1938 to June 1940 designed and tested the small turbopumps and gas generators to operate the turbines. Esther later said that the pump tests were \"the most trying and disheartening phase of the research.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274\u20135}}\n\nGoddard was able to flight-test many of his rockets, but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. Goddard did not consider them failures, however, because he felt that he always learned something from a test.<ref name=\"Gainor\" />{{rp|45}} Most of his work involved static tests, which are a standard procedure today, before a flight test. He wrote to a correspondent:  \"It is not a simple matter to differentiate unsuccessful from successful experiments. ... [Most] work that is finally successful is the result of a series of unsuccessful tests in which difficulties are gradually eliminated.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274}}\n\n===General Jimmy Doolittle===\n[[Jimmy Doolittle]] was introduced to the field of space science at an early point in its history. He recalls in his autobiography, \"I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation. ... While with Shell Oil I worked with him on the development of a type of fuel. ... \"<ref name=Jimmy>{{cite book|last1=Doolittle|first1=James H. \"Jimmy\"|title=I Could Never Be So Lucky Again|date=1991|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|page=515}}</ref> Harry Guggenheim and Charles Lindbergh arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle flew himself to Roswell in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard's shop and a \"short course\" in rocketry.  He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard's rocket. In closing he said, \"interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away\u2014who knows!\" In July 1941, he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in his rocket propulsion research. The Army was interested only in JATO at this point. However, Doolittle and Lindbergh were concerned about the state of rocketry in the US, and Doolittle remained in touch with Goddard.<ref name=Method/>{{rp|1208\u201316,1334,1443}}\n\nShortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke concerning Goddard to an [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS) conference at which a  large number interested in rocketry attended.

Simply reaching high altitudes was not his primary goal; he was trying, with a methodical approach, to perfect his liquid fuel engine and subsystems such as guidance and control so that his rocket could eventually achieve high altitudes without tumbling in the rare atmosphere, providing a stable vehicle for the experiments it would eventually carry. He had built the necessary turbopumps and was on the verge of building larger, lighter, more reliable rockets to reach extreme altitudes carrying scientific instruments when World War II intervened and changed the path of American history. He hoped to return to his experiments in Roswell after the war.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|206,230,330\u20131}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|923\u20134}}\n\nThough by the end of the Roswell years much of his technology had been replicated independently by others, he introduced new developments to rocketry that were used in this new enterprise: lightweight turbopumps, variable-thrust engine (in U.S.), engine with multiple combustion chambers and nozzles, and curtain cooling of combustion chamber.\n\nAlthough Goddard had brought his work in rocketry to the attention of the [[United States Army]], between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was no money for new experimental weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|297}} German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard's work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited [[military attach\u00e9]] to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the ''[[Abwehr]]'' in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch.

Fischer, who had visited Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, believed Goddard was doing valuable work and was able to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a [[PBY]] seaplane. By May 1942, he had a unit that could meet the Navy's requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February, he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack. Goddard wrote to Guggenheim that \"I can think of nothing that would give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|322,328\u20139,331,335,337}}\n\nIn April, Fischer notified Goddard that the Navy wanted to do all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, \"Esther, don't you know there's a war on?\" Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, \"I was wondering when you would ask me.\" Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger\u2014a long range missile\u2014but JATO was all he could manage, hoping for a greater project later.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|338,9}} It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|209}}\n\nGoddard and his team had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he received a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August, his engine was producing 800&nbsp;lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try, the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature at the last minute, there was no explosion and no lives were lost. The problem's cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, \"Putting [Goddard's] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|344\u201350}}\n\nMilton Lehman notes:\n<blockquote>\nIn its 1942 crash effort to perfect an aircraft booster, the Navy was beginning to learn its way in rocketry. In similar efforts, the Army Air Corps was also exploring the field [with [[GALCIT]]]. Compared to Germany's massive program, these beginnings were small, yet essential to later progress. They helped develop a nucleus of trained American rocket engineers, the first of the new breed who would follow the professor into the Age of Space.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|350}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn August, 1943, President Atwood at Clark wrote to Goddard that the University was losing the acting head of the Physics Department, was taking on \"emergency work\" for the Army, and he was to \"report for duty or declare the position vacant.\" Goddard replied that he believed he was needed by he Navy, was nearing retirement age, and was unable to lecture because of his throat problem, which did not allow allow him to talk above a whisper. He regretfully resigned as Professor of Physics and expressed his deepest appreciation for all Atwood and the Trustees had done for him and indirectly for the war effort.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1509\u201311}} In June he had gone to see a throat specialist in Baltimore, who recommended that he not talk at all, to give his throat a rest.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1503}}\n  \nThe station, under Lt Commander Robert Truax, was developing another JATO engine in 1942 that used [[hypergolic propellant]]<nowiki/>s, eliminating the need for an ignition system.

Goddard made improvements to the engine, and in November it was demonstrated to the Navy and some officials from Washington. Fischer invited the spectators to operate the controls; the engine blasted out over the Severn at full throttle with no hesitation, idled, and roared again at various thrust levels. The test was perfect, exceeding the Navy's requirements. The unit was able to be stopped and restarted, and it produced a medium thrust of 600 pounds for 15 seconds and a full thrust of 1,000 pounds for over 15 seconds. A Navy Commander commented that \"It was like being Thor, playing with thunderbolts.\" Goddard had produced the essential propulsion control system of the rocket plane. The Goddards celebrated by attending the Army-Navy football game and attending the Fischers' cocktail party.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|350\u20131}}\n\nThis engine was the basis of the Curtiss-Wright XLR25-CW-1 two-chamber, 15,000-pound variable-thrust engine that powered the [[Bell X-2]] research rocket plane. After World War II, Goddard's team and some patents went to [[Curtiss-Wright]] Corporation. \"Although his death in August 1945 prevented him from participating in the actual development of this engine, it was a direct descendent of his design.\"<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|1606}} Clark University and the Guggenheim Foundation received the royalties from the use of the patents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/curtiss-wright-xlr25-cw-1/page/2/|title=This Day In Aviation|last=Swopes|first=Began R.|date=2017|access-date=2 Sep 2019}}</ref>  In September 1956, the X-2 was the first plane to reach 126,000 feet altitude and in its last flight exceeded Mach 3 (3.2) before losing control and crashing.

Though the design details were not exactly the same, the basic design of the V-2 was similar to one of Goddard's rockets. The V-2, however, was technically far more advanced than the most successful of the rockets designed and tested by Goddard. The [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center|Peenem\u00fcnde rocket group]] led by [[Wernher von Braun]] may have benefited from the pre-1939 contacts to a limited extent,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|387\u20138}} but had also started from the work of their own space pioneer, [[Hermann Oberth]]; they also had the benefit of intensive state funding, large-scale production facilities (using slave labor), and repeated flight-testing that allowed them to refine their designs. Oberth was a theorist and had never built a rocket, but he tested small liquid propellant thrust chambers in 1929-30 which were not advancements in the \"state of the art.\"<ref name= \"Sutton\" />{{rp|273,275}} In 1922 Oberth asked Goddard for a copy of his 1919 paper and was sent one.<ref name= \"Clary\" />{{rp|96}}\n\nNevertheless, in 1963, von Braun, reflecting on the history of rocketry, said of Goddard: \"His rockets ... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html |title=Recollections of Childhood/Early Experiences in Rocketry |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> He once recalled that \"Goddard's experiments in liquid fuel saved us years of work, and enabled us to perfect the V-2 years before it would have been possible.\"<ref name=\"Levine\">{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Alan J.|title=The Missile and Space Race|year=1994|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-275-94451-4|page=3}}</ref> After  World War II von Braun reviewed Goddard's patents and believed they contained enough technical information to build a large missile.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aldrin|first1=Buzz, Malcolm McConnel|title=Men From Earth|date=1989|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|page=21}}</ref>\n\nThree features developed by Goddard appeared in the V-2: (1) turbopumps were used to inject fuel into the combustion chamber; (2) gyroscopically controlled vanes in the nozzle stabilized the rocket until external vanes in the air could do so; and (3) excess alcohol was fed in around the combustion chamber walls, so that a blanket of evaporating gas protected the engine walls from the combustion heat.\n<ref>{{cite book\n  |last=Burchard |first=John E.

General [[Walter Dornberger]], head of the V-2 project, used the idea that they were in a race with the U.S. and that Goddard had \"disappeared\" (to work with the Navy) as a way to persuade Hitler to raise the priority of the V-2.\n\n== Goddard's secrecy ==\nGoddard avoided sharing details of his work with other scientists and preferred to work alone with his technicians. [[Frank Malina]], who was then studying rocketry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], visited Goddard in August 1936. Goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research, other than that which had already been published in ''Liquid-Propellant Rocket Development''. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], Malina's mentor at the time, was unhappy with Goddard's attitude and later wrote, \"Naturally we at Caltech wanted as much information as we could get from Goddard for our mutual benefit. But Goddard believed in secrecy. ... The trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it.\" <ref name=\"Burrows\" />{{rp|90}} However, at an earlier point, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n said that Malina was \"highly enthusiastic\" after his visit and that Caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket, based on Goddard's work and patents. Malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in Goddard's shop.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|178}}\n\nGoddard's concerns about secrecy led to criticism for failure to cooperate with other scientists and engineers. His approach at that time was that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support. George Sutton, who became a rocket scientist working with von Braun's team in the late 1940s, said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of Goddard or his contributions and that they would have saved time if they had known the details of his work. Sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for Goddard's patents and depending on the German team for knowledge and guidance; he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the U.S. at that early period after World War II, though Germany and the Soviet Union had copies of some of them. (The Patent Office did not release rocket patents during World War II.)<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, Virginia|pages=267, 269}}</ref> However, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, an offshoot of the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at Caltech (GALCIT), filed two patent applications in Sep 1943 referencing Goddard's {{US patent|1102653}} for the multistage rocket.\n\nBy 1939, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT had received Army Air Corps funding to develop rockets to assist in aircraft take-off. Goddard learned of this in 1940, and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered.<ref name=\"Burrows\">{{cite book\n  |last=Burrows |first=William E.\n  |title=This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age\n  |year=1999 |publisher=Modern Library\n  | pages=89\u201392\n  |isbn=0-375-75485-7\n}}</ref> Malina could not understand why the Army did not arrange for an exchange of information between Goddard and Caltech since both were under government contract at the same time. Goddard did not think he could be of that much help to Caltech because they were designing rocket engines mainly with solid fuel, while he was using liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard was concerned with avoiding the public criticism and ridicule he had faced in the 1920s, which he believed had harmed his professional reputation. He also lacked interest in discussions with people who had less understanding of rocketry than he did,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|171}} feeling that his time was extremely constrained.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|23}} Goddard's health was frequently poor, as a result of his earlier bout of tuberculosis, and he was uncertain about how long he had to live<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|65,190}} He felt, therefore, that he hadn't the time to spare arguing with other scientists and the press about his new field of research, or helping all the amateur rocketeers who wrote to him.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61,71,110\u201311,114\u201315}} In 1932 Goddard wrote to H. G. Wells:\n<blockquote> How many more years I shall be able to work on the problem, I do not know; I hope, as long as I live. There can be no thought of finishing, for \"aiming at the stars\", both literally and figuratively, is a problem to occupy generations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.<ref name=Stoiko>{{cite book|last=Stoiko|first=Michael|title=Pioneers of Rocketry|year=1974|publisher=Hawthorn Books|location=New York|page=63}}</ref></blockquote>\nGoddard spoke to professional groups, published articles and papers and patented his ideas; but while he discussed basic principles, he was unwilling to reveal the details of his designs until he had flown rockets to high altitudes and thus proven his theory.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|115}} He tended to avoid any mention of space flight, and spoke only of high-altitude research, since he believed that other scientists regarded the subject as unscientific.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|116}} GALCIT saw Goddard's publicity problems and that the word \"rocket\" was \"of such bad repute\" that they used the word \"jet\" in the name of JPL and the related Aerojet Engineering Corporation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History Of Rocket Technology|editor-last=Emme|editor-first=Eugene E.|last1=Malina |first1=Frank J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=52}}</ref>\n\nMany authors writing about Goddard mention his secrecy, but\nneglect the reasons for it. Some reasons have been noted above. Much of his work was for the military and was classified.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1541}} There were some in the U.S. before World War II that called for long-range rockets, and in 1939 Major James Randolph wrote a \"provocative article\" advocating a 3000-mile range missile. Goddard was \"annoyed\" by the unclassified paper as he thought the subject of weapons should be \"discussed in strict secrecy.\" <ref name=\"Don\">{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Don P.|title=Bossart: America's Forgotten Rocket Scientist|year=2016|publisher=Mental Landscape|location=San Bernardino, CA|pages=76}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Goddard's tendency to secrecy was not absolute, nor was he totally uncooperative. In 1945 GALCIT was building the [[WAC Corporal]] for the Army.  But in 1942 they were having trouble with their liquid propellant rocket engine's performance (timely, smooth ignition and explosions). Frank Malina went  to Annapolis in February and consulted with Goddard and Stiff, and they arrived at a solution to the problem (hypergolic propellant), which resulted in the successful launch of the high-altitude research rocket in October 1945.<ref name=\"Heinz\">{{cite book|last=Gartmann|first=Heinz|title=The Men Behind the Space Rockets|year=1955|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|pages=149}}</ref>\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, Goddard offered his services, patents, and technology to the military, and made some significant contributions. Just before the Second World War several young Army officers and a few higher-ranking ones believed Goddard's research was important but were unable to generate funds for his work.<ref name=\"Glenn\">{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/rgoddardsite/|title=Robert H.

He became a thorough diarist and documenter of his work\u2014a skill that would greatly benefit his later career. These interests merged at age 16, when Goddard attempted to construct a balloon out of [[aluminum]], shaping the raw metal in his home workshop, and filling it with hydrogen. After nearly five weeks of methodical, documented efforts, he finally abandoned the project, remarking, \"... balloon will not go up. ... Aluminum is too heavy. Failior {{sic}} crowns enterprise.\" However, the lesson of this failure did not restrain Goddard's growing determination and confidence in his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|21}} He wrote in 1927, \"I imagine an innate interest in mechanical things was inherited from a number of ancestors  who were machinists.\" <ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|7}}\n\n===Cherry tree dream===\nHe became interested in space when he read [[H.

The 17-year-old Goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs. He was transfixed by the sky, and his imagination grew. He later wrote:\n\n{{quote |On this day I climbed a tall cherry tree at the back of the barn ... and as I looked toward the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the ''possibility'' of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet. I have several photographs of the tree, taken since, with the little ladder I made to climb it, leaning against it.\nIt seemed to me then that a weight whirling around a horizontal shaft, moving more rapidly above than below, could furnish lift by virtue of the greater centrifugal force at the top of the path.\n\nI was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended. Existence at last seemed very purposive.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|26}}<ref name=\"NASA Goddard\" >{{cite web\n  | url = http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sgoddard.htm\n  | title = Robert Goddard and His Rockets\n  | publisher = NASA}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the rest of his life, he observed October 19 as \"Anniversary Day\", a private commemoration of the day of his greatest inspiration.\n\n== Education and early studies ==\n\nThe young Goddard was a thin and frail boy, almost always in fragile health. He suffered from stomach problems, pleurisy, colds, and bronchitis, and he fell two years behind his classmates. He became a voracious reader, regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16,19}}\n\n===Aerodynamics and motion===\n\nGoddard's interest in aerodynamics led him to study some of [[Samuel Langley]]'s scientific papers in the periodical ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]''. In these papers, Langley wrote that birds flap their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air. Inspired by these articles, the teenage Goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home, noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight. He noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers, which he called the birds' equivalent of [[ailerons]]. He took exception to some of Langley's conclusions and in 1901 wrote a letter to ''St. Nicholas'' magazine<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|5}} with his own ideas. The editor of  ''St. Nicholas'' declined to publish Goddard's letter, remarking that birds fly with a certain amount of intelligence and that \"machines will not act with such intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|31}} Goddard disagreed, believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence.\n\nAround this time, Goddard read [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', and found that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] applied to motion in space. He wrote later about his own tests of the Law:\n\n{{quote |I began to realize that there might be something after all to Newton's Laws. The Third Law was accordingly tested, both with devices suspended by rubber bands and by devices on floats, in the little brook back of the barn, and the said law was verified conclusively. It made me realize that if a way to navigate space were to be discovered, or invented, it would be the result of a knowledge of physics and mathematics.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}}}}\n\n===Academics===\nAs his health improved, Goddard continued his formal schooling as a 19-year-old sophomore at [[South High Community School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm|title=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Dr. Robert H.

He excelled in his coursework, and his peers twice elected him class president. Making up for  lost time, he studied books on mathematics, astronomy, mechanics and composition from the school library.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}} At his graduation ceremony in 1904, he gave his class oration as [[valedictorian]]. In his speech, entitled \"On Taking Things for Granted\", Goddard included a section that would become emblematic of his life:\n\n<blockquote>[J]ust as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|19}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGoddard enrolled at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in 1904.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|41}} He quickly impressed the head of the physics department, A. Wilmer Duff, with his thirst for knowledge, and Duff took him on as a laboratory assistant and tutor.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|42}} At WPI, Goddard joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity and began a long courtship with high school classmate Miriam Olmstead, an honor student who had graduated with him as [[salutatorian]]. Eventually, she and Goddard were engaged, but they drifted apart and ended the engagement around 1909.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp |51}}\n\nGoddard received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in physics from Worcester Polytechnic in 1908,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics, he began his graduate studies at [[Clark University]] in Worcester in the fall of 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/library/collections/rgoddard.html | publisher =WPI George C. Gordon Library | title = Robert Goddard |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> Goddard received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in physics from Clark University in 1910, and then stayed at Clark to complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1911. He spent another year at Clark as an honorary fellow in physics, and in 1912 he accepted a research fellowship at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Frist Campus Center|Palmer Physical Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|56\u201358}}\n\n===First scientific writings===\nThe high school student summed up his ideas on space travel in a proposed article, \"The Navigation of Space,\" which he submitted to the ''Popular Science News''. The journal's editor returned it, saying that they could not use it \"in the near future.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|34}}\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Goddard wrote a paper proposing a method for balancing [[airplane]]s using gyro-stabilization. He submitted the idea to ''[[Scientific American]]'', which published the paper in 1907. Goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal of a way to automatically stabilize aircraft in flight.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} His proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional [[gyroscope]]s.\n\nWhile studying physics at WPI, ideas came to Goddard's mind that sometimes seemed impossible, but he was compelled to record them for future investigation. He wrote that \"there was something inside which simply would not stop working.\" He purchased some cloth-covered notebooks and began filling them with a variety of thoughts, mostly concerning his dream of space travel.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|11\u201313}} He considered centrifugal force, radio waves, magnetic reaction, solar energy, atomic energy, ion or electrostatic propulsion and other methods to reach space. After experimenting with solid fuel rockets he was convinced by 1909 that chemical-propellant engines were the answer.<ref name= \"Frank\" />{{rp|11\u201312}} A particularly complex concept was set down in June 1908: Sending a camera around distant planets, guided by measurements of gravity along the trajectory, and returning to earth.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|14}}\n\nHis first writing on the possibility of a liquid-fueled rocket came on February 2, 1909. Goddard had begun to study ways of increasing a rocket's efficiency using methods differing from conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]]s. He wrote in his notebook about using liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. He believed that 50 percent efficiency could be achieved with these liquid propellants (i.e., half of the heat energy of combustion converted to the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|55}}\n\n==First patents==\nIn the decades around 1910, radio was a new technology, fertile for innovation. In 1912, while working at Princeton University, Goddard investigated the effects of radio waves on insulators.<ref>Goddard, Robert H. \"On ponderomotive force upon a dielectric which carries a displacement current in a magnetic field\", ''[[Physical Review]]'', Vol. 6(2), pp. 99\u2013120 (August 1914).</ref> In order to generate radio-frequency power, he invented a vacuum tube with a beam deflection<ref>{{US patent|1159209}}</ref> that operated like a cathode-ray oscillator tube. His patent on this tube, which predated that of [[Lee De Forest]], became central in the suit between [[Arthur A. Collins]], whose small company made radio transmitter tubes, and [[AT&T]] and [[RCA]] over his use of [[vacuum tube]] technology.  Goddard accepted only a consultant's fee from Collins when the suit was dropped. Eventually the two big companies allowed the country's growing electronics industry to use the De Forest patents freely.<ref>McElroy, Gil, \"The Collins 45A \u2013 How Art Collins met Robert Goddard\", ''QST'', Vol. 81(2), pp. 44\u201346 (February 1997).</ref>\n\n===Rocket math===\nBy 1912 he had in his spare time, using calculus, developed the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. In effect he had independently developed the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] published a decade earlier in Russia. For vertical flight he included the effects of gravity and aerodynamic drag.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|136}}\n\nHis first goal was to build a [[Rocketsonde|sounding rocket]] with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that \"[I]n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|65,67,74,101}}\n\n===Fight to survive===\nIn early 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]] and had to leave his position at Princeton. He then returned to Worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery at home. His doctors did not expect him to live. He decided he should spend time outside in the fresh air and walk for exercise, and he gradually improved.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61\u201364}} When his nurse discovered some of his notes in his bed, he kept them, arguing, \"I have to live to do this work.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|66}}\n\nIt was during this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most important work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. He was afraid that nobody would be able to read his scribbling should he \nsuccumb.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n===Foundational patents===\nIn the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, [[patents]] were considered essential, not only to protect original work but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did\u2014and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote descriptions concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent lawyer in  Worcester who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|63\u201370}}\n\nIn 1914, his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered. The first, {{US patent|1102653}}, described a multi-stage rocket fueled with a solid \"explosive material.\" The second, {{US patent|1103503}}, described a rocket fueled with a [[solid fuel]] (explosive material) or with [[liquid propellant]]s (gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide). The two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry.<ref name=\"Sea and Sky: Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.seasky.org/spacexp/sky5d1.html\n  | title = Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\n  | publisher = Sea and Sky}}</ref><ref name=\"Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.russianspaceweb.com/chronology_XX.html\n  | title = Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\n  | publisher = Russian Space Web}}</ref> Overall, 214 patents were published, some posthumously by his wife.\n\n== Early rocketry research ==\n[[File:Robert Goddard footage.ogv|thumb|right|Video clips of Goddard's launches and other events in his life]]\nIn the fall of 1914, Goddard's health had improved, and he accepted a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at Clark University.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|73}} His position at Clark allowed him to further his rocketry research. He ordered numerous supplies that could be used to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests. Goddard's first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at Clark.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|74}} The launch was loud and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor, and Goddard had to reassure him that his experiments, while being serious study, were also quite harmless. After this incident, Goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab, in order to limit any disturbance.\n\nAt the Clark physics lab, Goddard conducted static tests of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about two percent of the thermal energy in their fuel into thrust and kinetic energy. At this point he applied [[de Laval nozzle]]s, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the ''internal efficiency'' of the engine: the ratio of the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.)<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|130}} By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of {{nowrap|6728 feet (2051 meters) per second}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|75}} Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion (de Laval) nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|78}}\n\nFew would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration.<ref name=\"Pendray\">{{cite book|last=Pendray|first=G.

With these performance levels, he believed a rocket could vertically lift a weight of {{nowrap|1 lb (0.45 kg)}} to a height of {{nowrap| 232 miles (373 km)}} with an initial launch weight of only {{nowrap|89.6 lbs (40.64 kg)}}.<ref>{{Cite web | date = September 1916 |title=September 27, 1916 \u2013 Goddard's Proposal to the Smithsonian | url = http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/documents/goddardsept1916.htm | publisher = The Smithsonian Institution}}.</ref> (Earth's atmosphere can be considered to end at {{convert|80|to|100|mi|km}} altitude, where its drag effect on orbiting satellites becomes minimal.)\n\nThe Smithsonian was interested and asked Goddard to elaborate upon his initial inquiry. Goddard responded with a detailed manuscript he had already prepared, entitled ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|79}}\n\nIn January 1917, the Smithsonian agreed to provide Goddard with a five-year grant totaling {{nowrap|US$5000}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|84}} Afterward, Clark was able to contribute {{nowrap|US$3500 }} and the use of their physics lab to the project. Worcester Polytechnic Institute also allowed him to use its abandoned Magnetics Laboratory on the edge of campus during this time, as a safe place for testing.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|85}} WPI also made some parts in their machine shop.\n\nGoddard's fellow Clark scientists were astonished at the unusually large Smithsonian grant for rocket research, which they thought was not real science.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|85}} Decades later, rocket scientists who knew how much it cost to research and develop rockets said that he had received little financial support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Viking Rocket Story|last=Rosen|first=Milton W.|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1955|isbn=|location=New York|pages=11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Enterprise|last=Grey|first=Jerry|publisher=William Morrow and Company|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York|pages=260\u2013688-03462\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, at the insistence of Dr. Arthur G. Webster, the world-renowned head of Clark's physics department,  Goddard arranged for the Smithsonian to publish the paper,  ''A Method...,'' which documented his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nWhile at Clark University, Goddard did research into solar power using a parabolic dish to concentrate the Sun's rays on a machined piece of [[quartz]], that was sprayed with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which then heated water and drove an electric generator. Goddard believed his invention had overcome all the obstacles that had previously defeated other scientists and inventors, and he had his findings published in the November 1929 issue of  ''Popular Science''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 \"A New Invention To Harness The Sun\"], ''Popular Science'', November 1929.</ref>\n\n===Goddard's military rocket===\nNot all of Goddard's early work was geared towards space travel. As the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country's universities began to lend their services to the war effort. Goddard believed his rocket research could be applied to many different military applications, including mobile artillery, field weapons and naval [[torpedo]]es. He made proposals to the Navy and Army. No record exists in his papers of any interest by the Navy to Goddard's inquiry. However, Army Ordnance was quite interested, and Goddard met several times with Army personnel.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nDuring this time, Goddard was also contacted, in early 1918, by a civilian industrialist in Worcester about the possibility of manufacturing rockets for the military. However, as the businessman's enthusiasm grew, so did Goddard's suspicion. Talks eventually broke down as Goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business. However, an [[Army Signal Corps]] officer tried to make Goddard cooperate, but he was called off by General [[George Squier]] of the Signal Corps who had been contacted by Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89\u201391}} Goddard became leery of working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to \"protect his ideas.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|152}} These events led to the Signal Corps sponsoring Goddard's work during World War I.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nGoddard proposed to the Army an idea for a tube-based rocket launcher as a light infantry weapon. The launcher concept became the precursor to the [[bazooka]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|92}} The rocket-powered, recoil-free weapon was the brainchild of Goddard as a side project (under Army contract) of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his [[tenure]] at [[Clark University]], and working at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] for security reasons, designed the tube-fired rocket for military use during World War I. He and his co-worker, Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]] successfully demonstrated his rocket to the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], on November 6, 1918, using two music stands for a launch platform. The Army was impressed, but the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Compi\u00e8gne Armistice]] was signed only five days later, and further development was discontinued as World War I ended.<ref name=\"NASA \u2013 Dr. Robert H.

Goddard, American Rocketry Pioneer\n  | publisher = NASA\n  | accessdate = 2010-05-04\n}}.</ref>\n\nThe delay in the development of the bazooka and other weapons was a result of the long recovery period required from Goddard's serious bout with tuberculosis. Goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the U.S. Government at [[Indian Head, Maryland]],<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|121}} until 1923, but his focus had turned to other research involving rocket propulsion, including work with liquid fuels and liquid oxygen.\n\nLater, the former Clark University researcher Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]], and Army officers Col. [[Leslie Skinner]] and Lt. [[Edward Uhl]] continued Goddard's work on the bazooka. A [[shaped-charge]] warhead was attached to the rocket, leading to the tank-killing weapon used in World War II and to many other powerful rocket weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|305}}\n\n== ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes'' ==\n\nIn 1919 Goddard thought that it would be premature to disclose the results of his experiments because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report, updated with footnotes, that he had submitted in late 1916.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nIn late 1919, the Smithsonian published Goddard's groundbreaking work, ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''. The report describes Goddard's mathematical theories of rocket flight, his experiments with solid-fuel rockets, and the possibilities he saw of exploring Earth's atmosphere and beyond. Along with [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]'s earlier work, ''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices'',<ref name=\"Tsiolkovsky, Exploration of Cosmic Space\">{{cite book\n  |title=The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices\n  |first=Konstantin |last=Tsiolkovsky\n  |authorlink=Konstantin Tsiolkovsky\n  |year=1903\n  |ref=Tsiolkovsky, Exploration of Cosmic Space\n}}</ref> which was not widely disseminated outside Russia,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ley|first1=Willy|title=Events in Space|url=https://archive.org/details/eventsinspace0000leyw|url-access=registration|date=1969|publisher=David McKay Company|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/eventsinspace0000leyw/page/9 9]}}</ref> Goddard's report is regarded as one of the pioneering works of the science of rocketry, and 1750 copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\"Emme\">{{cite book|last=Emme|first=Eugene M.|title=A History of Spaceflight|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|page=90}}</ref> Goddard also sent a copy to individuals who requested one, until his personal supply was exhausted. Smithsonian aerospace historian Frank Winter said that this paper was \"one of the key catalysts behind the international rocket movement of the 1920s and 30s.\" <ref name= \"NYT\"/>\n\nGoddard described extensive experiments with solid-fuel [[rocket engine]]s burning high-grade nitrocellulose [[smokeless powder]].

Included as a [[thought experiment]] was the idea of launching a rocket to the Moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required. Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash \"just visible\" from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.<ref name=\"Method\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Goddard|editor1-first=Esther C. |editor2-first=G.

He did, though, publish and talk about the rocket principle and [[sounding rockets]], since these subjects were not too \"far out.\" In a letter to the Smithsonian, dated March 1920, he discussed: photographing the Moon and planets from rocket-powered fly-by probes, sending messages to distant civilizations on inscribed metal plates, the use of solar energy in space, and the idea of high-velocity ion propulsion. In that same letter, Goddard clearly describes the concept of the [[Atmospheric reentry#Ablative|ablative heat shield]], suggesting the landing apparatus be covered with \"layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between\" designed to erode in the same way as the surface of a meteor.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/march-1920-report-concerning-further-developments-space-travel\n|last=Goddard  |first=Robert H.\n  |title=Report Concerning Further Developments\n  |date=March 1920\n  |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution Archives\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |bgcolor=#F5F5F5 |salign=center |align=right |width=33% |quote=Every vision is a joke until the first man accomplishes it; once realized, it becomes commonplace.|source=&ndash;Response to a reporter's question following criticism in ''The New York Times'', 1920.<ref name=\"Clark University\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www2.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm#nyt\n|title=When was the famous New York Times editorial about Dr. Goddard?\n|publisher=Clark University\n|accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_goddard.html\n|title=Robert Goddard: A Man and His Rocket\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>}}\n\n===Publicity and criticism===\nThe publication of Goddard's document gained him national attention from U.S. newspapers, most of it negative.

Even the Smithsonian had to abstain from publicity because of the amount of ridiculous correspondence received from the general public.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|113}} David Lasser, who co-founded the [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS), wrote in 1931 that Goddard was subjected in the press to the \"most violent attacks.\"<ref name=\"Lasser\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Lasser|editor1-first=David |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Godwin |title=The Conquest of Space|year=2002|publisher=Apogee Books|location=Burlington, Ontario|isbn=1-896522-92-0|page=38}}</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 1920, a front-page story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon\", reported a Smithsonian press release about a \"multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket.\" The chief application envisaged was \"the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth's atmosphere\", the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since \"the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down.\" But it also mentioned a proposal \"to [send] to the dark part of the new moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope.

It is not obvious, however, that the instruments would return to the point of departure; indeed, it is obvious that they would not, for parachutes drift exactly as balloons do.<ref name=\"NYT12\">{{cite news\n  |title=Topics of the Times\n  |url=http://it.is.rice.edu/~rickr/goddard.editorial.html\n  |quote=As a method of sending a missile to the higher, and even highest, part of the earth's atmospheric envelope, Professor Goddard's multiple-charge rocket is a practicable, and therefore promising device.\n  |work=New York Times\n  |date=January 13, 1920 |accessdate=2007-06-21\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217065558/http://it.is.rice.edu/~rickr/goddard.editorial.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe article pressed further on Goddard's proposal to launch rockets beyond the atmosphere:\n<blockquote>[A]fter the rocket quits our air and really starts on its longer journey, its flight would be neither accelerated nor maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left.

Unbeknownst to the ''Times'', thrust is possible in a vacuum, as the writer would have discovered had he read Goddard's paper.<ref>{{cite book\n|editor=Newton, Isaac\n|title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, 2nd ed\n|publisher=\n|location=London\n|year=1713\n|pages=\n|isbn=\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/}}\n</ref>\n\n====Aftermath====\nA week after the ''New York Times'' editorial, Goddard released a signed statement to the [[Associated Press]], attempting to restore reason to what had become a sensational story:\n<blockquote>Too much attention has been concentrated on the proposed flash pow[d]er experiment, and too little on the exploration of the atmosphere. ... Whatever interesting possibilities there may be of the method that has been proposed, other than the purpose for which it was intended, no one of them could be undertaken without first exploring the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite news |title=Goddard Rockets To Take Pictures |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 19, 1920 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E2DF103AE033A2575AC1A9679C946195D6CF}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1924, Goddard published an article, \"How my speed rocket can propel itself in vacuum\", in ''[[Popular Science]]'', in which he explained the physics and gave details of the vacuum experiments he had performed to prove the theory.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goddard |first=Robert |title=How my speed rocket can propel itself in vacuum |url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=DikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=38 |work=[[Popular Science]] |date=September 1924 |page=38}}</ref> But, no matter how he tried to explain his results, he was not understood by the majority. After one of Goddard's experiments in 1929, a local Worcester newspaper carried the mocking headline \"Moon rocket misses target by 238,799{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;miles.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|editor=Nelson, Craig\n|title=Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon\n|publisher=\n|location=\n|year=1713\n|pages=\n|isbn=9781101057735\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWMivGgbM7kC&pg=PT96 }}\n</ref>\n\nThough the unimaginitive of the public chuckled at the \"moon man,\" his groundbreaking paper was read seriously by many rocketeers in America, Europe, and Russia who were stirred to build their own rockets. This work was his most important contribution to the quest to \"aim for the stars.\" <ref name= \"Gainor\" />{{rp|50}}\n\nGoddard worked alone with just his team of mechanics and machinists for many years.  This was a result of the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists, and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use. Goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone, except during the two World Wars, which limited the impact of much of his work. Another limiting factor was the lack of support from the American government, military and academia, all failing to understand the value of the rocket to study the atmosphere and near space, and for military applications. As Germany became ever more war-like, he refused to communicate with German rocket experimenters, though he received more and more of their correspondence.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|131}}\n\n===='A Correction'====\nForty-nine years after its editorial mocking Goddard, on July 17, 1969\u2014the day after the launch of [[Apollo 11]]\u2014''The New York Times'' published a short item under the headline \"A Correction.\" The three-paragraph statement summarized its 1920 editorial and concluded:\n<blockquote>Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.<ref>''The New York Times'', July 17, 1969, p. 43,</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==First liquid-fueled flight==\n\nGoddard began considering liquid propellants, including hydrogen and oxygen, as early as 1909. He knew that hydrogen and oxygen was the most efficient fuel/oxidizer combination. Liquid hydrogen was not readily available in 1921, however, and he selected gasoline as the safest fuel to handle.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|13}}\n\n===First static tests===\n[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Robert Goddard, bundled against the cold weather of March 16, 1926, holds the launching frame of his most notable invention \u2014 the first liquid-fueled rocket.]]\nGoddard began experimenting with liquid oxidizer, [[liquid fuel rocket]]s in September 1921, and successfully tested the first liquid propellant engine in November 1923.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|520}} It had a cylindrical [[combustion chamber]], using impinging jets to mix and atomize [[liquid oxygen]] and [[gasoline]].<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|499\u2013500}}\n\nIn 1924\u201325, Goddard had problems developing a high-pressure [[piston pump]] to send fuel to the combustion chamber. He wanted to scale up the experiments, but his funding would not allow such growth. He decided to forego the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of [[inert gas]], a technique used today. The liquid oxygen, some of which evaporated,  provided its own pressure.\n\nOn December 6, 1925, he tested the simpler pressure feed system. He conducted a static test on the firing stand at the Clark University physics laboratory. The engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack. It was a major success for Goddard, proving that a liquid fuel rocket was possible.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|140}} The test moved Goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard conducted an additional test in December, and two more in January 1926. After that, he began preparing for a possible launch of the rocket system.\n\n===First flight===\nGoddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled ([[bipropellant rocket|gasoline and liquid oxygen]]) rocket on March 16, 1926, in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]]. Present at the launch were his crew chief Henry Sachs, Esther Goddard, and Percy Roope, who was Clark's assistant professor in the physics department. Goddard's diary entry of the event was notable for its understatement:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 16. Went to Auburn with S[achs] in am. E[sther] and Mr. Roope came out at 1 p.m. Tried rocket at 2.30. It rose 41 feet & went 184 feet, in 2.5 secs., after the lower half of the nozzle burned off. Brought materials to lab. ...<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis diary entry the next day elaborated:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 17, 1926. The first flight with a rocket using liquid propellants was made yesterday at Aunt Effie's farm in Auburn. ... \nEven though the release was pulled, the rocket did not rise at first, but the flame came out, and there was a steady roar. After a number of seconds it rose, slowly until it cleared the frame, and then at express train speed, curving over to the left, and striking the ice and snow, still going at a rapid rate.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe rocket, which was later dubbed \"Nell\", rose just 41&nbsp;feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended 184 feet away in a cabbage field,<ref>{{cite book|last=Streissguth|first=Thomas|title=Rocket man: the story of Robert Goddard|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37 37]|isbn=0-87614-863-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37}}</ref> but it was an important demonstration that liquid fuels and oxidizers were possible propellants for larger rockets. The launch site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]], the [[Goddard Rocket Launching Site]].\n\nViewers familiar with more modern rocket designs may find it difficult to distinguish the rocket from its launching apparatus in the well-known picture of \"Nell\". The complete rocket is significantly taller than Goddard but does not include the pyramidal support structure which he is grasping. The rocket's [[combustion chamber]] is the small cylinder at the top; the [[nozzle]] is visible beneath it. The fuel tank, which is also part of the rocket, is the larger cylinder opposite Goddard's torso. The fuel tank is directly beneath the nozzle and is protected from the motor's exhaust by an [[asbestos]] cone. Asbestos-wrapped aluminum tubes connect the motor to the tanks, providing both support and fuel transport.<ref>[http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf NASA, ''Discover NASA and You''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221503/http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}.</ref> This layout is no longer used, since the experiment showed that this was [[Pendulum rocket fallacy|no more stable]] than placing the combustion chamber and nozzle at the base. By May, after a series of modifications to simplify the plumbing, the combustion chamber and nozzle were placed in the now classic position, at the lower end of the rocket.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|259}}\n\nGoddard determined early that fins alone were not sufficient to stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory in the face of winds aloft and other disturbing forces. He added movable vanes in the exhaust, controlled by a gyroscope, to control and steer his rocket. (The Germans used this technique in their V-2.) He also introduced the more efficient swiveling engine in several rockets, basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|263\u20136}}\n\n==Lindbergh and Goddard==\n\nAfter launch of one of Goddard's rockets in July 1929 again gained the attention of the newspapers,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9tbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wlINAAAAIBAJ&dq=rocket%20accident&pg=4275%2C2780242 \"Giant Rocket Alarms Many\"], ''St. Joseph, Missouri Gazette'', July 18, 1929.</ref> [[Charles Lindbergh]] learned of his work in a ''New York Times'' article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of [[aviation]] (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step. After checking with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|141}} Professor Goddard met the aviator soon after in his office at Clark University.<ref name=\"lehm\">{{cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Milton|date=October 4, 1963|title=How Lindbergh Gave a Lift to Rocketry|journal=LIFE Magazine|volume=55|issue=14|pages=115\u2013127|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uFIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA115|accessdate=15 Mar 2010}}</ref> Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier's interest. He discussed his work openly with Lindbergh, forming an alliance that would last for the rest of his life. While having long since become reticent to share his ideas, Goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream, and whom he felt he could trust.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBy late 1929, Goddard had been attracting additional notoriety with each rocket launch. He was finding it increasingly difficult to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard's work and lent his famous name to Goddard's work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but impossible to find following the recent [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|U.S. stock market crash]] in October 1929.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\n===Guggenheim sponsorship===\nIn the spring of 1930, Lindbergh finally found an ally in the [[Guggenheim family]]. Financier [[Daniel Guggenheim]] agreed to fund Goddard's research over the next four years for a total of $100,000 (~${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1932|r=-5}}}} today). The Guggenheim family, especially [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry Guggenheim]], would continue to support Goddard's work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to [[Roswell, New Mexico]] <ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBecause of the military potential of the rocket, Goddard, Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, the Smithsonian Institution and others tried in 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II, to convince the Army and Navy of its value. Goddard's services were offered, but there was no interest, initially. Two young, imaginative military officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with Goddard just prior to the war. The Navy beat the Army to the punch and secured his services to build variable-thrust, liquid-fueled rocket engines for jet-assisted take-off (JATO) of aircraft.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|293\u2013297}} These rocket engines were the precursors to the larger throttlable rocket plane engines that helped launch the space age.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The X-Planes|last=Miller|first=Jay|publisher=Orion Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=43,128\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAstronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] wrote that his father, Edwin Aldrin Sr. \"was an early supporter of Robert Goddard.\"  The elder Aldrin was a student of physics under Goddard at Clark, and worked with Lindbergh to obtain the help of the Guggenheims. Buzz believed that if Goddard had received military support as von Braun's team had in Germany, American rocket technology would have developed much more rapidly in World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men from Earth|last=Aldrin|first=Buzz|last2=McConnell|first2=Malcolm|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1989|isbn=0-553-05374-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/ xx,21]|url=https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/}}</ref>\n\n===Lack of vision in the United States===\nBefore World War II there was a lack of vision and serious interest in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|719,746}} Between the World Wars, the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] was the main source of funding for Goddard's research.<ref name=\"Braun\" />{{rp|46,59,60}} Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian [[Eugene Emme]], but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans.<ref name=\"Emme\" />{{rp|63}} Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he \"would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race,\" and he wondered how soon the European \"theorists\" would begin to build rockets.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|136}}\nIn 1936, the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Berlin asked Charles Lindbergh to visit Germany and learn what he could of their progress in aviation. Although the Luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower, they were silent on the subject of rocketry. When Lindbergh told Goddard of this behavior, Goddard said, \"Yes, they must have plans for the rocket. When will our own people in Washington listen to reason?\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|272}}\n\nMost of the U.S.'s largest universities were also slow to realize rocketry's potential. Just before World War II, the head of the aeronautics department at MIT, at a meeting held by the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to discuss project funding, said that the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) \"can take the Buck Rogers Job [rocket research].\"<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=Sex and Rockets|year=1999|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|page=31}}</ref> In 1941, Goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from MIT but couldn't find one who was interested.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|326}}  There were some exceptions: MIT was at least teaching basic rocketry,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|264}} and Caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics. After the war, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker of MIT, having studied Goddard's patents, stated that \"Every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a Goddard rocket.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|363}}\n\nWhile away in Roswell, Goddard was still head of the physics department at Clark University, and Clark allowed him to devote most of his time to rocket research. Likewise, the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) permitted astronomer [[Samuel Herrick (astronomer)|Samuel Herrick]] to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named [[astrodynamics]]. Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of [[celestial mechanics]] \"to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation.\" Herrick's work contributed substantially to America's readiness to control flight of Earth satellites and send men to the Moon and back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vt/viblbv00753.xml|title=Samuel Herrick Papers 1930-1974|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Roswell, New Mexico==\n[[File:RobertHGoddardRocket TopDown.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lindbergh]] took this picture of Robert H.

He had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work, and Roswell seemed ideal. Here they would not endanger anyone, would not be bothered by the curious and would experience a more moderate climate (which was also better for Goddard's health).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|177}} The locals valued personal privacy, knew Goddard desired his, and when travelers asked where Goddard's facilities were located, they would likely be misdirected.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|261}}\n\nBy September 1931, his rockets had the now familiar appearance of a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] guidance and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] over 10&nbsp;years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|193\u20135}}\n\nA temporary loss of funding from the Guggenheims, as a result of the depression, forced Goddard in spring of 1932 to return to his much-loathed professorial responsibilities at Clark University.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clary |first1=David |title=Rocket Man |date=2003 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |isbn=978-0786887057 |pages=165\u2013166}}</ref> He remained at the university until the autumn of 1934, when funding resumed.<ref name=\"The Papers of Robert H.

Goddard\"/> Upon his return to Roswell, he began work on his A series of rockets, 4 to 4.5&nbsp;meters long, and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen. The gyroscopic control system was housed in the middle of the rocket, between the propellant tanks.<ref name=\"RockDev\">{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Robert and editors Esther C. Goddard and G. Edward Pendray|title=Rocket Development|year=1961|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|xv,15\u201346}}\n\nThe A-4 used a simpler pendulum system for guidance, as the gyroscopic system was being repaired. On March 8, 1935, it flew up to 1,000 feet, then turned into the wind and, Goddard reported, \"roared in a powerful descent across the prairie, at close to, or at, the speed of sound.\" On March 28, 1935, the A-5 successfully flew vertically to an altitude of (0.91&nbsp;mi; 4,800&nbsp;ft) using his gyroscopic guidance system. It then turned to a nearly horizontal path, flew 13,000 feet and achieved a maximum speed of 550 miles per hour. Goddard was elated because the guidance system kept the rocket on a vertical path so well.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|208}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|978\u20139}}\n\nIn 1936\u20131939, Goddard began work on the K and L series rockets, which were much more massive and designed to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624&nbsp;lbs in February 1936.<ref name=\"Braun\">{{cite book|last=Von Braun|first=Wernher and Frederick I. Ordway III|title=History of Rocketry and Space Travel, revised Edition|year=1969|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Co.|location=New York|page=50}}</ref>  This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around the outside of the combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Goddard returned to a smaller design, and his L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7&nbsp;mi; 8,900&nbsp;ft), the highest of any of his rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|71\u2013148}}\n\nGoddard experimented with many of the features of today's large rockets, such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles. In November 1936, he flew the world's first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four combustion chambers, reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through. This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|96}} In July 1937 he replaced the guidance vanes with a movable tail section containing a single combustion chamber, as if on gimbals ([[thrust vectoring]]). The flight was of low altitude, but a large disturbance, probably caused by a change in the wind velocity, was corrected back to vertical. In an August test the flight path was corrected seven times by the movable tail and was captured on film by Mrs Goddard.<ref name= \"RockDev\" />{{rp|113\u2013116}}\n\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Goddard worked on the P series of rockets, which used propellant turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet. The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|187\u2013215}}\n\nWhen Goddard mentioned the need for turbopumps, Harry Guggenheim suggested that he contact pump manufacturers to aid him. None were interested, as the development cost of these miniature pumps was prohibitive. Goddard's team was therefore left on its own and from September 1938 to June 1940 designed and tested the small turbopumps and gas generators to operate the turbines. Esther later said that the pump tests were \"the most trying and disheartening phase of the research.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274\u20135}}\n\nGoddard was able to flight-test many of his rockets, but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. Goddard did not consider them failures, however, because he felt that he always learned something from a test.<ref name=\"Gainor\" />{{rp|45}} Most of his work involved static tests, which are a standard procedure today, before a flight test. He wrote to a correspondent:  \"It is not a simple matter to differentiate unsuccessful from successful experiments. ... [Most] work that is finally successful is the result of a series of unsuccessful tests in which difficulties are gradually eliminated.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274}}\n\n===General Jimmy Doolittle===\n[[Jimmy Doolittle]] was introduced to the field of space science at an early point in its history. He recalls in his autobiography, \"I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation. ... While with Shell Oil I worked with him on the development of a type of fuel. ... \"<ref name=Jimmy>{{cite book|last1=Doolittle|first1=James H. \"Jimmy\"|title=I Could Never Be So Lucky Again|date=1991|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|page=515}}</ref> Harry Guggenheim and Charles Lindbergh arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle flew himself to Roswell in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard's shop and a \"short course\" in rocketry.  He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard's rocket. In closing he said, \"interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away\u2014who knows!\" In July 1941, he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in his rocket propulsion research. The Army was interested only in JATO at this point.

Simply reaching high altitudes was not his primary goal; he was trying, with a methodical approach, to perfect his liquid fuel engine and subsystems such as guidance and control so that his rocket could eventually achieve high altitudes without tumbling in the rare atmosphere, providing a stable vehicle for the experiments it would eventually carry. He had built the necessary turbopumps and was on the verge of building larger, lighter, more reliable rockets to reach extreme altitudes carrying scientific instruments when World War II intervened and changed the path of American history. He hoped to return to his experiments in Roswell after the war.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|206,230,330\u20131}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|923\u20134}}\n\nThough by the end of the Roswell years much of his technology had been replicated independently by others, he introduced new developments to rocketry that were used in this new enterprise: lightweight turbopumps, variable-thrust engine (in U.S.), engine with multiple combustion chambers and nozzles, and curtain cooling of combustion chamber.\n\nAlthough Goddard had brought his work in rocketry to the attention of the [[United States Army]], between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was no money for new experimental weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|297}} German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard's work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited [[military attach\u00e9]] to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the ''[[Abwehr]]'' in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch. The ''Abwehr'' was very interested and responded with more questions about Goddard's work.<ref>{{cite book\n  |first=David  |last=Kahn\n  |title=Hitler's Spies: German Military Intelligence in World War II\n  |publisher=Da Capo Press\n  |year=2000\n  |page=77\n  |isbn=0-02-052440-4\n}}</ref>{{rp|77}}<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|227\u20138}} Guellich's reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling,<ref>The Game of the Foxes, Ladislas Farago, 1972,</ref>{{rp|39\u201341}} but thereafter the Germans received very little information about Goddard.\n\nThe Soviet Union had a spy in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics.

Fischer, who had visited Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, believed Goddard was doing valuable work and was able to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a [[PBY]] seaplane. By May 1942, he had a unit that could meet the Navy's requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February, he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack. Goddard wrote to Guggenheim that \"I can think of nothing that would give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|322,328\u20139,331,335,337}}\n\nIn April, Fischer notified Goddard that the Navy wanted to do all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, \"Esther, don't you know there's a war on?\" Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, \"I was wondering when you would ask me.\" Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger\u2014a long range missile\u2014but JATO was all he could manage, hoping for a greater project later.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|338,9}} It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|209}}\n\nGoddard and his team had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he received a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August, his engine was producing 800&nbsp;lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try, the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature at the last minute, there was no explosion and no lives were lost. The problem's cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, \"Putting [Goddard's] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|344\u201350}}\n\nMilton Lehman notes:\n<blockquote>\nIn its 1942 crash effort to perfect an aircraft booster, the Navy was beginning to learn its way in rocketry. In similar efforts, the Army Air Corps was also exploring the field [with [[GALCIT]]]. Compared to Germany's massive program, these beginnings were small, yet essential to later progress. They helped develop a nucleus of trained American rocket engineers, the first of the new breed who would follow the professor into the Age of Space.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|350}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn August, 1943, President Atwood at Clark wrote to Goddard that the University was losing the acting head of the Physics Department, was taking on \"emergency work\" for the Army, and he was to \"report for duty or declare the position vacant.\" Goddard replied that he believed he was needed by he Navy, was nearing retirement age, and was unable to lecture because of his throat problem, which did not allow allow him to talk above a whisper. He regretfully resigned as Professor of Physics and expressed his deepest appreciation for all Atwood and the Trustees had done for him and indirectly for the war effort.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1509\u201311}} In June he had gone to see a throat specialist in Baltimore, who recommended that he not talk at all, to give his throat a rest.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1503}}\n  \nThe station, under Lt Commander Robert Truax, was developing another JATO engine in 1942 that used [[hypergolic propellant]]<nowiki/>s, eliminating the need for an ignition system.

The team built a 3000-lb thrust engine using a cluster of four 750-lb thrust motors.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1574,1592}} They also developed 750-lb engines for the Navy's Gorgon guided interceptor missile (experimental [[Project Gorgon]]).

Goddard made improvements to the engine, and in November it was demonstrated to the Navy and some officials from Washington. Fischer invited the spectators to operate the controls; the engine blasted out over the Severn at full throttle with no hesitation, idled, and roared again at various thrust levels. The test was perfect, exceeding the Navy's requirements. The unit was able to be stopped and restarted, and it produced a medium thrust of 600 pounds for 15 seconds and a full thrust of 1,000 pounds for over 15 seconds. A Navy Commander commented that \"It was like being Thor, playing with thunderbolts.\" Goddard had produced the essential propulsion control system of the rocket plane. The Goddards celebrated by attending the Army-Navy football game and attending the Fischers' cocktail party.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|350\u20131}}\n\nThis engine was the basis of the Curtiss-Wright XLR25-CW-1 two-chamber, 15,000-pound variable-thrust engine that powered the [[Bell X-2]] research rocket plane. After World War II, Goddard's team and some patents went to [[Curtiss-Wright]] Corporation. \"Although his death in August 1945 prevented him from participating in the actual development of this engine, it was a direct descendent of his design.\"<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|1606}} Clark University and the Guggenheim Foundation received the royalties from the use of the patents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/curtiss-wright-xlr25-cw-1/page/2/|title=This Day In Aviation|last=Swopes|first=Began R.|date=2017|access-date=2 Sep 2019}}</ref>  In September 1956, the X-2 was the first plane to reach 126,000 feet altitude and in its last flight exceeded Mach 3 (3.2) before losing control and crashing.

Though the design details were not exactly the same, the basic design of the V-2 was similar to one of Goddard's rockets. The V-2, however, was technically far more advanced than the most successful of the rockets designed and tested by Goddard. The [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center|Peenem\u00fcnde rocket group]] led by [[Wernher von Braun]] may have benefited from the pre-1939 contacts to a limited extent,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|387\u20138}} but had also started from the work of their own space pioneer, [[Hermann Oberth]]; they also had the benefit of intensive state funding, large-scale production facilities (using slave labor), and repeated flight-testing that allowed them to refine their designs.

General [[Walter Dornberger]], head of the V-2 project, used the idea that they were in a race with the U.S. and that Goddard had \"disappeared\" (to work with the Navy) as a way to persuade Hitler to raise the priority of the V-2.\n\n== Goddard's secrecy ==\nGoddard avoided sharing details of his work with other scientists and preferred to work alone with his technicians. [[Frank Malina]], who was then studying rocketry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], visited Goddard in August 1936. Goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research, other than that which had already been published in ''Liquid-Propellant Rocket Development''. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], Malina's mentor at the time, was unhappy with Goddard's attitude and later wrote, \"Naturally we at Caltech wanted as much information as we could get from Goddard for our mutual benefit. But Goddard believed in secrecy. ... The trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it.\" <ref name=\"Burrows\" />{{rp|90}} However, at an earlier point, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n said that Malina was \"highly enthusiastic\" after his visit and that Caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket, based on Goddard's work and patents. Malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in Goddard's shop.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|178}}\n\nGoddard's concerns about secrecy led to criticism for failure to cooperate with other scientists and engineers. His approach at that time was that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support. George Sutton, who became a rocket scientist working with von Braun's team in the late 1940s, said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of Goddard or his contributions and that they would have saved time if they had known the details of his work. Sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for Goddard's patents and depending on the German team for knowledge and guidance; he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the U.S. at that early period after World War II, though Germany and the Soviet Union had copies of some of them. (The Patent Office did not release rocket patents during World War II.)<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, Virginia|pages=267, 269}}</ref> However, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, an offshoot of the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at Caltech (GALCIT), filed two patent applications in Sep 1943 referencing Goddard's {{US patent|1102653}} for the multistage rocket.\n\nBy 1939, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT had received Army Air Corps funding to develop rockets to assist in aircraft take-off. Goddard learned of this in 1940, and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered.<ref name=\"Burrows\">{{cite book\n  |last=Burrows |first=William E.\n  |title=This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age\n  |year=1999 |publisher=Modern Library\n  | pages=89\u201392\n  |isbn=0-375-75485-7\n}}</ref> Malina could not understand why the Army did not arrange for an exchange of information between Goddard and Caltech since both were under government contract at the same time. Goddard did not think he could be of that much help to Caltech because they were designing rocket engines mainly with solid fuel, while he was using liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard was concerned with avoiding the public criticism and ridicule he had faced in the 1920s, which he believed had harmed his professional reputation. He also lacked interest in discussions with people who had less understanding of rocketry than he did,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|171}} feeling that his time was extremely constrained.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|23}} Goddard's health was frequently poor, as a result of his earlier bout of tuberculosis, and he was uncertain about how long he had to live<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|65,190}} He felt, therefore, that he hadn't the time to spare arguing with other scientists and the press about his new field of research, or helping all the amateur rocketeers who wrote to him.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61,71,110\u201311,114\u201315}} In 1932 Goddard wrote to H.

There can be no thought of finishing, for \"aiming at the stars\", both literally and figuratively, is a problem to occupy generations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.<ref name=Stoiko>{{cite book|last=Stoiko|first=Michael|title=Pioneers of Rocketry|year=1974|publisher=Hawthorn Books|location=New York|page=63}}</ref></blockquote>\nGoddard spoke to professional groups, published articles and papers and patented his ideas; but while he discussed basic principles, he was unwilling to reveal the details of his designs until he had flown rockets to high altitudes and thus proven his theory.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|115}} He tended to avoid any mention of space flight, and spoke only of high-altitude research, since he believed that other scientists regarded the subject as unscientific.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|116}} GALCIT saw Goddard's publicity problems and that the word \"rocket\" was \"of such bad repute\" that they used the word \"jet\" in the name of JPL and the related Aerojet Engineering Corporation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History Of Rocket Technology|editor-last=Emme|editor-first=Eugene E.|last1=Malina |first1=Frank J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=52}}</ref>\n\nMany authors writing about Goddard mention his secrecy, but\nneglect the reasons for it. Some reasons have been noted above. Much of his work was for the military and was classified.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1541}} There were some in the U.S. before World War II that called for long-range rockets, and in 1939 Major James Randolph wrote a \"provocative article\" advocating a 3000-mile range missile. Goddard was \"annoyed\" by the unclassified paper as he thought the subject of weapons should be \"discussed in strict secrecy.\" <ref name=\"Don\">{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Don P.|title=Bossart: America's Forgotten Rocket Scientist|year=2016|publisher=Mental Landscape|location=San Bernardino, CA|pages=76}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Goddard's tendency to secrecy was not absolute, nor was he totally uncooperative. In 1945 GALCIT was building the [[WAC Corporal]] for the Army.  But in 1942 they were having trouble with their liquid propellant rocket engine's performance (timely, smooth ignition and explosions). Frank Malina went  to Annapolis in February and consulted with Goddard and Stiff, and they arrived at a solution to the problem (hypergolic propellant), which resulted in the successful launch of the high-altitude research rocket in October 1945.<ref name=\"Heinz\">{{cite book|last=Gartmann|first=Heinz|title=The Men Behind the Space Rockets|year=1955|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|pages=149}}</ref>\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, Goddard offered his services, patents, and technology to the military, and made some significant contributions. Just before the Second World War several young Army officers and a few higher-ranking ones believed Goddard's research was important but were unable to generate funds for his work.<ref name=\"Glenn\">{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/rgoddardsite/|title=Robert H.

He made plans to work in the budding US aerospace industry (with Curtiss-Wright), taking most of his team with him.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|382,385}}\n\n==Personal life==\nOn June 21, 1924, Goddard married Esther Christine Kisk (March 31, 1901 \u2013 June 4, 1982),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faqs.cfm|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Dr. Robert H.

A distinction is generally made between the \"First French Colonial Empire,\" that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost or sold, and the \"Second French Colonial Empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex, the Second French colonial empire was one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}} in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\n\nThe main competition included [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the Dutch [[Dutch Empire|United Provinces]] and later [[English overseas possessions|Kingdom of Britain]] . France began to establish colonies in [[New France|North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[French India|India]] in the 17th century but lost most of its conquests following its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The north american holdings were ceded to Britain and Spain but the later retroceded [[Louisiana (New France)]] back to France in 1800 . The territory was then sold to the United States in 1803 ([[Louisiana Purchase]]). France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly [[French African colonies|in Africa]] as well as [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build [[German colonial empire|its own colonial empire]]. As it developed, the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige, especially regarding international power and spreading the [[French language]] and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tony Chafer |title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&pg=PA84 |year=2002 |publisher=Berg |pages=84\u201385 |isbn=9781859735572 }}</ref>\n\nA major goal was the {{lang|fr|Mission civilisatrice}} or \"The Civilizing Mission\".

Major revolts in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] and  [[Algerian War|Algeria]] proved very expensive and France lost both colonies.  Then followed a relatively peaceful [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization]] elsewhere after 1960.  The [[French constitution]] of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the [[French Union]] which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as [[overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] within the French Republic. These now total altogether 119,394&nbsp;km\u00b2 (46,098 sq. miles),  with 2.7 million people in 2013. By the 1970s, says [[Robert Aldrich (historian)|Robert Aldrich]], the last \"vestiges of empire held little interest for the French.\" He argues, \"Except for the traumatic decolonization of Algeria, however, what is remarkable is how few long-lasting effects on France the giving up of empire entailed.\"<ref>Robert Aldrich, ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'' (1996) p 305.

Due to this emphasis, the French relied heavily on creating friendly contacts with the local First Nations community. Without the appetite of New England for land, and by relying solely on Aboriginals to supply them with fur at the trading posts, the French composed a complex series of military, commercial, and diplomatic connections. These became the most enduring alliances between the French and the First Nation community. The French were, however, under pressure from religious orders to convert them to Catholicism.<ref>James R. Miller, ''Skyscrapers hide the heavens: A history of Indian-white relations in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThrough alliances with various Native American tribes, the French were able to exert a loose control over much of the North American continent. Areas of French settlement were generally limited to the [[St. Lawrence River]] Valley. Prior to the establishment of the 1663 [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]], the territories of New France were developed as [[mercantilism|mercantile colonies]]. It is only after the arrival of intendant [[Jean Talon]] in 1665 that France gave its American colonies the proper means to develop population colonies comparable to that of the British. Acadia itself was lost to the British in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. Back in France there was relatively little interest in colonialism, which concentrated rather on dominance within Europe, and for most of its history, New France was far behind the [[British North America]]n colonies in both population and economic development.<ref>Edward Robert Adair,  \"France and the Beginnings of New France.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 25.3 (1944): 246\u2013278.</ref><ref>Helen Dewar, \"Canada or Guadeloupe?: French and British Perceptions of Empire, 1760\u20131763.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 91.4 (2010): 637\u2013660.</ref>\n\nIn 1699, French territorial claims in North America expanded still further, with the foundation of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] in the basin of the [[Mississippi River]].

Settlement along the South American coast in what is today [[French Guiana]] began in 1624, and a colony was founded on [[Saint Kitts]] in 1625 (the island had to be shared with the English until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, when it was ceded outright). The ''[[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]]'' founded colonies in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] in 1635, and a colony was later founded on [[Saint Lucia]] by (1650).

These wars were the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u20131783), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1793\u20131802) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the [[French and Indian Wars]]. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the [[Second Hundred Years' War]].\n\nAlthough the War of the Austrian Succession was indecisive \u2013 despite French successes in India under the French Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]] and Europe under [[Marshal Saxe]] \u2013 the Seven Years' War, after early French successes in [[Menorca]] and North America, saw a French defeat, with the numerically superior British (over one million to about 50 thousand French settlers) conquering not only [[New France]] (excluding the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]), but also most of France's West Indian (Caribbean) colonies, and all of the [[French India|French Indian outposts]].\n\nWhile the peace treaty saw France's Indian outposts, and the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe restored to France, the competition for influence in India had been won by the British, and North America was entirely lost \u2013 most of [[New France]] was taken by Britain (also referred to as [[British North America]]), except [[Louisiana]], which France ceded to Spain as payment for Spain's late entrance into the war (and as compensation for Britain's annexation of Spanish Florida). Also ceded to the British were [[Grenada]] and [[Saint Lucia]] in the West Indies. Although the loss of Canada would cause much regret in future generations, it excited little unhappiness at the time; colonialism was widely regarded as both unimportant to France, and immoral.<ref>Colin Gordon Calloway,  ''The scratch of a pen: 1763 and the transformation of North America'' (2006). pp 165\u201369</ref>\n\nSome recovery of the French colonial empire was made during the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolution]], with Saint Lucia being returned to France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, but not nearly as much as had been hoped for at the time of French intervention. True disaster came to what remained of France's colonial empire in 1791 when Saint Domingue (the Western third of the Caribbean island of [[Hispaniola]]), France's richest and most important colony, was riven by a massive slave revolt, caused partly by the divisions among the island's elite, which had resulted from the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nThe slaves, led eventually by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and then, following his capture by the French in 1801, by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], held their own against French and British opponents, and ultimately achieved independence as [[First Empire of Haiti|Empire of Haiti]] in 1804 (Haiti became the first black republic in the world, followed by Liberia in 1847).<ref>Mimi Sheller,  \"The 'Haytian Fear': Racial Projects and Competing Reactions to the First Black Republic.\" ''Research in Politics and Society'' 6 (1999): 285\u2013304.</ref> The black and mulatto population of the island (including the Spanish east) had declined from 700,000 in 1789 to 351,819 in 1804.

The object of his policy was not to take territory, but to assure that the vast and lucrative Chinese market was open to French commerce, and not the exclusive trading partner of Britain. In January 1858 a combined British and French fleet bombarded and occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and landed troops at the mouth of the [[Hai River]] in northern China. In June 1858 the Chinese government in Peking was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] with Britain, France, Russia and the United States. This treaty opened six additional Chinese ports to European merchant ships, allowed Christian missionary activity, and legalized the import of opium into China.\n\n[[File:Looting of the Yuan Ming Yuan by Anglo French forces in 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Anglo-French forces pillage China's [[Summer Palace]], October 1860]]\nThe Chinese government was reluctant to observe the treaty, so Napoleon III and the British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]] decided to take more forceful action, in what became known in history as the second phase of the [[Second Opium War]]. A joint French-British expeditionary force of 8,000 men was created under a French general, [[Charles Cousin-Montauban]], who had commanded French forces in Algeria. At the beginning of 1860 the French-British fleet sailed from Europe, and in the spring of 1860 landed the army in China. The Anglo-French army force, led by Cousin-Montauban, captured Tientsin, and then marched on the capital.

At the orders of the British commander [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], the British and French forces burned and pillaged the [[Old Summer Palace]] of the Chinese Emperor. On 25 October 1860, the Chinese Emperor was obliged to accept a second treaty of Tientsin, opening an additional eleven new ports to European trade, making westerners immune to prosecution by Chinese courts, and establishing western diplomatic missions in Beijing. Some of the art objects taken from the looted Summer Palace were carried to France, where the Empress used them to decorate a Chinese-themed salon at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where they can be seen today.<ref>H.

Twelve Catholic priests at the time were living in Korea, with an estimated 23,000 Korean converts, belonging to churches founded by French missionaries in the 18th century. In January 1866, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and his father, regent [[Heungseon Daewongun|Daewongun]], ordered the execution of most of the French priests, and ten thousand converts. A squadron of French ships, carrying eight hundred naval infantry, attempted retaliation but made little headway.<ref>Daniel C. Kane, \"Bellonet and Roze: Overzealous Servants of Empire and the 1866 French Attack on Korea,\" ''Korean Studies'' (1999) Vol. 23, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn Japan the Meiji Emperor, and his enemies, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], both sought French military training and technology in their battle for power, known as the [[Boshin War]].\nIn 1867, a [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|military mission to Japan]] played a key role in modernizing the troops of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], and even participated on his side against Imperial troops during the [[Boshin war]]. The European representative of the Shogunate, [[Shibata Takenaka]], approached both Britain and France, asking assistance to build a modern shipyard and to train the Shogunate army in modern western warfare. The shipyard, which became the naval base of [[Yokosuka]], was designed by the French engineer [[Leonce Verny]]. The British, who supported the imperial faction, declined to provide trainers, but Napoleon III agreed, and in 1867 dispatched a delegation of nineteen French military experts in the fields of infantry, cavalry and artillery to Japan. They trained an elite corps, called the [[Denshutai]], to fight on the side of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nOn the other side, the Emperor purchased from the United States a French-built ironclad warship, renamed the [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|Kotetsu]] (literally \"ironclad\"). It played an important role in the first modern naval battle fought in Japan. By 1868, the Imperial forces had won a decisive victory. French influence in the Japanese navy remained strong.<ref>Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba, ''The last shogun: the life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu'' (1998) pp. 169\u2013172</ref>\n\n===France in Indochina and the Pacific (1858\u20131870)===\nNapoleon III also acted to increase the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Deeper down was the sense that France owed the world a civilizing mission.<ref>Arthur J. Dommen, ''The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans'' (2001) p. 4</ref>\n\nFrench missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, when the Jesuit priest [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] opened a mission there. In 1858 the Vietnamese emperor of the [[Nguyen Dynasty]] felt threatened by the French influence and tried to expel the missionaries. Napoleon III sent a naval force of fourteen gunships, carrying three thousand French and three thousand Filipino troops provided by Spain, under [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]], to compel the government to accept the missionaries and to stop the persecution of Catholics. In September 1858 the expeditionary force captured and occupied the port of [[Da Nang]], and then in February 1859 moved south and captured [[Saigon]]. The Vietnamese ruler was compelled to cede three provinces to France, and to offer protection to the Catholics. The French troops departed for a time to take part in the expedition to China, but in 1862, when the agreements were not fully followed by the Vietnamese emperor, they returned. The Emperor was forced to open treaty ports in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]], and all of [[Cochinchina]] became a French territory in 1864.\n\nIn 1863, the ruler of [[Cambodia]], King [[Norodom]], who had been placed in power by the government of [[Thailand]], rebelled against his sponsors and sought the protection of France. The Thai Emperor granted authority over Cambodia to France, in exchange for two provinces of [[Laos]], which were ceded by Cambodia to Thailand. In 1867, Cambodia formally became a protectorate of France.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Prise de Saigon 18 Fevrier 1859 Antoine Morel-Fatio.jpg|[[Siege of Saigon|Capture of Saigon]] by [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]] on 18 February 1859, painted by [[Antoine Morel-Fatio]]\nFile:Jean-Leon Gerome 001.JPG|Napoleon III receiving the [[France-Thailand relations|Siamese embassy]] at the palace of Fontainebleau in 1864\n</gallery>\n\n===Intervention in Syria and Lebanon (1860\u20131861)===\n[[File:French expeditionary corps landing in Beyrouth 16 August 1860.jpg|thumb|The [[R\u00e8glement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French expedition in Syria]] led by General [[Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], landing in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860]]\nIn the spring of 1860, a war broke out in [[Lebanon]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], between the quasi-Muslim [[Druze]] population and the [[Maronite Christians]]. The Ottoman authorities in Lebanon could not stop the violence, and it spread into neighboring [[Syria]], with the massacre of many Christians. In [[Damascus]], the Emir Abd-el-Kadr protected the Christians there against the Muslim rioters. Napoleon III felt obliged to intervene on behalf of the Christians, despite the opposition of London, which feared it would lead to a wider French presence in the Middle East. After long and difficult negotiations to obtain the approval of the British government, Napoleon III sent a French contingent of seven thousand men for a period of six months. The troops arrived in Beirut in August 1860, and took positions in the mountains between the Christian and Muslim communities. Napoleon III organized an international conference in Paris, where the country was placed under the rule of a Christian governor named by the Ottoman Sultan, which restored a fragile peace. The French troops departed in June 1861, after just under one year. The French intervention alarmed the British, but was highly popular with the powerful Catholic political faction in France, which had been alarmed by Napoleon's dispute with the Pope over his territories in Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 313</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n[[File:Vernet-Combat de Somah.jpg|thumb|The [[French North Africa|French conquest of Algeria]]]]\nAlgeria had been formally under French rule since 1830, but only in 1852 was the country entirely conquered. There were about 100,000 European settlers in the country, at that time, about half of them French. Under the Second Republic the country was ruled by a civilian government, but Louis Napoleon re-established a military government, much to the annoyance of the colonists. By 1857 the army had conquered Kabyle Province, and pacified the country.

In September 1860, however, he and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie visited Algeria, and the trip made a deep impression upon them. Eug\u00e9nie was invited to attend a traditional Arab wedding, and the Emperor met many of the local leaders. The Emperor gradually conceived the idea that Algeria should be governed differently from other colonies. in February 1863, he wrote a public letter to Pelissier, the Military Governor, saying: \"Algeria is not a colony in the traditional sense, but an Arab kingdom; the local people have, like the colonists, a legal right to my protection. I am just as much the Emperor of the Arabs of Algeria as I am of the French.\" He intended to rule Algeria through a government of Arab aristocrats. Toward this end he invited the chiefs of main Algerian tribal groups to his chateau at Compiegne for hunting and festivities.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 321-322</ref>\n\nCompared to previous administrations, Napoleon III was far more sympathetic to the native Algerians.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic period |last=Abun-Nasr |first=Jamil M. |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33767-0 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=10 November 2010 }}</ref> He halted European migration inland, restricting them to the coastal zone. He also freed the Algerian rebel leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al Qadir]] (who had been promised freedom on surrender but was imprisoned by the previous administration) and gave him a stipend of 150,000 francs. He allowed Muslims to serve in the military and civil service on theoretically equal terms and allowed them to migrate to France. In addition, he gave the option of citizenship; however, for Muslims to take this option they had to accept all of the French civil code, including parts governing inheritance and marriage which conflicted with Muslim laws, and they had to reject the competence of religious [[Sharia]] courts. This was interpreted by some Muslims as requiring them to give up parts of their religion to obtain citizenship and was resented.\n\nMore importantly, Napoleon III changed the system of land tenure. While ostensibly well-intentioned, in effect this move destroyed the traditional system of land management and deprived many Algerians of land. While Napoleon did renounce state claims to tribal lands, he also began a process of dismantling tribal land ownership in favour of individual land ownership. This process was corrupted by French officials sympathetic to the French in Algeria who took much of the land they surveyed into public domain. In addition, many tribal leaders, chosen for loyalty to the French rather than influence in their tribe, immediately sold communal land for cash.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jamil M. Abun-Nasr|title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=264|isbn=9780521337670}}</ref>\n\nHis attempted reforms were interrupted in 1864 by an Arab insurrection, which required more than a year and an army of 85,000 soldiers to suppress. Nonetheless, he did not give up his idea of making Algeria a model where French colonists and Arabs could live and work together as equals. He traveled to Algiers for a second time on 3 May 1865, and this time he remained for a month, meeting with tribal leaders and local officials. He offered a wide amnesty to participants of the insurrection, and promised to name Arabs to high positions in his government. He also promised a large public works program of new ports, railroads, and roads. However, once again his plans met a major natural obstacle' in 1866 and 1867, Algeria was struck by an epidemic of cholera, clouds of locusts, draught and famine, and his reforms were hindered by the French colonists, who voted massively against him in the plebiscites of his late reign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 322-23</ref>\n\n===French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867)===\n{{Main|French intervention in Mexico|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Emperador Maximiliano I de Mexico.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III tried unsuccessfully to place [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, on the throne of Mexico. Portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] in [[Chapultepec Castle]], Mexico]]\nIn December 1862, the conservative Mexican government was overthrown by [[Benito Juarez]], who established a secular state and refused to pay the internal and external debts of the old government. France was the largest owner of the debt, owed 135 million gold francs of the 260 million francs total. The rest of the debt was owed to Britain (85 million francs) and Spain (40 million). Under an 1861 agreement, France, Britain and Spain organized a joint military force to compel the Mexican government to pay. A British-French flotilla of ships arrived at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|VeraCruz]] in December 1861 and landed 7500 French soldiers and 700 British soldiers, joined later by 6000 Spanish soldiers from [[Cuba]].\n\nJuarez opened negotiations with the international force, but it soon became evident that the French expedition had a more ambitious objective than debt repayment. Napoleon III and the Empress had been intensively lobbied by Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe, who proposed that France establish a new conservative and Catholic government in Mexico, under a European monarch. Napoleon III was told that the new monarch would be welcomed by the entire Mexican population. He consented to launch the operation if the new monarch would be approved by a national plebiscite, as he had been. The monarch selected for this task was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|the Archduke Maximilian]], the brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz-Joseph II, and husband of [[Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of the King of Belgium.\n\nWhen the British and Spanish realized the French goals, they withdrew from the expedition, but the French marched on Mexico City. The first attempt by General Lorencez was repulsed by the forces of General [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] at [[Puebla]] on 5 May 1862, the first defeat of a French Army since Waterloo. Napoleon III appointed a new commander, General Forey, one of the victors of Solferino, and sent 23,000 fresh soldiers. Napoleon III believed that the Mexican people would embrace the new government. He also knew that the government of the United States would be unable to prevent it, even though it was in contravention of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], because of the [[American Civil War]] then underway, and the implicit support provided by the neighboring Confederate States of America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles M.

After bitter resistance, the defenders of Mexico City surrendered on 7 June 1863. Forey, disregarding Napoleon III's instructions not to install a monarch without a popular plebiscite, organized an assembly of Mexican notables who proclaimed the Mexican Empire and invited [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] to rule. Ruling President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and his Republican forces retreated to the countryside and fought against the French troops and the Mexican monarchists.\n\n[[File:San Pablo del Monte.jpg|thumb|French [[chasseurs d'Afrique]] taking the standard of the Durango lancers at the [[Battle of San Pablo del Monte]]]]\nMaximilian was a reluctant Emperor, not arriving in Mexico until June 1864. One of his first acts was to sign an agreement that Mexico would repay France the entire cost of the war. The combined Mexican monarchist and French forces won victories up until 1865, but then the tide began to turn against them, in part because the American Civil War had ended. The U.S. government demanded that France withdraw its soldiers from Mexico. Facing a guerilla war and a financial catastrophe, the Emperor Maximilian became more and more depressed, leaving the capital for long periods and allowing the [[Carlota of Mexico|Empress Carlota]] to reign. Not willing to have a war with the United States, Napoleon III decided at the beginning of 1866 to withdraw French troops from Mexico. In 1863 Maximilian had sent Carlota to Europe to appeal for funds and support. She appealed to Napoleon III, but he refused to provide more troops or money. During her tour of European courts, she lost and never regained her sanity. Maximilian refused pleas that he depart, and fought against the growing partisan army of Juarez. He was captured, judged, and shot on 19 June 1867.\n\nThe misadventure in Mexico cost the lives of six thousand French soldiers and 336 million francs, in a campaign originally designed to collect 60 million francs. It also aroused the hostility of both the United States and Austria, which had lost a member of its royal family. It was also a distraction to Napoleon III, on the eve of his coming confrontation with Prussia.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Maximilian and Ju\u00e1rez'' (1992).</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Si\u00e8ge de Puebla - 29 mars 1863.PNG|The [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Siege of Puebla]] by the French Army\nFile:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|The execution of Maximilian I on 19 June 1867, as painted by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British foreign minister from 1846 to 1851 and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] from 1855 to 1865, sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe; this rarely involved an alignment with France.

Both nations saw it as vital to maintaining their influence and empires in Asia. In 1882, ongoing civil disturbances in Egypt prompted Britain to intervene, extending a hand to France.

Washington repeatedly warned that this meant war but the emperor kept this option open, hoping to get Britain as an ally. The Union blockade of southern ports stopped the supply of cotton to textile mills in France, and caused unemployment. The Confederacy had put their faith in [[Cotton diplomacy|\"King Cotton\" diplomacy]], expecting that the cutoff of cotton supplies would cause Britain and France to declare war to reopen the trade. Through 1862, Napoleon III met unofficially with Confederate diplomats, raising their hopes that he would unilaterally recognize the Confederacy. France was reluctant to act without collaboration with the British, who after much wavering finally rejected intervention as not worth the heavy risk of losing American food exports. Napoleon realized that a war with the U.S. without allies \"would spell disaster\" for France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC&pg=PA183|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=183|isbn=0803225822}}</ref> In 1863 the Confederacy realized there was no longer any chance of intervention, and expelled the French and British consuls, who were advising their citizens not to enlist in the Confederate Army.

After years of diplomatic negotiation, Britain and France agreed to abrogate the convention in 1887 and the French formally annexed all the Leeward Islands without official treaties of cession from the islands' sovereign governments.

A distinction is generally made between the \"first colonial empire,\" that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \"second colonial empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex, the Second French colonial empire was one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}} in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\n\nThe main competition included [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the Dutch [[Dutch Empire|United Provinces]] and later [[English overseas possessions|Kingdom of Britain]] . France began to establish colonies in [[New France|North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[French India|India]] in the 17th century. A series of wars with Britain and others resulted in France losing nearly all of its conquests by 1814. France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly [[French African colonies|in Africa]] as well as [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build [[German colonial empire|its own colonial empire]]. As it developed, the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige, especially regarding international power and spreading the [[French language]] and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tony Chafer |title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&pg=PA84 |year=2002 |publisher=Berg |pages=84\u201385 |isbn=9781859735572 }}</ref>\n\nA major goal was the {{lang|fr|Mission civilisatrice}} or \"The Civilizing Mission\".

Historian Tony Chafer argues: \"In an effort to restore its world-power status after the humiliation of defeat and occupation, France was eager to maintain its overseas empire at the end of the Second World War.\"<ref>Tony Chafer, ''The end of empire in French West Africa: France's successful decolonization?''

Major revolts in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] and  [[Algerian War|Algeria]] proved very expensive and France lost both colonies.  Then followed a relatively peaceful [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization]] elsewhere after 1960.  The [[French constitution]] of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the [[French Union]] which endured until 1958.

Due to this emphasis, the French relied heavily on creating friendly contacts with the local First Nations community. Without the appetite of New England for land, and by relying solely on Aboriginals to supply them with fur at the trading posts, the French composed a complex series of military, commercial, and diplomatic connections. These became the most enduring alliances between the French and the First Nation community. The French were, however, under pressure from religious orders to convert them to Catholicism.<ref>James R. Miller, ''Skyscrapers hide the heavens: A history of Indian-white relations in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThrough alliances with various Native American tribes, the French were able to exert a loose control over much of the North American continent.

Acadia itself was lost to the British in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713.

These wars were the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u20131783), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1793\u20131802) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the [[French and Indian Wars]]. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the [[Second Hundred Years' War]].\n\nAlthough the War of the Austrian Succession was indecisive \u2013 despite French successes in India under the French Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]] and Europe under [[Marshal Saxe]] \u2013 the Seven Years' War, after early French successes in [[Menorca]] and North America, saw a French defeat, with the numerically superior British (over one million to about 50 thousand French settlers) conquering not only [[New France]] (excluding the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]), but also most of France's West Indian (Caribbean) colonies, and all of the [[French India|French Indian outposts]].\n\nWhile the peace treaty saw France's Indian outposts, and the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe restored to France, the competition for influence in India had been won by the British, and North America was entirely lost \u2013 most of [[New France]] was taken by Britain (also referred to as [[British North America]]), except [[Louisiana]], which France ceded to Spain as payment for Spain's late entrance into the war (and as compensation for Britain's annexation of Spanish Florida). Also ceded to the British were [[Grenada]] and [[Saint Lucia]] in the West Indies. Although the loss of Canada would cause much regret in future generations, it excited little unhappiness at the time; colonialism was widely regarded as both unimportant to France, and immoral.<ref>Colin Gordon Calloway,  ''The scratch of a pen: 1763 and the transformation of North America'' (2006). pp 165\u201369</ref>\n\nSome recovery of the French colonial empire was made during the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolution]], with Saint Lucia being returned to France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, but not nearly as much as had been hoped for at the time of French intervention. True disaster came to what remained of France's colonial empire in 1791 when Saint Domingue (the Western third of the Caribbean island of [[Hispaniola]]), France's richest and most important colony, was riven by a massive slave revolt, caused partly by the divisions among the island's elite, which had resulted from the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nThe slaves, led eventually by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and then, following his capture by the French in 1801, by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], held their own against French and British opponents, and ultimately achieved independence as [[First Empire of Haiti|Empire of Haiti]] in 1804 (Haiti became the first black republic in the world, followed by Liberia in 1847).<ref>Mimi Sheller,  \"The 'Haytian Fear': Racial Projects and Competing Reactions to the First Black Republic.\" ''Research in Politics and Society'' 6 (1999): 285\u2013304.</ref> The black and mulatto population of the island (including the Spanish east) had declined from 700,000 in 1789 to 351,819 in 1804.

The economy had largely been based on the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]], carried out by the rulers of the small kingdoms of the interior, until France [[abolition of slavery|abolished slavery]] in its colonies in 1848. In 1854, Napoleon III named an enterprising [[French Army|French]] officer, [[Louis Faidherbe]], to govern and expand the colony, and to give it the beginning of a modern economy. Faidherbe built a series of forts along the Senegal River, formed alliances with leaders in the interior, and sent expeditions against those who resisted French rule. He built a new port at [[Dakar]], established and protected telegraph lines and roads, followed these with a [[Dakar-Saint-Louis railway|rail line between Dakar and Saint-Louis]] and [[Dakar\u2013Niger Railway|another into the interior]]. He built schools, bridges, and systems to supply fresh water to the towns. He also introduced the large-scale cultivation of [[Bambara groundnuts]] and peanuts as a commercial crop. Reaching into the [[Niger River|Niger]] valley, Senegal became the primary French base in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] and a model colony. Dakar became one of the most important cities of the French Empire and of Africa.<ref>G.

The object of his policy was not to take territory, but to assure that the vast and lucrative Chinese market was open to French commerce, and not the exclusive trading partner of Britain. In January 1858 a combined British and French fleet bombarded and occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and landed troops at the mouth of the [[Hai River]] in northern China. In June 1858 the Chinese government in Peking was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] with Britain, France, Russia and the United States. This treaty opened six additional Chinese ports to European merchant ships, allowed Christian missionary activity, and legalized the import of opium into China.\n\n[[File:Looting of the Yuan Ming Yuan by Anglo French forces in 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Anglo-French forces pillage China's [[Summer Palace]], October 1860]]\nThe Chinese government was reluctant to observe the treaty, so Napoleon III and the British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]] decided to take more forceful action, in what became known in history as the second phase of the [[Second Opium War]]. A joint French-British expeditionary force of 8,000 men was created under a French general, [[Charles Cousin-Montauban]], who had commanded French forces in Algeria. At the beginning of 1860 the French-British fleet sailed from Europe, and in the spring of 1860 landed the army in China. The Anglo-French army force, led by Cousin-Montauban, captured Tientsin, and then marched on the capital. On 21 September 1860 it defeated the army of the Chinese emperor at the [[Battle of Palikao]] and seized the capital Beijing. At the orders of the British commander [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], the British and French forces burned and pillaged the [[Old Summer Palace]] of the Chinese Emperor. On 25 October 1860, the Chinese Emperor was obliged to accept a second treaty of Tientsin, opening an additional eleven new ports to European trade, making westerners immune to prosecution by Chinese courts, and establishing western diplomatic missions in Beijing. Some of the art objects taken from the looted Summer Palace were carried to France, where the Empress used them to decorate a Chinese-themed salon at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where they can be seen today.<ref>H.

Twelve Catholic priests at the time were living in Korea, with an estimated 23,000 Korean converts, belonging to churches founded by French missionaries in the 18th century. In January 1866, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and his father, regent [[Heungseon Daewongun|Daewongun]], ordered the execution of most of the French priests, and ten thousand converts. A squadron of French ships, carrying eight hundred naval infantry, attempted retaliation but made little headway.<ref>Daniel C. Kane, \"Bellonet and Roze: Overzealous Servants of Empire and the 1866 French Attack on Korea,\" ''Korean Studies'' (1999) Vol. 23, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn Japan the Meiji Emperor, and his enemies, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], both sought French military training and technology in their battle for power, known as the [[Boshin War]].\nIn 1867, a [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|military mission to Japan]] played a key role in modernizing the troops of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], and even participated on his side against Imperial troops during the [[Boshin war]]. The European representative of the Shogunate, [[Shibata Takenaka]], approached both Britain and France, asking assistance to build a modern shipyard and to train the Shogunate army in modern western warfare. The shipyard, which became the naval base of [[Yokosuka]], was designed by the French engineer [[Leonce Verny]]. The British, who supported the imperial faction, declined to provide trainers, but Napoleon III agreed, and in 1867 dispatched a delegation of nineteen French military experts in the fields of infantry, cavalry and artillery to Japan. They trained an elite corps, called the [[Denshutai]], to fight on the side of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nOn the other side, the Emperor purchased from the United States a French-built ironclad warship, renamed the [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|Kotetsu]] (literally \"ironclad\"). It played an important role in the first modern naval battle fought in Japan. By 1868, the Imperial forces had won a decisive victory. French influence in the Japanese navy remained strong.<ref>Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba, ''The last shogun: the life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu'' (1998) pp. 169\u2013172</ref>\n\n===France in Indochina and the Pacific (1858\u20131870)===\nNapoleon III also acted to increase the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Deeper down was the sense that France owed the world a civilizing mission.<ref>Arthur J. Dommen, ''The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans'' (2001) p. 4</ref>\n\nFrench missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, when the Jesuit priest [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] opened a mission there. In 1858 the Vietnamese emperor of the [[Nguyen Dynasty]] felt threatened by the French influence and tried to expel the missionaries. Napoleon III sent a naval force of fourteen gunships, carrying three thousand French and three thousand Filipino troops provided by Spain, under [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]], to compel the government to accept the missionaries and to stop the persecution of Catholics. In September 1858 the expeditionary force captured and occupied the port of [[Da Nang]], and then in February 1859 moved south and captured [[Saigon]]. The Vietnamese ruler was compelled to cede three provinces to France, and to offer protection to the Catholics. The French troops departed for a time to take part in the expedition to China, but in 1862, when the agreements were not fully followed by the Vietnamese emperor, they returned. The Emperor was forced to open treaty ports in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]], and all of [[Cochinchina]] became a French territory in 1864.\n\nIn 1863, the ruler of [[Cambodia]], King [[Norodom]], who had been placed in power by the government of [[Thailand]], rebelled against his sponsors and sought the protection of France. The Thai Emperor granted authority over Cambodia to France, in exchange for two provinces of [[Laos]], which were ceded by Cambodia to Thailand. In 1867, Cambodia formally became a protectorate of France.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Prise de Saigon 18 Fevrier 1859 Antoine Morel-Fatio.jpg|[[Siege of Saigon|Capture of Saigon]] by [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]] on 18 February 1859, painted by [[Antoine Morel-Fatio]]\nFile:Jean-Leon Gerome 001.JPG|Napoleon III receiving the [[France-Thailand relations|Siamese embassy]] at the palace of Fontainebleau in 1864\n</gallery>\n\n===Intervention in Syria and Lebanon (1860\u20131861)===\n[[File:French expeditionary corps landing in Beyrouth 16 August 1860.jpg|thumb|The [[R\u00e8glement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French expedition in Syria]] led by General [[Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], landing in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860]]\nIn the spring of 1860, a war broke out in [[Lebanon]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], between the quasi-Muslim [[Druze]] population and the [[Maronite Christians]]. The Ottoman authorities in Lebanon could not stop the violence, and it spread into neighboring [[Syria]], with the massacre of many Christians. In [[Damascus]], the Emir Abd-el-Kadr protected the Christians there against the Muslim rioters. Napoleon III felt obliged to intervene on behalf of the Christians, despite the opposition of London, which feared it would lead to a wider French presence in the Middle East. After long and difficult negotiations to obtain the approval of the British government, Napoleon III sent a French contingent of seven thousand men for a period of six months. The troops arrived in Beirut in August 1860, and took positions in the mountains between the Christian and Muslim communities. Napoleon III organized an international conference in Paris, where the country was placed under the rule of a Christian governor named by the Ottoman Sultan, which restored a fragile peace. The French troops departed in June 1861, after just under one year. The French intervention alarmed the British, but was highly popular with the powerful Catholic political faction in France, which had been alarmed by Napoleon's dispute with the Pope over his territories in Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 313</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n[[File:Vernet-Combat de Somah.jpg|thumb|The [[French North Africa|French conquest of Algeria]]]]\nAlgeria had been formally under French rule since 1830, but only in 1852 was the country entirely conquered. There were about 100,000 European settlers in the country, at that time, about half of them French. Under the Second Republic the country was ruled by a civilian government, but Louis Napoleon re-established a military government, much to the annoyance of the colonists. By 1857 the army had conquered Kabyle Province, and pacified the country.

In September 1860, however, he and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie visited Algeria, and the trip made a deep impression upon them. Eug\u00e9nie was invited to attend a traditional Arab wedding, and the Emperor met many of the local leaders. The Emperor gradually conceived the idea that Algeria should be governed differently from other colonies. in February 1863, he wrote a public letter to Pelissier, the Military Governor, saying: \"Algeria is not a colony in the traditional sense, but an Arab kingdom; the local people have, like the colonists, a legal right to my protection. I am just as much the Emperor of the Arabs of Algeria as I am of the French.\" He intended to rule Algeria through a government of Arab aristocrats. Toward this end he invited the chiefs of main Algerian tribal groups to his chateau at Compiegne for hunting and festivities.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 321-322</ref>\n\nCompared to previous administrations, Napoleon III was far more sympathetic to the native Algerians.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic period |last=Abun-Nasr |first=Jamil M. |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33767-0 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=10 November 2010 }}</ref> He halted European migration inland, restricting them to the coastal zone. He also freed the Algerian rebel leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al Qadir]] (who had been promised freedom on surrender but was imprisoned by the previous administration) and gave him a stipend of 150,000 francs. He allowed Muslims to serve in the military and civil service on theoretically equal terms and allowed them to migrate to France. In addition, he gave the option of citizenship; however, for Muslims to take this option they had to accept all of the French civil code, including parts governing inheritance and marriage which conflicted with Muslim laws, and they had to reject the competence of religious [[Sharia]] courts. This was interpreted by some Muslims as requiring them to give up parts of their religion to obtain citizenship and was resented.\n\nMore importantly, Napoleon III changed the system of land tenure. While ostensibly well-intentioned, in effect this move destroyed the traditional system of land management and deprived many Algerians of land. While Napoleon did renounce state claims to tribal lands, he also began a process of dismantling tribal land ownership in favour of individual land ownership. This process was corrupted by French officials sympathetic to the French in Algeria who took much of the land they surveyed into public domain. In addition, many tribal leaders, chosen for loyalty to the French rather than influence in their tribe, immediately sold communal land for cash.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jamil M. Abun-Nasr|title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=264|isbn=9780521337670}}</ref>\n\nHis attempted reforms were interrupted in 1864 by an Arab insurrection, which required more than a year and an army of 85,000 soldiers to suppress. Nonetheless, he did not give up his idea of making Algeria a model where French colonists and Arabs could live and work together as equals. He traveled to Algiers for a second time on 3 May 1865, and this time he remained for a month, meeting with tribal leaders and local officials. He offered a wide amnesty to participants of the insurrection, and promised to name Arabs to high positions in his government. He also promised a large public works program of new ports, railroads, and roads. However, once again his plans met a major natural obstacle' in 1866 and 1867, Algeria was struck by an epidemic of cholera, clouds of locusts, draught and famine, and his reforms were hindered by the French colonists, who voted massively against him in the plebiscites of his late reign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 322-23</ref>\n\n===French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867)===\n{{Main|French intervention in Mexico|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Emperador Maximiliano I de Mexico.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III tried unsuccessfully to place [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, on the throne of Mexico. Portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] in [[Chapultepec Castle]], Mexico]]\nIn December 1862, the conservative Mexican government was overthrown by [[Benito Juarez]], who established a secular state and refused to pay the internal and external debts of the old government. France was the largest owner of the debt, owed 135 million gold francs of the 260 million francs total. The rest of the debt was owed to Britain (85 million francs) and Spain (40 million). Under an 1861 agreement, France, Britain and Spain organized a joint military force to compel the Mexican government to pay. A British-French flotilla of ships arrived at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|VeraCruz]] in December 1861 and landed 7500 French soldiers and 700 British soldiers, joined later by 6000 Spanish soldiers from [[Cuba]].\n\nJuarez opened negotiations with the international force, but it soon became evident that the French expedition had a more ambitious objective than debt repayment. Napoleon III and the Empress had been intensively lobbied by Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe, who proposed that France establish a new conservative and Catholic government in Mexico, under a European monarch. Napoleon III was told that the new monarch would be welcomed by the entire Mexican population. He consented to launch the operation if the new monarch would be approved by a national plebiscite, as he had been. The monarch selected for this task was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|the Archduke Maximilian]], the brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz-Joseph II, and husband of [[Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of the King of Belgium.\n\nWhen the British and Spanish realized the French goals, they withdrew from the expedition, but the French marched on Mexico City. The first attempt by General Lorencez was repulsed by the forces of General [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] at [[Puebla]] on 5 May 1862, the first defeat of a French Army since Waterloo. Napoleon III appointed a new commander, General Forey, one of the victors of Solferino, and sent 23,000 fresh soldiers. Napoleon III believed that the Mexican people would embrace the new government. He also knew that the government of the United States would be unable to prevent it, even though it was in contravention of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], because of the [[American Civil War]] then underway, and the implicit support provided by the neighboring Confederate States of America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles M.

After bitter resistance, the defenders of Mexico City surrendered on 7 June 1863. Forey, disregarding Napoleon III's instructions not to install a monarch without a popular plebiscite, organized an assembly of Mexican notables who proclaimed the Mexican Empire and invited [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] to rule. Ruling President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and his Republican forces retreated to the countryside and fought against the French troops and the Mexican monarchists.\n\n[[File:San Pablo del Monte.jpg|thumb|French [[chasseurs d'Afrique]] taking the standard of the Durango lancers at the [[Battle of San Pablo del Monte]]]]\nMaximilian was a reluctant Emperor, not arriving in Mexico until June 1864. One of his first acts was to sign an agreement that Mexico would repay France the entire cost of the war. The combined Mexican monarchist and French forces won victories up until 1865, but then the tide began to turn against them, in part because the American Civil War had ended. The U.S. government demanded that France withdraw its soldiers from Mexico. Facing a guerilla war and a financial catastrophe, the Emperor Maximilian became more and more depressed, leaving the capital for long periods and allowing the [[Carlota of Mexico|Empress Carlota]] to reign. Not willing to have a war with the United States, Napoleon III decided at the beginning of 1866 to withdraw French troops from Mexico. In 1863 Maximilian had sent Carlota to Europe to appeal for funds and support. She appealed to Napoleon III, but he refused to provide more troops or money. During her tour of European courts, she lost and never regained her sanity. Maximilian refused pleas that he depart, and fought against the growing partisan army of Juarez. He was captured, judged, and shot on 19 June 1867.\n\nThe misadventure in Mexico cost the lives of six thousand French soldiers and 336 million francs, in a campaign originally designed to collect 60 million francs. It also aroused the hostility of both the United States and Austria, which had lost a member of its royal family. It was also a distraction to Napoleon III, on the eve of his coming confrontation with Prussia.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Maximilian and Ju\u00e1rez'' (1992).</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Si\u00e8ge de Puebla - 29 mars 1863.PNG|The [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Siege of Puebla]] by the French Army\nFile:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|The execution of Maximilian I on 19 June 1867, as painted by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British foreign minister from 1846 to 1851 and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] from 1855 to 1865, sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe; this rarely involved an alignment with France.

Washington repeatedly warned that this meant war but the emperor kept this option open, hoping to get Britain as an ally. The Union blockade of southern ports stopped the supply of cotton to textile mills in France, and caused unemployment. The Confederacy had put their faith in [[Cotton diplomacy|\"King Cotton\" diplomacy]], expecting that the cutoff of cotton supplies would cause Britain and France to declare war to reopen the trade. Through 1862, Napoleon III met unofficially with Confederate diplomats, raising their hopes that he would unilaterally recognize the Confederacy. France was reluctant to act without collaboration with the British, who after much wavering finally rejected intervention as not worth the heavy risk of losing American food exports. Napoleon realized that a war with the U.S. without allies \"would spell disaster\" for France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC&pg=PA183|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=183|isbn=0803225822}}</ref> In 1863 the Confederacy realized there was no longer any chance of intervention, and expelled the French and British consuls, who were advising their citizens not to enlist in the Confederate Army.

France generally had close to the slowest natural population growth in Europe, and emigration pressures were therefore quite small. A small but significant emigration, numbering only in the tens of thousands, of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the provinces of [[Acadia]], Canada and [[Louisiana]], both (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and Africa. In New France, Huguenots were banned from settling in the territory, and Quebec was one of the most staunchly Catholic areas in the world until the [[Quiet Revolution]]. The current [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] population, which numbers in the millions, is descended almost entirely from New France's small settler population.\n\nOn 31 December 1687 a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population. After Champlain's founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of [[New France]]. Encouraging settlement was difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1763 New France only had a population of some 65,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=British North America: 1763\u20131841 |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563379_21/canada.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031124234/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563379_21/Canada.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn 1787, there were 30,000 white colonists on France's colony of [[Saint-Domingue]].

He was the youngest son of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]]. His father died when he was young and three of Alfred's brothers, [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]], [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], reigned in turn before him.\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Alfred spent several years fighting [[Viking]] invasions. He won a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878 and made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as the [[Danelaw]] in the North of England. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of Viking leader [[Guthrum]] to Christianity. He defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, becoming the dominant ruler in England.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328 }} Details of his life are described in a work by 9th-century Welsh scholar and bishop [[Asser]].\n\nAlfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin and improving the legal system and military structure and his people's quality of life. He was given the epithet \"the Great\" during and after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, and, alongside the [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Cnut the Great]], remains the only king of England to be given such a name.\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Further|House of Wessex family tree}}\n[[File:\u00c6thelwulf - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|Alfred's father [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] in the early fourteenth-century ''Genealogical Roll of the Kings of England'']]\nAlfred was born in the royal estate of [[Wantage]], historically in [[Berkshire]] but now in [[Oxfordshire]], between 847 and 849.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=45\u201346|2a1=Nelson|2y=2003|2p=295}}{{efn|According to Asser, Alfred was born in 849 but a regnal list thought to have been produced at his court states that he was 23 years old when he acceded and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that he acceeded after Easter in 871. These sources imply that he was born between Easter 847 and Easter 848.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=47\u201348}}}} He was the youngest of five sons of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] by his first wife, [[Osburh]]. In 853 Alfred is reported by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to have been sent to Rome where he was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by [[Pope Leo IV]], who \"anointed him as king\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 853}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"[[consul]]\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}} It may also be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]], around 854\u2013855.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}}\n\nOn their return from Rome in 856 \u00c6thelwulf was deposed by his son [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]]. With civil war looming the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. \u00c6thelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and \u00c6thelwulf would rule in the east. When King \u00c6thelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: \u00c6thelbald, [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].{{sfn|Crofton|2006|p=8}}\n\nBishop Asser tells the story of how, as a child, Alfred won a book of Saxon poems, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it.{{sfn|Asser|866|loc=paragraph 23}} Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing.

During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of ''secundarius'', which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic [[Tanistry|tanist]], a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should \u00c6thelred fall in battle. It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples - such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related - to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander. {{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n===Viking invasion===\nIn 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside \u00c6thelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 868}} The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870 and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] on 22 January.

This was in accordance with the agreement that \u00c6thelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg. The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King \u00c6thelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=135}}\n\nWhile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. Alfred was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}}\n\nThe Viking army withdrew from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]].

By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101|loc= [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} In 825 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the peoples of Essex, Sussex, Kent and Surrey had surrendered to [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], Alfred's grandfather. From then until the arrival of the [[Great Heathen Army]] Essex had formed part of Wessex.

Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river.

Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful.

They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]] and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation.

They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]] and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore.

The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nThe force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and forced to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines failed. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle.

Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM ('Alfred King of the Saxons').]]\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or [[fyrd]], and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59\u201360}} According to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694,\n\n{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service|source={{harvnb|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}} }}\n\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nIn contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller-scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThese bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThe means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}\n\nWith these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}\n\n===Administration and taxation===\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair.

The ''hide'' was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A ''hide'' is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The ''hide'' would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many ''hides'' he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}\n\n===Burghal system===\n{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]\n[[File:winchesterwalls.jpg|thumb|right|The walled defence round a burh. Alfred's capital, Winchester. Saxon and medieval work on Roman foundations.]]\n\nAt the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was a network of ''[[burh]]s'', distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three burhs, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}\n\nAlfred's burhs (of which twenty two developed into [[borough]]s.{{efn|The Alfredian ''burh'' represented a stage in the evolution of English medieval towns and boroughs. Of the twenty two burhs that became boroughs three did not attain full town status.{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}{{sfn|Loyn|1991|p=138}}}}{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}) ranged from former [[Roman Britain|Roman towns]], such as [[Winchester]], where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at [[Burpham]] in West Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}</ref>\n\nA contemporary document now known as the ''[[Burghal Hidage]]'' provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the ''hidage'' for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}} Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\n\nThe burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ''[[herepath]]s''). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the [[Lympne]] estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".<ref>Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}</ref>{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}\n\n===English navy===\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or [[Frisians|Frisian]] ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}}\n\nThe warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}\n\n==Legal reform==\n{{Main|Doom book}}\n\n[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of Alfred.]]\nIn the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]] consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=62\u201393}} Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"[[synod]]-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".<ref>\"Alfred\" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine [[capitulary]] of 786 that was presented to Offa by two [[papal legates]].{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280\u201381}}\n\nAbout a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the Apostolic Letter from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}\n\nSimilarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] and Alfred's code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".<ref name=keynes>\"Alfred\" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord, \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\".<ref name=keynes/> Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites \"Alfred's Pastoral Care\" ch. 28</ref>\n\nWhen one turns from the ''domboc''<nowiki />'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.<ref>\"Alfred\" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".<ref>Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}</ref> A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.<ref>The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544\u2013546}}.</ref>\n\nAsser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.<ref>Asser, chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=109\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England,{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}} whereas Asser's ''The Life of King Alfred'' promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}}\n\n==Foreign relations==\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{efn|Some versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' reported that Alfred sent a delegation to India, although this could just mean western Asia, as other versions say \"[[Iudea]]\".{{harv|Abels|1998|pp=190\u201392}}}} Around 890, [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] undertook a journey from [[Hedeby]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.{{sfn|Orosius|Hampson|1855|p=16}}\n\nAlfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign, the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of three pilgrim \"[[Scoti|Scots]]\" (i.e. [[Early medieval Ireland|Irish]]) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]] may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Religion and culture==\n[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow-Alfred.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great pictured in a stained glass window in the West Window of the South Transept of [[Bristol Cathedral]].]]\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.{{sfn|Keynes|1999|loc=\"King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey\"}}\n\nThis revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\";{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to [[Adam]], thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.{{sfn|Gransden|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nVery little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAlfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nHe was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}{{sfn|Fleming|1985}}\n\n===Effect of Danish raids on education===\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265\u201368}}\n\nManuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. A solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote, or who knew little or no Latin. \"It is clear\", Brooks concludes, \"that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship\".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172\u201373}}\n\n===Establishment of a court school===\nFollowing the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\".<ref>Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90\u201391. Cf. ''Codicology of the court school of Charlemagne: Gospel book production, illumination, and emphasised script (European university studies. Series 28, History of art)''</ref> He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. [[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Advocacy of education in English===\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\".<ref>Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}</ref> Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nThere were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.{{sfn|Bately|2014|pp=113-142}}\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'' ('Blooms') or ''Anthology''. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''\u00e6stels''\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''\u00e6stel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n==Appearance and character==\n[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]\n[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser#The Life of King Alfred|Life of King Alfred]]'',\n\n{{quote|Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother\u2014indeed, by everybody\u2014with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ... [He] was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers, and more pleasing in manner, speech and behaviour ... [and] in spite of all the demands of the present life, it has been the desire for wisdom, more than anything else, together with the nobility of his birth, which have characterized the nature of his noble mind.|source={{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=74\u201375}} }}\n\nIt is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as \"shameful negligence\" of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these \"he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}} An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlthough he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred \"could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Queen Ealhswith.png|thumb|A posthumous image of Ealhswith, 1220.]]\nIn 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of a Mercian nobleman, [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]]. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=77, 240\u201341}}\n\nThey had five or six children together including: [[Edward the Elder]] who succeeded his father as king; [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] who became lady of the Mercians; and [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]], daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler#Ancient through medieval eras|Butler]] of England. [[Asser]], in his ''Vita \u00c6lfredi'' asserts that this shows his lineage from the [[Jutes]] of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as [[Bede]] tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under [[C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex|C\u00e6dwalla]].{{sfn|Bristol University|2010}}\n\n[[Osferth]] was described as a relative in King Alfred's will and he attested charters in a high position until 934. A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother \u2013 mistakenly according to Keynes and Lapidge, and in the view of [[Janet Nelson]] he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=322, n. 79}}{{sfn|Nelson|1999|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n{| class = wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Name!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Birth!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Death!! style=\"width:64%;\"|Notes\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]]||||12 June 918||Married c. 886, [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]] d. 911; had issue\n|-\n|[[Edward the Elder|Edward]]||c. 874||17 July 924||Married (1) [[Ecgwynn]], (2) [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], (3) 919 [[Eadgifu of Kent|Eadgifu]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]]||||||Abbess of [[Shaftesbury Abbey|Shaftesbury]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]]||||16 October 922(?)|| Married and had issue\n|-\n|[[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]]||||929||Married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II]] d. 918; had issue\n|}\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Alfred the Great's will.jpg|thumb|upright|Alfred's will]]\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 at the age of 50 or 51.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=308}} How he died is unknown, although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness. His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either [[Crohn's disease]] or [[haemorrhoids]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}}{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=58}} His grandson King [[Eadred]] seems to have suffered from a similar illness.{{sfn|Malmesbury|1904|p=145}}{{efn|According to St Dunstan's apprentice, \"poor King Eadred would suck the juice out of the food, chew what remained for a little while and spit it out: a nasty practice that often turned the stomachs of the thegns who dined with him.\"{{sfn|Dunstan|1992|p=248}}}}\n\nAlfred was buried temporarily in the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] in [[Winchester]]. Four years after his death, he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). The New Minster moved to Hyde in 1110 a little north of the city, and the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] and the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}\n\nThe royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}} Further excavations were inconclusive in 1866 and 1897.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred. These came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}}\n\nExcavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1886 excavation.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}} The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones, suggested at the time to be those of Alfred; they proved instead to belong to an elderly woman.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013}} In March 2013, the Diocese of Winchester exhumed the bones from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's and placed them in secure storage. The diocese made no claim that they were the bones of Alfred, but intended to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of [[King Richard III]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2013}}{{sfn|Cohen|2013}} The bones were radiocarbon-dated but the results showed that they were from the 1300s and therefore not of Alfred. In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis that had been unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, and had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], but this remains unproven.{{sfn|BBC|2014}}{{sfn|Keys|2014}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see also|Cultural depictions of Alfred the Great}}\n[[File:Statue of King Alfred in Wantage Market Square.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Alfred the Great at [[Wantage]], Oxfordshire]]\n\nAlfred is venerated as a saint by some Christian traditions.<ref name=\"cathsaints\">{{cite web|title=Saint Alfred the Great|url=https://catholicsaints.info/saint-alfred-the-great/|website=CatholicSaints.info|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref> Though [[Henry VI of England]] attempted unsuccessfully to have him canonized by [[Pope Eugene IV]] in 1441, he was venerated sometimes in the Catholic Church; however the current \"[[Roman Martyrology]]\" does not mention him.<ref>http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/92430</ref>{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=231}}{{efn|Some Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that Alfred should be recognised as a saint.

Later medieval historians such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation, Alfred was seen as a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as \"the Great\", not any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}\n\nA number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour:\n* The [[University of Winchester]] created from the former King Alfred's College, Winchester (1928 to 2004)\n* [[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]; the local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of Alfred's ascension to the throne\n* The [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]]\n[[File:Alfred the Great - Samuel Woodforde.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century portrait of Alfred by [[Samuel Woodforde]]]]\n* [[King Alfred's Academy]], a secondary school in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], the birthplace of Alfred\n* King's Lodge School in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]], so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school\n* The King Alfred School and Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge, so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney\n* The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK\n* King Alfred's house in [[Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield]]\n\nThe Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']], and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']] in his honour.

He was the youngest son of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]]. His father died when he was young and three of Alfred's brothers, [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]], [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], reigned in turn before him.\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Alfred spent several years fighting [[Viking]] invasions. He won a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878 and made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as the [[Danelaw]] in the North of England. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of Viking leader [[Guthrum]] to Christianity. He defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, becoming the dominant ruler in England.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328 }} Details of his life are described in a work by 9th-century Welsh scholar and bishop [[Asser]].\n\nAlfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin and improving the legal system and military structure and his people's quality of life. He was given the epithet \"the Great\" during and after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, and, alongside the [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Cnut the Great]], remains the only king of England to be given such a name.\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Further|House of Wessex family tree}}\n[[File:\u00c6thelwulf - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|Alfred's father [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] in the early fourteenth-century ''Genealogical Roll of the Kings of England'']]\nAlfred was born in the royal estate of [[Wantage]], historically in [[Berkshire]] but now in [[Oxfordshire]], between 847 and 849.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=45\u201346|2a1=Nelson|2y=2003|2p=295}}{{efn|According to Asser, Alfred was born in 849 but a regnal list thought to have been produced at his court states that he was 23 years old when he acceded and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that he acceeded after Easter in 871. These sources imply that he was born between Easter 847 and Easter 848.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=47\u201348}}}} He was the youngest of five sons of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] by his first wife, [[Osburh]]. In 853 Alfred is reported by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to have been sent to Rome where he was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by [[Pope Leo IV]], who \"anointed him as king\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 853}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"[[consul]]\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}} It may also be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]], around 854\u2013855.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}}\n\nOn their return from Rome in 856 \u00c6thelwulf was deposed by his son [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]]. With civil war looming the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. \u00c6thelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and \u00c6thelwulf would rule in the east. When King \u00c6thelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: \u00c6thelbald, [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].{{sfn|Crofton|2006|p=8}}\n\nBishop Asser tells the story of how, as a child, Alfred won a book of Saxon poems, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it.{{sfn|Asser|866|loc=paragraph 23}} Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from [[Crohn's disease]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}} Statues of Alfred in [[Winchester]] and [[Wantage]] portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong and, though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.{{sfn|Cornwell|2009|loc=\"Historical Note\" (p. 385 and following)}}\n\n==Alfred's brothers==\n[[File:England Great Army map.svg|thumb|A map of the route taken by the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] which arrived in England from Denmark, Norway, and southern Sweden in 865.]]\n\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the [[Great Heathen Army]] of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=16\u201317}} Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old \u00c6thelred. During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of ''secundarius'', which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic [[Tanistry|tanist]], a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should \u00c6thelred fall in battle. It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples - such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related - to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander. {{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n===Viking invasion===\nIn 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside \u00c6thelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 868}} The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870 and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]]).{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} \u00c6thelred died shortly afterwards in April.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n==King at war==\n\n===Early struggles===\nIn April 871 King \u00c6thelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though \u00c6thelred left two under-age sons, [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]]. This was in accordance with the agreement that \u00c6thelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg. The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King \u00c6thelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=135}}\n\nWhile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. Alfred was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}}\n\nThe Viking army withdrew from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]]. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.{{sfn|Brooks|Graham-Campbell|1986|pp=91\u2013110}}\n\nIn 876 under their new leader, [[Guthrum]], the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]]. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} He negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a \"holy ring\" associated with the worship of [[Thor]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 876}}{{sfn|Arnold|2011|p=59}} The Danes broke their word and after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] in [[Devon]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 877}}\n\nAlfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878 the Danes made a sudden attack on [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas \"and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at [[Athelney]] in the marshes of [[Somerset]], and from that fort kept fighting against the foe\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} From his fort at [[Athelney]], an island in the marshes near [[North Petherton]], Alfred was able to mount a resistance campaign, rallying the local [[militia]]s from [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n===The cake legend===\nA legend tells how when Alfred first fled to the [[Somerset Levels]], he was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some wheaten cakes she had left cooking on the fire.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=101}}{{sfn|Horspool|2006|p=2}} Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return. 878 was the nadir of the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was still resisting.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=101}} There is no contemporary evidence for the legend, although it is possible that there was an early oral tradition. The first time that it was actually written down was about one hundred years after Alfred's death.{{sfn|Horspool|2006|p=2}}\n\n===Counter-attack and victory===\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on the supposed site of Egbert's Stone, the mustering place before the [[Battle of Edington]].{{efn|The inscription reads \"ALFRED THE GREAT AD 879 on this Summit Erected his Standard Against Danish Invaders To him We owe The Origin of Juries The Establishment of a Militia The Creation of a Naval Force ALFRED The Light of a Benighted Age Was a Philosopher and a Christian The Father of his People The Founder of the English MONARCHY and LIBERTY\".{{harv|Horspool|2006|pages=73}} }} ]]\n\nIn the seventh week after Easter (4\u201310 May 878), around [[Whitsuntide]], Alfred rode to [[Egbert's Stone]] east of [[Selwood, Somerset|Selwood]] where he was met by \"all the people of Somerset and of [[Wiltshire]] and of that part of [[Hampshire]] which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of [[Southampton Water]]), and they rejoiced to see him\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the [[fyrd]]s of three [[shire]]s. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of [[ealdormen]], royal [[High-reeve|reeves]] and king's [[thegn]]s, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pages=187\u201391}}\n\nAlfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing [[Battle of Edington]] which may have been fought near [[Westbury, Wiltshire]]. He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]]. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\nAccording to Asser,\n\n{{quote|The unbinding of the [[chrisom]] {{efn| A chrisom was the face-cloth or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he or she was [[Baptism|baptised]] or christened.

Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=Ch. 60}} The formal [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], preserved in [[Old English]] in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (Manuscript 383), and in a [[Latin]] compilation known as ''[[Quadripartitus]]'', was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia]] was deposed.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=163}}\n\nThat treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101|loc= [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} In 825 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the peoples of Essex, Sussex, Kent and Surrey had surrendered to [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], Alfred's grandfather. From then until the arrival of the [[Great Heathen Army]] Essex had formed part of Wessex. After the foundation of Danelaw, it seems that some of Essex would have been ceded to the Danes, but how much is not clear.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|pp=303\u2013304}}\n\nIn 2015, two metal detectorists operating without landowner permission found a large hoard near [[Leominster]] consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE. The hoard is believed to have been buried by a Viking during their raids of the area, while Wessex was ruled by Alfred and Mercia by Ceolwulf II. Coins recovered from the treasure hunters depict both kings, \"indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms\u2014at least, for a time\u2014that was previously unknown to historians\".<ref name=\"newsweek.com\" /> According to Gareth Williams of the [[British Museum]], \"these coins enable us to re-interpret our history at a key moment in the creation of England as a single kingdom.\"<ref name=\"bbc.com\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that the find \"rewrites Anglo-Saxon history&nbsp;...

A year later, in 881, Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships \"on the high seas\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred's forces.{{sfn|Alfred|1969|p=76}} Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period, as they had for decades.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|pp=20-21}}\n\nIn 883\u2014though there is some debate over the year\u2014King Alfred, because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome, received a number of gifts from [[Pope Marinus I|Pope Marinus]].{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=78}} Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the [[true cross]], a great treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus's friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=88}}\n\nAfter the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=86}}\n\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|A plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred.]]\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=24}} Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=23}}\n\nThis is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=106}} This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact, he would never adopt the title for himself. Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, [[\u00c6thelswith]], en route to Rome in 888.{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=114}} In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], \u00c6thelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]].{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=89}} Guthrum's death changed the political landscape for Alfred. The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power-hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of King Alfred The Great and the Danes|url=http://www.localhistories.org/alfred.html|publisher=Local Histories|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Viking attacks (890s)===\n\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\nAfter another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]] and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}}\n\nWhile he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]] and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege of Exeter (893)|Siege of Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nThe force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and forced to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines failed. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England returned to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Military reorganisation==\n[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871\u2013899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM ('Alfred King of the Saxons').]]\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or [[fyrd]], and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59\u201360}} According to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694,\n\n{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service|source={{harvnb|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}} }}\n\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nIn contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller-scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThese bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThe means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}\n\nWith these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}\n\n===Administration and taxation===\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda necessitas'' or ''trimoda necessitas''.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}} The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was {{lang|ang|fierdwite}}.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nTo maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The ''hide'' was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A ''hide'' is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The ''hide'' would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many ''hides'' he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}\n\n===Burghal system===\n{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]\n[[File:winchesterwalls.jpg|thumb|right|The walled defence round a burh. Alfred's capital, Winchester. Saxon and medieval work on Roman foundations.]]\n\nAt the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was a network of ''[[burh]]s'', distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three burhs, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}\n\nAlfred's burhs (of which twenty two developed into [[borough]]s.{{efn|The Alfredian ''burh'' represented a stage in the evolution of English medieval towns and boroughs. Of the twenty two burhs that became boroughs three did not attain full town status.{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}{{sfn|Loyn|1991|p=138}}}}{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}) ranged from former [[Roman Britain|Roman towns]], such as [[Winchester]], where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at [[Burpham]] in West Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}</ref>\n\nA contemporary document now known as the ''[[Burghal Hidage]]'' provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the ''hidage'' for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}} Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\n\nThe burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ''[[herepath]]s''). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the [[Lympne]] estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".<ref>Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}</ref>{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}\n\n===English navy===\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or [[Frisians|Frisian]] ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}}\n\nThe warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}\n\n==Legal reform==\n{{Main|Doom book}}\n\n[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of Alfred.]]\nIn the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]] consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=62\u201393}} Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"[[synod]]-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".<ref>\"Alfred\" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine [[capitulary]] of 786 that was presented to Offa by two [[papal legates]].{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280\u201381}}\n\nAbout a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the Apostolic Letter from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}\n\nSimilarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] and Alfred's code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".<ref name=keynes>\"Alfred\" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord, \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\".<ref name=keynes/> Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites \"Alfred's Pastoral Care\" ch. 28</ref>\n\nWhen one turns from the ''domboc''<nowiki />'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.<ref>\"Alfred\" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".<ref>Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}</ref> A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.<ref>The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544\u2013546}}.</ref>\n\nAsser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.<ref>Asser, chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=109\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England,{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}} whereas Asser's ''The Life of King Alfred'' promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}}\n\n==Foreign relations==\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{efn|Some versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' reported that Alfred sent a delegation to India, although this could just mean western Asia, as other versions say \"[[Iudea]]\".{{harv|Abels|1998|pp=190\u201392}}}} Around 890, [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] undertook a journey from [[Hedeby]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.{{sfn|Orosius|Hampson|1855|p=16}}\n\nAlfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign, the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of three pilgrim \"[[Scoti|Scots]]\" (i.e. [[Early medieval Ireland|Irish]]) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]] may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Religion and culture==\n[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow-Alfred.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great pictured in a stained glass window in the West Window of the South Transept of [[Bristol Cathedral]].]]\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.{{sfn|Keynes|1999|loc=\"King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey\"}}\n\nThis revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\";{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to [[Adam]], thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.{{sfn|Gransden|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nVery little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAlfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nHe was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}{{sfn|Fleming|1985}}\n\n===Effect of Danish raids on education===\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265\u201368}}\n\nManuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. A solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote, or who knew little or no Latin. \"It is clear\", Brooks concludes, \"that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship\".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172\u201373}}\n\n===Establishment of a court school===\nFollowing the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\".<ref>Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90\u201391. Cf. ''Codicology of the court school of Charlemagne: Gospel book production, illumination, and emphasised script (European university studies. Series 28, History of art)''</ref> He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. [[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Advocacy of education in English===\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\".<ref>Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}</ref> Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nThere were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.{{sfn|Bately|2014|pp=113-142}}\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'' ('Blooms') or ''Anthology''. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''\u00e6stels''\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''\u00e6stel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n==Appearance and character==\n[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]\n[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser#The Life of King Alfred|Life of King Alfred]]'',\n\n{{quote|Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother\u2014indeed, by everybody\u2014with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ... [He] was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers, and more pleasing in manner, speech and behaviour ... [and] in spite of all the demands of the present life, it has been the desire for wisdom, more than anything else, together with the nobility of his birth, which have characterized the nature of his noble mind.|source={{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=74\u201375}} }}\n\nIt is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as \"shameful negligence\" of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these \"he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}} An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlthough he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred \"could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Queen Ealhswith.png|thumb|A posthumous image of Ealhswith, 1220.]]\nIn 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of a Mercian nobleman, [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]]. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=77, 240\u201341}}\n\nThey had five or six children together including: [[Edward the Elder]] who succeeded his father as king; [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] who became lady of the Mercians; and [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]], daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler#Ancient through medieval eras|Butler]] of England. [[Asser]], in his ''Vita \u00c6lfredi'' asserts that this shows his lineage from the [[Jutes]] of the Isle of Wight.

A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother \u2013 mistakenly according to Keynes and Lapidge, and in the view of [[Janet Nelson]] he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=322, n. 79}}{{sfn|Nelson|1999|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n{| class = wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Name!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Birth!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Death!! style=\"width:64%;\"|Notes\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]]||||12 June 918||Married c. 886, [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]] d. 911; had issue\n|-\n|[[Edward the Elder|Edward]]||c. 874||17 July 924||Married (1) [[Ecgwynn]], (2) [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], (3) 919 [[Eadgifu of Kent|Eadgifu]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]]||||||Abbess of [[Shaftesbury Abbey|Shaftesbury]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]]||||16 October 922(?)|| Married and had issue\n|-\n|[[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]]||||929||Married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II]] d. 918; had issue\n|}\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Alfred the Great's will.jpg|thumb|upright|Alfred's will]]\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 at the age of 50 or 51.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=308}} How he died is unknown, although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness.

Four years after his death, he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). The New Minster moved to Hyde in 1110 a little north of the city, and the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] and the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}\n\nThe royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}} Further excavations were inconclusive in 1866 and 1897.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred.

Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as \"the Great\", not any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}\n\nA number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour:\n* The [[University of Winchester]] created from the former King Alfred's College, Winchester (1928 to 2004)\n* [[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]; the local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of Alfred's ascension to the throne\n* The [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]]\n[[File:Alfred the Great - Samuel Woodforde.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century portrait of Alfred by [[Samuel Woodforde]]]]\n* [[King Alfred's Academy]], a secondary school in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], the birthplace of Alfred\n* King's Lodge School in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]], so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school\n* The King Alfred School and Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge, so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney\n* The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK\n* King Alfred's house in [[Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield]]\n\nThe Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']], and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']] in his honour.
