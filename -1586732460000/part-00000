They are already on the infobox.--> is the [[head of state]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|country's constitution]], the presidency is a largely [[Figurehead|ceremonial office]] with limited power. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party of China]], the [[Paramount leader|top leader]] in the [[One-party state|one party system]]. The presidency is officially regarded as [[Government of the People's Republic of China|an institution of the state]] rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the [[National People's Congress]], the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative.{{NoteTag|It is listed as such in the current Constitution; it is thus equivalent to organs such as the State Council, rather than to offices such as that of the Premier.}} The current president is [[Xi Jinping]], who took office in March 2013.\n\nSince 1993, apart from brief periods of transition, the top leader of China simultaneously serves as the president, the [[Leader of the Communist Party of China|leader of the party]] (as [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary]]), and the [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|commander-in-chief]] of the military (as the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]]). This individual then carries out different duties under separate titles. For example, the leader meets foreign dignitaries and receives ambassadors in his capacity as President, issues military directives as Chairman of [[Central Military Commission (China)|the Central Military Commission]], and upholds party rule as the general secretary of [[Communist Party of China|the Communist Party of China]].\n\nThe presidency was first established in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] in 1954 and successively held by [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Liu Shaoqi]]. Liu fell into political disgrace during the [[Cultural Revolution]], after which the presidency became vacant. The presidency was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers. The official English-language [[translation]] of the title was \"[[Chairman]]\"; after 1982, this translation was changed to \"[[President (government title)|President]]\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.{{NoteTag|In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] the President of the PRC is termed ''zh\u01d4x\u00ed'' while the Presidents of other countries are termed ''z\u01d2ngt\u01d2ng''. Furthermore ''zh\u01d4x\u00ed'' continues to have the meaning of \"chairman\" in a generic context.}}\n\nBetween 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. During the Mao era and also since 2018, there were no term limits attached to this office.\n\n== Qualifications and election ==\nAccording to the current [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], the president must be a Chinese citizen with full electoral rights who has reached the age of 45.\n\nThe president is elected by the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), China's highest state body, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by a simple majority vote.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812224210/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html |date=12 August 2010 }}, Articles 62, 63.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the NPC, the president is nominated by the NPC [[Presidium of the National People's Congress|Presidium]], the Congress's executive organ.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Organic Law of the National People's Congress of the PRC |accessdate = 2013-07-03 |url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207281.htm |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6a1t4WswJ?url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207281.htm |archive-date = 15 July 2015 |url-status = live }}, Article 13.</ref> In practice, however, the ruling [[Communist Party of China]] reserves the post of president for its current [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]].

In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the [[National People's Congress]]. The president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic. Under the constitution the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the National People's Congress. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state.  It is therefore conceived to mainly function as an symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-term-limit-explainer.html|title=Ending Term Limits for China\u2019s Xi Is a Big Deal.

Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] had a personal [[Ilyushin Il-18]] which he used on his visits. After he died, the aircraft was withdrawn from service and preserved at an aviation museum in China. In the 1970s, the position of Chinese president was abolished, but [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Hua Guofeng]] were [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] successively. With the introduction of the Boeing 747, officials started using the CAAC [[Boeing 747SP]] for international trips. After the CAAC was split up into six in 1988, the 747s were handed over to Air China, and officials continued using 747SPs under the CA livery. \n\nWhen [[Jiang Zemin]] came into power in 1989, the 747SPs were permanently returned to passenger service, and 747-400s were utilized. They were used throughout the use of Zemin, [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Xi Jinping]]. The 747-400s originally belong to Air China, but one month before the president goes on an official trip, the chosen plane is specifically inspected and retrofitted for VIP use. After the president returns to Beijing, the 747-400 is inspected and converted back to passenger configurations. \n\nIn the 2010s a [[Boeing 747-8]] painted in the CA livery was seen around the world, under the fake rego B-2479 and the real rego B-2485. Rumours spread, saying this would be China's new Air Force One. In 2016 it was seen landing in Hamburg for VIP configuration, and since then, it has been on loan to the Chinese Government from Air China for use by the president. Although no official photos have been released, the inside is thought to have a far more lavish interior, including conference tables, seating for the press, private bedrooms, and other features. \n\nAfter the 747-8 was introduced, the 747-400s now carry ministers and serve as decoy aircraft. On some occasions, an Air China Boeing 737 has even been used for transport. In the late 2010s, the president started importing his own presidential car on foreign trips. For this reason, an Air China Boeing 747 cargo aircraft is used for transportation of freight. \n\nIn order not to confuse air traffic control between a normal CA flight and a flight carrying a Chinese government member, all aircraft carrying government people fly under the callsign CA1 to CA100, since normal CA flights fly under the callsign CA101 and above.\n\n== Political ranking ==\n{{Main|Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nFor President [[Liu Shaoqi]], he was also the first [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|vice chairman of the Communist Party of China]], ranked second in the [[Communist Party of China]], behind Chairman [[Mao Zedong]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mathews|first1=Jay|title=5 Children of Liu Shaoqi Detail Years in Disfavor|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/5-children-of-liu-shaoqi-detail-years-in-disfavor/024ff499-48af-4c41-b47c-fd7e0031bf75/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Washington Post|date=4 March 1980|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429154152/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/5-children-of-liu-shaoqi-detail-years-in-disfavor/024ff499-48af-4c41-b47c-fd7e0031bf75/|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For President [[Li Xiannian]], he was also the 5th ranked member of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]], after CPC general secretary and premier.<ref>{{cite news|title=Li Xiannian: China's new president|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/18/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNLi-Xiannian-Chinas-new-president/5105424756800/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=[[United Press International|UPI]]|date=18 June 1983|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205229/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/18/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNLi-Xiannian-Chinas-new-president/5105424756800/|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For President [[Yang Shangkun]], he was not a member of Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Del Vecchio|first1=Mark S.|title=Yang Shangkun elected Chinese president|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/08/Yang-Shangkun-elected-Chinese-president/9536576475200/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=UPI|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205223/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/08/Yang-Shangkun-elected-Chinese-president/9536576475200/|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Since [[Jiang Zemin]], the president is also the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party of China]], ranking first in party and state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jiang Zemin to have lower rank in Communist party|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9823478/Jiang-Zemin-to-have-lower-rank-in-Communist-party.html|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312234448/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9823478/Jiang-Zemin-to-have-lower-rank-in-Communist-party.html|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Establishment in 1954 ===\nThe office of State Chairman (the original English translation, as noted above) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.

It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n=== History up to 1974 ===\n[[Mao Zedong]] was the first to hold the office of State Chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1955. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]], first [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|vice chairman of the Communist Party]]. Liu was reelected as State Chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of State Chairman.  This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nAfter Liu's removal in 1968, the office of State Chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman [[Dong Biwu]] as \"acting state chairman.\"{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Abolition in 1975 ===\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of State Chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the party chairman [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|Supreme Commander]] of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] in concurrence as Chairman of the party CMC.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| issn = 0305-7410\n| issue = 76\n| pages = 794\u2013841\n| last = Cohen\n| first = Jerome Alan\n| title = China's Changing Constitution\n| journal = The China Quarterly\n| date = 1978-12-01\n| jstor = 652647\n}}</ref> The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of State Chairman. The office was finally reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982.  The title of the office (\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d, guojia zhuxi) was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" was adopted.\n\n=== Restoration in 1982 ===\nIn the 1982 Constitution, the president was conceived of as a [[figurehead]] of state with actual state power resting in the hands of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party]], [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier of the State Council]] and the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and all four posts were designed to be held by separate people. The president therefore held minor responsibilities such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. In the original 1982 Constitution plan, the party would develop policy, the state would execute it, and the power would be divided to prevent a [[cult of personality]] from forming as it did with the case of Mao Zedong. Thus in 1982, China perceivably had four main leaders: Hu Yaobang, the party general secretary; Zhao Ziyang, the premier; Li Xiannian, the president; and Deng Xiaoping, the \"paramount leader\", holding title of the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] and was overall [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. The current [[Politics of Vietnam|political structure of Vietnam]] is similar to the structure China followed in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], was terminated.

They are already on the infobox.--> is the [[head of state]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|country's constitution]], the presidency is a largely [[Figurehead|ceremonial office]] with limited power. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party of China]], the [[Paramount leader|top leader]] in the [[One-party state|one party system]]. The presidency is officially regarded as [[Government of the People's Republic of China|an institution of the state]] rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the [[National People's Congress]], the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative.{{NoteTag|It is listed as such in the current Constitution; it is thus equivalent to organs such as the State Council, rather than to offices such as that of the Premier.}} The current president is [[Xi Jinping]], who took office in March 2013.\n\nSince 1993, apart from brief periods of transition, the top leader of China simultaneously serves as the president, the [[Leader of the Communist Party of China|leader of the party]] (as [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary]]), and the [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|commander-in-chief]] of the military (as the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]]). This individual then carries out different duties under separate titles. For example, the leader meets foreign dignitaries and receives ambassadors in his capacity as President, issues military directives as Chairman of [[Central Military Commission (China)|the Central Military Commission]], and upholds party rule as the general secretary of [[Communist Party of China|the Communist Party of China]].\n\nThe presidency was first established in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] in 1954 and successively held by [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Liu Shaoqi]]. Liu fell into political disgrace during the [[Cultural Revolution]], after which the presidency became vacant. The presidency was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers.

In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the [[National People's Congress]]. The president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic. Under the constitution the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the National People's Congress. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state.  It is therefore conceived to mainly function as an symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-term-limit-explainer.html|title=Ending Term Limits for China\u2019s Xi Is a Big Deal.

Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] had a personal [[Ilyushin Il-18]] which he used on his visits. After he died, the aircraft was withdrawn from service and preserved at an aviation museum in China. In the 1970s, the position of Chinese president was abolished, but [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Hua Guofeng]] were [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] successively. With the introduction of the Boeing 747, officials started using the CAAC [[Boeing 747SP]] for international trips. After the CAAC was split up into six in 1988, the 747s were handed over to Air China, and officials continued using 747SPs under the CA livery. \n\nWhen [[Jiang Zemin]] came into power in 1989, the 747SPs were permanently returned to passenger service, and 747-400s were utilized. They were used throughout the use of Zemin, [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Xi Jinping]]. The 747-400s originally belong to Air China, but one month before the president goes on an official trip, the chosen plane is specifically inspected and retrofitted for VIP use. After the president returns to Beijing, the 747-400 is inspected and converted back to passenger configurations. \n\nIn the 2010s a [[Boeing 747-8]] painted in the CA livery was seen around the world, under the fake rego B-2479 and the real rego B-2485. Rumours spread, saying this would be China's new Air Force One. In 2016 it was seen landing in Hamburg for VIP configuration, and since then, it has been on loan to the Chinese Government from Air China for use by the president. Although no official photos have been released, the inside is thought to have a far more lavish interior, including conference tables, seating for the press, private bedrooms, and other features. \n\nAfter the 747-8 was introduced, the 747-400s now carry ministers and serve as decoy aircraft. On some occasions, an Air China Boeing 737 has even been used for transport. In the late 2010s, the president started importing his own presidential car on foreign trips. For this reason, an Air China Boeing 747 cargo aircraft is used for transportation of freight. \n\nIn order not to confuse air traffic control between a normal CA flight and a flight carrying a Chinese government member, all aircraft carrying government people fly under the callsign CA1 to CA100, since normal CA flights fly under the callsign CA101 and above.\n\n== Political ranking ==\n{{Main|Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nFor President [[Liu Shaoqi]], he was also the first [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|vice chairman of the Communist Party of China]], ranked second in the [[Communist Party of China]], behind Chairman [[Mao Zedong]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mathews|first1=Jay|title=5 Children of Liu Shaoqi Detail Years in Disfavor|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/5-children-of-liu-shaoqi-detail-years-in-disfavor/024ff499-48af-4c41-b47c-fd7e0031bf75/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Washington Post|date=4 March 1980|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429154152/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/5-children-of-liu-shaoqi-detail-years-in-disfavor/024ff499-48af-4c41-b47c-fd7e0031bf75/|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For President [[Li Xiannian]], he was also the 5th ranked member of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]], after CPC general secretary and premier.<ref>{{cite news|title=Li Xiannian: China's new president|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/18/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNLi-Xiannian-Chinas-new-president/5105424756800/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=[[United Press International|UPI]]|date=18 June 1983|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205229/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/18/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNLi-Xiannian-Chinas-new-president/5105424756800/|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For President [[Yang Shangkun]], he was not a member of Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Del Vecchio|first1=Mark S.|title=Yang Shangkun elected Chinese president|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/08/Yang-Shangkun-elected-Chinese-president/9536576475200/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=UPI|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205223/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/08/Yang-Shangkun-elected-Chinese-president/9536576475200/|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Since [[Jiang Zemin]], the president is also the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party of China]], ranking first in party and state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jiang Zemin to have lower rank in Communist party|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9823478/Jiang-Zemin-to-have-lower-rank-in-Communist-party.html|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312234448/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9823478/Jiang-Zemin-to-have-lower-rank-in-Communist-party.html|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Establishment in 1954 ===\nThe office of State Chairman (the original English translation, as noted above) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.

It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n=== History up to 1974 ===\n[[Mao Zedong]] was the first to hold the office of State Chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1955. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]], first [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|vice chairman of the Communist Party]]. Liu was reelected as State Chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of State Chairman.  This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nAfter Liu's removal in 1968, the office of State Chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman [[Dong Biwu]] as \"acting state chairman.\"{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Abolition in 1975 ===\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of State Chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the party chairman [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|Supreme Commander]] of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] in concurrence as Chairman of the party CMC.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| issn = 0305-7410\n| issue = 76\n| pages = 794\u2013841\n| last = Cohen\n| first = Jerome Alan\n| title = China's Changing Constitution\n| journal = The China Quarterly\n| date = 1978-12-01\n| jstor = 652647\n}}</ref> The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of State Chairman. The office was finally reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982.  The title of the office (\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d, guojia zhuxi) was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" was adopted.\n\n=== Restoration in 1982 ===\nIn the 1982 Constitution, the president was conceived of as a [[figurehead]] of state with actual state power resting in the hands of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party]], [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier of the State Council]] and the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and all four posts were designed to be held by separate people. The president therefore held minor responsibilities such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. In the original 1982 Constitution plan, the party would develop policy, the state would execute it, and the power would be divided to prevent a [[cult of personality]] from forming as it did with the case of Mao Zedong. Thus in 1982, China perceivably had four main leaders: Hu Yaobang, the party general secretary; Zhao Ziyang, the premier; Li Xiannian, the president; and Deng Xiaoping, the \"paramount leader\", holding title of the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] and was overall [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. The current [[Politics of Vietnam|political structure of Vietnam]] is similar to the structure China followed in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], was terminated. In 1993, the post of President was taken by [[Jiang Zemin]], who as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], became the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/|title=A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513080847/https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/|archive-date=13 May 2018|access-date=12 May 2018|quote=[[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.
