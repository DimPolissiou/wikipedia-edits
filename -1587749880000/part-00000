{"title_page": "Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text_new": "{{short description|Amendment establishing the direct election of senators}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{US Constitution article series}}\n[[File:17th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb|The Seventeenth Amendment in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\nThe '''Seventeenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XVII''') to the [[United States Constitution]] established the popular election of [[United States Senate|United States senators]] by the people of the states. The amendment supersedes [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Senate|Article I, \u00a73]], Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, under which senators were elected by [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]]. It also alters the procedure for filling vacancies in the Senate, allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until a [[By-election|special election]] can be held.\n\nThe amendment was proposed by the [[62nd United States Congress|62nd Congress]] in 1912 and became part of the Constitution on April 8, 1913 on ratification by three-fourths (36) of the state legislatures. Sitting senators were not affected by the Amendment's provisions until their existing terms expired, so the Amendment took six years to fully implement. The transition began with two special elections in 1913\u2014the first in [[1913 United States Senate election in Georgia|Georgia]]<ref>{{cite web|title=BACON, Augustus Octavius (1839-1914)|url=https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=B000014|website=Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress|accessdate=February 24, 2020|quote=became the first U.S. Senator elected by popular vote following ratification of the 17th Amendment, on July 15, 1913}}</ref> and second in [[1913 United States Senate special election in Maryland|Maryland]]. The transition then began in earnest with the [[1914 United States Senate elections|November 1914 election]], and was complete on 4 March 1919 when the senators chosen at the [[1918 United States Senate elections|November 1918 election]] took office.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.\n\nWhen vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.\n\nThis amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#17|title=The Constitution of the United States Amendments 11\u201327|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>}}\n\n==Background==\n===Original composition===\n[[File:JusticeJamesWilson.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], the only member of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] who supported electing the [[United States Senate]] by popular vote]]\nOriginally, under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Senate|Article I, \u00a7 3]], Clauses 1 and 2 of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], each [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] elected its state's senators for a six-year term.<ref>Zywicki (1997) p.&nbsp;169</ref> Each state, regardless of size, is entitled to two senators as part of the [[Connecticut Compromise]] between the small and large states.<ref>Vile (2003) p.&nbsp;404</ref> This contrasted with the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], a body elected by popular vote, and was described as an uncontroversial decision; at the time, [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] was the sole advocate of popularly electing the Senate, but his proposal was defeated 10\u20131.<ref>Zywicki (1994) p.&nbsp;1013</ref> There were many advantages to the original method of electing senators. Prior to the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties, with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state. However, under the new Constitution, the federal government was granted substantially more power than before. Having the state legislatures elect the senators reassured [[Anti-Federalism|anti-federalists]] that there would be some protection against the federal government swallowing up of states and their powers,<ref>Riker (1955) p.&nbsp;452</ref> and providing a [[Separation of powers|check]] on the power of the federal government.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;516</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the longer terms and avoidance of popular election turned the Senate into a body that could counter the populism of the House. While the representatives operated in a two-year [[direct election]] cycle, making them frequently accountable to their constituents, the senators could afford to \"take a more detached view of issues coming before Congress\".<ref name=byb515>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;515</ref> State legislatures retained the theoretical right to \"instruct\" their senators to vote for or against proposals, thus giving the states both direct and indirect representation in the federal government.<ref>Zywicki (1994) p.&nbsp;1019</ref> The Senate was part of a formal bicameralism, with the members of the Senate and House responsible to completely distinct constituencies; this helped defeat the problem of the federal government being subject to \"special interests\".<ref>Zywicki (1997) p.&nbsp;176</ref> Members of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] considered the Senate to be parallel to the British [[House of Lords]] as an \"upper house\", containing the \"better men\" of society, but improved upon as they would be conscientiously chosen by the upper houses of state republican legislatures for fixed terms, and not merely inherited for life as in the British system, subject to a monarch's arbitrary expansion. It was hoped that they would provide abler deliberation and greater stability than the House of Representatives due to the senators' status.<ref>Zywicki (1997) p.&nbsp;180</ref>\n\n===Issues===\nAccording to Judge [[Jay Bybee]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], those in favor of popular elections for senators believed that two primary problems were caused by the original provisions: legislative corruption and electoral deadlocks.<ref name=Bybee538>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;538</ref> There was a sense that senatorial elections were \"bought and sold\", changing hands for favors and sums of money rather than because of the competence of the candidate. Between 1857 and 1900, the Senate investigated three elections over corruption. In 1900, for example, [[William A. Clark]] had his election voided after the Senate concluded that he had bought votes in the Montana legislature. But analysts Bybee and [[Todd Zywicki]] believe this concern was largely unfounded; there was a \"dearth of hard information\" on the subject.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;539</ref> In more than a century of legislative elections of U.S. senators, only ten cases were contested for allegations of impropriety.<ref name=zywicki1022>Zywicki (1994) p.&nbsp;1022</ref>\n\nElectoral deadlocks were another issue. Because state legislatures were charged with deciding whom to appoint as senators, the system relied on their ability to agree. Some states could not, and thus delayed sending representatives to Congress; in a few cases, the system broke down to the point where states completely lacked representation in the Senate.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;541</ref> Deadlocks started to become an issue in the 1850s, with a deadlocked [[Indiana]] legislature allowing a Senate seat to sit vacant for two years.<ref name=SenateWebsite>{{cite web|title=Direct Election of Senators|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Direct_Election_Senators.htm|website=United States Senate|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref> Between 1891 and 1905, 46 elections were deadlocked across 20 states;<ref name=zywicki1022/> in one extreme example, a Senate seat for Delaware went unfilled from 1899 until 1903.<ref name=bybee542>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;542</ref> The business of holding elections also caused great disruption in the state legislatures, with a full third of the [[19th Oregon Legislative Assembly|Oregon House of Representatives choosing not to swear the oath of office in 1897]] due to a dispute over an open Senate seat. The result was that [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Oregon's legislature]] was unable to pass legislation that year.<ref name=bybee542/>\n\nZywicki again argues that this was not a serious issue. Deadlocks were a problem, but they were the exception rather than the norm; many legislatures did not deadlock over elections at all. Most of those that did in the 19th century were the newly admitted western states, which suffered from \"inexperienced legislatures and weak party discipline...as western legislatures gained experience, deadlocks became less frequent.\" While Utah suffered from deadlocks in 1897 and 1899, they became what Zywicki refers to as \"a good teaching experience,\" and Utah never again failed to elect senators.<ref>Zywicki (1994) p.&nbsp;1024</ref> Another concern was that when deadlocks occurred, state legislatures were unable to conduct their other normal business; [[James Ure|James Christian Ure]], writing in the ''[[South Texas Law Review]]'', notes that this did not in fact occur. In a deadlock situation, state legislatures would deal with the matter by holding \"one vote at the beginning of the day\u2014then the legislators would continue with their normal affairs\".<ref>Ure (2007) p.&nbsp;286</ref>\n\nEventually, legislative elections held in a state's Senate election years were perceived to have become so dominated by the business of picking Senators that the state's choice for Senator distracted the electorate from all other pertinent issues.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;543</ref> Senator [[John H. Mitchell]] noted that the Senate became the \"vital issue\" in all legislative campaigns, with the policy stances and qualifications of state legislative candidates ignored by voters who were more interested in the indirect Senate election.<ref name=DSchleicher>{{cite magazine|last1=Schleicher|first1=David|title=States' Wrongs|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/02/conservatives_17th_amendment_repeal_effort_why_their_plan_will_backfire.single.html|accessdate=9 October 2014|magazine=Slate|date=27 February 2014}}</ref> To remedy this, some state legislatures created \"advisory elections\" that served as de facto general elections, allowing legislative campaigns to focus on local issues.<ref name=DSchleicher/>\n\n===Calls for reform===\n[[File:BRYAN, WILLIAM JENNINGS LCCN2016856655 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[William Jennings Bryan]], who campaigned for the popular election of U.S. senators]]\nCalls for a constitutional amendment regarding Senate elections started in the early 19th century, with [[Henry R.

Stockton]] to the Senate due to his approval by a plurality of the New Jersey Legislature rather than a majority. In reaction, the Congress passed a bill in July 1866 that required state legislatures to elect senators by an absolute majority.<ref name=Bybee536/>\n\nBy the 1890s, support for the introduction of direct election for the Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]] incorporated the direct election of senators into its [[Omaha Platform]], adopted in 1892.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Paul S.|last2=Dubofsky|first2=Melvyn|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-508209-8|oclc=185508759|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00paul_0/page/612 612]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00paul_0/page/612}}</ref> [[List of Oregon ballot measures#1908|In 1908]], [[Oregon]] passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote.

David Graham Philips, one of the \"yellow journalists\" whom President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]] called \"muckrakers\", described [[Nelson Aldrich]] of Rhode Island as the principal \"traitor\" among the \"scurvy lot\" in control of the Senate by theft, perjury, and bribes corrupting the state legislatures to gain election to the Senate. A few state legislatures began to petition the Congress for direct election of senators. By 1893, the House had the two-thirds vote for just such an amendment. However, when the joint resolution reached the Senate, it failed from neglect, as it did again in 1900, 1904 and 1908; each time the House approved the appropriate resolution, and each time it died in the Senate.<ref>MacNeil, Neil and Richard A. Baker, ''The American Senate: An Insider's History'' 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-19-536761-4}}. pp.&nbsp;22\u201323.</ref>\n\nOn the second national legislative front, reformers worked toward a constitutional amendment, which was strongly supported in the House of Representatives but initially opposed by the Senate. Bybee notes that the state legislatures, which would lose power if the reforms went through, were supportive of the campaign. By 1910, 31 state legislatures had passed resolutions calling for a constitutional amendment allowing direct election, and in the same year ten [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] senators who were opposed to reform were forced out of their seats, acting as a \"wake-up call to the Senate\".<ref name=\"Bybee 1997 p.&nbsp;537\"/>\n\nReformers included [[William Jennings Bryan]], while opponents counted respected figures such as [[Elihu Root]] and [[George Frisbie Hoar]] among their number; Root cared so strongly about the issue that after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, he refused to stand for re\u2011election to the Senate.<ref name=Bybee538/> Bryan and the reformers argued for popular election through highlighting perceived flaws with the existing system, specifically corruption and electoral deadlocks, and through arousing populist sentiment. Most important was the populist argument; that there was a need to \"Awaken, in the senators...a more acute sense of responsibility to the people\", which it was felt they lacked; election through state legislatures was seen as an anachronism that was out of step with the wishes of the American people, and one that had led to the Senate becoming \"a sort of aristocratic body \u2013 too far removed from the people, beyond their reach, and with no special interest in their welfare\".<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;544</ref> The settlement of the West and continuing absorption of hundreds of thousands of immigrants expanded the sense of \"the people.\"\n\nHoar replied that 'the people' were both a less permanent and a less trusted body than state legislatures, and that moving the responsibility for the election of senators to them would see it passing into the hands of a body that \"[lasted] but a day\" before changing. Other counterarguments were that renowned senators could not have been elected directly, and that since a large number of senators had experience in the House, which was already directly elected, a constitutional amendment would be pointless.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;545</ref> The reform was considered by opponents to threaten the rights and independence of the states, who were \"sovereign, entitled...to have a separate branch of Congress...to which they could send their ambassadors\". This was countered by the argument that a change in the mode in which senators were elected would not change their responsibilities.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;546</ref>\n\nThe Senate freshman class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators had been elected through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More than half of the states had some form of primary selection for the Senate. The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826.<ref>MacNeil, Neil and Richard A.

This meant that their millions of population had no political representation. Most of the South had one-party states.

See Fla. Const. of 1885, Art. III, \u00a7 2. By that time, the amendment had been ratified by 35 states, and, as noted above, would be ratified by the 36th state on April 8, 1913, a circumstance which made any action by the Florida Legislature unnecessary.</ref> [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], [[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], [[Alaska]] or [[Hawaii]]. Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states at the time of the amendment's proposal, and have never taken any official action to support or oppose the amendment since achieving statehood.\n\n==Effect==\nThe Seventeenth Amendment altered the process for electing United States senators and changed the way vacancies would be filled. Originally, the Constitution required state legislatures to fill Senate vacancies.\n\nThe Seventeenth Amendment had a dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S. Senate.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;552.</ref> Before the Supreme Court required \"[[one man, one vote]]\" in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), [[malapportionment]] of state legislatures was common. For example, rural counties and cities could be given \"equal weight\" in the state legislatures, enabling one rural vote to equal 200 city votes. The malapportioned state legislatures would have given the Republicans control of the Senate in the [[United States Senate elections, 1916|1916 Senate elections]]. With direct election, each vote represented equally, the Democrats retained control of the Senate.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;552. Similarly, he believes the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994 would not have happened; instead, the Democrats would have controlled 70 seats in the Senate to the Republicans' 30. See Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;553</ref>\n\nThe reputation of corrupt and arbitrary state legislatures continued to decline as the Senate joined the House of Representatives implementing popular reforms. Judge Bybee has argued that the amendment led to complete \"ignominy\" for state legislatures without the buttress of a state-based check on Congress. In the decades following the Seventeenth Amendment, the federal government was enabled to enact [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] measures.<ref name=byb535>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;535. This was partially fueled by the Senators; he wrote in the ''[[Northwestern University Law Review]]'':{{quote|Politics, like nature, abhorred a vacuum, so senators felt the pressure to do something, namely enact laws. Once senators were no longer accountable to and constrained by state legislatures, the maximizing function for senators was unrestrained; senators almost always found in their own interest to procure federal legislation, even to the detriment of state control of traditional state functions.}} See Bybee, p.&nbsp;536.</ref> However, Schleiches argues that the separation of state legislatures and the Senate had a beneficial effect on the states, as it led state legislative campaigns to focus on local rather than national issues.<ref name=DSchleicher/>\n\n[[New Deal]] legislation is another example of expanding federal regulation overruling the state legislatures promoting their local state interests in coal, oil, corn and cotton.<ref>Rossum (1999) p.&nbsp;715</ref> Ure agrees, saying that not only is each senator now free to ignore his state's interests, senators \"have incentive to use their advice-and-consent powers to install Supreme Court justices who are inclined to increase federal power at the expense of state sovereignty\".<ref>Ure (2007) p.&nbsp;288</ref> Over the first half of the 20th century, with a popularly elected Senate confirming nominations, both Republican and Democratic, the Supreme Court began to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|apply the Bill of Rights to the states]], overturning state laws whenever they harmed individual state citizens.<ref>Kochan (2003) p.&nbsp;1053 Donald J. Kochan, for an article in the ''[[Albany Law Review]]'', analyzed the effect of the Seventeenth Amendment on Supreme Court decisions over the constitutionality of state legislation. He found a \"statistically significant difference\" in the number of cases holding state legislation unconstitutional before and after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, with the number of holdings of unconstitutionality increasing sixfold. Besides the Seventeenth Amendment, decline in the influence of the states also followed economic changes. Zywicki observes that interest groups of all kinds began to focus efforts on the federal government, as national issues could not be directed by influencing only a few state legislatures of with Senators of the most seniority chairing the major committees. He attributes the rise in the strength of interest groups partially to the development of the U.S.&nbsp;economy on an interstate, national level. See Zywicki (1997) p.&nbsp;215. Ure also argues that the Seventeenth Amendment led to the rise of [[Special Interest Group|special interest groups]] to fill the void; with citizens replacing state legislators as the Senate's electorate, with citizens being less able to monitor the actions of their Senators, the Senate became more susceptible to pressure from interest groups, who in turn were more influential due to the centralization of power in the federal government; an interest group no longer needed to [[Lobbying|lobby]] many state legislatures, and could instead focus its efforts on the federal government. See Ure (2007) p.&nbsp;293</ref>\n\n===Filling vacancies===\nThe Seventeenth Amendment says a state legislature may permit its [[Governor (United States)|governor]] to make temporary appointments, which last until a [[By-election|special election]] is held to fill the vacancy. Currently, all but three states \u2014 [[Oregon]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Oklahoma]] \u2014 permit such appointments.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newsweek.com/us-senate-vacancies-governor-party-opinion-890223|magazine=Newsweek|title=Does a Governor Have to Appoint a Vacated U.S. Senate Seat By Party?|first=Ross|last=Cohen|date=April 22, 2018}}</ref> The Constitution does not set out how the temporary appointee is to be selected.\n\nThe Seventeenth Amendment requires a governor to call a special election to fill the vacancy.<ref>Vile (2010) p.&nbsp;197</ref>\n\n===First direct elections to the Senate===\n\n[[Oklahoma]], admitted to statehood in 1907, chose a senator by legislative election three times: twice in 1907, when admitted, and once in 1908. In 1912, Oklahoma reelected [[Robert Latham Owen|Robert Owen]] by advisory popular vote.<ref name=Dubin/>\n\n[[Oregon]] held primaries in 1908 in which the parties would run candidates for that position, and the state legislature pledged to choose the winner as the new senator.{{Fact|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[New Mexico]], admitted to statehood in 1912, chose only its first two senators legislatively.

Pennsylvania]]'' (1991),<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Trinsey v. Pennsylvania|vol=941|court=F.2d|year=1991}}</ref> the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] was faced with a situation where, following the death of Senator [[John Heinz]] of [[Pennsylvania]], Governor [[Bob Casey Sr.|Bob Casey]] had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a [[Primary election|primary]].<ref>Gold (1992) p.&nbsp;202</ref> A voter and prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey,&nbsp;Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>Novakovic (1992) p.&nbsp;940</ref> The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.<ref>Novakovic (1992) p.&nbsp;945</ref>\n\nAnother subject of analysis is whether statutes restricting the authority of governors to appoint temporary replacements are constitutional. [[Vikram Amar]], writing in the ''Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly'', claims that Wyoming's requirement that its governor fill a senatorial vacancy by nominating a person of the same party as the person who vacated that Senate seat violates the Seventeenth Amendment.<ref>Amar (2008) p.&nbsp;728</ref> This is based on the text of the Seventeenth Amendment, which states that \"the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments\". The amendment only empowers the legislature to delegate the authority to the governor and, once that authority has been delegated, does not permit the legislature to intervene. The authority is to decide whether the governor shall have the power to appoint temporary senators, not who the governor may appoint.<ref>Amar (2008) pp.&nbsp;729\u201330</ref> [[Sanford Levinson]], in his rebuttal to Amar, argues that rather than engaging in a [[Textualism|textual]] interpretation, those examining the meaning of constitutional provisions should interpret them in the fashion that provides the most benefit, and that legislatures being able to restrict gubernatorial appointment authority provides a substantial benefit to the states.<ref>Levinson (2008) pp.&nbsp;718\u20139</ref>\n\n===Reform and repeal efforts===\nNotwithstanding controversies over the effects of the Seventeenth Amendment, advocates have emerged to reform or repeal the amendment. Under President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Presidency of Barack Obama|administration]] in 2009, four sitting Democratic senators left the Senate for executive branch positions: Barack Obama (President), [[Joe Biden]] (Vice President), [[Hillary Clinton]] (Secretary of State), and [[Ken Salazar]] (Secretary of the Interior). Controversies developed about the successor appointments made by [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois governor]] [[Rod Blagojevich]] and [[List of Governors of New York|New York governor]] [[David Paterson]].

The amendment supersedes [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Senate|Article I, \u00a73]], Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, under which senators were elected by [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]]. It also alters the procedure for filling vacancies in the Senate, allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until a [[By-election|special election]] can be held.\n\nThe amendment was proposed by the [[62nd United States Congress|62nd Congress]] in 1912 and became part of the Constitution on April 8, 1913 on ratification by three-fourths (36) of the state legislatures. Sitting senators were not affected by the Amendment's provisions until their existing terms expired, so the Amendment took six years to fully implement. The transition began with two special elections in 1913\u2014the first in [[1913 United States Senate election in Georgia|Georgia]]<ref>{{cite web |title=BACON, Augustus Octavius (1839-1914) |url=https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=B000014 |website=Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress |accessdate=February 24, 2020 |quote=became the first U.S. Senator elected by popular vote following ratification of the 17th Amendment, on July 15, 1913}}</ref> and second in [[1913 United States Senate special election in Maryland|Maryland]]. The transition then began in earnest with the [[1914 United States Senate elections|November 1914 election]], and was complete on 4 March 1919 when the senators chosen at the [[1918 United States Senate elections|November 1918 election]] took office.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.

Prior to the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties, with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state. However, under the new Constitution, the federal government was granted substantially more power than before. Having the state legislatures elect the senators reassured [[Anti-Federalism|anti-federalists]] that there would be some protection against the federal government swallowing up of states and their powers,<ref>Riker (1955) p.&nbsp;452</ref> and providing a [[Separation of powers|check]] on the power of the federal government.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;516</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the longer terms and avoidance of popular election turned the Senate into a body that could counter the populism of the House. While the representatives operated in a two-year [[direct election]] cycle, making them frequently accountable to their constituents, the senators could afford to \"take a more detached view of issues coming before Congress\".<ref name=byb515>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;515</ref> State legislatures retained the theoretical right to \"instruct\" their senators to vote for or against proposals, thus giving the states both direct and indirect representation in the federal government.<ref>Zywicki (1994) p.&nbsp;1019</ref> The Senate was part of a formal bicameralism, with the members of the Senate and House responsible to completely distinct constituencies; this helped defeat the problem of the federal government being subject to \"special interests\".<ref>Zywicki (1997) p.&nbsp;176</ref> Members of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] considered the Senate to be parallel to the British [[House of Lords]] as an \"upper house\", containing the \"better men\" of society, but improved upon as they would be conscientiously chosen by the upper houses of state republican legislatures for fixed terms, and not merely inherited for life as in the British system, subject to a monarch's arbitrary expansion. It was hoped that they would provide abler deliberation and greater stability than the House of Representatives due to the senators' status.<ref>Zywicki (1997) p.&nbsp;180</ref>\n\n===Issues===\nAccording to Judge [[Jay Bybee]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], those in favor of popular elections for senators believed that two primary problems were caused by the original provisions: legislative corruption and electoral deadlocks.<ref name=Bybee538>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;538</ref> There was a sense that senatorial elections were \"bought and sold\", changing hands for favors and sums of money rather than because of the competence of the candidate. Between 1857 and 1900, the Senate investigated three elections over corruption. In 1900, for example, [[William A. Clark]] had his election voided after the Senate concluded that he had bought votes in the Montana legislature. But analysts Bybee and [[Todd Zywicki]] believe this concern was largely unfounded; there was a \"dearth of hard information\" on the subject.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;539</ref> In more than a century of legislative elections of U.S. senators, only ten cases were contested for allegations of impropriety.<ref name=zywicki1022>Zywicki (1994) p.&nbsp;1022</ref>\n\nElectoral deadlocks were another issue. Because state legislatures were charged with deciding whom to appoint as senators, the system relied on their ability to agree. Some states could not, and thus delayed sending representatives to Congress; in a few cases, the system broke down to the point where states completely lacked representation in the Senate.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;541</ref> Deadlocks started to become an issue in the 1850s, with a deadlocked [[Indiana]] legislature allowing a Senate seat to sit vacant for two years.<ref name=SenateWebsite>{{cite web|title=Direct Election of Senators|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Direct_Election_Senators.htm|website=United States Senate|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref> Between 1891 and 1905, 46 elections were deadlocked across 20 states;<ref name=zywicki1022/> in one extreme example, a Senate seat for Delaware went unfilled from 1899 until 1903.<ref name=bybee542>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;542</ref> The business of holding elections also caused great disruption in the state legislatures, with a full third of the [[19th Oregon Legislative Assembly|Oregon House of Representatives choosing not to swear the oath of office in 1897]] due to a dispute over an open Senate seat. The result was that [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Oregon's legislature]] was unable to pass legislation that year.<ref name=bybee542/>\n\nZywicki again argues that this was not a serious issue. Deadlocks were a problem, but they were the exception rather than the norm; many legislatures did not deadlock over elections at all. Most of those that did in the 19th century were the newly admitted western states, which suffered from \"inexperienced legislatures and weak party discipline...as western legislatures gained experience, deadlocks became less frequent.\" While Utah suffered from deadlocks in 1897 and 1899, they became what Zywicki refers to as \"a good teaching experience,\" and Utah never again failed to elect senators.<ref>Zywicki (1994) p.&nbsp;1024</ref> Another concern was that when deadlocks occurred, state legislatures were unable to conduct their other normal business; [[James Ure|James Christian Ure]], writing in the ''[[South Texas Law Review]]'', notes that this did not in fact occur. In a deadlock situation, state legislatures would deal with the matter by holding \"one vote at the beginning of the day\u2014then the legislators would continue with their normal affairs\".<ref>Ure (2007) p.&nbsp;286</ref>\n\nEventually, legislative elections held in a state's Senate election years were perceived to have become so dominated by the business of picking Senators that the state's choice for Senator distracted the electorate from all other pertinent issues.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;543</ref> Senator [[John H. Mitchell]] noted that the Senate became the \"vital issue\" in all legislative campaigns, with the policy stances and qualifications of state legislative candidates ignored by voters who were more interested in the indirect Senate election.<ref name=DSchleicher>{{cite magazine|last1=Schleicher|first1=David|title=States' Wrongs|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/02/conservatives_17th_amendment_repeal_effort_why_their_plan_will_backfire.single.html|accessdate=9 October 2014|magazine=Slate|date=27 February 2014}}</ref> To remedy this, some state legislatures created \"advisory elections\" that served as de facto general elections, allowing legislative campaigns to focus on local issues.<ref name=DSchleicher/>\n\n===Calls for reform===\n[[File:BRYAN, WILLIAM JENNINGS LCCN2016856655 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[William Jennings Bryan]], who campaigned for the popular election of U.S. senators]]\nCalls for a constitutional amendment regarding Senate elections started in the early 19th century, with [[Henry R.

Stockton]] to the Senate due to his approval by a plurality of the New Jersey Legislature rather than a majority. In reaction, the Congress passed a bill in July 1866 that required state legislatures to elect senators by an absolute majority.<ref name=Bybee536/>\n\nBy the 1890s, support for the introduction of direct election for the Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]] incorporated the direct election of senators into its [[Omaha Platform]], adopted in 1892.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Paul S.|last2=Dubofsky|first2=Melvyn|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-508209-8|oclc=185508759|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00paul_0/page/612 612]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00paul_0/page/612}}</ref> [[List of Oregon ballot measures#1908|In 1908]], [[Oregon]] passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote.

David Graham Philips, one of the \"yellow journalists\" whom President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]] called \"muckrakers\", described [[Nelson Aldrich]] of Rhode Island as the principal \"traitor\" among the \"scurvy lot\" in control of the Senate by theft, perjury, and bribes corrupting the state legislatures to gain election to the Senate. A few state legislatures began to petition the Congress for direct election of senators. By 1893, the House had the two-thirds vote for just such an amendment. However, when the joint resolution reached the Senate, it failed from neglect, as it did again in 1900, 1904 and 1908; each time the House approved the appropriate resolution, and each time it died in the Senate.<ref>MacNeil, Neil and Richard A. Baker, ''The American Senate: An Insider's History'' 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-19-536761-4}}. pp.&nbsp;22\u201323.</ref>\n\nOn the second national legislative front, reformers worked toward a constitutional amendment, which was strongly supported in the House of Representatives but initially opposed by the Senate. Bybee notes that the state legislatures, which would lose power if the reforms went through, were supportive of the campaign. By 1910, 31 state legislatures had passed resolutions calling for a constitutional amendment allowing direct election, and in the same year ten [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] senators who were opposed to reform were forced out of their seats, acting as a \"wake-up call to the Senate\".<ref name=\"Bybee 1997 p.&nbsp;537\"/>\n\nReformers included [[William Jennings Bryan]], while opponents counted respected figures such as [[Elihu Root]] and [[George Frisbie Hoar]] among their number; Root cared so strongly about the issue that after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, he refused to stand for re\u2011election to the Senate.<ref name=Bybee538/> Bryan and the reformers argued for popular election through highlighting perceived flaws with the existing system, specifically corruption and electoral deadlocks, and through arousing populist sentiment. Most important was the populist argument; that there was a need to \"Awaken, in the senators...a more acute sense of responsibility to the people\", which it was felt they lacked; election through state legislatures was seen as an anachronism that was out of step with the wishes of the American people, and one that had led to the Senate becoming \"a sort of aristocratic body \u2013 too far removed from the people, beyond their reach, and with no special interest in their welfare\".<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;544</ref> The settlement of the West and continuing absorption of hundreds of thousands of immigrants expanded the sense of \"the people.\"\n\nHoar replied that 'the people' were both a less permanent and a less trusted body than state legislatures, and that moving the responsibility for the election of senators to them would see it passing into the hands of a body that \"[lasted] but a day\" before changing. Other counterarguments were that renowned senators could not have been elected directly, and that since a large number of senators had experience in the House, which was already directly elected, a constitutional amendment would be pointless.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;545</ref> The reform was considered by opponents to threaten the rights and independence of the states, who were \"sovereign, entitled...to have a separate branch of Congress...to which they could send their ambassadors\". This was countered by the argument that a change in the mode in which senators were elected would not change their responsibilities.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;546</ref>\n\nThe Senate freshman class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators had been elected through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More than half of the states had some form of primary selection for the Senate. The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826.<ref>MacNeil, Neil and Richard A. Baker, ''The American Senate: An Insider's History'' 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-19-536761-4}}. p.&nbsp;23.</ref>\n\nBy 1912, 239 political parties at both the state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and 33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries.<ref>Rossum (1999) p.&nbsp;708</ref> Twenty-seven states had called for a [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional convention]] on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. [[Alabama]] and [[Wyoming]], already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.<ref>Rossum (1999) p.&nbsp;710</ref>\n\n==Proposal and ratification==\n\n===Proposal in Congress===\nIn 1911, the House of Representatives passed House Joint Resolution 39 proposing a constitutional amendment for direct election of senators. The original resolution passed by the House contained the following clause:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/17th-amendment/hjres39.html|title=17th Amendment: Direct Election of U.S. Senators|date=August 15, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators shall be as prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof.}}\n\nThis so-called \"race rider\" clause would have strengthened the powers of states over senatorial elections and weakened those of Congress by overriding Congress's power to override state laws affecting the manner of senatorial elections.<ref>Zachary Clopton & Steven E.

This meant that their millions of population had no political representation. Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution came before the Senate, a substitute resolution, one without the rider, was proposed by [[Joseph L. Bristow]] of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with 4 not voting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/17th-amendment/|title=17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Direct Election of U.S. Senators|date=August 15, 2016}}</ref> Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change.

Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states at the time of the amendment's proposal, and have never taken any official action to support or oppose the amendment since achieving statehood.\n\n==Effect==\nThe Seventeenth Amendment altered the process for electing United States senators and changed the way vacancies would be filled. Originally, the Constitution required state legislatures to fill Senate vacancies.\n\nThe Seventeenth Amendment had a dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S. Senate.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;552.</ref> Before the Supreme Court required \"[[one man, one vote]]\" in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), [[malapportionment]] of state legislatures was common. For example, rural counties and cities could be given \"equal weight\" in the state legislatures, enabling one rural vote to equal 200 city votes. The malapportioned state legislatures would have given the Republicans control of the Senate in the [[United States Senate elections, 1916|1916 Senate elections]]. With direct election, each vote represented equally, the Democrats retained control of the Senate.<ref>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;552. Similarly, he believes the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994 would not have happened; instead, the Democrats would have controlled 70 seats in the Senate to the Republicans' 30. See Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;553</ref>\n\nThe reputation of corrupt and arbitrary state legislatures continued to decline as the Senate joined the House of Representatives implementing popular reforms. Judge Bybee has argued that the amendment led to complete \"ignominy\" for state legislatures without the buttress of a state-based check on Congress. In the decades following the Seventeenth Amendment, the federal government was enabled to enact [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] measures.<ref name=byb535>Bybee (1997) p.&nbsp;535. This was partially fueled by the Senators; he wrote in the ''[[Northwestern University Law Review]]'':{{quote|Politics, like nature, abhorred a vacuum, so senators felt the pressure to do something, namely enact laws. Once senators were no longer accountable to and constrained by state legislatures, the maximizing function for senators was unrestrained; senators almost always found in their own interest to procure federal legislation, even to the detriment of state control of traditional state functions.}} See Bybee, p.&nbsp;536.</ref> However, Schleiches argues that the separation of state legislatures and the Senate had a beneficial effect on the states, as it led state legislative campaigns to focus on local rather than national issues.<ref name=DSchleicher/>\n\n[[New Deal]] legislation is another example of expanding federal regulation overruling the state legislatures promoting their local state interests in coal, oil, corn and cotton.<ref>Rossum (1999) p.&nbsp;715</ref> Ure agrees, saying that not only is each senator now free to ignore his state's interests, senators \"have incentive to use their advice-and-consent powers to install Supreme Court justices who are inclined to increase federal power at the expense of state sovereignty\".<ref>Ure (2007) p.&nbsp;288</ref> Over the first half of the 20th century, with a popularly elected Senate confirming nominations, both Republican and Democratic, the Supreme Court began to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|apply the Bill of Rights to the states]], overturning state laws whenever they harmed individual state citizens.<ref>Kochan (2003) p.&nbsp;1053 Donald J. Kochan, for an article in the ''[[Albany Law Review]]'', analyzed the effect of the Seventeenth Amendment on Supreme Court decisions over the constitutionality of state legislation. He found a \"statistically significant difference\" in the number of cases holding state legislation unconstitutional before and after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, with the number of holdings of unconstitutionality increasing sixfold. Besides the Seventeenth Amendment, decline in the influence of the states also followed economic changes. Zywicki observes that interest groups of all kinds began to focus efforts on the federal government, as national issues could not be directed by influencing only a few state legislatures of with Senators of the most seniority chairing the major committees. He attributes the rise in the strength of interest groups partially to the development of the U.S.&nbsp;economy on an interstate, national level. See Zywicki (1997) p.&nbsp;215. Ure also argues that the Seventeenth Amendment led to the rise of [[Special Interest Group|special interest groups]] to fill the void; with citizens replacing state legislators as the Senate's electorate, with citizens being less able to monitor the actions of their Senators, the Senate became more susceptible to pressure from interest groups, who in turn were more influential due to the centralization of power in the federal government; an interest group no longer needed to [[Lobbying|lobby]] many state legislatures, and could instead focus its efforts on the federal government. See Ure (2007) p.&nbsp;293</ref>\n\n===Filling vacancies===\nThe Seventeenth Amendment says a state legislature may permit its [[Governor (United States)|governor]] to make temporary appointments, which last until a [[By-election|special election]] is held to fill the vacancy. Currently, all but three states \u2014 [[Oregon]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Oklahoma]] \u2014 permit such appointments.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newsweek.com/us-senate-vacancies-governor-party-opinion-890223|magazine=Newsweek|title=Does a Governor Have to Appoint a Vacated U.S. Senate Seat By Party?|first=Ross|last=Cohen|date=April 22, 2018}}</ref> The Constitution does not set out how the temporary appointee is to be selected.\n\nThe Seventeenth Amendment requires a governor to call a special election to fill the vacancy.<ref>Vile (2010) p.&nbsp;197</ref>\n\n===First direct elections to the Senate===\n\n[[Oklahoma]], admitted to statehood in 1907, chose a senator by legislative election three times: twice in 1907, when admitted, and once in 1908. In 1912, Oklahoma reelected [[Robert Latham Owen|Robert Owen]] by advisory popular vote.<ref name=Dubin/>\n\n[[Oregon]] held primaries in 1908 in which the parties would run candidates for that position, and the state legislature pledged to choose the winner as the new senator.{{Fact|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[New Mexico]], admitted to statehood in 1912, chose only its first two senators legislatively. [[Arizona]], admitted to statehood in 1912, chose its first two senators by advisory popular vote.

Pennsylvania]]'' (1991),<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Trinsey v. Pennsylvania|vol=941|court=F.2d|year=1991}}</ref> the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] was faced with a situation where, following the death of Senator [[John Heinz]] of [[Pennsylvania]], Governor [[Bob Casey Sr.|Bob Casey]] had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a [[Primary election|primary]].<ref>Gold (1992) p.&nbsp;202</ref> A voter and prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey,&nbsp;Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>Novakovic (1992) p.&nbsp;940</ref> The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.<ref>Novakovic (1992) p.&nbsp;945</ref>\n\nAnother subject of analysis is whether statutes restricting the authority of governors to appoint temporary replacements are constitutional. [[Vikram Amar]], writing in the ''Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly'', claims that Wyoming's requirement that its governor fill a senatorial vacancy by nominating a person of the same party as the person who vacated that Senate seat violates the Seventeenth Amendment.<ref>Amar (2008) p.&nbsp;728</ref> This is based on the text of the Seventeenth Amendment, which states that \"the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments\". The amendment only empowers the legislature to delegate the authority to the governor and, once that authority has been delegated, does not permit the legislature to intervene. The authority is to decide whether the governor shall have the power to appoint temporary senators, not who the governor may appoint.<ref>Amar (2008) pp.&nbsp;729\u201330</ref> [[Sanford Levinson]], in his rebuttal to Amar, argues that rather than engaging in a [[Textualism|textual]] interpretation, those examining the meaning of constitutional provisions should interpret them in the fashion that provides the most benefit, and that legislatures being able to restrict gubernatorial appointment authority provides a substantial benefit to the states.<ref>Levinson (2008) pp.&nbsp;718\u20139</ref>\n\n===Reform and repeal efforts===\nNotwithstanding controversies over the effects of the Seventeenth Amendment, advocates have emerged to reform or repeal the amendment. Under President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Presidency of Barack Obama|administration]] in 2009, four sitting Democratic senators left the Senate for executive branch positions: Barack Obama (President), [[Joe Biden]] (Vice President), [[Hillary Clinton]] (Secretary of State), and [[Ken Salazar]] (Secretary of the Interior). Controversies developed about the successor appointments made by [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois governor]] [[Rod Blagojevich]] and [[List of Governors of New York|New York governor]] [[David Paterson]].

A large amount of 1 crore honas was spent on the function. Sambhaji wanted to replenish his depleted treasury.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] had finished his campaign on the North-Western border. He was preparing for a full-scale invasion of the [[Deccan Plateau]]. Sambhaji knew that the [[Maratha Empire]] was heading into a sustained conflict against the overwhelmingly larger [[Mughal Empire]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He wanted to fill the Maratha treasury before the arrival of Aurangzeb in Deccan. Sambhaji also wanted to gain a psychological edge over his opponent Aurangzeb by scoring the first victory.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Shivaji|title=Chhava|publisher=Continental Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Maratha Plan ==\nSambhaji called a strategic meeting of his advisors and senior generals at Raigad, just after his coronation.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sambhaji and Maratha generals decided to attack and sack [[Burhanpur]] as it was an important trading center and a very rich city.<ref name=\":3\" /> Burhanpur was not an easy target for the Marathas. Distance from Raigad to Burhanpur was more than 500 kilometres. The Marathas had to pass through at least 300 kilometres of Mughal territory undetected. The Subhedar of Burhanpur was [[Bahadurkhan Kokaltash]]. The city was heavily fortified and guarded by a force of 8,000. Maratha generals had to consider all these factors before attacking deep into the Mughal territory.\n\nSambhaji had got the news that Bahadurkhan was going to Aurangabad for his nephew's wedding with a girl from the royal family of [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Bahadurkhan took a force 3,000 with him for the wedding. Hence Burhanpur was left with an army of 5,000 under Bahadurkhan's deputy [[Kakar Khan]]. Sambhaji and generals decided to further bifurcate the force at [[Burhanpur]] by feigning a move to attack [[Surat]] so that Mughals at Burhanpur will be forced to send reinforcement to Surat, which had been sacked by Shivaji twice before.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Sacking of Burhanpur ==\nBurhanpur was left with a force of 5,000 under Bahadurkhan's deputy Kakar Khan. Marathas deliberately sent their few horsemen near Surat to feign an attack on Surat. Sightings of Maratha horsemen near Surat created great panic in the city. The Subhedar of Surat asked Kakar Khan for help. Kakar Khan immediately sent 4,000 of his troops to Surat. Burhanpur was left with only 1,000 soldiers under Kakar Khan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMeanwhile [[Hambirrao Mohite]] had reached the forests near Burhanpur with a 15,000 strong cavalry force. Kakar Khan panicked after hearing this news and gathered some civilian forces. He decided to attack Hambirrao at midnight. As he came out of the city gates [[Sambhaji]] himself attacked from the old trenches with a cavalry force of 4,000. Sambhaji's force routed the ill-prepared mughal garrison. Sambhaji then left 200-300 soldiers at the main city gate and left for Bahadurpura,<ref name=\":2\" /> the richest suburb of the city. Sambhaji started to loot the houses of the richest merchants which were shown to him by his spies. Hambirrao's force soon joined Sambhaji and the combined Maratha force started looting the city. Karnapura was suburb with many armed Sikhs, they were disarmed as a precautionary measure. Hambirrao then sealed the city's entrances to ensure that the word of the attack doesn't spread out. Marathas looted the city consecutively for three days. Marathas earned a loot estimated to be around 2 crore rupees.<ref name=\":4\" /> The Marathas also captured the city fort and arrested Kakar Khan.\n\nBahadurkhan got the news and immediately left Aurangabad with a large army to save Burhanpur.<ref name=\":3\" /> When Marathas got the news they immediately left the city for Raigad as they were far away from Maratha territory.\n\n== Withdrawal of Maratha forces ==\nSambhaji left Burhanpur and started marching towards Raigad. Bahadurkhan left Aurangabad with a force of around 20,000 to seize the loot back from the Marathas. The Marathas were deep into Mughal territory and their March was slowed down because of the loot. Sambhaji could not afford a battle in such a situation. Sambhaji decided to divide his forces into three parts.\n\nThere were two routes to reach Raigad. First route was the shorter one via Dharangaon-Chopda. Second one was longer one via Erandol. Bahadurkhan was waiting for Sambhaji's forces at the first route. Sambhaji deliberately sent his first division under Mulla Kazi Haider disguised as envoys via the first route. Bahadurkhan arrested them all but they convinced him that Sambhaji will choose the longer route to avoid his forces. After some time the second division of Maratha force consisting of 3,000 soldiers passed via the same route without any loot. Bahadurkhan did not attack them as he was concerned with securing the loot. Bahadurkhan was convinced after seeing this force that Sambhaji has opted for the longer route and left for Erandol. Three hours after Bahadurkhan had left the first route the entire Maratha army took the loot via the Dharangaon-Chopda route to the Maratha stronghold of [[Salher]]. And the Marathas reached Raigad shortly thereafter. This complex manouvre was possible because of a network of efficient spies of Sambhaji.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Bahadurkhan had left Aurangabad hastily with a large army leaving only few soldiers in Aurangabad. Seeing this opportunity a Maratha sardar named Suryaji Jakhde attacked Aurangabad with a force of 7,000 via [[Paithan]]. Bahadurkhan immediately rushed to Aurangabad via Fardapur and Suryaji Jakhde had to retreat from the city.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Assassination attempt on Sambhaji ==\nAurangzeb had stationed few of his trusted horsemen called 'Ahudi' in every important mughal city. Their job was to locate and kill the leader of enemy forces in case of an attack. When Sambhaji left Burhanpur for Raigad, five 'Ahudi' horsemen from Burhanpur started chasing the returning Maratha army. Sambhaji went to Vani with a small force to visit Saptashringi temple. They attacked Sambhaji at Saptashringi temple at Vani village. Sambhaji was saved because of his armour. Sambhaji then killed all five of the Ahudis in personal combat.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Sambhaji's conduct with people of Burhanpur ==\nSome historians have argued that Sambhaji committed atrocities against Muslims, the Maratha forces committed plunder, rape against them. These accounts are false, biased against Sambhaji and do not take into account following facts.\n\n1) There are no contemporary sources which  claim that Sambhaji committed atrocities in Burhanpur.\n\n2) The Maratha army had a well defined code of conduct regarding their behaviour with civilians. They were not allowed not steal, plunder anything from poor people. Rape and murder of civilians was totally forbidden in the army. Any Maratha Soldier who violated this code of conduct by behaving inappropriately with civilians was given a death sentence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jadhav|first=Namdevrao|title=Ganimi Kava|publisher=Rajamata Prakashan|year=|isbn=978-8191098006|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref>\n\n3) Sambhaji looted only the houses of rich traders which were shown to him by his spies.

He was coronated on 16 January 1681 at [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Indrajit|title=Marathyanche Swatantrayuddha Bhag 1 - Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> His coronation ceremony was attended by more than 50,000 people. A large amount of 1 crore honas was spent on the function. Sambhaji wanted to replenish his depleted treasury.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nMughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] had finished his campaign on the North-Western border. He was preparing for a full scale invasion of the [[Deccan Plateau]]. Sambhaji knew that the [[Maratha Empire]] was heading into a sustained conflict against the overwhelmingly larger [[Mughal Empire]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He wanted to fill the Maratha treasury before the arrival of Aurangzeb in Deccan. Sambhaji also wanted to gain a psychological edge over his opponent Aurangzeb by scoring the first victory. <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Shivaji|title=Chhava|publisher=Continental Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Maratha Plan ==\nSambhaji called a strategic meeting of his advisors and senior generals at Raigad, just after his coronation.<ref name=\":0\" />Sambhaji and Maratha generals decided to attack and sack [[Burhanpur]] as it was an important trading center and a very rich city.<ref name=\":3\" /> Burhanpur was not an easy target for the Marathas. Distance from Raigad to Burhanpur was more than 500 kilometres. The Marathas had to pass through at least 300 kilometres of Mughal territory undetected. The Subhedar of Burhanpur was [[Bahadurkhan Kokaltash]]. The city was heavily fortified and guarded by a force of 8,000. Maratha generals had to consider all these factors before attacking deep into the Mughal territory. \n\nSambhaji had got the news that Bahadurkhan was going to Aurangabad for his nephew's wedding with a girl from the royal family of [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Bahadurkhan took a force 3,000 with him for the wedding. Hence Burhanpur was left with an army of 5,000 under Bahadurkhan's deputy [[Kakar Khan]]. Sambhaji and generals decided to further bifurcate the force at [[Burhanpur]] by feigning a move to attack [[Surat]] so that Mughals at Burhanpur will be forced to send reinforcement to Surat, which had been sacked by Shivaji twice before. <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Sacking of Burhanpur ==\nBurhanpur was left with a force of 5,000 under Bahadurkhan's deputy Kakar Khan. Marathas deliberately sent their few horsemen near Surat to feign an attack on Surat. Sightings of Maratha horsemen near Surat created great panic in the city. The Subhedar of Surat asked Kakar Khan for help. Kakar Khan immediately sent 4,000 of his troops to Surat. Burhanpur was left with only 1,000 soldiers under Kakar Khan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMeanwhile [[Hambirrao Mohite]] had reached the forests near Burhanpur with a 15,000 strong cavalry force. Kakar Khan panicked after hearing this news and gathered some civilian forces. He decided to attack Hambirrao at midnight. As he came out of the city gates [[Sambhaji]] himself attacked from the old trenches with a cavalry force of 4,000. Sambhaji's force routed the ill prepared mughal garrison. Sambhaji then left 200-300 soldiers at the main city gate and left for Bahadurpura,<ref name=\":2\" /> the richest suburb of the city. Sambhaji started to loot the houses of the richest merchants which were shown to him by his spies. Hambirrao's force soon joined Sambhaji and the combined Maratha force started looting the city. Karnapura was suburb with many armed Sikhs, they were disarmed as a precautionary measure. Hambirrao then sealed the city's entrances to ensure that the word of the attack doesn't spread out. Marathas looted the city consecutively for three days. Marathas earned a loot estimated to be around 2 crore rupees<ref name=\":4\" />. The Marathas also captured the city fort and arrested Kakar Khan. \n\nBahadurkhan got the news and immediately left Aurangabad with a large army to save Burhanpur.<ref name=\":3\" /> When Marathas got the news they immediately left the city for Raigad as they were far away from Maratha territory.\n\n== Withdrawal of Maratha forces ==\nSambhaji left Burhanpur and started marching towards Raigad. Bahadurkhan left Aurangabad with a force of around 20,000 to seize the loot back from the Marathas. The Marathas were deep into Mughal territory and their March was slowed down because of the loot. Sambhaji could not afford a battle in such a situation. Sambhaji decided to to divide his forces into three parts.\n\nThere were two routes to reach Raigad. First route was the shorter one via Dharangaon-Chopda. Second one was longer one via Erandol. Bahadurkhan was waiting for Sambhaji's forces at the first route. Sambhaji deliberately sent his first division under Mulla Kazi Haider disguised as envoys via the first route. Bahadurkhan arrested them all but they convinced him that Sambhaji will choose the longer route to avoid his forces. After some time the second division of Maratha force consisting of 3,000 soldiers passed via the same route without any loot. Bahadurkhan did not attack them as he was concerned with securing the loot. Bahadurkhan was convinced after seeing this force that Sambhaji has opted for the longer route and left for Erandol. Three hours after Bahadurkhan had left the first route the entire Maratha army took the loot via the Dharangaon-Chopda route to the Maratha stronghold of [[Salher]]. And the Marathas reached Raigad shortly thereafter. This complex manouvre was possible because of a network of efficient spies of Sambhaji. <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMeanwhile Bahadurkhan had left Aurangabad hastily with a large army leaving only few soldiers in Aurangabad. Seeing this opportunity a Maratha sardar named Suryaji Jakhde attacked Aurangabad with a force of 7,000 via [[Paithan]]. Bahadurkhan immediately rushed to Aurangabad via Fardapur and Suryaji Jakhde had to retreat from the city.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Assassination attempt on Sambhaji ==\nAurangzeb had stationed few of his trusted horsemen called 'Ahudi' in every important mughal city. Their job was to locate and kill the leader of enemy forces in case of an attack. When Sambhaji left Burhanpur for Raigad, five 'Ahudi' horsemen from Burhanpur started chasing the returning Maratha army. Sambhaji went to Vani with a small force to visit Saptashringi temple. They attacked Sambhaji at Saptashringi temple at Vani village. Sambhaji was saved because of his armour. Sambhaji then killed all five of the Ahudis in personal combat. <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n<br />\n\n== Sambhaji's conduct with people of Burhanpur ==\nSome historians have argued that Sambhaji commited atrocities against muslims, the Maratha forces commited plunder, rape against them. These accounts are false, biased against Sambhaji and do not take into account following facts.\n\n1) There are no contemporary sources which  claim that Sambhaji commited atrocities in Burhanpur.\n\n2) The Maratha army had a well defined code of conduct regarding their behaviour with civilians. They were not allowed not steal, plunder anything from poor people. Rape and murder of civilians was totally forbidden in the army. Any Maratha Soldier who violated this code of conduct by behaving inappropriately with civilians was given a death sentence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jadhav|first=Namdevrao|title=Ganimi Kava|publisher=Rajamata Prakashan|year=|isbn=978-8191098006|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref>\n\n3) Sambhaji looted only the houses of rich traders which were shown to him by his spies. He did not loot a single penny from the poor sections of the society.\n\n4) Sambhaji did not harm common people especially women and children as he was tolerant and followed war ethics properly. <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Bahekar|first=S.A.|title=Martiyar Sambhaji|publisher=Kasab Publications|year=1999|isbn=|location=Jalgaon|pages=353}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n5) Sambhaji infact bought horses from a Arab trader who was utterly frightened and was ready to give his horses for free.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAll these evidences show that Sambhaji behaved tolerantly with the civilians and followed the war ethics properly.

This series became the first to see the return of [[Anthony McPartlin]] to his television duties, hosting alongside [[Declan Donnelly]] (colloquially forming the hosting duo known as [[Ant & Dec]]), following his absence the previous year to attend rehab prior to the start of the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 12)|previous series' live episodes]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-02-05/britains-got-talent-2019-date-time-auditions-ant-dec-live-shows-itv/|title=Britain's Got Talent 2019: Everything you need to know|magazine=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref> Alongside McPartlin's return, the competition for this year saw the oldest participant to win ''Britain's Got Talent'', and the surprise return of a performer who participated in a previous year's contest, operating under an alias until their final appearance.\n\nThe thirteenth series was won by 89-year-old singer [[Colin Thackery]],<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48495405 |title =Britain's Got Talent: Colin Thackery crowned winner|date=3 June 2019|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 June 2019}}</ref> with mentalist Marc Spelmann (under the stage name \"X\") finishing in second place and magician [[Ben Hart (magician)|Ben Hart]] in third place.

His latest attempt led to the host of ''Britain's Got More Talent'', [[Stephen Mulhern]], triggering a Golden Buzzer for him. This action led to speculation in the media over whether this had been officially allowed, but it was later revealed to have been disallowed on the grounds that it did not fall under the contest rules, as Mulhern had no official allowance to provide a Golden Buzzer act.\n\nThis series featured two notable events during its broadcast. The first to take place was the forced withdrawal of an act - extreme magicians Brotherhood - who had secured a spot in the semi-finals. Despite Brotherhood's success in the auditions landing them a place in the fifth and final semi-final, concerns over health and safety were raised about the dangerous nature of their performance, leading to the group of magicians withdrawing their involvement at the request of the production staff and broadcaster, and their place being offered to another act which had been eliminated during auditions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-britains-talent-act-brotherhood-16228064|title=Britain's Got Talent act The Brotherhood WITHDRAW from semi-final|author=Lucy Needham|newspaper=Daily Mirror|accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref> The second was the surprise revelation that a participant who had operated under anonymity, was in reality a former semi-finalist from a previous year's contest who had re-entered the contest for this year in order to emphasis the values of hope and perseverance.\n\nOf the participants that took part, only 40 made it into the five live semi-finals - of these acts, dancer [[Akshat Singh]], band Chapter 13, choir Flakefleet Primary School, singer Giorgia Borg, and stand-up comedian Kojo Anim,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/a27590271/britains-got-talent-2019-semi-finalists/|title=Britain's Got Talent reveals its 2019 semi-finalists - here's the full list|website=www.digitalspy.com|author=Sam Warner|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref> each received a golden buzzer during their auditions - with eight appearing in each one, and eleven of these acts making it into the live final; the wildcard act chosen by the judges was dance duo Libby & Charlie, after they lost out in a tied judges' vote in the last semi-final round.

The band openly discussed that they had met whilst performing in the West End show ''[[School of Rock (musical)|School of Rock]]'', which prompted complaints by viewers that the act was a professional one and thus it was \"unfair\" that they had received a place in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/11/britains-got-talent-viewers-brand-show-farce-west-end-performers-chapter-13-land-golden-buzzer-9500400/|title=Britain's Got Talent viewers brand show 'a farce' as West End performers Chapter 13 land golden buzzer|last=Dosani|first=Rishma|date=11 May 2019|website=Metro.co.uk|accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Unacceptable content in Semi-final===\nDuring the live semi-final on 27 May 2019, a semi-finalist act drew criticism from viewers in two separate areas. Regulator [[Ofcom]] received around 192 complaints regarding the broadcast of the performance by The Haunting - 154 of these complaints focused on the scary nature of the act, citing that it was unsuitable for the programme and could likely cause distress for young viewers; 38 of the complaints focused on the reaction of Amanda Holden, in which the frightening nature of the act caused her to swear on live television before the 9pm [[Watershed (broadcasting)#United Kingdom|watershed]]. Although no investigation was made, ITV censored Holden's swearing for playback services, despite it being posted onto social media, with Holden apologising for her reaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/28/ofcom-receives-192-complaints-amanda-holden-swearing-hauntings-britains-got-talent-performance-9704418/|title=Britain's Got Talent hit with 192 Ofcom complaints for Amanda Holden swearing and The Haunting's performance|last=Yeates|first=Sydney|date=28 May 2019|website=Metro.co.uk|accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Simon Cowell walk-off===\nFollowing their live semi-final appearance on 30 May 2019, ventriloquist Jimmy Tamley criticised the producers of ''Britain's Got Talent'' for setting him up before he had conducted a new routine on live television. His criticism was over the fact that, despite fair treatment from backstage staff, he had not been informed that Cowell had been dealing with a skiing injury during his involvement in the programme, and thus could not fully take part in Tamley's act as a life-size ventriloquist's dummy through the use of a \"ventriloquist mask\" \u2013 a special device used by ventriloquists on human volunteers, which could be operated by concealed controls. Following his performance, Tamley voiced his anger at Cowell's decision to leave mid-way into his performance, later stating that the producers had \"thrown me under the bus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/04/britains-got-talent-star-jimmy-tamley-slams-bosses-huge-rant-simon-cowell-drama-threw-bus-9806960/amp/|title=Britain's Got Talent Semifinalist Angry with Producers}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Britain's Got Talent|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Britain's Got Talent (series 13)}}\n[[Category:2019 British television seasons]]\n[[Category:Britain's Got Talent]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:ITV reality television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremantle (company)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{short description|British talent competition series}}\n{{Infobox reality talent competition\n| name          = Britain's Got Talent\n| season        = 13\n| logo          =\n| judges        = [[Simon Cowell]]<br>[[Amanda Holden]]<br>[[Alesha Dixon]]<br>[[David Walliams]]\n| presenter     = [[Anthony McPartlin]] ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]])<br>[[Declan Donnelly]] ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]])\n| copresenter   = [[Stephen Mulhern]] ([[ITV2]])\n| first_aired   = {{startdate|2019|4|6|df=y}}\n| last_aired    = {{startdate|2019|6|2|df=y}}\n| broadcaster   = [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]<br>[[ITV2]] (''BGMT'')\n| image         =\n| winner-name   = [[Colin Thackery]]\n| winner-origin = [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk]]\n| winner-genre  = War Veteran Singer\n| runner-name   = X (Marc Spelmann)\n| british       = yes\n| last          = Britain's Got Talent (series 12)\n| next          = Britain's Got Talent (series 14)\n| year          = 2019\n}}\n\nThe thirteenth series of '''''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''''', a [[Reality television|British talent competition]] series, began broadcasting in the UK during 2019, from 6 April to 2 June on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. This series became the first to see the return of [[Anthony McPartlin]] to his television duties, hosting alongside [[Declan Donnelly]] (colloquially forming the hosting duo known as [[Ant & Dec]]), following his absence the previous year to attend rehab prior to the start of the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 12)|previous series' live episodes]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-02-05/britains-got-talent-2019-date-time-auditions-ant-dec-live-shows-itv/|title=Britain's Got Talent 2019: Everything you need to know|magazine=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref> Alongside McPartlin's return, the competition for this year saw the oldest participant to win ''Britain's Got Talent'', and the surprise return of a performer who participated in a previous year's contest, operating under an alias until their final appearance.\n\nThe thirteenth series was won by 89-year-old singer [[Colin Thackery]],<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48495405 |title =Britain's Got Talent: Colin Thackery crowned winner|date=3 June 2019|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 June 2019}}</ref> with mentalist Marc Spelmann (under the stage name \"X\") finishing in second place and magician [[Ben Hart (magician)|Ben Hart]] in third place.

His latest attempt led to the host of ''Britain's Got More Talent'', [[Stephen Mulhern]], triggering a Golden Buzzer for him. This action led to speculation in the media over whether this had been officially allowed, but it was later revealed to have been disallowed on the grounds that it did not fall under the contest rules, as Mulhern had no official allowance to provide a Golden Buzzer act.\n\nThis series featured two notable events during its broadcast. The first to take place was the forced withdrawal of an act - extreme magicians Brotherhood - who had secured a spot in the semi-finals. Despite Brotherhood's success in the auditions landing them a place in the fifth and final semi-final, concerns over health and safety were raised about the dangerous nature of their performance, leading to the group of magicians withdrawing their involvement at the request of the production staff and broadcaster, and their place being offered to another act which had been eliminated during auditions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-britains-talent-act-brotherhood-16228064|title=Britain's Got Talent act The Brotherhood WITHDRAW from semi-final|author=Lucy Needham|newspaper=Daily Mirror|accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref> The second was the surprise revelation that a participant who had operated under anonymity, was in reality a former semi-finalist from a previous year's contest who had re-entered the contest for this year in order to emphasis the values of hope and perseverance.\n\nOf the participants that took part, only 40 made it into the five live semi-finals - of these acts, dancer [[Akshat Singh]], band Chapter 13, choir Flakefleet Primary School, singer Giorgia Borg, and stand-up comedian Kojo Anim,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/a27590271/britains-got-talent-2019-semi-finalists/|title=Britain's Got Talent reveals its 2019 semi-finalists - here's the full list|website=www.digitalspy.com|author=Sam Warner|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref> each received a golden buzzer during their auditions - with eight appearing in each one, and eleven of these acts making it into the live final; the wildcard act chosen by the judges was dance duo Libby & Charlie, after they lost out in a tied judges' vote in the last semi-final round.

Although no investigation was made, ITV censored Holden's swearing for playback services, despite it being posted onto social media, with Holden apologising for her reaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/28/ofcom-receives-192-complaints-amanda-holden-swearing-hauntings-britains-got-talent-performance-9704418/|title=Britain's Got Talent hit with 192 Ofcom complaints for Amanda Holden swearing and The Haunting's performance|last=Yeates|first=Sydney|date=28 May 2019|website=Metro.co.uk|accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Simon Cowell walk-off===\nFollowing their live semi-final appearance on 30 May 2019, ventriloquist Jimmy Tamley criticised the producers of ''Britain's Got Talent'' for setting him up before he had conducted a new routine on live television. His criticism was over the fact that, despite fair treatment from backstage staff, he had not been informed that Cowell had been dealing with a skiing injury during his involvement in the programme, and thus could not fully take part in Tamley's act as a life-size ventriloquist's dummy through the use of a \"ventriloquist mask\" \u2013 a special device used by ventriloquists on human volunteers, which could be operated by concealed controls. Following his performance, Tamley voiced his anger at Cowell's decision to leave mid-way into his performance, later stating that the producers had \"thrown me under the bus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/04/britains-got-talent-star-jimmy-tamley-slams-bosses-huge-rant-simon-cowell-drama-threw-bus-9806960/amp/|title=Britain's Got Talent Semifinalist Angry with Producers}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Britain's Got Talent|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Britain's Got Talent (series 13)}}\n[[Category:2019 British television seasons]]\n[[Category:Britain's Got Talent]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:ITV reality television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremantle (company)]]\n", "name_user": "109.154.201.0", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSemi-final 3 (29 May))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain%27s_Got_Talent_(series_13)"}

The film is directed by [[Andy Muschietti]], returning from the first film, with a screenplay by [[Gary Dauberman]]. Set in 2016, 27 years after the first film, it stars [[Jessica Chastain]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Jay Ryan (actor)|Jay Ryan]], [[James Ransone]], [[Andy Bean (actor)|Andy Bean]], and [[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]], who returns as [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]. It is the second installment of the [[It (film series)|''It'' film series]]. \n\nTalks for an ''It'' sequel began in February 2016. By September 2017, [[New Line Cinema]] announced that it would be released in September 2019, with Dauberman writing the script and Muschietti to direct. [[Principal photography]] began on June 19, 2018, at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]] and on locations in and around [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]], [[Oshawa]] and [[Toronto, Ontario]] and wrapped on October 31, 2018. The film is produced by New Line Cinema, Double Dream, [[Vertigo Entertainment]] and Rideback, and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\n''It Chapter Two'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on August 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 6, 2019, in 2D, [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]]. The film has grossed over $473{{nbsp}}million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its acting and themes but criticism for its near-three hour runtime and weaker scares compared to its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2016, [[Derry (Stephen King)|Derry, Maine]], Don Hagarty witnesses his boyfriend Adrian Mellon being murdered by [[It (character)|Pennywise]] after a gang of homophobic youths beat them up and throw Adrian off a bridge while leaving the annual Derry carnival. Overhearing a police scanner and investigating the scene, [[Mike Hanlon]] discovers It has returned, and calls his childhood friends, [[Bill Denbrough]], [[Ben Hanscom]], [[Beverly Marsh]], [[Richie Tozier]], [[Eddie Kaspbrak]], and [[Stanley Uris]], back to Derry to honor the promise they made in 1989 to kill It if it came back. While the others travel to Derry with only hazy memories and a sense of dread, Stan slashes his wrists in the bathtub soon after getting the call. The Losers meet for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where Mike refreshes their memories while they are tormented by hallucinations and learn of Stan's death.\n\nRichie and Eddie decide to leave until Beverly reveals that ever since she was exposed to It's Deadlights, she has been experiencing visions of their deaths should they fail or leave town without fulfilling their promise. Meanwhile, Henry Bowers, who survived being pushed into the well at the [[Derry (Stephen King)#The%20House%20on%2029%20Neibolt%20Street|Neibolt house]] and was arrested for murdering his father in 1989, escapes from a mental institution with help from It. At a baseball game, a little girl named Victoria is killed after It, as Pennywise, deceives her by saying that he can remove a birthmark from her face. Mike takes Bill to his library abode and shows him, via a drug-induced vision, that the Shokopiwah [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe's]] Ritual of Ch\u00fcd can stop It for good. \n\nGoing to their old clubhouse and acquiring Stan's shower cap, Mike explains that the ritual requires seven personal items from their past to be sacrificed and advises the others to find their artifacts by retracing their steps following their falling out after first entering the Neibolt house. Beverly goes to her old home, now inhabited by an elderly woman named Mrs. Kersh, and finds Ben's love letter, still believing Bill wrote it, fleeing when Mrs. Kersh reveals herself to be It. Ben recalls another childhood encounter with Pennywise at high school before realizing his artifact is the yearbook page Beverly signed, which he kept in his wallet. Both Richie and Eddie recall their own personal encounters with It while retrieving their artifacts: a game token from an abandoned arcade, and an inhaler. Pennywise confronts Richie and taunts him about his sexuality, leading to him deciding to leave again and reconsidering again after recalling Stan's bar mitzvah, before menacing Eddie in the guise of the Leper, but flees when Eddie standing up to It causes the being to shrink in size.\n\nBill finds his childhood bicycle \"Silver\" and recovers the paper boat from the storm drain where Georgie was killed while meeting a boy named Dean, whom they saw earlier at the restaurant and lives at his old house and hears voices from the shower drain. Bill regroups with the others before running off to the carnival and into a funhouse after learning It is going after Dean, only to end up watching helplessly as Pennywise kills the boy before his eyes. Henry unsuccessfully attempts to murder Eddie before attacking Mike, but Richie intervenes and kills him. The Losers join a traumatized Bill at the Neibolt house, talking him out of facing It alone out of guilt.\n\nThe group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, Mike providing a rock from the Losers' fight with the Bowers Gang as they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after Pennywise emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Pennywise pressures Mike into revealing that It killed those who previously performed the ritual and that Mike scratched that truth off the sealing jar. Mike assures the others they have a better chance of facing their fears, but they accuse Mike of lying to them. It attacks the Losers and places Bill, Ben, and Beverly in nightmarish scenarios, which they escape once Bill lets go of his guilt over Georgie's death, and Beverly realizes Ben wrote the love letter, while Richie and Eddie are forced to choose from three doors. Mike gets caught by Pennywise, but Richie manages to distract It, allowing Mike to escape, getting caught in It's Deadlights, and Eddie is fatally impaled after saving him. Eddie reveals how he made It feel small earlier, making the Losers realize they can do that by exploiting his requirement of a physical form and how they see it. They begin taunting Pennywise, showing that they are not afraid of any of It's forms and calling the creature \"just a clown.\" Their mockeries cause Pennywise to surprisingly regress physically and mentally into a helpless infant. Mike proceeds to rip out Pennywise's heart so he and the Losers can crush it, finally killing It for good. Eddie dies from his injuries, and the Losers are forced to leave him behind when It's death causes a cave-in that destroys the Neibolt house.\n\nThe remaining Losers comfort Richie as he mourns for Eddie, their ordeal's end signified by the scars on their hands disappearing.

The film is directed by [[Andy Muschietti]], returning from the first film, with a screenplay by [[Gary Dauberman]]. Set in 2016, 27 years after the first film, it stars [[Jessica Chastain]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Jay Ryan (actor)|Jay Ryan]], [[James Ransone]], [[Andy Bean (actor)|Andy Bean]], and [[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]], who returns as [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]. It is the second installment of the [[It (film series)|''It'' film series]]. \n\nTalks for an ''It'' sequel began in February 2016. By September 2017, [[New Line Cinema]] announced that it would be released in September 2019, with Dauberman writing the script and Muschietti to direct. [[Principal photography]] began on June 19, 2018, at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]] and on locations in and around [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]], [[Oshawa]] and [[Toronto, Ontario]] and wrapped on October 31, 2018. The film is produced by New Line Cinema, Double Dream, [[Vertigo Entertainment]] and Rideback, and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\n''It Chapter Two'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on August 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 6, 2019, in 2D, [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]]. The film has grossed over $473{{nbsp}}million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its acting and themes but criticism for its near-three hour runtime and weaker scares compared to its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2016, [[Derry (Stephen King)|Derry, Maine]], Don Hagarty witnesses his boyfriend Adrian Mellon being murdered by [[It (character)|Pennywise]] after a gang of homophobic youths beat them up and throw Adrian off a bridge while leaving the annual Derry carnival. Overhearing a police scanner and investigating the scene, [[Mike Hanlon]] discovers It has returned, and calls his childhood friends, [[Bill Denbrough]], [[Ben Hanscom]], [[Beverly Marsh]], [[Richie Tozier]], [[Eddie Kaspbrak]], and [[Stanley Uris]], back to Derry to honor the promise they made in 1989 to kill It if it came back. While the others travel to Derry with only hazy memories and a sense of dread, Stan slashes his wrists in the bathtub soon after getting the call. The Losers meet for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where Mike refreshes their memories while they are tormented by hallucinations and learn of Stan's death.\n\nRichie and Eddie decide to leave until Beverly reveals that ever since she was exposed to It's Deadlights, she has been experiencing visions of their deaths should they fail or leave town without fulfilling their promise. Meanwhile, Henry Bowers, who survived being pushed into the well at the [[Derry (Stephen King)#The%20House%20on%2029%20Neibolt%20Street|Neibolt house]] and was arrested for murdering his father in 1989, escapes from a mental institution with help from It. At a baseball game, a little girl named Victoria is killed after It, as Pennywise, deceives her by saying that he can remove a birthmark from her face. Mike takes Bill to his library abode and shows him, via a drug-induced vision, that the Shokopiwah [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe's]] Ritual of Ch\u00fcd can stop It for good. \n\nGoing to their old clubhouse and acquiring Stan's shower cap, Mike explains that the ritual requires seven personal items from their past to be sacrificed and advises the others to find their artifacts by retracing their steps following their falling out after first entering the Neibolt house. Beverly goes to her old home, now inhabited by an elderly woman named Mrs. Kersh, and finds Ben's love letter, still believing Bill wrote it, fleeing when Mrs. Kersh reveals herself to be It. Ben recalls another childhood encounter with Pennywise at high school before realizing his artifact is the yearbook page Beverly signed, which he kept in his wallet. Both Richie and Eddie recall their own personal encounters with It while retrieving their artifacts: a game token from an abandoned arcade, and an inhaler. Pennywise confronts Richie and taunts him about his sexuality, leading to him deciding to leave again and reconsidering again after recalling Stan's bar mitzvah, before menacing Eddie in the guise of the Leper, but flees when Eddie standing up to It causes the being to shrink in size.\n\nBill finds his childhood bicycle \"Silver\" and recovers the paper boat from the storm drain where Georgie was killed while meeting a boy named Dean, whom they saw earlier at the restaurant and lives at his old house and hears voices from the shower drain. Bill regroups with the others before running off to the carnival and into a funhouse after learning It is going after Dean, only to end up watching helplessly as Pennywise kills the boy before his eyes. Henry unsuccessfully attempts to murder Eddie before attacking Mike, but Richie intervenes and kills him. The Losers join a traumatized Bill at the Neibolt house, talking him out of facing It alone out of guilt.\n\nThe group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, Mike providing a rock from the Losers' fight with the Bowers Gang as they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after Pennywise emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Pennywise pressures Mike into revealing that It killed those who previously performed the ritual and that Mike scratched that truth off the sealing jar. Mike assures the others they have a better chance of facing their fears, but they accuse Mike of lying to them. It attacks the Losers and places Bill, Ben, and Beverly in nightmarish scenarios, which they escape once Bill lets go of his guilt over Georgie's death, and Beverly realizes Ben wrote the love letter, while Richie and Eddie are forced to choose from three doors. Mike gets caught by Pennywise, but Richie manages to distract It, allowing Mike to escape, getting caught in It's Deadlights, and Eddie is fatally impaled after saving him. Eddie reveals how he made It feel small earlier, making the Losers realize they can do that by exploiting his requirement of a physical form and how they see it. They begin taunting Pennywise, showing that they are not afraid of any of It's forms and calling the creature \"just a clown.\" Their mockeries cause Pennywise to surprisingly regress physically and mentally into a helpless infant. Mike proceeds to rip out Pennywise's heart so he and the Losers can crush it, finally killing It for good. Eddie dies from his injuries, and the Losers are forced to leave him behind when It's death causes a cave-in that destroys the Neibolt house.\n\nThe remaining Losers comfort Richie as he mourns for Eddie, their ordeal's end signified by the scars on their hands disappearing.

Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]. Osmanabad city is the administrative headquarter of [[Osmanabad_district|Osmanabad District]].\n\n==History==\nThe city Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, the 7th Nizam, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]], of which the region was a part till 1948. Osmanabad's history dates way back to the era of the Ramayana where the [[Hindu]] deity [[Rama]] is said to have spent a few years of his exile. As per historical evidence, the district was ruled by the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. In early centuries the city belonged to the Hindu Chalukyas and Devagiri Yadavas, but later became a part of the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.\n\nFor a period of time, Osmanabad was also ruled by the Mughals, Bahmani, Nizam and Adil Shah kingdoms. Before the Hyderabad Nizam's rule, it was under control of the Mughal King Aurangzeb. Being under the Nizam rule, the district did not celebrate its freedom when the rest of India became independent in 1947. However, soon in 1948, Hyderabad State was merged with independent India and the district became a part of the then Mumbai District. It became a part of Maharashtra State when the State was formed in 1960.\nOsmanabad has a historic lineage dating back to the days of Marathwada and even before that to several kingdoms of which the region was a part.\n\n==Geography==\nThe city of Osmanabad has an elevation of {{Convert|653|m|ft}}.\nOsmanabad city is located in the west central part of [[Osmanabad Tahsil]], but relatively central for the district as a whole.

Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]. Osmanabad city is the administrative headquarter of [[Osmanabad_district|Osmanabad District]].\n\n==History==\nThe city Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, the 7th Nizam, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]], of which the region was a part till 1948. Osmanabad's history dates way back to the era of the Ramayana where the [[Hindu]] deity [[Rama]] is said to have spent a few years of his exile. As per historical evidence, the district was ruled by the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. In early centuries the city belonged to the Hindu Chalukyas and Devagiri Yadavas, but later became a part of the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.\n\nFor a period of time, Osmanabad was also ruled by the Mughals, Bahmani, Nizam and Adil Shah kingdoms. Before the Hyderabad Nizam's rule, it was under control of the Mughal King Aurangzeb. Being under the Nizam rule, the district did not celebrate its freedom when the rest of India became independent in 1947. However, soon in 1948, Hyderabad State was merged with independent India and the district became a part of the then Mumbai District. It became a part of Maharashtra State when the State was formed in 1960.\nOsmanabad has a historic lineage dating back to the days of Marathwada and even before that to several kingdoms of which the region was a part.\n\n==Geography==\nThe city of Osmanabad has an elevation of {{Convert|653|m|ft}}.\nOsmanabad city is located in the west central part of [[Osmanabad Tahsil]], but relatively central for the district as a whole.
