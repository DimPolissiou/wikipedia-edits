For 27 years from {{F1|1977}} Head was technical director at Williams Grand Prix Engineering, and responsible for many innovations within Formula One. Head oversaw the design and construction of Williams cars until May 2004 when his role was handed over to [[Sam Michael]].\n\n==Early career==\nPatrick Head was born into motor sport, his father Michael racing [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] sportscars in the 1950s, and was privately educated at [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]]. After leaving school Head joined the [[Royal Navy]], but soon realised that a career in the [[military]] was not how he wanted to spend his life and so left to attend [[University]], first in [[Birmingham University|Birmingham]] and later, after failing his first year exams, at [[University College London|UCL]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-2012/50/part-one-goldrush|title=Lunch with... Patrick Head|last=Taylor|first=Simon|date=March 2012|website=|publisher=Motor Sport Magazine|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref> Head graduated in 1970 with a [[Mechanical Engineering]] [[academic degree|degree]] and immediately joined the [[chassis]] manufacturer [[Lola Cars|Lola]] in [[Huntingdon]]. Here he formed a friendly relationship with [[John Barnard]], whose Formula One designs for [[McLaren]], [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] would later go on to compete against Williams. \nHead was involved in a number of new projects all trying to become established as car builders or engineering companies and it was during this period that Head and [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] met. Finally becoming disillusioned by his lack of success Head quit motor racing to work on building boats, but was lured back by Williams to join [[Frank Williams Racing Cars|his team]], which Head did during 1975.\n\nIn 1976 thirty-four-year-old Frank Williams decided that the time was right to re-form his own team and promptly set about luring Head back into Formula One. After one abortive attempt, on 8 February 1977 [[WilliamsF1|Williams Grand Prix Engineering]] was founded with Williams and Head taking seventy and thirty percent of the company respectively. In {{F1|1977}} the team raced a customer [[March Engineering|March]] chassis, but in {{F1|1978}}, with backing from [[Saudi Airlines]] and having signed Australian driver [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]], the Head-designed FW06 made its first appearance. Despite having no money, and with Williams himself frequently forced to conduct business from a [[telephone box]], Head still managed to design a respectable car.\n\nThe following season Williams scored 11 world championship points finishing 9th in the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|constructors championship]] and from here momentum began to build. As early as the fourth round of the {{F1|1979}} season Jones made the team's first visit to the podium. The same year saw a Head-designed car take the first of over one-hundred race wins when Swiss driver [[Clay Regazzoni]] won the [[1979 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Four more victories followed in 1979 and Head was now an established [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] car designer.\n\n==1980s==\nHead's {{F1|1980}} car was the class of the field, taking [[Alan Jones (Formula One)|Alan Jones]] and the team to both titles, and securing Williams as a front runner. More success followed in the 1980s and Head began to move away from designing the cars himself, effectively creating a role of Technical Director, a person who oversaw the processes of design, construction, racing and testing, bringing together all the different disciplines. [[Frank Dernie]] took over as chief designer. During the 1980s he is also credited with many revolutionary concepts including a six-wheeled car, which tested in 1982, and [[continuously variable transmission]], which replaced the car's conventional gearbox and allowed the engine to remain at optimum [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] during the entire lap. Neither system made it into racing due to rule changes, which many{{Who|date=July 2015}} attribute to pressure from other teams, who were worried about the time required to develop similar systems of their own.\n\nIn 1986 Head, with other Williams management, was forced to assume control of the team when Frank Williams was seriously injured in a road accident. Despite this diversion, and under Head's temporary stewardship, the team still secured the constructors titles in {{F1|1986}} and both the constructors' and drivers title (with [[Nelson Piquet]]) in {{F1|1987}}.\n\n==1990s==\nIn 1990 Williams hired [[Adrian Newey]], recently sacked as technical director of [[Leyton House Racing]]. The two engineers rapidly formed the outstanding design partnership of the 1990s with Head/Newey cars achieving a level of dominance never seen before, and not repeated until the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]/[[Michael Schumacher|Schumacher]] era a decade later. In a seven-year period between 1991 and 1997, Williams had fifty-nine race wins, won five constructors titles, and four different drivers won world championships. However, Newey also had ambitions to succeed to technical director, but this was blocked as Head was a founder and shareholder of the team. With Williams securing both the drivers and constructors titles in 1996, McLaren managed to lure Newey away though he was forced to take [[Garden leave|gardening leave]] for the 1997 season.\n\n==2000s==\nSince the departure of Newey, Williams often appeared a spent force, able to win occasionally, but unable to mount a consistent challenge. During the dominant Ferrari/Schumacher period from 2000\u201304, Williams managed to finish runner-up in the constructors championship in 2002 and 2003, and 2003 was the closest that one of their drivers, [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], got to the world title.\n\nIn 2004, Head moved to the position of Director of Engineering, as [[Sam Michael]] became Technical Director. After Head's move, Williams's decline continued and following Montoya's win at the [[2004 Brazilian Grand Prix]], they entered a lengthy period without a Grand Prix victory ended by [[Pastor Maldonado]] winning the [[2012 Spanish Grand Prix]].\n\n==2010s==\nIn 2012, Head resigned from his position in the Williams team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/01/04/williams-announces-resignation-of-patrick-head/|title=Williams announces resignation of Patrick Head|last=Joseph|first=Noah|date=4 January 2012|website=autoblog.com|publisher=|access-date=6 September 2018}}</ref> He continued his involvement in Williams Hybrid Power Limited until it was sold to GKN in April 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/10737329/Williams-sells-hybrid-power-unit-to-GKN.html|title=Williams sells hybrid power unit to GKN|last=Clancy|first=Rebecca|date=1 April 2014|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=6 September 2018}}</ref> In 2015, he received a Knighthood for his services to motorsport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12040/9883348/f1-team-williams-designer-patrick-head-gets-knighthood|title=F1 team Williams designer Patrick Head gets knighthood|last=|first=|date=|website=skysports.com|publisher=|access-date=6 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2019, Head returned to [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams Racing]] for the first time in eight years.

Under Italian law the \"responsibility\" for such an accident has to be proved but no action was taken against Head or Williams' Chief Designer [[Adrian Newey]], neither of whom attended the court hearing. The court's findings were made public 13 years after the accident and the case was closed.<ref>[http://www.gazzetta.it/Motori/Formula1/Primo_Piano/2007/04_Aprile/13/senna.shtml gazzetta.it]</ref>\n\nThe Italian Court of Appeal, on 13 April 2007, stated the following in the verdict numbered 15050: \"It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control.\" Even being found responsible for Senna's accident, Head was not arrested because in Italy, the statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.<ref>Hamilton, Maurice (ed.) (1985) Autocourse 1985 \u2013 1986 Hazleton publishing pp.427 {{ISBN|0-905138-38-4}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nMany of the top engineers in Formula One, such as [[Adrian Newey]], [[Neil Oatley]], [[Ross Brawn]], [[Frank Dernie]], [[Paddy Lowe]], [[Eghbal Hamidy]], [[Geoff Willis]] and [[Enrique Scalabroni]] have worked under Head's supervision early in their careers, and all have moved on to senior positions within other teams. Brawn in particular has had success as Head's opposite number at [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[Brawn GP]] and [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]].
