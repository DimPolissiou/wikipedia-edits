Bing therefore disapproves of her actions.

She left HK in the early part of the series to seek help in curing her Stomach Cancer, without informing the family of her whereabouts. Upon returning, Hoi, thinking Choi Yiu was dead, was in a relationship with Auntie Ho's daughter Seung-Seung. She married Hoi eventually, and changed into a loving and caring wife and mother, but died during a bandit attack in Mainland China.

Although her real name is Leung Seung Yin, she is widely remembered in the series as ''the upper-class person'' because of her initial discriminatory view towards less wealthy persons, in addition to commoner cultures and customs that she considered as \"undesirable\" for her and her aristocratic cabals. The attitudes, however, somewhat subsided after the family went broke.\n*'''Ching Wun''' \u5289\u6e05\u82b8- Rich, initially snobbish, and highly educated, Ching Wun's love for Dai Sing was strong enough for her to decide to leave her upper-class life behind to marry Dai Sing, who couldn't provide much for her and their two children.

She therefore falls in love with Lap Sung and marries her, but the marriage was extremely ill-fated and ended up with the death of Rebecca, Sharon's miscarriage and loss of memory, and Lap Sung becoming a cripple. She gets her happy ending eventually though, after regaining her memories, and ends up with a promising young student back in New York (US) named Samson, who is a medical student.\n\n====Auntie Ho family====\n\n*'''Auntie Ho''' \u597d\u59e8(Full name Leung Yun Ho \u6881\u6f64\u597d.

Some women were allegedly picked up by the policemen on the launches, taken to the nearest police station, gang-raped for days and then released.  People who took boats into the river to save the drowning women were fired on by the police. Police continued attacking people who braved the action and took multiple boat trips back and forth to get the necessities. This ultimately resulted in a confrontation between refugees armed with crude implements like bows and arrows, lathis, bricks and stones, on one hand, and the police on the other.

In 1826, it was designated as the 26th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. In 1856, it was dispatched to [[Persia]], where it took part in the [[Battle of Kooshab]] during the [[Anglo-Persian War]] of 1856-57.  In 1891,  the regiment was localized to the Province of [[Baluchistan]] and reconstituted with [[Baloch people|Balochis]], [[Brahui people|Brahuis]], [[Pashtun people|Pathan]]s and Punjabi Muslims. It adopted uniforms of drab colour with red trousers and its designation was changed to 26th (Baluchistan) Regiment of Bombay Infantry. In 1900 it was sent to [[China]] to suppress the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In 1901, the regiment's designation was changed to 26th Baluchistan Infantry.<ref name=\"Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin 1998\">Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (1998).

Consequently, the regiment's designation was changed to 126th Baluchistan Infantry and it was delocalized from Baluchistan. On the outbreak of the [[First World War]], the regiment was sent to [[Aden]], where it remained during the war except for brief stays in [[First Suez Offensive|Egypt]] in 1915 and [[Mesopotamian Campaign|Mesopotamia]] in 1917.<ref name=\"Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin 1998\"/>[[File:26th (Baluchistan) Regiment, Bombay Infantry 1897.jpg|thumb|right|26th (Baluchistan) Regiment, Bombay Infantry, 1897.|320px]]\n\n==Subsequent History==\nIn 1922, the regiment was grouped with five other Baluch battalions: 1st & 2nd Battalions of [[124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry]], [[127th Baluch Light Infantry|127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry]], [[129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis]] and the [[130th King George's Own Baluchis (Jacob's Rifles)]], to form the 10th Baluch Regiment. The 126th Baluchistan Infantry was redesignated as the 2nd Battalion of the new regiment.<ref name=\"Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin 1998\"/> During the [[Second World War]], 2/10th Baluch fought with great gallantry in the [[Malayan Campaign]]. The battalion was taken prisoner by the Japanese on [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore Island]] after the surrender of British forces on 15 February 1942. It suffered a total of 1596 casualties in the war and during the Japanese captivity. The battalion won distinction for resisting intense enemy pressure to join the Japanese-sponsored [[Indian National Army]]. Prominent among them was Lieutenant [[Abrar Hussain (general)|Abrar Hussain]], who was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for his heroic conduct whilst a Prisoner of War.

Because of this, only very small amounts of catalyst are required to alter the reaction rate in most cases.<ref>[http://www.anl.gov/articles/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-catalysis 7 things you may not know about catalysis] Louise Lerner, [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (2011)</ref>\n\nIn general, chemical reactions occur faster in the presence of a catalyst because the catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower [[activation energy]] than the non-catalyzed mechanism. In catalyzed mechanisms, the catalyst usually reacts to form a temporary [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]], which then regenerates the original catalyst in a cyclic process. A substance which provides a mechanism with a higher activation energy does not decrease the rate because the reaction can still occur by the non-catalyzed route.<ref name=LM82/> An added substance which does reduce the reaction rate is not considered a catalyst<ref name=\"IUPACc\"/> but a [[reaction inhibitor]] ([[#Inhibitors, poisons, and promoters|see below]]).\n\nCatalysts may be classified as either [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous or heterogeneous]].  A homogeneous catalyst is one whose [[molecule]]s are dispersed in the same phase (usually gaseous or liquid) as the [[reactant]]'s molecules. A heterogeneous catalyst is one whose molecules are not in the same phase as the reactant's, which are typically gases or liquids that are [[adsorption|adsorbed]] onto the surface of the solid catalyst. [[Enzyme]]s and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category.\n\n==Technical perspective==\n\nIn the presence of a catalyst, less [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is required to reach the [[transition state]], but the total free energy from reactants to products does not change.<ref name=\"IUPACc\" /> A catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations. The effect of a catalyst may vary due to the presence of other substances known as inhibitors or [[Catalyst poisoning|poisons]] (which reduce the catalytic activity) or promoters (which increase the activity and also affect the temperature of the reaction).<ref name=\"IUPACc\" />\n\nCatalyzed reactions have a lower [[activation energy]] (rate-limiting free energy of activation) than the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in a higher reaction rate at the same temperature and for the same reactant [[concentration]]s. However, the detailed mechanics of catalysis is complex. Catalysts may bind to the reagents to polarize bonds, e.g. [[acid catalyst]]s for reactions of [[carbonyl]] compounds, or form specific intermediates that are not produced naturally, such as osmate [[ester]]s in [[osmium tetroxide]]-catalyzed [[dihydroxylation]] of [[alkene]]s, or cause [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of reagents to reactive forms, such as [[chemisorption|chemisorbed hydrogen]] in [[catalytic hydrogenation]].\n\n[[Chemical kinetics|Kinetically]], catalytic reactions are typical [[chemical reaction]]s; i.e. the reaction rate depends on the frequency of contact of the reactants in the rate-determining step.  Usually, the catalyst participates in this slowest step, and rates are limited by amount of catalyst and its \"activity\".  In [[heterogeneous catalysis]], the diffusion of reagents to the surface and diffusion of products from the surface can be rate determining. A [[nanomaterial-based catalyst]] is an example of a heterogeneous catalyst. Analogous events associated with [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] binding and product dissociation apply to homogeneous catalysts.\n\nAlthough catalysts are not consumed by the reaction itself, they may be inhibited, deactivated, or destroyed by secondary processes.  In [[heterogeneous]] catalysis, typical secondary processes include [[coking]] where the catalyst becomes covered by [[polymer]]ic side products.  Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid\u2013liquid system or sublimate in a solid\u2013gas system.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe production of most industrially important chemicals involves catalysis. Similarly, most biochemically significant processes are catalysed.  Research into catalysis is a major field in [[applied science]] and involves many areas of chemistry, notably [[organometallic chemistry]] and [[materials science]].  Catalysis is relevant to many aspects of [[environmental science]], e.g. the [[catalytic converter]] in automobiles and the dynamics of the [[ozone hole]]. Catalytic reactions are preferred in environmentally friendly [[green chemistry]] due to the reduced amount of waste generated,<ref>{{cite web | title=The 12 Principles of Green Chemistry | work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | url=http://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/june2011/principles.htm | accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> as opposed to [[stoichiometric]] reactions in which all reactants are consumed and more side products are formed. Many [[transition metal]]s and transition metal [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are used in catalysis as well. Catalysts called [[enzyme]]s are important in [[biology]].\n\nA catalyst works by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the reaction product. The rate of the reaction is increased as this alternative route has a lower [[activation energy]] than the reaction route not mediated by the catalyst. The [[disproportionation]] of [[hydrogen peroxide]] creates water and [[oxygen]], as shown below.\n:2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>  \u2192   2 H<sub>2</sub>O  +  O<sub>2</sub>\nThis reaction is preferable in the sense that the reaction products are more stable than the starting material, though the uncatalysed reaction is slow. In fact, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is so slow that hydrogen peroxide solutions are commercially available. This reaction is strongly affected by catalysts such as [[manganese dioxide]], or the enzyme [[peroxidase]] in organisms. Upon the addition of a small amount of [[manganese dioxide]], the hydrogen peroxide reacts rapidly. This effect is readily seen by the [[Effervescence (chemistry)|effervescence]] of oxygen.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |title=Genie in a Bottle |url=http://www.chem.umn.edu/services/lecturedemo/info/genie.htm |date=2005-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405195443/http://www.chem.umn.edu/services/lecturedemo/info/genie.htm |archivedate=2008-04-05 }}</ref> The manganese dioxide is not consumed in the reaction, and thus may be recovered unchanged, and re-used indefinitely.

Catalytic activity is not a kind of reaction rate, but a property of the [[catalyst]] under certain conditions, in relation to a specific [[chemical reaction]]. Catalytic activity of one katal (Symbol 1 kat = 1&nbsp;mol/s) of a catalyst means one mole of that catalyst (substance, in [[Mole (unit)|Mol]]) will catalyse 1 mole of the reactant to product in one second. A catalyst may and usually will have different catalytic activity for distinct reactions. See [[katal]] for an example.\n\nThere are further derived SI units related to catalytic activity, see the above reference for details.\n\n===Typical mechanism===\n{{Main|catalytic cycle}}\n\nCatalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form [[reaction intermediate|intermediates]] that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process regenerating the catalyst. The following is a typical reaction scheme, where '''''C''''' represents the catalyst, X and Y are reactants, and Z is the product of the reaction of X and Y:\n{{NumBlk|:|X + '''''C''''' \u2192 X'''''C'''''   |{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|Y + X'''''C''''' \u2192 XY'''''C''''' |{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|XY'''''C''''' \u2192 '''''C'''''Z     |{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|'''''C'''''Z \u2192 '''''C''''' + Z   |{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nAlthough the catalyst is consumed by reaction {{EquationNote|1}}, it is subsequently produced by reaction {{EquationNote|4}}, so it does not occur in the overall reaction equation:\n:X + Y \u2192 Z\nAs a catalyst is regenerated in a reaction, often only small amounts are needed to increase the rate of the reaction. In practice, however, catalysts are sometimes consumed in secondary processes.\n\nThe catalyst does usually appear in the [[rate equation]]. For example, if the [[rate-determining step]] in the above reaction scheme is the first step <br />  X + C \u2192 XC, the catalyzed reaction will be [[Order of reaction|second order]] with rate equation v = k<sub>cat</sub>[X] [C], which is proportional to the catalyst concentration [C]. However [C] remains constant during the reaction so that the catalyzed reaction is [[Order of reaction#Pseudo-first order|pseudo-first order]]:\nv = k<sub>obs</sub>[X],   where k<sub>obs</sub> = k<sub>cat</sub>[C].\n\nAs an example of a detailed mechanism at the microscopic level, in 2008 Danish researchers first revealed the sequence of events when [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] combine on the surface of [[titanium dioxide]] (TiO<sub>2</sub>, or ''titania'') to produce water.  With a time-lapse series of [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] images, they determined the molecules undergo [[adsorption]], [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[diffusion]] before reacting.  The intermediate reaction states were: HO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, then H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the final reaction product ([[Water dimer|water molecule dimers]]), after which the water molecule [[desorption|desorbs]] from the catalyst surface.<ref>{{cite news\n| first = Mitch\n| last = Jacoby\n| date = 16 February 2009\n| title = Making Water Step by Step\n| newspaper = [[Chemical & Engineering News]]\n| page = 10\n| url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/87/i07/8707notw6.html\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n| vauthors = Matthiesen J, Wendt S, Hansen J\u00d8, Madsen GK, Lira E, Galliker P, Vestergaard EK, Schaub R, Laegsgaard E, Hammer B, Besenbacher F\n| year = 2009\n| title = Observation of All the Intermediate Steps of a Chemical Reaction on an Oxide Surface by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy\n| journal = [[ACS Nano]]\n| volume = 3\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 517\u201326\n| issn = 1520-605X\n| doi = 10.1021/nn8008245\n| pmid = 19309169\n| citeseerx = 10.1.1.711.974\n}}</ref>\n\n===Reaction energetics===\n\n[[Image:CatalysisScheme.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in a hypothetical exothermic chemical reaction X + Y to give Z. The presence of the catalyst opens a different reaction pathway (shown in red) with a lower activation energy. The final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same.]]\nCatalysts work by providing an (alternative) mechanism involving a different [[transition state]] and lower [[activation energy]]. Consequently,  more molecular collisions have the energy needed to reach the transition state. Hence, catalysts can enable reactions that would otherwise be blocked or slowed by a kinetic barrier.  The catalyst may increase reaction rate or selectivity, or enable the reaction at lower temperatures. This effect can be illustrated with an [[Energy profile (chemistry)|energy profile]] diagram.\n\nIn the catalyzed [[elementary reaction]], catalysts do '''not''' change the extent of a reaction: they have '''no''' effect on the [[chemical equilibrium]] of a reaction because the rate of both the forward and the reverse reaction are both affected (see also [[thermodynamics]]).  The [[second law of thermodynamics]] describes why a catalyst does not change the chemical equilibrium of a reaction.  Suppose there was such a catalyst that shifted an equilibrium. Introducing the catalyst to the system would result in a reaction to move to the new equilibrium, producing energy. Production of energy is a necessary result since reactions are spontaneous only if [[Gibbs free energy]] is produced, and if there is no energy barrier, there is no need for a catalyst. Then, removing the catalyst would also result in reaction, producing energy; i.e. the addition and its reverse process, removal, would both produce energy. Thus, a catalyst that could change the equilibrium would be a [[perpetual motion machine]], a contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics.<ref>Robertson, A.J.B. (1970) ''Catalysis of Gas Reactions by Metals''. Logos Press, London.</ref> Thus, catalyst '''does not''' alter the equilibrium constant. (A catalyst can however change the equilibrium concentrations by reacting in a subsequent step. It is then consumed as the reaction proceeds, and thus it is also a reactant. Illustrative is the base-catalysed [[hydrolysis]] of [[ester]]s, where the produced [[carboxylic acid]] immediately reacts with the base catalyst and thus the reaction equilibrium is shifted towards hydrolysis.)\n\nThe [[SI derived unit]] for measuring the '''catalytic activity''' of a catalyst is the [[katal]], which is moles per second. The productivity of a catalyst can be described by the [[turnover number]] (or TON) and the catalytic activity by the ''turn over frequency'' (TOF), which is the TON per time unit. The biochemical equivalent is the [[enzyme unit]].  For more information on the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis, see the article on ''[[Enzyme#Kinetics|enzymes]]''.\n\nThe catalyst stabilizes the transition state more than it stabilizes the starting material.  It decreases the kinetic barrier by decreasing the ''difference'' in energy between starting material and transition state. It '''does not''' change the energy difference between starting materials and products (thermodynamic barrier), or the available energy (this is provided by the environment as heat or light).\n\n===Materials===\n\nThe chemical nature of catalysts is as diverse as catalysis itself, although some generalizations can be made.  Proton [[acid]]s are probably the most widely used catalysts, especially for the many reactions involving water, including hydrolysis and its reverse.  Multifunctional solids often are catalytically active, e.g. [[zeolite]]s, [[alumina]], higher-order oxides, graphitic carbon, nanoparticles, nanodots, and facets of bulk materials.  [[Transition metals]] are often used to catalyze [[redox]] reactions (oxidation, hydrogenation). Examples are [[nickel]], such as [[Raney nickel]] for hydrogenation, and [[vanadium(V) oxide]] for oxidation of [[sulfur dioxide]] into [[sulfur trioxide]] by the so-called [[contact process]].  Many catalytic processes, especially those used in organic synthesis, require \"late transition metals\", such as [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[gold]], [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]], or [[iridium]].\n\nSome so-called catalysts are really '''precatalysts'''.  Precatalysts convert to catalysts in the reaction. For example, [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> loses one triphenylphosphine ligand before entering the true catalytic cycle. Precatalysts are easier to store but are easily activated [[in situ#Chemistry and chemical engineering|in situ]]. Because of this preactivation step, many catalytic reactions involve an [[induction period]].\n\nChemical species that improve catalytic activity are called '''co-catalysts''' ('''cocatalysts''') or '''promoters''' in '''cooperative catalysis'''.\n\n==Types==\n\nCatalysts can be [[heterogeneous]] or [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogeneous]], depending on whether a catalyst exists in the same [[phase (matter)|phase]] as the [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. [[Biocatalysts]] (enzymes) are often seen as a separate group.\n\n===Heterogeneous catalysts===\n{{Main|Heterogeneous catalysis}}\n\n[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|right|The microporous molecular structure of the [[zeolite]] ZSM-5 is exploited in catalysts used in refineries]]\n[[File:Ceolite nax.JPG|thumb|Zeolites are extruded as pellets for easy handling in catalytic reactors.]]\nHeterogeneous catalysts act in a different [[phase (matter)|phase]] than the [[reactants]]. Most heterogeneous catalysts are [[solid]]s that act on substrates in a [[liquid]] or gaseous [[reaction mixture]]. Diverse mechanisms for [[reactions on surfaces]] are known, depending on how the adsorption takes place ([[Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson|Langmuir-Hinshelwood]], [[Eley\u2013Rideal mechanism|Eley-Rideal]], and Mars-[[Dirk Willem van Krevelen|van Krevelen]]).<ref>Kn\u00f6zinger, Helmut and Kochloefl, Karl (2002) \"Heterogeneous Catalysis and Solid Catalysts\" in Ullmann's ''Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_313}}</ref> The total surface area of solid has an important effect on the reaction rate. The smaller the catalyst particle size, the larger the surface area for a given mass of particles.\n\nA heterogeneous catalyst has '''active sites''', which are the atoms or crystal faces where the reaction actually occurs. Depending on the mechanism, the active site may be either a planar exposed metal surface, a crystal edge with imperfect metal valence or a complicated combination of the two. Thus, not only most of the volume, but also most of the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst may be catalytically inactive. Finding out the nature of the active site requires technically challenging research. Thus, empirical research for finding out new metal combinations for catalysis continues.\n\nFor example, in the [[Haber process]], finely divided [[iron]] serves as a catalyst for the synthesis of [[ammonia]] from [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]]. The reacting [[gas]]es [[adsorb]] onto active sites on the iron particles. Once physically adsorbed, the reagents undergo [[chemisorption]] that results in dissociation into adsorbed atomic species, and new bonds between the resulting fragments form in part due to their close proximity. In this way the particularly strong [[triple bond]] in nitrogen is broken, which would be extremely uncommon in the gas phase due to its high activation energy. Thus, the activation energy of the overall reaction is lowered, and the rate of reaction increases.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Another place where a heterogeneous catalyst is applied is in the oxidation of sulfur dioxide on [[vanadium(V) oxide]] for the production of [[sulfuric acid]].\n\nHeterogeneous catalysts are typically \"[[catalyst support|supported]],\" which means that the catalyst is dispersed on a second material that enhances the effectiveness or minimizes their cost. Supports prevent or reduce agglomeration and sintering small catalyst particles, exposing more surface area, thus catalysts have a higher specific activity (per gram) on a support. Sometimes the support is merely a surface on which the catalyst is spread to increase the surface area. More often, the support and the catalyst interact, affecting the catalytic reaction. Supports can also be used in nanoparticle synthesis by providing sites for individual molecules of catalyst to chemically bind. Supports are porous materials with a high surface area, most commonly [[alumina]], [[zeolites]] or various kinds of [[activated carbon]]. Specialized supports include [[silicon dioxide]], [[titanium dioxide]], [[calcium carbonate]], and [[barium sulfate]].\n\n====Electrocatalysts====\n{{Main|Electrocatalyst}}\n\nIn the context of [[electrochemistry]], specifically in [[fuel cell]] engineering, various metal-containing catalysts are used to enhance the rates of the [[half reaction]]s that comprise the fuel cell. One common type of fuel cell electrocatalyst is based upon [[nanoparticles]] of [[platinum]] that are supported on slightly larger [[carbon]] particles. When in contact with one of the [[electrodes]] in a fuel cell, this platinum increases the rate of [[oxygen]] reduction either to water, or to [[hydroxide]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]].\n\n===Homogeneous catalysts===\n{{Main|Homogeneous catalysis}}\n\nHomogeneous catalysts function in the same phase as the reactants, but the mechanistic principles involved in heterogeneous catalysis are generally applicable. Typically homogeneous catalysts are dissolved in a solvent with the substrates.  One example of homogeneous catalysis involves the influence of [[hydrogen|H]]<sup>+</sup> on the [[esterification]] of carboxylic acids, such as the formation of [[methyl acetate]] from [[acetic acid]] and [[methanol]].<ref>Behr, Arno (2002) \"Organometallic Compounds and Homogeneous Catalysis\" in Ullmann's ''Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_215}}</ref> One high-volume process requiring a homogeneous catalyst is [[hydroformylation]], which adds [[carbon monoxide]] to an [[alkene]] to produce an alkyl [[aldehyde]]. The aldehyde can be converted to various products such as alcohols or acids (for e.g. detergents) or [[polyol]]s (for plastics such as [[polycarbonate]] or [[polyurethane]]). For inorganic chemists, homogeneous catalysis is often synonymous with [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic catalysts]].<ref>Elschenbroich, C. (2006) ''Organometallics''. Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{ISBN|978-3-527-29390-2}}</ref>\n\n====Organocatalysis====\n{{Main|Organocatalysis}}\n\nWhereas transition metals sometimes attract most of the attention in the study of catalysis, small organic molecules without metals can also exhibit catalytic properties, as is apparent from the fact that many [[enzyme]]s lack transition metals.  Typically, organic catalysts require a higher loading (amount of catalyst per unit amount of reactant, expressed in [[mol%]] [[amount of substance]]) than transition metal(-ion)-based catalysts, but these catalysts are usually commercially available in bulk, helping to reduce costs.  In the early 2000s, these organocatalysts were considered \"new generation\" and are competitive to traditional [[metal]](-ion)-containing catalysts.  Organocatalysts are supposed to operate akin to metal-free enzymes utilizing, e.g., non-covalent interactions such as [[hydrogen bonding]]. The discipline organocatalysis is divided in the application of covalent (e.g., [[proline]], [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine|DMAP]]) and non-covalent (e.g., [[thiourea organocatalysis]]) organocatalysts referring to the preferred catalyst-[[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] [[binding (molecular)|binding]] and interaction, respectively.\n\n===Photocatalysts===\n\n[[Photocatalysis]] is the phenomenon where the catalyst can receive light (such as visible light), be promoted to an excited state, and then undergo [[intersystem crossing]] with the starting material, returning to ground state without being consumed. The excited state of the starting material will then undergo reactions it ordinarily could not if directly illuminated. For example, [[singlet oxygen]] is usually produced by photocatalysis. Photocatalysts are also the main ingredient in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s.\n\n===Enzymes and biocatalysts===\n{{Main|enzyme catalysis}}\n\nIn biology, [[enzyme]]s are protein-based catalysts in [[metabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. Most biocatalysts are enzymes, but other non-protein-based classes of biomolecules also exhibit catalytic properties including [[ribozyme]]s, and synthetic [[deoxyribozyme]]s.<ref>Nelson, D.L. and Cox, M.M. (2000) ''Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry'' 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.</ref>\n\nBiocatalysts can be thought of as intermediate between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, although strictly speaking soluble enzymes are homogeneous catalysts and [[Biological membrane|membrane]]-bound enzymes are heterogeneous. Several factors affect the activity of enzymes (and other catalysts) including temperature, pH, concentration of enzyme, substrate, and products.  A particularly important reagent in enzymatic reactions is water, which is the product of many bond-forming reactions and a reactant in many bond-breaking processes.\n\nIn [[biocatalysis]], enzymes are employed to prepare many commodity chemicals including [[high-fructose corn syrup]] and [[acrylamide]].\n\nSome [[monoclonal antibodies]] whose binding target is a stable molecule which resembles the transition state of a chemical reaction can function as weak catalysts for that chemical reaction by lowering its activation energy.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044547/http://www.documentroot.com/2010/03/catalytic-antibodies-simply-explained.html Catalytic Antibodies Simply Explained].

The simplest example of autocatalysis is a reaction of type A + B \u2192 2 B, in one or in several steps. The overall reaction is just A \u2192 B, so that B is a product. But since B is also a reactant, it may be present in the rate equation and affect the reaction rate. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of B increases and can accelerate the reaction as a catalyst. In effect, the reaction accelerates itself or is autocatalyzed.\n\nA real example is the hydrolysis of an [[ester]] such as [[aspirin]] to a [[carboxylic acid]] and an [[alcohol]]. In the absence of added acid catalysts, the carboxylic acid product catalyzes the hydrolysis.\n\n==Significance==\n\n[[File:Verbrennung eines Zuckerw\u00fcrfels.png|thumb|Left: Partially caramelised [[cube sugar]], Right: burning cube sugar with ash as catalyst]]\n[[File:TiCrPt micropump3.webm|thumb|A Ti-Cr-Pt tube (~40 \u03bcm long) releases oxygen bubbles when immersed in [[hydrogen peroxide]] (via catalytic decomposition), forming a [[micropump]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C1CP20542K|pmid=21505711|url= http://nanomem.fudan.edu.cn/79solovev2011.pdf |title=Tunable catalytic tubular micro-pumps operating at low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=21|pages=10131\u201335|year=2011|last1=Solovev|first1=Alexander A.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Samuel|last3=Mei|first3=Yongfeng|last4=Schmidt|first4=Oliver G.|bibcode=2011PCCP...1310131S}}</ref>]]\n\nEstimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.<ref>\"Recognizing the Best in Innovation: Breakthrough Catalyst\".

Another mechanism is the modification of surface geometry. For instance, in hydrogenation operations, large planes of metal surface function as sites of [[hydrogenolysis]] catalysis while sites catalyzing [[hydrogenation]] of unsaturates are smaller. Thus, a poison that covers surface randomly will tend to reduce the number of uncontaminated large planes but leave proportionally more smaller sites free, thus changing the hydrogenation vs. hydrogenolysis selectivity. Many other mechanisms are also possible.\n\nPromoters can cover up surface to prevent production of a mat of coke, or even actively remove such material (e.g., rhenium on platinum in [[catalytic reforming|platforming]]). They can aid the dispersion of the catalytic material or bind to reagents.\n\n==Current market==\n\nThe global demand for catalysts in 2010 was estimated at approximately US$29.5 billion.

Because of this, only very small amounts of catalyst are required to alter the reaction rate in most cases.<ref>[http://www.anl.gov/articles/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-catalysis 7 things you may not know about catalysis] Louise Lerner, [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (2011)</ref>\n\nIn general, chemical reactions occur faster in the presence of a catalyst because the catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower [[activation energy]] than the non-catalyzed mechanism. In catalyzed mechanisms, the catalyst usually reacts to form a temporary [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]], which then regenerates the original catalyst in a cyclic process. A substance which provides a mechanism with a higher activation energy does not decrease the rate because the reaction can still occur by the non-catalyzed route.<ref name=LM82/> An added substance which does reduce the reaction rate is not considered a catalyst<ref name=\"IUPACc\"/> but a [[reaction inhibitor]] ([[#Inhibitors, poisons, and promoters|see below]]).\n\nCatalysts may be classified as either [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous or heterogeneous]].  A homogeneous catalyst is one whose [[molecule]]s are dispersed in the same phase (usually gaseous or liquid) as the [[reactant]]'s molecules. A heterogeneous catalyst is one whose molecules are not in the same phase as the reactant's, which are typically gases or liquids that are [[adsorption|adsorbed]] onto the surface of the solid catalyst. [[Enzyme]]s and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category.\n\n==Technical perspective==\n\nIn the presence of a catalyst, less [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is required to reach the [[transition state]], but the total free energy from reactants to products does not change.<ref name=\"IUPACc\" /> A catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations. The effect of a catalyst may vary due to the presence of other substances known as inhibitors or [[Catalyst poisoning|poisons]] (which reduce the catalytic activity) or promoters (which increase the activity and also affect the temperature of the reaction).<ref name=\"IUPACc\" />\n\nCatalyzed reactions have a lower [[activation energy]] (rate-limiting free energy of activation) than the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in a higher reaction rate at the same temperature and for the same reactant [[concentration]]s. However, the detailed mechanics of catalysis is complex. Catalysts may bind to the reagents to polarize bonds, e.g. [[acid catalyst]]s for reactions of [[carbonyl]] compounds, or form specific intermediates that are not produced naturally, such as osmate [[ester]]s in [[osmium tetroxide]]-catalyzed [[dihydroxylation]] of [[alkene]]s, or cause [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of reagents to reactive forms, such as [[chemisorption|chemisorbed hydrogen]] in [[catalytic hydrogenation]].\n\n[[Chemical kinetics|Kinetically]], catalytic reactions are typical [[chemical reaction]]s; i.e. the reaction rate depends on the frequency of contact of the reactants in the rate-determining step.  Usually, the catalyst participates in this slowest step, and rates are limited by amount of catalyst and its \"activity\".  In [[heterogeneous catalysis]], the diffusion of reagents to the surface and diffusion of products from the surface can be rate determining. A [[nanomaterial-based catalyst]] is an example of a heterogeneous catalyst. Analogous events associated with [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] binding and product dissociation apply to homogeneous catalysts.\n\nAlthough catalysts are not consumed by the reaction itself, they may be inhibited, deactivated, or destroyed by secondary processes.  In [[heterogeneous]] catalysis, typical secondary processes include [[coking]] where the catalyst becomes covered by [[polymer]]ic side products.  Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid\u2013liquid system or sublimate in a solid\u2013gas system.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe production of most industrially important chemicals involves catalysis. Similarly, most biochemically significant processes are catalysed.  Research into catalysis is a major field in [[applied science]] and involves many areas of chemistry, notably [[organometallic chemistry]] and [[materials science]].  Catalysis is relevant to many aspects of [[environmental science]], e.g. the [[catalytic converter]] in automobiles and the dynamics of the [[ozone hole]]. Catalytic reactions are preferred in environmentally friendly [[green chemistry]] due to the reduced amount of waste generated,<ref>{{cite web | title=The 12 Principles of Green Chemistry | work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | url=http://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/june2011/principles.htm | accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> as opposed to [[stoichiometric]] reactions in which all reactants are consumed and more side products are formed. Many [[transition metal]]s and transition metal [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are used in catalysis as well. Catalysts called [[enzyme]]s are important in [[biology]].\n\nA catalyst works by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the reaction product. The rate of the reaction is increased as this alternative route has a lower [[activation energy]] than the reaction route not mediated by the catalyst. The [[disproportionation]] of [[hydrogen peroxide]] creates water and [[oxygen]], as shown below.\n:2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>  \u2192   2 H<sub>2</sub>O  +  O<sub>2</sub>\nThis reaction is preferable in the sense that the reaction products are more stable than the starting material, though the uncatalysed reaction is slow. In fact, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is so slow that hydrogen peroxide solutions are commercially available. This reaction is strongly affected by catalysts such as [[manganese dioxide]], or the enzyme [[peroxidase]] in organisms. Upon the addition of a small amount of [[manganese dioxide]], the hydrogen peroxide reacts rapidly. This effect is readily seen by the [[Effervescence (chemistry)|effervescence]] of oxygen.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |title=Genie in a Bottle |url=http://www.chem.umn.edu/services/lecturedemo/info/genie.htm |date=2005-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405195443/http://www.chem.umn.edu/services/lecturedemo/info/genie.htm |archivedate=2008-04-05 }}</ref> The manganese dioxide is not consumed in the reaction, and thus may be recovered unchanged, and re-used indefinitely.

Catalytic activity is not a kind of reaction rate, but a property of the [[catalyst]] under certain conditions, in relation to a specific [[chemical reaction]]. Catalytic activity of one katal (Symbol 1 kat = 1&nbsp;mol/s) of a catalyst means one mole of that catalyst (substance, in [[Mole (unit)|Mol]]) will catalyse 1 mole of the reactant to product in one second. A catalyst may and usually will have different catalytic activity for distinct reactions. See [[katal]] for an example.\n\nThere are further derived SI units related to catalytic activity, see the above reference for details.\n\n===Typical mechanism===\n{{Main|catalytic cycle}}\n\nCatalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form [[reaction intermediate|intermediates]] that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process regenerating the catalyst. The following is a typical reaction scheme, where '''''C''''' represents the catalyst, X and Y are reactants, and Z is the product of the reaction of X and Y:\n{{NumBlk|:|X + '''''C''''' \u2192 X'''''C'''''   |{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|Y + X'''''C''''' \u2192 XY'''''C''''' |{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|XY'''''C''''' \u2192 '''''C'''''Z     |{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|'''''C'''''Z \u2192 '''''C''''' + Z   |{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nAlthough the catalyst is consumed by reaction {{EquationNote|1}}, it is subsequently produced by reaction {{EquationNote|4}}, so it does not occur in the overall reaction equation:\n:X + Y \u2192 Z\nAs a catalyst is regenerated in a reaction, often only small amounts are needed to increase the rate of the reaction. In practice, however, catalysts are sometimes consumed in secondary processes.\n\nThe catalyst does usually appear in the [[rate equation]]. For example, if the [[rate-determining step]] in the above reaction scheme is the first step <br />  X + C \u2192 XC, the catalyzed reaction will be [[Order of reaction|second order]] with rate equation v = k<sub>cat</sub>[X] [C], which is proportional to the catalyst concentration [C]. However [C] remains constant during the reaction so that the catalyzed reaction is [[Order of reaction#Pseudo-first order|pseudo-first order]]:\nv = k<sub>obs</sub>[X],   where k<sub>obs</sub> = k<sub>cat</sub>[C].\n\nAs an example of a detailed mechanism at the microscopic level, in 2008 Danish researchers first revealed the sequence of events when [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] combine on the surface of [[titanium dioxide]] (TiO<sub>2</sub>, or ''titania'') to produce water.  With a time-lapse series of [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] images, they determined the molecules undergo [[adsorption]], [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[diffusion]] before reacting.  The intermediate reaction states were: HO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, then H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the final reaction product ([[Water dimer|water molecule dimers]]), after which the water molecule [[desorption|desorbs]] from the catalyst surface.<ref>{{cite news\n| first = Mitch\n| last = Jacoby\n| date = 16 February 2009\n| title = Making Water Step by Step\n| newspaper = [[Chemical & Engineering News]]\n| page = 10\n| url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/87/i07/8707notw6.html\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n| vauthors = Matthiesen J, Wendt S, Hansen J\u00d8, Madsen GK, Lira E, Galliker P, Vestergaard EK, Schaub R, Laegsgaard E, Hammer B, Besenbacher F\n| year = 2009\n| title = Observation of All the Intermediate Steps of a Chemical Reaction on an Oxide Surface by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy\n| journal = [[ACS Nano]]\n| volume = 3\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 517\u201326\n| issn = 1520-605X\n| doi = 10.1021/nn8008245\n| pmid = 19309169\n| citeseerx = 10.1.1.711.974\n}}</ref>\n\n===Reaction energetics===\n\n[[Image:CatalysisScheme.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in a hypothetical exothermic chemical reaction X + Y to give Z. The presence of the catalyst opens a different reaction pathway (shown in red) with a lower activation energy. The final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same.]]\nCatalysts work by providing an (alternative) mechanism involving a different [[transition state]] and lower [[activation energy]]. Consequently,  more molecular collisions have the energy needed to reach the transition state. Hence, catalysts can enable reactions that would otherwise be blocked or slowed by a kinetic barrier.  The catalyst may increase reaction rate or selectivity, or enable the reaction at lower temperatures. This effect can be illustrated with an [[Energy profile (chemistry)|energy profile]] diagram.\n\nIn the catalyzed [[elementary reaction]], catalysts do '''not''' change the extent of a reaction: they have '''no''' effect on the [[chemical equilibrium]] of a reaction because the rate of both the forward and the reverse reaction are both affected (see also [[thermodynamics]]).  The [[second law of thermodynamics]] describes why a catalyst does not change the chemical equilibrium of a reaction.  Suppose there was such a catalyst that shifted an equilibrium. Introducing the catalyst to the system would result in a reaction to move to the new equilibrium, producing energy. Production of energy is a necessary result since reactions are spontaneous only if [[Gibbs free energy]] is produced, and if there is no energy barrier, there is no need for a catalyst. Then, removing the catalyst would also result in reaction, producing energy; i.e. the addition and its reverse process, removal, would both produce energy. Thus, a catalyst that could change the equilibrium would be a [[perpetual motion machine]], a contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics.<ref>Robertson, A.J.B. (1970) ''Catalysis of Gas Reactions by Metals''. Logos Press, London.</ref> Thus, catalyst '''does not''' alter the equilibrium constant. (A catalyst can however change the equilibrium concentrations by reacting in a subsequent step. It is then consumed as the reaction proceeds, and thus it is also a reactant. Illustrative is the base-catalysed [[hydrolysis]] of [[ester]]s, where the produced [[carboxylic acid]] immediately reacts with the base catalyst and thus the reaction equilibrium is shifted towards hydrolysis.)\n\nThe [[SI derived unit]] for measuring the '''catalytic activity''' of a catalyst is the [[katal]], which is moles per second. The productivity of a catalyst can be described by the [[turnover number]] (or TON) and the catalytic activity by the ''turn over frequency'' (TOF), which is the TON per time unit. The biochemical equivalent is the [[enzyme unit]].  For more information on the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis, see the article on ''[[Enzyme#Kinetics|enzymes]]''.\n\nThe catalyst stabilizes the transition state more than it stabilizes the starting material.  It decreases the kinetic barrier by decreasing the ''difference'' in energy between starting material and transition state. It '''does not''' change the energy difference between starting materials and products (thermodynamic barrier), or the available energy (this is provided by the environment as heat or light).\n\n===Materials===\n\nThe chemical nature of catalysts is as diverse as catalysis itself, although some generalizations can be made.  Proton [[acid]]s are probably the most widely used catalysts, especially for the many reactions involving water, including hydrolysis and its reverse.  Multifunctional solids often are catalytically active, e.g. [[zeolite]]s, [[alumina]], higher-order oxides, graphitic carbon, nanoparticles, nanodots, and facets of bulk materials.  [[Transition metals]] are often used to catalyze [[redox]] reactions (oxidation, hydrogenation). Examples are [[nickel]], such as [[Raney nickel]] for hydrogenation, and [[vanadium(V) oxide]] for oxidation of [[sulfur dioxide]] into [[sulfur trioxide]] by the so-called [[contact process]].  Many catalytic processes, especially those used in organic synthesis, require \"late transition metals\", such as [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[gold]], [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]], or [[iridium]].\n\nSome so-called catalysts are really '''precatalysts'''.  Precatalysts convert to catalysts in the reaction. For example, [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> loses one triphenylphosphine ligand before entering the true catalytic cycle. Precatalysts are easier to store but are easily activated [[in situ#Chemistry and chemical engineering|in situ]]. Because of this preactivation step, many catalytic reactions involve an [[induction period]].\n\nChemical species that improve catalytic activity are called '''co-catalysts''' ('''cocatalysts''') or '''promoters''' in '''cooperative catalysis'''.\n\n==Types==\n\nCatalysts can be [[heterogeneous]] or [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogeneous]], depending on whether a catalyst exists in the same [[phase (matter)|phase]] as the [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. [[Biocatalysts]] (enzymes) are often seen as a separate group.\n\n===Heterogeneous catalysts===\n{{Main|Heterogeneous catalysis}}\n\n[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|right|The microporous molecular structure of the [[zeolite]] ZSM-5 is exploited in catalysts used in refineries]]\n[[File:Ceolite nax.JPG|thumb|Zeolites are extruded as pellets for easy handling in catalytic reactors.]]\nHeterogeneous catalysts act in a different [[phase (matter)|phase]] than the [[reactants]]. Most heterogeneous catalysts are [[solid]]s that act on substrates in a [[liquid]] or gaseous [[reaction mixture]]. Diverse mechanisms for [[reactions on surfaces]] are known, depending on how the adsorption takes place ([[Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson|Langmuir-Hinshelwood]], [[Eley\u2013Rideal mechanism|Eley-Rideal]], and Mars-[[Dirk Willem van Krevelen|van Krevelen]]).<ref>Kn\u00f6zinger, Helmut and Kochloefl, Karl (2002) \"Heterogeneous Catalysis and Solid Catalysts\" in Ullmann's ''Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_313}}</ref> The total surface area of solid has an important effect on the reaction rate. The smaller the catalyst particle size, the larger the surface area for a given mass of particles.\n\nA heterogeneous catalyst has '''active sites''', which are the atoms or crystal faces where the reaction actually occurs. Depending on the mechanism, the active site may be either a planar exposed metal surface, a crystal edge with imperfect metal valence or a complicated combination of the two. Thus, not only most of the volume, but also most of the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst may be catalytically inactive. Finding out the nature of the active site requires technically challenging research. Thus, empirical research for finding out new metal combinations for catalysis continues.\n\nFor example, in the [[Haber process]], finely divided [[iron]] serves as a catalyst for the synthesis of [[ammonia]] from [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]]. The reacting [[gas]]es [[adsorb]] onto active sites on the iron particles. Once physically adsorbed, the reagents undergo [[chemisorption]] that results in dissociation into adsorbed atomic species, and new bonds between the resulting fragments form in part due to their close proximity. In this way the particularly strong [[triple bond]] in nitrogen is broken, which would be extremely uncommon in the gas phase due to its high activation energy. Thus, the activation energy of the overall reaction is lowered, and the rate of reaction increases.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Another place where a heterogeneous catalyst is applied is in the oxidation of sulfur dioxide on [[vanadium(V) oxide]] for the production of [[sulfuric acid]].\n\nHeterogeneous catalysts are typically \"[[catalyst support|supported]],\" which means that the catalyst is dispersed on a second material that enhances the effectiveness or minimizes their cost. Supports prevent or reduce agglomeration and sintering small catalyst particles, exposing more surface area, thus catalysts have a higher specific activity (per gram) on a support. Sometimes the support is merely a surface on which the catalyst is spread to increase the surface area. More often, the support and the catalyst interact, affecting the catalytic reaction. Supports can also be used in nanoparticle synthesis by providing sites for individual molecules of catalyst to chemically bind. Supports are porous materials with a high surface area, most commonly [[alumina]], [[zeolites]] or various kinds of [[activated carbon]]. Specialized supports include [[silicon dioxide]], [[titanium dioxide]], [[calcium carbonate]], and [[barium sulfate]].\n\n====Electrocatalysts====\n{{Main|Electrocatalyst}}\n\nIn the context of [[electrochemistry]], specifically in [[fuel cell]] engineering, various metal-containing catalysts are used to enhance the rates of the [[half reaction]]s that comprise the fuel cell. One common type of fuel cell electrocatalyst is based upon [[nanoparticles]] of [[platinum]] that are supported on slightly larger [[carbon]] particles. When in contact with one of the [[electrodes]] in a fuel cell, this platinum increases the rate of [[oxygen]] reduction either to water, or to [[hydroxide]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]].\n\n===Homogeneous catalysts===\n{{Main|Homogeneous catalysis}}\n\nHomogeneous catalysts function in the same phase as the reactants, but the mechanistic principles involved in heterogeneous catalysis are generally applicable. Typically homogeneous catalysts are dissolved in a solvent with the substrates.  One example of homogeneous catalysis involves the influence of [[hydrogen|H]]<sup>+</sup> on the [[esterification]] of carboxylic acids, such as the formation of [[methyl acetate]] from [[acetic acid]] and [[methanol]].<ref>Behr, Arno (2002) \"Organometallic Compounds and Homogeneous Catalysis\" in Ullmann's ''Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_215}}</ref> One high-volume process requiring a homogeneous catalyst is [[hydroformylation]], which adds [[carbon monoxide]] to an [[alkene]] to produce an alkyl [[aldehyde]]. The aldehyde can be converted to various products such as alcohols or acids (for e.g. detergents) or [[polyol]]s (for plastics such as [[polycarbonate]] or [[polyurethane]]). For inorganic chemists, homogeneous catalysis is often synonymous with [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic catalysts]].<ref>Elschenbroich, C. (2006) ''Organometallics''. Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{ISBN|978-3-527-29390-2}}</ref>\n\n====Organocatalysis====\n{{Main|Organocatalysis}}\n\nWhereas transition metals sometimes attract most of the attention in the study of catalysis, small organic molecules without metals can also exhibit catalytic properties, as is apparent from the fact that many [[enzyme]]s lack transition metals.  Typically, organic catalysts require a higher loading (amount of catalyst per unit amount of reactant, expressed in [[mol%]] [[amount of substance]]) than transition metal(-ion)-based catalysts, but these catalysts are usually commercially available in bulk, helping to reduce costs.  In the early 2000s, these organocatalysts were considered \"new generation\" and are competitive to traditional [[metal]](-ion)-containing catalysts.  Organocatalysts are supposed to operate akin to metal-free enzymes utilizing, e.g., non-covalent interactions such as [[hydrogen bonding]]. The discipline organocatalysis is divided in the application of covalent (e.g., [[proline]], [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine|DMAP]]) and non-covalent (e.g., [[thiourea organocatalysis]]) organocatalysts referring to the preferred catalyst-[[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] [[binding (molecular)|binding]] and interaction, respectively.\n\n===Photocatalysts===\n\n[[Photocatalysis]] is the phenomenon where the catalyst can receive light (such as visible light), be promoted to an excited state, and then undergo [[intersystem crossing]] with the starting material, returning to ground state without being consumed. The excited state of the starting material will then undergo reactions it ordinarily could not if directly illuminated. For example, [[singlet oxygen]] is usually produced by photocatalysis. Photocatalysts are also the main ingredient in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s.\n\n===Enzymes and biocatalysts===\n{{Main|enzyme catalysis}}\n\nIn biology, [[enzyme]]s are protein-based catalysts in [[metabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. Most biocatalysts are enzymes, but other non-protein-based classes of biomolecules also exhibit catalytic properties including [[ribozyme]]s, and synthetic [[deoxyribozyme]]s.<ref>Nelson, D.L. and Cox, M.M. (2000) ''Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry'' 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.</ref>\n\nBiocatalysts can be thought of as intermediate between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, although strictly speaking soluble enzymes are homogeneous catalysts and [[Biological membrane|membrane]]-bound enzymes are heterogeneous. Several factors affect the activity of enzymes (and other catalysts) including temperature, pH, concentration of enzyme, substrate, and products.  A particularly important reagent in enzymatic reactions is water, which is the product of many bond-forming reactions and a reactant in many bond-breaking processes.\n\nIn [[biocatalysis]], enzymes are employed to prepare many commodity chemicals including [[high-fructose corn syrup]] and [[acrylamide]].\n\nSome [[monoclonal antibodies]] whose binding target is a stable molecule which resembles the transition state of a chemical reaction can function as weak catalysts for that chemical reaction by lowering its activation energy.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044547/http://www.documentroot.com/2010/03/catalytic-antibodies-simply-explained.html Catalytic Antibodies Simply Explained].

The simplest example of autocatalysis is a reaction of type A + B \u2192 2 B, in one or in several steps. The overall reaction is just A \u2192 B, so that B is a product. But since B is also a reactant, it may be present in the rate equation and affect the reaction rate. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of B increases and can accelerate the reaction as a catalyst. In effect, the reaction accelerates itself or is autocatalyzed.\n\nA real example is the hydrolysis of an [[ester]] such as [[aspirin]] to a [[carboxylic acid]] and an [[alcohol]]. In the absence of added acid catalysts, the carboxylic acid product catalyzes the hydrolysis.\n\n==Significance==\n\n[[File:Verbrennung eines Zuckerw\u00fcrfels.png|thumb|Left: Partially caramelised [[cube sugar]], Right: burning cube sugar with ash as catalyst]]\n[[File:TiCrPt micropump3.webm|thumb|A Ti-Cr-Pt tube (~40 \u03bcm long) releases oxygen bubbles when immersed in [[hydrogen peroxide]] (via catalytic decomposition), forming a [[micropump]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C1CP20542K|pmid=21505711|url= http://nanomem.fudan.edu.cn/79solovev2011.pdf |title=Tunable catalytic tubular micro-pumps operating at low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=21|pages=10131\u201335|year=2011|last1=Solovev|first1=Alexander A.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Samuel|last3=Mei|first3=Yongfeng|last4=Schmidt|first4=Oliver G.|bibcode=2011PCCP...1310131S}}</ref>]]\n\nEstimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.<ref>\"Recognizing the Best in Innovation: Breakthrough Catalyst\".

Promoters are substances that increase the catalytic activity, even though they are not catalysts by themselves.\n\nInhibitors are sometimes referred to as \"negative catalysts\" since they decrease the reaction rate.<ref name=Laidler78/> However the term inhibitor is preferred since they do not work by introducing a reaction path with higher activation energy; this would not reduce the rate since the reaction would continue to occur by the non-catalyzed path. Instead they act either by deactivating catalysts, or by removing reaction intermediates such as free radicals.<ref name=Laidler78>Laidler, K.J.

(1982) ''Physical Chemistry'', Benjamin/Cummings, p. 425. {{ISBN|0-618-12341-5}}.</ref>\n\nThe inhibitor may modify selectivity in addition to rate. For instance, in the reduction of [[alkyne]]s to [[alkene]]s, a [[palladium]] (Pd) catalyst partly \"poisoned\" with [[lead(II) acetate]] (Pb(CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) can be used.<ref name=Lindlar>{{OrgSynth | author = Lindlar, H. and Dubuis, R. | title = Palladium Catalyst for Partial Reduction of Acetylenes | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 880 | year = 2016 | doi=10.15227/orgsyn.046.0089}}</ref> Without the deactivation of the catalyst, the alkene produced would be further reduced to [[alkane]].<ref>Jencks, W.P.

Another mechanism is the modification of surface geometry. For instance, in hydrogenation operations, large planes of metal surface function as sites of [[hydrogenolysis]] catalysis while sites catalyzing [[hydrogenation]] of unsaturates are smaller. Thus, a poison that covers surface randomly will tend to reduce the number of uncontaminated large planes but leave proportionally more smaller sites free, thus changing the hydrogenation vs. hydrogenolysis selectivity. Many other mechanisms are also possible.\n\nPromoters can cover up surface to prevent production of a mat of coke, or even actively remove such material (e.g., rhenium on platinum in [[catalytic reforming|platforming]]). They can aid the dispersion of the catalytic material or bind to reagents.\n\n==Current market==\n\nThe global demand for catalysts in 2010 was estimated at approximately US$29.5 billion.

They participate in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. They currently have 25 teams across schoolboy, junior and senior grades. The Roosters premier team began the [[Te Atatu Roosters 2019 Season|2019 season]] in the \"Fox Championship Qualifying Competition\", but after qualifying first they gained entry to the Fox Championship competition where a top 4 finish will see them begin the 2020 season in the top division.\n[[File:Te Atatu v New Lynn.jpg|thumb|right|Te Atatu scoring v New Lynn]]\n\n==Home Ground==\nThe Roosters play at the [[Auckland Council|council owned]] [[Jack Colvin Park]] located on the [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula]], next to the [[North Western Motorway]]. Junior teams play at [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]], and at Gloria Park both also on the peninsula.\n\n== History ==\nThe Te Atatu club was founded in 1955 after the opening of the North-Western motorway led to suburban growth in the Te Atat\u016b area. The first team was a 7-aside team formed to represent Te Atatu North and South. They initially had to wear [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] jerseys and their first ever game was against Wesley at [[Fowlds Park]]. The first training area was in a cow paddock on Edmonton Rd, before they were later able to move to [[Ramlea Park]].\n\nIn 1961 Te Atatu won their first schoolboy championship in their Te Atatu colours. In 1960\u201361 [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]] was developed on Neil Avenue and in 1965 they fielded their first senior side in the Senior B grade. The ground is still commonly referred to as 'Neil Ave'.\n\nIn the late 1960s work began on the current club rooms on Toru Avenue. They were built on Crown (council) land arranged with Waitemata Mayor [[Jack Colvin]] after 3 club members were elected to the WCC Parks Committee. However, before the club rooms could be built the land needed to be prepared. The land was in such poor condition that no other clubs had bothered applying for it, and life member Ken Pitman described the task of preparing it thus: \"What a mess, over six acres of swamp, gorse and pine trees, five feet thick. Well we were all enthusiastic and silly enough to attempt the impossible. We chopped, scrounged, swore, drank and burned our way through the lot\". The council also helped by putting a culvert under the motorway and realigned the creek which ran through the park. Eventually the playing fields were established and work could begin on the club rooms.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/67998177/</ref>\n\nThe club rooms took over 6 years to complete with the foundation stone being laid on 17 December 1962, with the official opening on 19 April 1969 by MP Martin Finlay. Just as the land was prepared solely by club members, so to was the clubroom built completely by members including Ken Pitman, Tom Hetherington, Ted Quedely, Eric Draper, Ernie Rainbow, Morrie Ramsey, Peter and Bis Pitman, Buddy Jones, Harry McWilliams, Jim Denyer, Gordon McCarten, Pat Fairweather, Don McMeekin, Murray Hill and Ian Pattulo.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | title = The History of Te Atatu Rugby League Club\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | publisher = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | date = 18 February 2012\n  | url = http://www.foxsportspulse.com/club_info.cgi?client=0-4975-69502-0-0&sID=128875&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=8812328\n  | accessdate = 7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s Te Atatu were becoming more competitive on the field at senior level and completed wins over all of the top clubs over a period of time, including [[Ellerslie Eagles]], [[Mt Albert Lions]], [[Glenora Bears]], [[Richmond Bulldogs]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies]].  At this time the club also began producing NZ international quality players such as [[Dennis A. Williams|Dennis Williams]] who aged only 18 famously scored a brilliant individual try with his first touch of the ball in his debut test versus Great Britain, along with John Smith and John Wilson. In 1973 they won the Senior Competition and the Phelan Shield. In the same year they played the first ever [[Australian Aboriginal rugby league team]] in a pre season game, losing 13\u201317.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]\n  | title = Aboriginal team wins\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | date = 18 February 1973\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-LIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3423,6519452\n  | accessdate = 10 August 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | title = Aboriginal Rugby League Stars Recognised After 4 Decades\n  | work = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | place =Australia\n  \n  | date = 8 February 2013\n  | url = https://www.armidaleexpress.com.au/story/1286216/aboriginal-rugby-league-stars-recognised-after-four-decades/\n  | accessdate = 30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAround this time other branches of the club were formed at Ranui (which later led to the formation of the [[Waitemata Seagulls]]), and [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]]. Teams playing at [[Moire Park]] in Massey were known as Te Atatu Massey. The nickname 'Roosters' was adopted along with the Eastern Suburbs (now [[Sydney Roosters]]) style jersey. In 1976 they turned 21 yrs old and celebrated with a ball at the Mandalay in the city. In 1979 club members looking for a summer activity to continue bonding and to develop player skills formed the Te Atatu Roosters Softball Club. The softball club has since relocated to the Massey Rugby Club and plays at Rosedale Park on Auckland's North Shore, but has retained the name [[Roosters Softball Club]].<ref>http://www.onlysport.co.nz/browse/profile-607-Roosters_Softball_Club_Inc.html</ref><ref>http://www.roosterssoftball.co.nz/</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the club finally began experiencing the success on the field they had sought after for many years. In 1986 they were runners up in the Fox Memorial to Mt Albert but weeks later were crowned National Club Champions after defeating the same opposition. Then in 1988 they won the Fox Memorial Shield beating local rivals [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 23\u201316 in the final at [[Carlaw Park]] and a month later won the National Club title for the second time by again defeating Glenora at Eden Park as curtain-raiser to the Kiwis \u2013 Kangaroo World Cup final.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Te Atatu Roosters Facebook page]]\n  | first = Graeme Murdoch\n  | title = 60th Jubilee Speech Notes\n  |publisher=Facebook\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | pages = 1\u20132\n  | date = 20 June 2015\n  | url = https://www.facebook.com/1423833681197274/photos/pb.1423833681197274.-2207520000.1436166628./1638454956401811/?type=3&theater\n  | accessdate = 6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Te Atatu formed their first women's premier team. They have now played four seasons and won the 2nd division title twice (2016 and 2019).<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/sport/80016339/women-flock-to-the-te-atatu-roosters-rugby-league-team</ref>\n\n== Titles ==\n{{see also|Auckland Rugby League club trophies}}\nTe Atatu's first ever senior trophy was the Gillette Cup in 1968. They won it again in 1974.\n\nTheir other trophies early in their existence were in the Sharman Cup where they won it in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976 and 1978.\n\nTe Atatu had a historic year in 1986 when they won the Rukutai Shield for winning the minor premiership and making the Fox Memorial grand final (both for the first time) where they lost to the [[Mt Albert Lions]] 31\u20134. A month later they had revenge when they beat the Lions by 36\u201310 to claim their first National Club title at [[Carlaw Park]], defeating Randwick and Upper Hutt along the way.\n\nTe Atatu finally won the coveted [[Fox Memorial Shield]], awarded to the Auckland club champions in 1988 with a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6JGSd5irZ4|22-16 win] over local rivals the [[Glenora Bears]].  They also went on to win the Lion Red National Club Final against Glenora at [[Eden Park]] 18\u20138 in the same year.  The match was televised live as it was the curtain-raiser to the New Zealand \u2013 Australia Rugby League World Cup final which Australia went on to win 25\u201312 in front of 45,363 spectators.\n\nIn 1990 they again made the Fox Memorial final but lost to a [[Tawera Nikau]] inspired [[Otahuhu Leopards]]. In 1993 they made the Fox Memorial final for the 4th time but were again defeated by the [[Northcote Tigers]] 29\u201310.\n\nIn 2005 the Roosters celebrated their 50th Jubilee. In 2007 Te Atatu won the Roope Rooster (which by this time had become a trophy the winning team defended on their home ground). They defeated Mt Albert to win it and defended it for 3 matches before losing it to the [[Richmond Bulldogs]].\n\nIn 2010 they finished 4th at the end of the regular season in the Fox Memorial and defeated 3rd placed Howick in the minor final, before losing to Otahuhu in preliminary final.\n\nThe 2011 to 2014 seasons were largely uneventful, spent in the lower divisions. The 2014 season was arguably one of the worst in the club's history with just 2 wins from 18 games, both over the last placed [[Manukau Magpies]].\n\nThe club then rebuilt in 2015 by appointing Revell Neil and bringing in many new players to the premier team. This saw a massive reversal in results and over the 2015 and 2016 seasons they won a remarkable 35 games, with 2 draws and just 3 losses. In 2015 they had their 60th Jubilee which featured a celebratory match with local rivals Glenora and was won by Te Atatu 38\u201328. They also won the Phelan Shield in this time. In 2016 they won the Phelan Shield again along with promotion back to the Fox Memorial when they beat the [[Bay Roskill Vikings]] 31\u201322 in the Sharman Cup final. In 2017 they were competitive in many matches but failed to convert this into wins. They were relegated back to the Sharman Cup and in 2018 were forced to rebuild after losing many of their players to other teams. Former Te Atatu player [[Lawrence Tagaloa]] was appointed head coach. They finished the season with a 7\u20137 record and lost to New Lynn in the Sharman Cup championship final. 2019 saw another change with new coaches (Keith Hanley and Phil Gordon) appointed and many new additions to the team.\n\n[[File:TeAtatuRoostersvPtChev.png|thumb|right|Te Atatu players in a match against Point Chevalier]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Williams|Dennis Williams]] in 1971. He went on to play 31 tests for New Zealand. The majority of the NZ representatives were to come from the late 1980s and early 1990s when the club experienced considerable success on the field With the likes of [[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]], [[Mark Elia]], [[Mark Horo]], [[Ron O'Regan]], [[Dean Orr]], and [[Sam Panapa]] in the side. In the early 1990s brothers Henry and [[Robbie Paul]] represented the Kiwi's though Robbie moved to play professionally in England at a young age and due to the difficulty for players from England being able to return to New Zealand or Australia for tests he did not represent New Zealand as many times as he would undoubtedly have. His brother [[Henry Paul]] also moved to play professionally in England and he later switched codes representing England in rugby union, and in [[Rugby Sevens]]. He was not the only Te Atatu Rooster to represent another country in Rugby Union. [[Shontayne Hape]] switched codes and was selected for the full English international side who he represented 13 times, and more recently [[James O'Connor (rugby union)|James O'Connor]] who was a Te Atatu Schoolboy was selected for the Wallabies, the [[Australia national rugby union team]].\n\n===NZ Representatives===\n'''Kiwis'''\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]] (16 tests)\n*[[Mark Elia]] (37 tests)\n*[[Shontayne Hape]] (14 tests)\n*[[Mark Horo]] (16 tests)\n*[[Suaia Matagi]] (1 test)\n*[[Ron O'Regan]] (8 tests)\n*[[Dean Orr]] (1 test)\n*[[Sam Panapa]] (8 tests)\n*[[Henry Paul]] (24 tests)\n*[[Robbie Paul]] (29 tests)\n*[[John Smith (rugby league)|John Smith]] (12 tests)\n*[[Dennis A.

They participate in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. They currently have 25 teams across schoolboy, junior and senior grades. The Roosters premier team began the [[Te Atatu Roosters 2019 Season|2019 season]] in the \"Fox Championship Qualifying Competition\", but after qualifying first they gained entry to the Fox Championship competition where a top 4 finish will see them begin the 2020 season in the top division.\n[[File:Te Atatu v New Lynn.jpg|thumb|right|Te Atatu scoring v New Lynn]]\n\n==Home Ground==\nThe Roosters play at the [[Auckland Council|council owned]] [[Jack Colvin Park]] located on the [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula]], next to the [[North Western Motorway]]. Junior teams play at [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]], and at Gloria Park both also on the peninsula.\n\n== History ==\nThe Te Atatu club was founded in 1955 after the opening of the North-Western motorway led to suburban growth in the Te Atat\u016b area. The first team was a 7-aside team formed to represent Te Atatu North and South. They initially had to wear [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] jerseys and their first ever game was against Wesley at [[Fowlds Park]]. The first training area was in a cow paddock on Edmonton Rd, before they were later able to move to [[Ramlea Park]].\n\nIn 1961 Te Atatu won their first schoolboy championship in their Te Atatu colours. In 1960\u201361 [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]] was developed on Neil Avenue and in 1965 they fielded their first senior side in the Senior B grade. The ground is still commonly referred to as 'Neil Ave'.\n\nIn the late 1960s work began on the current club rooms on Toru Avenue. They were built on Crown (council) land arranged with Waitemata Mayor [[Jack Colvin]] after 3 club members were elected to the WCC Parks Committee. However, before the club rooms could be built the land needed to be prepared. The land was in such poor condition that no other clubs had bothered applying for it, and life member Ken Pitman described the task of preparing it thus: \"What a mess, over six acres of swamp, gorse and pine trees, five feet thick. Well we were all enthusiastic and silly enough to attempt the impossible. We chopped, scrounged, swore, drank and burned our way through the lot\". The council also helped by putting a culvert under the motorway and realigned the creek which ran through the park. Eventually the playing fields were established and work could begin on the club rooms.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/67998177/</ref>\n\nThe club rooms took over 6 years to complete with the foundation stone being laid on 17 December 1962, with the official opening on 19 April 1969 by MP Martin Finlay. Just as the land was prepared solely by club members, so to was the clubroom built completely by members including Ken Pitman, Tom Hetherington, Ted Quedely, Eric Draper, Ernie Rainbow, Morrie Ramsey, Peter and Bis Pitman, Buddy Jones, Harry McWilliams, Jim Denyer, Gordon McCarten, Pat Fairweather, Don McMeekin, Murray Hill and Ian Pattulo.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | title = The History of Te Atatu Rugby League Club\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | publisher = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | date = 18 February 2012\n  | url = http://www.foxsportspulse.com/club_info.cgi?client=0-4975-69502-0-0&sID=128875&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=8812328\n  | accessdate = 7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s Te Atatu were becoming more competitive on the field at senior level and completed wins over all of the top clubs over a period of time, including [[Ellerslie Eagles]], [[Mt Albert Lions]], [[Glenora Bears]], [[Richmond Bulldogs]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies]].  At this time the club also began producing NZ international quality players such as [[Dennis A. Williams|Dennis Williams]] who aged only 18 famously scored a brilliant individual try with his first touch of the ball in his debut test versus Great Britain, along with John Smith and John Wilson. In 1973 they won the Senior Competition and the Phelan Shield. In the same year they played the first ever [[Australian Aboriginal rugby league team]] in a pre season game, losing 13\u201317.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]\n  | title = Aboriginal team wins\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | date = 18 February 1973\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-LIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3423,6519452\n  | accessdate = 10 August 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | title = Aboriginal Rugby League Stars Recognised After 4 Decades\n  | work = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | place =Australia\n  \n  | date = 8 February 2013\n  | url = https://www.armidaleexpress.com.au/story/1286216/aboriginal-rugby-league-stars-recognised-after-four-decades/\n  | accessdate = 30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAround this time other branches of the club were formed at Ranui (which later led to the formation of the [[Waitemata Seagulls]]), and [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]]. Teams playing at [[Moire Park]] in Massey were known as Te Atatu Massey. The nickname 'Roosters' was adopted along with the Eastern Suburbs (now [[Sydney Roosters]]) style jersey. In 1976 they turned 21 yrs old and celebrated with a ball at the Mandalay in the city. In 1979 club members looking for a summer activity to continue bonding and to develop player skills formed the Te Atatu Roosters Softball Club. The softball club has since relocated to the Massey Rugby Club and plays at Rosedale Park on Auckland's North Shore, but has retained the name [[Roosters Softball Club]].<ref>http://www.onlysport.co.nz/browse/profile-607-Roosters_Softball_Club_Inc.html</ref><ref>http://www.roosterssoftball.co.nz/</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the club finally began experiencing the success on the field they had sought after for many years. In 1986 they were runners up in the Fox Memorial to Mt Albert but weeks later were crowned National Club Champions after defeating the same opposition. Then in 1988 they won the Fox Memorial Shield beating local rivals [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 23\u201316 in the final at [[Carlaw Park]] and a month later won the National Club title for the second time by again defeating Glenora at Eden Park as curtain-raiser to the Kiwis \u2013 Kangaroo World Cup final.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Te Atatu Roosters Facebook page]]\n  | first = Graeme Murdoch\n  | title = 60th Jubilee Speech Notes\n  |publisher=Facebook\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | pages = 1\u20132\n  | date = 20 June 2015\n  | url = https://www.facebook.com/1423833681197274/photos/pb.1423833681197274.-2207520000.1436166628./1638454956401811/?type=3&theater\n  | accessdate = 6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Te Atatu formed their first women's premier team. They have now played four seasons and won the 2nd division title twice (2016 and 2019).<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/sport/80016339/women-flock-to-the-te-atatu-roosters-rugby-league-team</ref>\n\n== Titles ==\n{{see also|Auckland Rugby League club trophies}}\nTe Atatu's first ever senior trophy was the Gillette Cup in 1968. They won it again in 1974.\n\nTheir other trophies early in their existence were in the Sharman Cup where they won it in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976 and 1978.\n\nTe Atatu had a historic year in 1986 when they won the Rukutai Shield for winning the minor premiership and making the Fox Memorial grand final (both for the first time) where they lost to the [[Mt Albert Lions]] 31\u20134. A month later they had revenge when they beat the Lions by 36\u201310 to claim their first National Club title at [[Carlaw Park]], defeating Randwick and Upper Hutt along the way.\n\nTe Atatu finally won the coveted [[Fox Memorial Shield]], awarded to the Auckland club champions in 1988 with a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6JGSd5irZ4|22-16 win] over local rivals the [[Glenora Bears]].  They also went on to win the Lion Red National Club Final against Glenora at [[Eden Park]] 18\u20138 in the same year.  The match was televised live as it was the curtain-raiser to the New Zealand \u2013 Australia Rugby League World Cup final which Australia went on to win 25\u201312 in front of 45,363 spectators.\n\nIn 1990 they again made the Fox Memorial final but lost to a [[Tawera Nikau]] inspired [[Otahuhu Leopards]]. In 1993 they made the Fox Memorial final for the 4th time but were again defeated by the [[Northcote Tigers]] 29\u201310.\n\nIn 2005 the Roosters celebrated their 50th Jubilee. In 2007 Te Atatu won the Roope Rooster (which by this time had become a trophy the winning team defended on their home ground). They defeated Mt Albert to win it and defended it for 3 matches before losing it to the [[Richmond Bulldogs]].\n\nIn 2010 they finished 4th at the end of the regular season in the Fox Memorial and defeated 3rd placed Howick in the minor final, before losing to Otahuhu in preliminary final.\n\nThe 2011 to 2014 seasons were largely uneventful, spent in the lower divisions. The 2014 season was arguably one of the worst in the club's history with just 2 wins from 18 games, both over the last placed [[Manukau Magpies]].\n\nThe club then rebuilt in 2015 by appointing Revell Neil and bringing in many new players to the premier team. This saw a massive reversal in results and over the 2015 and 2016 seasons they won a remarkable 35 games, with 2 draws and just 3 losses. In 2015 they had their 60th Jubilee which featured a celebratory match with local rivals Glenora and was won by Te Atatu 38\u201328. They also won the Phelan Shield in this time. In 2016 they won the Phelan Shield again along with promotion back to the Fox Memorial when they beat the [[Bay Roskill Vikings]] 31\u201322 in the Sharman Cup final. In 2017 they were competitive in many matches but failed to convert this into wins. They were relegated back to the Sharman Cup and in 2018 were forced to rebuild after losing many of their players to other teams. Former Te Atatu player [[Lawrence Tagaloa]] was appointed head coach. They finished the season with a 7\u20137 record and lost to New Lynn in the Sharman Cup championship final. 2019 saw another change with new coaches (Keith Hanley and Phil Gordon) appointed and many new additions to the team.\n\n[[File:TeAtatuRoostersvPtChev.png|thumb|right|Te Atatu players in a match against Point Chevalier]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Williams|Dennis Williams]] in 1971. He went on to play 31 tests for New Zealand. The majority of the NZ representatives were to come from the late 1980s and early 1990s when the club experienced considerable success on the field With the likes of [[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]], [[Mark Elia]], [[Mark Horo]], [[Ron O'Regan]], [[Dean Orr]], and [[Sam Panapa]] in the side. In the early 1990s brothers Henry and [[Robbie Paul]] represented the Kiwi's though Robbie moved to play professionally in England at a young age and due to the difficulty for players from England being able to return to New Zealand or Australia for tests he did not represent New Zealand as many times as he would undoubtedly have. His brother [[Henry Paul]] also moved to play professionally in England and he later switched codes representing England in rugby union, and in [[Rugby Sevens]]. He was not the only Te Atatu Rooster to represent another country in Rugby Union. [[Shontayne Hape]] switched codes and was selected for the full English international side who he represented 13 times, and more recently [[James O'Connor (rugby union)|James O'Connor]] who was a Te Atatu Schoolboy was selected for the Wallabies, the [[Australia national rugby union team]].\n\n===NZ Representatives===\n'''Kiwis'''\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]] (16 tests)\n*[[Mark Elia]] (37 tests)\n*[[Shontayne Hape]] (14 tests)\n*[[Mark Horo]] (16 tests)\n*[[Suaia Matagi]] (1 test)\n*[[Ron O'Regan]] (8 tests)\n*[[Dean Orr]] (1 test)\n*[[Sam Panapa]] (8 tests)\n*[[Henry Paul]] (24 tests)\n*[[Robbie Paul]] (29 tests)\n*[[John Smith (rugby league)|John Smith]] (12 tests)\n*[[Dennis A.

{"title_page": "Dental emergency", "text_new": "A '''dental emergency''' is an issue involving the teeth and supporting tissues that is of high importance to be treated by the relevant professional. Dental emergencies do not always involve pain, although this is a common signal that something needs to be looked at. Pain can originate from the tooth, surrounding tissues or can have the sensation of originating in the teeth but be caused by an independent source ([[orofacial pain]] and [[toothache]]). Depending on the type of pain experienced an experienced clinician can determine the likely cause and can treat the issue as each tissue type gives different messages in a dental emergency.<ref>{{cite|title= Dental Emergency | url=\n\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.emergency-dental-365.com/blog/dental-emergency/what-is-a-dental-emergency/}}</ref>\u00a0\n\nMany emergencies exist and can range from bacterial, fungal or viral infections to a fractured tooth or [[dental restoration]], each requiring an individual response and treatment that is unique to the situation. Fractures ([[dental trauma]]) can occur anywhere on the tooth or to the surrounding bone, depending on the site and extent of fracture the treatment options will vary. [[Dental restoration]] falling out or fracturing can also be considered a dental emergency as these can impact on function in regards to aesthetics, eating and pronunciation and as such should be tended to with the same haste as loss of tooth tissue. All dental emergencies should be treated under the supervision or guidance of a dental health professional in order to preserve the teeth for as long as possible.\n\nBy contrast, a [[medical emergency]] is often more precisely defined as an acute condition which presents an immediate threat to life, limb, vision or long term health. Consequently, dental emergencies can rarely be described as medical emergencies in these terms. Some define a dental emergency in terms of the individual's willingness to attend for emergency dental treatment at any time at short notice, stating that persons who are fussy about when they are available for treatment are not true emergency cases.<ref name=\"Mitchell_2009\">{{cite book | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Laura | last2 = McCaul | first2 = David A.

There can be aesthetical concerns if the filling is in a visible area. Patients need to be aware of the sharp edges and ensure their tongue does not constantly apply pressure around that area, as it can cause cuts to the tongue. However, in some cases the result of the loss of a filling can cause irritation to the side of the cheek and potentially lead to an [[ulcer]]. Sharp edges can easily be dealt with by levelling the filling or tooth edges from your local dentist during the emergency appointment. [[Hypersensitivity]] issues may also arise, short sharp pain caused by exposed underlying dentine, after the deterioration of the filling material.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\n\nReasons for the deterioration of a restoration vary in different cases, the cause may be underlying caries or it could be occlusal trauma, caused from natural dentition during mastication. The longevity of restorative materials could also be a factor; the survival rates of amalgam are usually 10\u201315 years, composite 7 years, while gold and ceramic fillings have over a 20-year longevity.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\n\nDuring the emergency appointment the dentist will need to take a set of radiographs to assess for any underlying [[caries]], bone loss or possible [[abscess]]. The clinical examination will detect the reasons behind the failure of the restoration. Upon treatment the dentist will provide options on the tooth\u2019s prognosis, these may include a new restoration, extraction, root canal or placement of a crown. The tooth prognosis includes the tooth\u2019s vitality and restorability.\n\n* '''Crack, fracture and mobility'''\n \nA crack, fracture and the mobility of a tooth are all interrelated as the pain and symptoms experienced from a tooth that has been cracked are very similar to that of a tooth that has been fractured.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\nA tooth crack is defined as an incomplete fracture of enamel or dentine and therefore is not usually associated with noticeable mobility.<ref name=\"Darby_2010\">{{cite book | vauthors = Darby ML, Walsh MM | year = 2010 | title = Dental Hygiene Theory and Practice | edition = 3rd | location = St Louis, Missouri | publisher = Saunders Elsevier | isbn = 978-1-4160-5357-6 }}</ref>\nThe cause of a tooth crack can be by excessive force applied to a healthy tooth or physiologic forces applied to a weakened tooth. The teeth most commonly involved are usually the lower molars, followed by the upper premolars and molars. The condition is extremely common in the age range of 30\u201360 years.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\n\nA diagnosis of a cracked tooth is extremely difficult. Careful history and assessment of the symptoms presented needs to be taken into account; radiographs and certain tests will be conducted in the dental office. Most common symptoms are cold sensitivity, sharp pain when using force to chew, these pain results from the release of pressure and are very important indicators of a cracked tooth. However, the symptoms may differ from various patients, subject to the depth and orientation of the crack.\n\n===Broken crown===\nCrowns can become broken by a fracture, non-retentive preparation, secondary caries, weak cement, excessive occlusal forces, decementation or loosening of the crown.<ref name=\"Darby_2010\"/> The consequences of a crown becoming loose include the risk of ingestion and less likely, inhalation. The management of the loose crown includes immediate recementation or a replacement crown, depending on the assessment conducted by the dentist.\n\nThe factors that are taken into consideration in making this decision include the strength of the temporary crown to be placed and occlusal forces. Thus, a thorough occlusal examination is of paramount importance, strength of the cement, a strong alternative of cement should be considered. The occlusion assessment should also include the static and functional occlusion as well as the possible presence of Para functional habits, such as clenching or bruxism.\n\nManagement includes cleaning all the cement and residues, to carefully inspect for any underlying caries or fractures. Details that need to be assessed include margins, gingivae and contact points; occlusion needs to be checked in both ICP and in lateral and protrusive excursions, before the crown can be re-cemented. Stronger cement should be used than the original such as resin cements, especially in cases of heavy occlusal forces.\n\nIn some cases, immediate reconstruction of the abutment may be deemed inappropriate, if the underlying structure is deemed deficient due to caries or a fracture then this issue needs to be addressed. The treatment plan may vary with the addition of a root canal treatment or a temporary crown for the reconstruction of a new crown.\n\n* '''Fracture of a porcelain veneer or a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown'''\nImmediate management includes a chair side repair of the fractured veneer with composite material. Bonding composite to the exposed metal will involve achieving macro mechanical retention by making grooves and notches or abrading the surface. \nBonding material back onto exposed porcelain involves abrading, hydrofluoric acid etching and silanating then followed by a conventional bonding procedure. Composite patch will remain a temporary solution as the longevity of composite restorations is not predictable as well as the colour of composite is not as stable as porcelain for aesthetical reasons.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\n\n===Broken denture===\n\nA fracture can involve any damage to the denture. Any type of repair to the denture is much less ideal then making a new one. The ratio of fracture to a denture is a 1:3 ratio of the upper to lower.<ref name=\"Darby_2010\"/>\n\nThe most common reason for fracture in a denture; is accidental dropping of the denture in the case of the lower denture, and improper fitting and stability of the denture in the upper denture.\n\n* '''Techniques to prevent denture from being broken:'''\n\n# Use a basin of water in the sink, to help prevent the denture from breaking if happens to fall on a hard surface.\n# Hold the denture in non-dominant hand with a firm, but gentle grasp.\n# Do not use any powdered or abrasive cleaners, including most regular toothpastes, they are too abrasive and produce scratches on the denture surface.\n# Avoid excessive scrubbing as this can damage the denture.\n# Dry denture and place in a plastic container stored some where safe over night.\n\n===Broken or loose implants===\nImplant success is relatively high, the rate of implant survival is between 85-95%,<ref name=\"pmid3527955\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Albrektsson T, Zarb G, Worthington P, Eriksson AR | title = The long-term efficacy of currently used dental implants: a review and proposed criteria of success | journal = The International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Implants | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 11\u201325 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3527955 | doi = | url = http://www.idis.academy/pdf/articles/5.pdf }}</ref> although it is not uncommon for emergency management of a failing implant or one of its components. The failure is most likely due to infection of the implant. It is highly recommended to visit or refer patient to the specialist who provided the implant. \n \nLate failures that occur with implants are usually due to moderate to severe bone loss, mostly located in the posterior areas of teeth and involve a multi-unit prosthesis. A fracture or decementation of a post or loosening of the abutment screw of an implant could be the result of dissolved cement, secondary caries, use of a weak post, or excessive occlusal forces.<ref name=\"Darby_2010\"/>\nOral home care needs to remain at a high standard, brushing twice a day for the duration of two minutes with the use of fluoridated tooth paste. Interdental cleaning once a day using either floss, interdental brushes, wood sticks. Regular dental appointments every 6 months to maintain gingival health, professional cleans, radiographs to examine the bone loss and the implant status. All the following is needed to prolong the longevity of the implant and reduce the risk of [[peri-implantitis]].\n\n== Acute oral medical and surgical conditions ==\n[[File:Abces dentaire.jpg|thumb|right|An abscess originating from a tooth which has spread to involve the [[buccal space]]. Above, deformation of the cheek on the second day.

It can occur throughout the body (generalized), or a specific part or organ can be affected (localized). A swelling may arise intra-orally or externally around the face, jaws and neck and can be caused by trauma (hematoma, swelling due to fracture, [[TMJ]] dislocation), infection or inflammation. Swelling can occur in the gums, palate, lips, buccal space, etc. It can happen due to periodontal problems, infection, abscess, cysts, allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock), salivary gland tumour, inflammation or obstruction of salivary gland.\n\n=== Cellulitis ===\nBacterial infection in the oro-facial region can lead to abscess and swelling. The rapid spread of this infection through connective tissue spaces, is often referred to as cellulitis. The clinical features of cellulitis are a painful, diffuse, brawny swelling. The overlying skin is red, tense and shiny. There is usually an associated trismus, cervical lymphadenopathy, malaise and pyrexia. Cellulitis usually develops\nquickly, over the course of hours, and may follow an inadequately managed or ignored local dental infection. If the infection spreads to involve the floor of mouth and pharyngeal spaces, then the airway can be compromised. Initially, the floor of the mouth will be raised and the patient will have difficulty in swallowing saliva; this\npools and may be observed running from the patient\u2019s mouth. This sign indicates the need for urgent management. Cellulitis involving the tissue spaces on both sides of the floor of mouth is described as Ludwig's angina <ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Coulthard P, Horner K, Sloan P, Theaker E | year = 2008 | title = Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Radiology, Pathology and Oral Medicine | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Elsevier Limited | isbn = 978-0-443-06896-6 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/masterdentistry0000unse }}</ref> Such presentations require immediate attention.\n\nLocalised dental abscesses may be appropriately treated by intra-oral drainage via tooth extraction, opening of root canals and/or intra-oral incision and drainage.

Wearers should   wear a mouth  guard over the appliance if  when playing contact sports.  If one of the components is loose or comes off,  the user must call the orthodontist right away.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the component  is loose the dentist as an emergency  treatment can  cover the  component with orthodontic relief wax.  If the component  breaks off, then the dentist can use   a pair of tweezers to  remove it  making sure to protect the  airway   at all times.\n\n=== Loose or Lost Ligature ===\n\n[[Elastics (orthodontics)|Ligatures]] are small elastics or wires which aim to secure the [[Orthodontic archwires|archwire]] firmly within the brackets on the teeth. If a ligature becomes loose or lost, this can render the appliance less effective as the forces on that particular tooth are reduced. In this case, a loose elastic can be re-positioned with tweezers, ideally by an orthodontist however general dental practitioners are also able to do so. If a wire ligature becomes loose, it should be secured or replaced only by a trained orthodontist and in the meantime, if causing irritation, orthodontic relief wax should be used over any sharp ends. The patient should avoid replacing the wire ligature themselves if it is lost and should seek an appointment with their orthodontist.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sodipo I, Birdsall J | title = Orthodontic First Aid for General Dental Practitioners | journal = Dental Update | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 461\u20132, 465\u20136, 469\u201371 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27529914 | doi = 10.12968/denu.2016.43.5.461| url = https://www.dental-update.co.uk/issueArticle.asp?aKey=1540 }}</ref>\n\n=== Lost separator/spacer ===\n\n[[File:Orthodontic spacer removal.jpg|thumb|Separator found between posterior teeth]]\n[[Orthodontic spacer|Separators]], also known as orthodontic spacers, are usually placed between posterior teeth to open up contact point prior to placing metal orthodontic bands. The separators should ideally be kept in place until the patient's next appointment in order for the orthodontic band to fit. If the separator is lost, the orthodontist should be informed and he/she can advise for a next appointment for the patient.\n\n=== Protruding archwires ===\n\nThe [[Orthodontic archwires|archwire]] in fixed orthodontic appliances should be flat against the tooth, however if the wire is protruding it can cause irritation to the surrounding soft tissues. Wire benders or a dental flat plastic can be used to bend the wire into place, or if this is not possible, the protruding wire can be covered with wax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aso.org.au/troubleshooting-possible-orthodontic-issues|title=Troubleshooting possible orthodontic issues - Australian Society of Orthodontists|website=www.aso.org.au|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> If there are significant problems, the wire can be clipped using distal end cutters, being careful to avoid inhaling or ingesting wire fragments.

If a bracket de-bonds from the tooth, the de-bonded bracket can be removed from the archwire by initially removing the ligature holding it in place. Alternatively, orthodontic wax relief can be used to secure the de-bonded bracket to the adjacent bracket as a temporary measure to prevent irritation of lip and cheek. However, it is essential to inform the orthodontist as soon as possible so that appropriate actions are taken to address the de-bonded brackets immediately.\n\n=== Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions ===\n\nThe most common allergy in orthodontics is to nickel. Nickel is found in multiple orthodontic components, such as nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires and stainless steel brackets. If patients are previously exposed to nickel, for example with nickel-containing jewellery, the re-exposure with orthodontic components are more likely to lead to a Type IV delayed hypersensitivity immune response.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerosuo H, Kullaa A, Kerosuo E, Kanerva L, Hensten-Pettersen A | title = Nickel allergy in adolescents in relation to orthodontic treatment and piercing of ears | journal = American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 148\u201354 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8638560 | doi=10.1016/s0889-5406(96)70175-0}}</ref> This response is usually delayed for a few days or weeks.

If the object is visible, recline the patient and attempt to remove it while otherwise encouraging the patient to cough the object out. If this is not immediately successful call for help and an ambulance.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\" /> Follow the guidelines for 'choking/aspiration' in the 'Medical Emergencies and Resuscitation' document provided by the Resuscitation Council UK.\n\n=== Ingested or aspirated component ===\n\nIt is not unheard of to ingest an orthodontic component or appliance, usually being asymptomatic causing no harm to the patient. No treatment is required except for monitoring stools to ensure the component has passed safely. If however the patient is having symptoms of pain or vomiting, the component may be lodged in the oesophagus or oropharynx. In such situations the patient must be sent to hospital.\n\nIf the component is more than 5&nbsp;cm long the patient should always be sent to A&E as there is a higher risk of obstruction or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract so removal may be advised instead of allowing the component to pass naturally.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\" /> When sending a patient to hospital the referral letter must contain details regarding the components size, shape, flexibility, radio-opacity as well as information about the incident for example when it was swallowed.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\" />\n\nAspiration of an orthodontic component which was unable to be removed must be referred to A&E for chest radiographs and subsequent removal of the component. The referral letter again must include details as described above.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\" />\n\n==Treatments==\nThe treatment is cause-related. For example, [[oil of cloves]], which contains [[eugenol]], can be used to treat dental pain; a drop  can be applied with a cotton swab as a [[palliative]] .{{cn|date=January 2020}}  After [[wisdom teeth|wisdom tooth]] extraction, for example, a condition known as [[dry socket]] can develop where nerve endings are exposed to air.

Dental emergencies do not always involve pain, although this is a common signal that something needs to be looked at. Pain can originate from the tooth, surrounding tissues or can have the sensation of originating in the teeth but be caused by an independent source ([[orofacial pain]] and [[toothache]]). Depending on the type of pain experienced an experienced clinician can determine the likely cause and can treat the issue as each tissue type gives different messages in a dental emergency.\n\nMany emergencies exist and can range from bacterial, fungal or viral infections to a fractured tooth or [[dental restoration]], each requiring an individual response and treatment that is unique to the situation. Fractures ([[dental trauma]]) can occur anywhere on the tooth or to the surrounding bone, depending on the site and extent of fracture the treatment options will vary. [[Dental restoration]] falling out or fracturing can also be considered a dental emergency as these can impact on function in regards to aesthetics, eating and pronunciation and as such should be tended to with the same haste as loss of tooth tissue. All dental emergencies should be treated under the supervision or guidance of a dental health professional in order to preserve the teeth for as long as possible.\n\nBy contrast, a [[medical emergency]] is often more precisely defined as an acute condition which presents an immediate threat to life, limb, vision or long term health. Consequently, dental emergencies can rarely be described as medical emergencies in these terms.

There can be aesthetical concerns if the filling is in a visible area. Patients need to be aware of the sharp edges and ensure their tongue does not constantly apply pressure around that area, as it can cause cuts to the tongue. However, in some cases the result of the loss of a filling can cause irritation to the side of the cheek and potentially lead to an [[ulcer]]. Sharp edges can easily be dealt with by levelling the filling or tooth edges from your local dentist during the emergency appointment. [[Hypersensitivity]] issues may also arise, short sharp pain caused by exposed underlying dentine, after the deterioration of the filling material.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\n\nReasons for the deterioration of a restoration vary in different cases, the cause may be underlying caries or it could be occlusal trauma, caused from natural dentition during mastication. The longevity of restorative materials could also be a factor; the survival rates of amalgam are usually 10\u201315 years, composite 7 years, while gold and ceramic fillings have over a 20-year longevity.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\n\nDuring the emergency appointment the dentist will need to take a set of radiographs to assess for any underlying [[caries]], bone loss or possible [[abscess]]. The clinical examination will detect the reasons behind the failure of the restoration. Upon treatment the dentist will provide options on the tooth\u2019s prognosis, these may include a new restoration, extraction, root canal or placement of a crown. The tooth prognosis includes the tooth\u2019s vitality and restorability.\n\n* '''Crack, fracture and mobility'''\n \nA crack, fracture and the mobility of a tooth are all interrelated as the pain and symptoms experienced from a tooth that has been cracked are very similar to that of a tooth that has been fractured.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\nA tooth crack is defined as an incomplete fracture of enamel or dentine and therefore is not usually associated with noticeable mobility.<ref name=\"Darby_2010\">{{cite book | vauthors = Darby ML, Walsh MM | year = 2010 | title = Dental Hygiene Theory and Practice | edition = 3rd | location = St Louis, Missouri | publisher = Saunders Elsevier | isbn = 978-1-4160-5357-6 }}</ref>\nThe cause of a tooth crack can be by excessive force applied to a healthy tooth or physiologic forces applied to a weakened tooth. The teeth most commonly involved are usually the lower molars, followed by the upper premolars and molars. The condition is extremely common in the age range of 30\u201360 years.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\n\nA diagnosis of a cracked tooth is extremely difficult. Careful history and assessment of the symptoms presented needs to be taken into account; radiographs and certain tests will be conducted in the dental office. Most common symptoms are cold sensitivity, sharp pain when using force to chew, these pain results from the release of pressure and are very important indicators of a cracked tooth. However, the symptoms may differ from various patients, subject to the depth and orientation of the crack.\n\n===Broken crown===\nCrowns can become broken by a fracture, non-retentive preparation, secondary caries, weak cement, excessive occlusal forces, decementation or loosening of the crown.<ref name=\"Darby_2010\"/> The consequences of a crown becoming loose include the risk of ingestion and less likely, inhalation. The management of the loose crown includes immediate recementation or a replacement crown, depending on the assessment conducted by the dentist.\n\nThe factors that are taken into consideration in making this decision include the strength of the temporary crown to be placed and occlusal forces. Thus, a thorough occlusal examination is of paramount importance, strength of the cement, a strong alternative of cement should be considered. The occlusion assessment should also include the static and functional occlusion as well as the possible presence of Para functional habits, such as clenching or bruxism.\n\nManagement includes cleaning all the cement and residues, to carefully inspect for any underlying caries or fractures. Details that need to be assessed include margins, gingivae and contact points; occlusion needs to be checked in both ICP and in lateral and protrusive excursions, before the crown can be re-cemented. Stronger cement should be used than the original such as resin cements, especially in cases of heavy occlusal forces.\n\nIn some cases, immediate reconstruction of the abutment may be deemed inappropriate, if the underlying structure is deemed deficient due to caries or a fracture then this issue needs to be addressed. The treatment plan may vary with the addition of a root canal treatment or a temporary crown for the reconstruction of a new crown.\n\n* '''Fracture of a porcelain veneer or a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown'''\nImmediate management includes a chair side repair of the fractured veneer with composite material. Bonding composite to the exposed metal will involve achieving macro mechanical retention by making grooves and notches or abrading the surface. \nBonding material back onto exposed porcelain involves abrading, hydrofluoric acid etching and silanating then followed by a conventional bonding procedure. Composite patch will remain a temporary solution as the longevity of composite restorations is not predictable as well as the colour of composite is not as stable as porcelain for aesthetical reasons.<ref name=\"Greenwood_2012\"/>\n\n===Broken denture===\n\nA fracture can involve any damage to the denture. Any type of repair to the denture is much less ideal then making a new one. The ratio of fracture to a denture is a 1:3 ratio of the upper to lower.<ref name=\"Darby_2010\"/>\n\nThe most common reason for fracture in a denture; is accidental dropping of the denture in the case of the lower denture, and improper fitting and stability of the denture in the upper denture.\n\n* '''Techniques to prevent denture from being broken:'''\n\n# Use a basin of water in the sink, to help prevent the denture from breaking if happens to fall on a hard surface.\n# Hold the denture in non-dominant hand with a firm, but gentle grasp.\n# Do not use any powdered or abrasive cleaners, including most regular toothpastes, they are too abrasive and produce scratches on the denture surface.\n# Avoid excessive scrubbing as this can damage the denture.\n# Dry denture and place in a plastic container stored some where safe over night.\n\n===Broken or loose implants===\nImplant success is relatively high, the rate of implant survival is between 85-95%,<ref name=\"pmid3527955\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Albrektsson T, Zarb G, Worthington P, Eriksson AR | title = The long-term efficacy of currently used dental implants: a review and proposed criteria of success | journal = The International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Implants | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 11\u201325 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3527955 | doi = | url = http://www.idis.academy/pdf/articles/5.pdf }}</ref> although it is not uncommon for emergency management of a failing implant or one of its components. The failure is most likely due to infection of the implant. It is highly recommended to visit or refer patient to the specialist who provided the implant. \n \nLate failures that occur with implants are usually due to moderate to severe bone loss, mostly located in the posterior areas of teeth and involve a multi-unit prosthesis. A fracture or decementation of a post or loosening of the abutment screw of an implant could be the result of dissolved cement, secondary caries, use of a weak post, or excessive occlusal forces.<ref name=\"Darby_2010\"/>\nOral home care needs to remain at a high standard, brushing twice a day for the duration of two minutes with the use of fluoridated tooth paste. Interdental cleaning once a day using either floss, interdental brushes, wood sticks. Regular dental appointments every 6 months to maintain gingival health, professional cleans, radiographs to examine the bone loss and the implant status. All the following is needed to prolong the longevity of the implant and reduce the risk of [[peri-implantitis]].\n\n== Acute oral medical and surgical conditions ==\n[[File:Abces dentaire.jpg|thumb|right|An abscess originating from a tooth which has spread to involve the [[buccal space]]. Above, deformation of the cheek on the second day.

It can occur throughout the body (generalized), or a specific part or organ can be affected (localized). A swelling may arise intra-orally or externally around the face, jaws and neck and can be caused by trauma (hematoma, swelling due to fracture, [[TMJ]] dislocation), infection or inflammation. Swelling can occur in the gums, palate, lips, buccal space, etc. It can happen due to periodontal problems, infection, abscess, cysts, allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock), salivary gland tumour, inflammation or obstruction of salivary gland.\n\n=== Cellulitis ===\nBacterial infection in the oro-facial region can lead to abscess and swelling. The rapid spread of this infection through connective tissue spaces, is often referred to as cellulitis. The clinical features of cellulitis are a painful, diffuse, brawny swelling. The overlying skin is red, tense and shiny. There is usually an associated trismus, cervical lymphadenopathy, malaise and pyrexia. Cellulitis usually develops\nquickly, over the course of hours, and may follow an inadequately managed or ignored local dental infection. If the infection spreads to involve the floor of mouth and pharyngeal spaces, then the airway can be compromised. Initially, the floor of the mouth will be raised and the patient will have difficulty in swallowing saliva; this\npools and may be observed running from the patient\u2019s mouth. This sign indicates the need for urgent management. Cellulitis involving the tissue spaces on both sides of the floor of mouth is described as Ludwig's angina <ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Coulthard P, Horner K, Sloan P, Theaker E | year = 2008 | title = Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Radiology, Pathology and Oral Medicine | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Elsevier Limited | isbn = 978-0-443-06896-6 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/masterdentistry0000unse }}</ref> Such presentations require immediate attention.\n\nLocalised dental abscesses may be appropriately treated by intra-oral drainage via tooth extraction, opening of root canals and/or intra-oral incision and drainage.

If a ligature becomes loose or lost, this can render the appliance less effective as the forces on that particular tooth are reduced. In this case, a loose elastic can be re-positioned with tweezers, ideally by an orthodontist however general dental practitioners are also able to do so. If a wire ligature becomes loose, it should be secured or replaced only by a trained orthodontist and in the meantime, if causing irritation, orthodontic relief wax should be used over any sharp ends.

If a bracket de-bonds from the tooth, the de-bonded bracket can be removed from the archwire by initially removing the ligature holding it in place. Alternatively, orthodontic wax relief can be used to secure the de-bonded bracket to the adjacent bracket as a temporary measure to prevent irritation of lip and cheek. However, it is essential to inform the orthodontist as soon as possible so that appropriate actions are taken to address the de-bonded brackets immediately.\n\n=== Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions ===\n\nThe most common allergy in orthodontics is to nickel. Nickel is found in multiple orthodontic components, such as nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires and stainless steel brackets. If patients are previously exposed to nickel, for example with nickel-containing jewellery, the re-exposure with orthodontic components are more likely to lead to a Type IV delayed hypersensitivity immune response.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerosuo H, Kullaa A, Kerosuo E, Kanerva L, Hensten-Pettersen A | title = Nickel allergy in adolescents in relation to orthodontic treatment and piercing of ears | journal = American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 148\u201354 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8638560 | doi=10.1016/s0889-5406(96)70175-0}}</ref> This response is usually delayed for a few days or weeks. In this case, the orthodontist must be informed immediately to make arrangements for patient to receive nickel-free components.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakravarthi S, Padmanabhan S, Chitharanjan AB | title = Allergy and orthodontics | journal = Journal of Orthodontic Science | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 83\u20137 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 24987632 | pmc = 4072366 | doi = 10.4103/2278-0203.105871 }}</ref> However, such immune response to nickel is rare, as it is believed that the oral mucosa requires a much higher concentration to illicit a response compared to the skin.\n\n=== Airway obstruction ===\n\nWhen a small removable appliance or a loose component obstructs a patients airway a true medical emergency arises. If the object is visible, recline the patient and attempt to remove it while otherwise encouraging the patient to cough the object out. If this is not immediately successful call for help and an ambulance.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\" /> Follow the guidelines for 'choking/aspiration' in the 'Medical Emergencies and Resuscitation' document provided by the Resuscitation Council UK.\n\n=== Ingested or aspirated component ===\n\nIt is not unheard of to ingest an orthodontic component or appliance, usually being asymptomatic causing no harm to the patient. No treatment is required except for monitoring stools to ensure the component has passed safely. If however the patient is having symptoms of pain or vomiting, the component may be lodged in the oesophagus or oropharynx. In such situations the patient must be sent to hospital.\n\nIf the component is more than 5&nbsp;cm long the patient should always be sent to A&E as there is a higher risk of obstruction or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract so removal may be advised instead of allowing the component to pass naturally.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\" /> When sending a patient to hospital the referral letter must contain details regarding the components size, shape, flexibility, radio-opacity as well as information about the incident for example when it was swallowed.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\" />\n\nAspiration of an orthodontic component which was unable to be removed must be referred to A&E for chest radiographs and subsequent removal of the component. The referral letter again must include details as described above.<ref name=\"Sodipo_2016\" />\n\n==Treatments==\nThe treatment is cause-related. For example, [[oil of cloves]], which contains [[eugenol]], can be used to treat dental pain; a drop  can be applied with a cotton swab as a [[palliative]] .{{cn|date=January 2020}}  After [[wisdom teeth|wisdom tooth]] extraction, for example, a condition known as [[dry socket]] can develop where nerve endings are exposed to air.  A piece of sterile gauze or cotton soaked in oil of cloves may be placed in the socket after careful cleaning with [[saline (medicine)|saline]] to relieve this form of pain .{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n[[Over-the-counter drug|Over-the-counter]] [[topical anesthetic]]s containing [[active ingredient]]s such as [[benzocaine]] or [[choline]] [[salicylate]] may be applied directly to the gum in order to deaden sensation.\n\n[[Analgesics]] such as  [[aspirin]], [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[ibuprofen]] are also commonly used; aspirin and ibuprofen have the additional benefits of being [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]].

It stems from a compositional tradition that dates back to the introduction of [[musique concr\u00e8te]] (a form of musique exp\u00e9rimentale)<ref>Palombini, C. (1998), \"[http://www.rem.ufpr.br/_REM/REMv3.1/vol3/Schaefferi.html Pierre Schaeffer, 1953: towards an Experimental Music', an exegesis of Schaeffer's 'Vers une musique exp\u00e9rimentale'], Music & Letters 74 (4): 542--57, Oxford University Press.</ref>  in the late 1940s. Unlike musical works that are realised using [[sheet music]] exclusively, [[musical composition|compositions]] that are purely acousmatic (in listening terms) often exist solely as fixed media [[audio format|audio recordings]].\n\nThe compositional practice of acousmatic music features [[acousmatic sound]] as a central [[musical aspect]]. Other aspects traditionally thought of as 'musical' such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|metre]] may be present but more often consideration is given to sound-based characteristics such as [[timbre]] and [[spectral music|spectrum]]. Compositional materials can include sounds derived from [[musical instruments]], [[voice]], electronically generated sound, audio that has been manipulated using various [[effects units|effect processors]], as well as general [[sound effects]] and [[field recordings]].\n\nThe music is produced with the aid of various [[music technology|music technologies]], such as [[digital recording|digital recorders]], [[digital signal processing]] tools and [[digital audio workstation]]s. Using such technology various sound materials can be combined, juxtaposed, and transformed in any conceivable manner. In this context the compositional method can be seen as a process of ''sound organisation'': a term first used by the French composer [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]].<ref>Ouellette, Fernand (1973), ''Edgard Var\u00e8se'', London: Calder and Boyars. {{ISBN|978-0-7145-0208-3}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to certain historical accounts, the origin of the term ''acousmatic'' can be traced back to [[Pythagoras]]; the philosopher is believed to have tutored his [[students]] from behind a screen so as not to let his presence distract them from the content of his lectures. Under these conditions, the listener focuses on the sounds being produced to heighten the sense of hearing. In 1955, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Peignot]] and [[Pierre Schaeffer]] were the first to use the term ''acousmatique'' to define the listening experience of musique concr\u00e8te.<ref>Peignot, J. (1960), De la musique concr\u00e8te \u00e0 l'acousmatique, ''Esprit'', No. 280. Paris: ''Esprit'': 111-123.</ref> It is said to be derived from ''akousmatikoi'', the outer circle of Pythagoras' disciples who only heard their teacher speaking from behind a veil. In a similar way, one hears acousmatic music from behind the 'veil' of loudspeakers, without seeing the source of the sound.<ref>Schaeffer, Pierre (1966), ''Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux'', Paris: \u00c9ditions du Seuil. {{OCLC|301664906}}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\nWithin [[academia]] the term acousmatic music, or acousmatic art,<ref>[[Denis Dufour|Dufour, D.]] (1989), \"Peu importe le son\", ''Le Son des musiques'', Symposium Ina-GRM and France-Culture, Paris: Ina-GRM/Buchet-Chastel.</ref><ref>Dhomont, F. (1996), \"Is there a Quebec sound\", ''Organised Sound'', 1(1), Cambridge University Press.</ref> has gained common usage, particularly when referring to contemporary musique concr\u00e8te; however, there is some dispute as to whether acousmatic practice relates to a style of composition or a way of listening to sound.<ref>McFarlane, M.W.

University of Rochester Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3000-4}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\nAcousmatic music may contain sounds that have recognizably musical sources, but may equally present recognizable sources that are beyond the bounds of traditional vocal and instrumental [[technology]]. We are as likely to hear the sounds of a bird, or of a factory as we are the sounds of a [[violin]]. The technology involved transcends the mere reproduction of sounds. Techniques of [[Sound synthesis|synthesis]] and sound processing are employed which may present us with sounds that are unfamiliar and that may defy clear source attribution. Acousmatic compositions may present us with familiar musical events: chords, melodies and rhythms which are easily reconcilable with other forms of music, but may equally present us with events which cannot be classified within such a traditional [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].<ref>Windsor, W.L. (1995). \"A Perceptual Approach to the Description and Analysis of Acousmatic Music\", Ph. D Thesis, City University Department of Music, September 1995, Sheffield.</ref>\n\n==Performance practice==\nAcousmatic compositions are sometimes presented to audiences in concert settings that are often indistinguishable from acoustic recitals, albeit without performers. In an acousmatic concert the sound component is produced using pre-recorded media, or generated in [[Real-time computing|real-time]] using a [[computer]]. The sound material will then be distributed spatially, via multiple [[loudspeakers]], using a practice known as [[Sound diffusion|sound diffusion]]. The work is often ''diffused'' by the composer (if present) but the role of interpreter can also be assumed by another practitioner of the art. To provide a guideline for ''spatialisation'' of the work by an interpreter, many composers provide a ''diffusion score''; in its simplest form this might be a graphic representation of the acousmatic work with indications for spatial manipulations, relative to a time-line.<ref>Emmerson, Simon (2007). \"Living Electronic Music\", Aldershot, Hants: Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5546-6}}</ref>\n\n==The acousmatic experience==\nIn acousmatic music, listeners are challenged to distinguish sounds, not based on their source, but by their sonic quality. As Pierre Schaeffer writes in his ''Treatise on Musical Objects'' \"The concealment of the causes does not result from a technical imperfection, nor is it an occasional process of variation: it becomes a precondition, a deliberate placing-in-condition of the subject. It is ''toward it'', then, that the question turns around; \"what am I hearing?... What exactly are you hearing\" -in the sense that one asks the subject to describe not the external references of the sound it perceives but the perception itself.\" <ref>Cox, Christopher and Warner, Daniel. ''Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music'' Continuum Books (2002).</ref>\n\nThat music is acousmatic is determined more by ''how'' it is listened to, than by whether it is being played from a loudspeaker or not. In understanding the term 'acousmatic' appropriately, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between sound '''source''' and sound '''identity'''.<ref>Schaeffer, Pierre (1966), ''Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux'', Paris: \u00c9ditions du Seuil. {{OCLC|301664906}}</ref>\n\nIf for example a recording of a solo cello being played in a recognizable way is sounded through a loudspeaker, the source of the sound is the loudspeaker, but its identity is still 'cello' for a listener. Thus, acousmatic music can be said to be that which calls for the listener to perceive sound without (or with a reduced) sensibility to the sound's identity. The listening mode is oriented instead upon more abstract timbral than mimetic aspects of the sound. Pierre Schaeffer has referred to this as ''\u00e9coute r\u00e9duite''. It can be said that an ''\u00e9coute r\u00e9duite'' leads to the perception of music as acousmatic, in the sense that playing sounds from loudspeakers has the potential for obscuring their identity, as the visual reference is removed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Pierre |title=Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux |date=1966 |location=Le Seuil}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Austin, Larry, and Denis Smalley. \"Sound Diffusion in Composition and Performance: An Interview with Denis Smalley\".

It is the [[List of districts in Tamil Nadu|first district]] created in Tamil Nadu after the [[independence of India]] by splitting it from then-[[Salem district]] on 02 October, 1965. The other major towns in the district are [[Harur]], [[Palacode]], [[Kariamangalam|Karimangalam]], [[Nallampalli]] , [[Pennagaram]] and [[Pappireddipatti]]. Dharmapuri District is one of the major producers of mango in the state, fine quality [[granite]] is found in the district. It is also one of the main [[sericulture]] belts in the state. Around 30 percent of the district's area is under forest cover. [[Kaveri]] enters Tamil Nadu through this district. Most dangerous district\n\n==Etymology==\nDharmapuri was called ''Tagadur'' during the [[Sangam period|Sangam era]]. The name Tagadur is derived from two [[Tamil language|Tamil]] words, ''Tagadu'' meaning iron ore, and ''ur'' meaning place. The name Tagadur was changed to Dharmapuri after the Sangam period, possibly during the period of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] or the period of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. The name Tagadur is still used by some of the people of Dharmapuri.\n\n==History==\nThe region is believed to have been controlled by the [[Pallava dynasty]] in the 8th century. The [[Rashtrakuta]]s took over in the 9th century. They were defeated by the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] in the 11th century, and subsequently the district came under the Chola sphere of governance.<ref name=\"hstry\"/>\n\nDuring 18th century present day Dharmapuri district was part of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and was called Baramahal. As part of the [[Treaty of Seringapatam]] (signed on 18 March 1792) after the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]], Tipu Sultan agreed to give part of his territories including present-day Dharmapuri district to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] which was then merged into the [[Madras Presidency]] an [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|administrative subdivision]] of [[British India]].\n\nIt was part of the [[Salem District]] under British rule, until the founding of Dharmapuri district on 2 October 1965. The Dharmapuri district was split into Dharmapuri and [[Krishnagiri district]]s in 2004.<ref name=\"hstry\">{{cite web | url=http://www.dharmapuri.tn.nic.in/history.htm | title=History of Dharmapuri District | publisher=Dharmapuri District Official TN Website | accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> Many historical rock sculptures are found in this district. Modhur, a village near Dharmapuri has remains that date back to the Neolithic age. A government museum in Dharmapuri town displays some of these significant sculptures.\n\nThe district was the site of [[2012 Dharmapuri violence|anti-Dalit riots]] by Vanniyar community after the elopement of a Dalit boy and Vanniyar girl.\n\n==Geography==\nThe district is located between latitudes N 11 47\u2019 and 12 33\u2019 and longitudes E 77 02\u2019 and 78 40\u2019. Occupies an area of {{convert|4497.77|km\u00b2|abbr=on}} (i.e. 3.46% of Tamil Nadu). It is bounded on the north by [[Krishnagiri District]], on the east by [[Tiruvannamalai District]] and [[Kallakurichi district]], on the south by [[Salem District]], and on the west by Karnataka's [[Chamarajanagar District]]. The whole district is surrounded by hills and forests, and the terrain consists mostly of rolling plains. \n\n===Forests===\nThe whole district is predominantly covered with forests. Spider Valley located near [[Hogenakkal (village)|Hogenakkal]] is home to many wild animals. The district falls in the migratory path of elephants. Conflicts between man and elephant are most common in these parts. Many tribal communities depend on these forests. Vathalmalai, a mountain hamlet on top of Shervarayan hill chain has suitable conditions to cultivate coffee and [[jackfruit]]. Wild boars and [[spotted deer]] are commonly seen in Morappur and [[Harur]] forest region. [[Gaur]]s sometimes stroll near villages in the [[Bommidi]] region. [[Thoppur|Thoppur ghat]] has one of the area's scenic highways surrounded by mountains and forests.\n\n==Governance==\n[[Dharmapuri]] is the district headquarters. The district has been divided into two revenue divisions namely [[Dharmapuri]] and [[Harur]] consisting seven [[Tehsil|taluks]].\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nRevenue divisions: [[Dharmapuri]] and [[Harur]].\n\nRevenue taluks: [[Dharmapuri taluk|Dharmapuri]], [[Harur taluk|Harur]], [[Karimangalam taluk|Karimangalam]], [[Nallampalli taluk|Nallampalli]], [[Palacode taluk|Palacode]], [[Pappireddipatti taluk|Pappireddipatti]], [[Pennagaram taluk|Pennagaram]].\n\nTown Panchayats: [[Harur]], [[Morappur block|Morappur]], [[Marandahalli]], [[Bommidi]], [[Palakkodu]], [[Pennagaram]], [[Karimangalam]], [[Kambainallur]], [[Papparapatti, Dharmapuri|Papparapatti]], [[Kadathur]], [[Pappireddipatti]].\n\nPanchayat Unions: [[Dharmapuri]], [[Harur]], [[Nallampalli]], [[Palakkodu]], [[Pennagaram]], [[Karimangalam]], [[Morappur block|Morappur]], [[Pappireddipatti]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=3,28,897|13=1911|14=3,44,203|15=1921|16=3,28,877|17=1931|18=3,83,902|19=1941|20=4,43,969|21=1951|22=4,99,582|23=1961|24=6,15,809|25=1971|26=7,96,404|27=1981|28=9,40,175|29=1991|30=11,23,583|31=2001|32=12,95,182|33=2011|34=15,06,843|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}According to [[2011 census of India|2011 census]], Dharmapuri district had a population of 1,506,843 with a sex-ratio of 946 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929.<ref name=\"dashboard\">{{cite web|title=Census Info 2011 Final population totals|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/censusinfodashboard/index.html|publisher=Office of The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|year=2013|accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref> A total of 167,940 were under the age of six, constituting 87,777 males and 80,163 females.

It is the [[List of districts in Tamil Nadu|first district]] created in Tamil Nadu after the [[independence of India]] by splitting it from then-[[Salem district]] on 02 October, 1965. The other major towns in the district are [[Harur]], [[Palacode]], [[Kariamangalam|Karimangalam]], [[Nallampalli]] , [[Pennagaram]] and [[Pappireddipatti]]. Dharmapuri District is one of the major producers of mango in the state, fine quality [[granite]] is found in the district. It is also one of the main [[sericulture]] belts in the state. Around 30 percent of the district's area is under forest cover. [[Kaveri]] enters Tamil Nadu through this district.\n\n==Etymology==\nDharmapuri was called ''Tagadur'' during the [[Sangam period|Sangam era]]. The name Tagadur is derived from two [[Tamil language|Tamil]] words, ''Tagadu'' meaning iron ore, and ''ur'' meaning place. The name Tagadur was changed to Dharmapuri after the Sangam period, possibly during the period of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] or the period of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. The name Tagadur is still used by some of the people of Dharmapuri.\n\n==History==\nThe region is believed to have been controlled by the [[Pallava dynasty]] in the 8th century. The [[Rashtrakuta]]s took over in the 9th century. They were defeated by the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] in the 11th century, and subsequently the district came under the Chola sphere of governance.<ref name=\"hstry\"/>\n\nDuring 18th century present day Dharmapuri district was part of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and was called Baramahal. As part of the [[Treaty of Seringapatam]] (signed on 18 March 1792) after the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]], Tipu Sultan agreed to give part of his territories including present-day Dharmapuri district to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] which was then merged into the [[Madras Presidency]] an [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|administrative subdivision]] of [[British India]].\n\nIt was part of the [[Salem District]] under British rule, until the founding of Dharmapuri district on 2 October 1965. The Dharmapuri district was split into Dharmapuri and [[Krishnagiri district]]s in 2004.<ref name=\"hstry\">{{cite web | url=http://www.dharmapuri.tn.nic.in/history.htm | title=History of Dharmapuri District | publisher=Dharmapuri District Official TN Website | accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> Many historical rock sculptures are found in this district. Modhur, a village near Dharmapuri has remains that date back to the Neolithic age.

Spider Valley located near [[Hogenakkal (village)|Hogenakkal]] is home to many wild animals. The district falls in the migratory path of elephants. Conflicts between man and elephant are most common in these parts. Many tribal communities depend on these forests. Vathalmalai, a mountain hamlet on top of Shervarayan hill chain has suitable conditions to cultivate coffee and [[jackfruit]]. Wild boars and [[spotted deer]] are commonly seen in Morappur and [[Harur]] forest region. [[Gaur]]s sometimes stroll near villages in the [[Bommidi]] region.

The town is in the far west of the county, close to the borders of [[Hampshire]] and [[Berkshire]]; the boundaries intersect on the western edge of the town where all three counties converge on the A30 national route.

A settlement known as \"New Town\" grew in the area around the college which in 1831 was renamed Yorktown, after [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Philip Ralph Johnston |url=http://www.philipjohnston.com/rmas/history.htm |title=History of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst |publisher=Philipjohnston.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> At this time, the population was 702. In 1848, the first [[parish church]] of St. Michael, Yorktown was built by [[Henry Woodyer]], in an area formerly part of [[Frimley]], itself only a [[chapelry]] of [[Ash, Surrey|Ash]].\n\nLater, the [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]] was established to the east of the Academy, and a property speculator built the nearby Cambridge Hotel. The surrounding area became known as Cambridge Town, but was renamed \"Camberley\" in January 1877 to avoid confusion by the [[General Post Office]] with [[Cambridge]] in Cambridgeshire. The renaming of Camberley was mentioned in the 1963 film adaptation of [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Lord of the Flies (1963 film)|Lord of the Flies]]''. The character [[Lord of the Flies#Piggy|Piggy]] states that the new name consisted of three parts; \"Cam\" taken from the original name of Cambridgetown, \"ber\" which means 'river', because there are many rivers in the area, and \"ley\" because it is a common ending for English town names in the area (as in neighbouring [[Frimley]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/lord-of-the-flies-script.html |title=Film script for Lord of the Flies |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> although the name was actually derived from the \"Cam\" stream which runs through the town (mainly underground), \"Amber\" Hill which was marked on [[John Norden]]'s map of the area in 1607 and \"ley\" usually meaning a clearing in the woodland.<ref>George C. B. Poulter, ''The History of Camberley'', 1937</ref> Hugh Edwards, the child actor who played Piggy, attended Camberley Primary School which was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the town centre redevelopment.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Camberley grew in size. This was given added impetus with the arrival of the branch-line railway and [[Camberley railway station|railway station]] in 1878 and a reputation for healthy air, due to the vast number of pine trees, which were said to be good for those suffering from [[pulmonary disorder]]s. By the end of the century the population had reached 8,400. Since then, the town has absorbed the original settlement of Yorktown, which is now regarded as part of Camberley.\n\n===20th century===\nThe Southern Scott Scramble, the first known [[motorcycle scrambling]] event, took place on Camberley Heath on 29 March 1924. The event, won by A.B. Sparks, attracted a crowd in the thousands and is considered to be the first instance of what later developed in the sport of [[motocross]]. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Old Dean]] common was used as an instruction camp of the Free French Forces. The [[Kremer prize]] was conceived in the Cambridge Hotel in Camberley in 1959 after Henry Kremer toured a Microcell factory.\n\nBarossa Golf Club (now defunct) was located on Barossa Common. The club was founded in 1893 and continued until WW2.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=802 \u201cBarossa Golf Club, Camberley\u201d], \u201cGolf\u2019s Missing Links\u201d.</ref>\n\nThe Old Dean housing estate was built in the 1950s on the \"Old Dean Common\" for residents of heavily bombed Surrey-area's homeless after World War II. Many of the roads on that half of the Old Dean are named after areas of London, with the others named after places on the common.\n\nCamberley falls under the siren test area of [[Broadmoor Hospital]], a secure mental hospital in nearby [[Crowthorne]]. The siren was installed following a public outcry at the escape of child-murderer [[John Thomas Straffen]] in April 1952. The siren is still tested every Monday at 10am.\n\nIn 1969 there was an outbreak of [[rabies]] when a dog, just released from a sixth month [[quarantine]] after returning from Germany, attacked two people on Camberley Common. The scare resulted in restriction orders for dogs and large-scale shoots to carry out the destruction of foxes and other wildlife.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.historytoday.com/neil-pemberton/mad-dogs-and-englishmen|title=Mad Dogs and Englishmen|magazine=History Today|issue=9|volume=57|author=Neil Pemberton|year=2007|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nAfter debate and delay (plans having been discussed for over half a decade), in 2006, a {{convert|7|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed-use development west of Park Street named The Atrium was built of residential, leisure and retail buildings with wide pedestrianised areas and 683 public parking spaces. Its 217 mid-rise apartments split into courtyards in the [[Barcelona]] style.  Fourteen new retail units face directly onto Park Street, opposite the Main Square shopping centre. Park Street has been [[pedestrianised]] and landscaped as part of the development. Leisure facilities include a nine-screen cinema, a [[bowling alley]], a health and fitness club, caf\u00e9s and restaurants. Various elements of The Atrium was opened during 2008, with the final elements, the main cinema and bowling alley, opening in October and November 2008, respectively.<ref>[http://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/council/theatrium/default.htm Surrey Heath Website \u2013 Atrium Update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719115737/http://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/council/theatrium/default.htm |date=19 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the town's households were named by [[Experian]] as having the highest [[carbon footprint]] in the UK, estimated at 28.05 tonnes per household per year (compared to 18.36 tonnes for the lowest, South Shields).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.experian.co.uk/search/index.html?cx=018221729092257204127%3A2-4ig1wazeo&cof=FORID%3A10%3BNB%3A1&ie=UTF-8&q=camberley&sa.x=0&sa.y=0&sa=Search|title=Carbon footprint |publisher=Experian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCamberley is in the far west of Surrey, adjacent to the boundaries of [[Hampshire]]'s [[Hart district]] and [[Berkshire]]'s [[Bracknell Forest]] district. It lies directly between the A30 national route and [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]] (junction 4 exit). It is at the northern edge of the [[Blackwater Valley]] conurbation, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} south of [[Bracknell]] and {{convert|17|mi|km}} east of [[Basingstoke]].\n\nThe smaller town of [[Frimley]], being so close to Camberley, is often regarded as part of the town, although the two are, for the most part, separated by the M3 motorway. Frimley has its own town centre, a major regional hospital ([[Frimley Park Hospital|Frimley Park]]) and extensive suburban areas. In the 19th century, York Town and Camberley were in the ecclesiastical parish of Frimley.\n\nThe exurb [[Blackwater, Hampshire|Blackwater]], {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west is identified by the Government Statistical Service (including its ONS office) as within the Built-up-Area but is in the Hart District of Hampshire and has its own town council (both take in [[Hawley, Hampshire|Hawley]]). The same could be said for [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]] which is home of \"The Meadows\" retail park which is in the Bracknell Forest borough of [[Berkshire]].  The [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] is located in Camberley, despite the name suggesting otherwise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Location|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/24490.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n[[Camberley]]'s [[town centre]] is host to ''The Square'' shopping centre (previously called The Mall), controversially purchased by Surrey Heath Borough Council for \u00a3110 million in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Parker |first1=Graham |title=Surrey Heath stands by \u00a3110m purchase of Camberley centre |url=https://www.propertyweek.com/markets/surrey-heath-stands-by-110m-purchase-of-camberley-centre/5099706.article |accessdate=25 January 2020 |publisher=Property Week |date=9 November 2018}}</ref> This is a late 1980s development anchored by rent free stores such as Sports Direct subsidiary [[House of Fraser]].

The programme of the theatre comprises music concerts, contemporary and classical drama, comedy evenings, an annual professional pantomime and cinema films.  The theatre is also used by local recreational actors, musicians, landscape artists and dance schools, advertising all tickets on its own website for productions.<ref>[http://www.camberleytheatre.co.uk Camberley Theatre official website] Accessed 2015-04-09.</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Whiteelephant5-wyrdlight.jpg|thumb|Camberley's White Elephant]]\nA familiar landmark in Camberley is the concrete pipe white elephant which is on the [[A30 road|A30]] approaching The Meadows roundabout.

The surrounding area became known as Cambridge Town, but was renamed \"Camberley\" in January 1877 to avoid confusion by the [[General Post Office]] with [[Cambridge]] in Cambridgeshire. The renaming of Camberley was mentioned in the 1963 film adaptation of [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Lord of the Flies (1963 film)|Lord of the Flies]]''. The character [[Lord of the Flies#Piggy|Piggy]] states that the new name consisted of three parts; \"Cam\" taken from the original name of Cambridgetown, \"ber\" which means 'river', because there are many rivers in the area, and \"ley\" because it is a common ending for English town names in the area (as in neighbouring [[Frimley]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/lord-of-the-flies-script.html |title=Film script for Lord of the Flies |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> although the name was actually derived from the \"Cam\" stream which runs through the town (mainly underground), \"Amber\" Hill which was marked on [[John Norden]]'s map of the area in 1607 and \"ley\" usually meaning a clearing in the woodland.<ref>George C.

This was given added impetus with the arrival of the branch-line railway and [[Camberley railway station|railway station]] in 1878 and a reputation for healthy air, due to the vast number of pine trees, which were said to be good for those suffering from [[pulmonary disorder]]s. By the end of the century the population had reached 8,400. Since then, the town has absorbed the original settlement of Yorktown, which is now regarded as part of Camberley.\n\n===20th century===\nThe Southern Scott Scramble, the first known [[motorcycle scrambling]] event, took place on Camberley Heath on 29 March 1924.

During the [[Second World War]], the [[Old Dean]] common was used as an instruction camp of the Free French Forces. The [[Kremer prize]] was conceived in the Cambridge Hotel in Camberley in 1959 after Henry Kremer toured a Microcell factory.\n\nBarossa Golf Club (now defunct) was located on Barossa Common.

declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection.\n\nAnd taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe.\n\nThe European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots.\u00a0As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\n\nAfter consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans.\n\nTo keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.\u00a0The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.\u00a0These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.\n\nThere will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval.\u00a0Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.\u00a0These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea.\u00a0And, as their situation improves, we will reevaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.\n\nEarlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.\n\nWe are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time.\u00a0These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.\n\nAdditionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies.\u00a0Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day.\u00a0We are moving very quickly.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans: The risk is very, very low.\u00a0Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus.\u00a0The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions.\u00a0The elderly population must be very, very careful.\n\nIn particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits.\u00a0In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas.\n\nMy administration is coordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings.\n\nSmart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow.\n\nEvery community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts \u2014 and they are the best.\n\nFor all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene.\u00a0Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus.\u00a0 Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home.\n\nTo ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief.\u00a0This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.\n\nI will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.\n\nBecause of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far.\n\nOur banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong.\u00a0Our unemployment is at a historic low.\u00a0This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.\n\nThis is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.\n\nHowever, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions:\u00a0I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus.\n\nEffective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories.\u00a0These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus.\u00a0To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion.\n\nUsing emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted.\u00a0This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.\n\nFinally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief.\u00a0Hopefully they will consider this very strongly.\n\nWe are at a critical time in the fight against the virus.\u00a0We made a life-saving move with early action on China.\u00a0Now we must take the same action with Europe.\u00a0 We will not delay.\u00a0I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people.\u00a0I will always put the well-being of America first.\n\nIf we are vigilant \u2014 and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will \u2014 we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus.\u00a0The virus will not have a chance against us.\n\nNo nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.\u00a0We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world.\n\nWe are all in this together.\u00a0We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family.\n\nAs history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity.\n\nOur future remains brighter than anyone can imagine.\u00a0Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before.\n\nGod bless you, and God bless America.

Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic. We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people.\n\nThis is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.\u00a0I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.\n\nFrom the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats.\u00a0 This is the way it always was and always will be.\u00a0 It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.\n\nOur team is the best anywhere in the world.\u00a0At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years.\u00a0We
