Other factors, including the continued hostility from the Kandian government and a rival cinnamon trade from China, led to a 40% decline in the volume of cinnamon exported between 1785 and 1791. Despite attempts to clear land around Negombo and create cinnamon plantations, by the time the British commander [[Colonel Stuart]] took over the trade in 1796, it was clear that the industry was in decline. Poor policies put in place by [[Frederick North]] the first [[Governor of British Ceylon]] exacerbated the problem. By the 1830s commercial interest had moved elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the British takeover of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815, Negombo lost its strategic value as an outpost of Colombo. However it continued to develop in commercial influence. The Negombo fishery was at the heart of the seafood trade in Ceylon, and many migrant fisherman arrived annually with the profits of their ventures going into the small, prosperous town. In 1907 Negombo was connected to the massive railway project that was linking the island together under British control and encouraging the growth of plantations in coconuts, tea and coffee.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - SRI LANKAN FISHING BOAT. 2.jpg|thumb|A traditional fishing boat]]\nNegombo is about {{convert|2|m|0}} above sea level, and Negombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The Dutch canal flows in the heart of the city. The lagoon is one of the most scenic landmarks of Negombo. There are over 190 species of wildlife and plenty of birds in its mangroves. The northern border of the city is formed by the Ma Oya river which meets the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nNegombo features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The city receives rainfall mainly from the Southwestern monsoons from May to August and October to January. During the remaining months there is a little precipitation due to [[Convective]] rains. The average annual precipitation is about {{convert|2,400|mm|0}}. The average temperature varies {{convert|24|C|0}} to {{convert|30|C|0}}, and there are high humidity levels from February to April.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Negombo, Sri Lanka\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 30\n|Feb high C = 31\n|Mar high C = 31\n|Apr high C = 31\n|May high C = 31\n|Jun high C = 29\n|Jul high C = 29\n|Aug high C = 29\n|Sep high C = 29\n|Oct high C = 29\n|Nov high C = 29\n|Dec high C = 29\n|year high C = 30\n|Jan low C = 22\n|Feb low C = 22\n|Mar low C = 23\n|Apr low C = 24\n|May low C = 26\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 25\n|Aug low C = 25\n|Sep low C = 25\n|Oct low C = 24\n|Nov low C = 23\n|Dec low C = 22\n|year low C = 24\n|Jan precipitation mm = 89\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69\n|Mar precipitation mm = 147\n|Apr precipitation mm = 231\n|May precipitation mm = 371\n|Jun precipitation mm = 224\n|Jul precipitation mm = 135\n|Aug precipitation mm = 109\n|Sep precipitation mm = 160\n|Oct precipitation mm = 348\n|Nov precipitation mm = 315\n|Dec precipitation mm = 147\n|year precipitation mm = 2345\n|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Negombo Lagoon ==\n\n[[Negombo Lagoon]] is large semi-enclosed coastal water body with plenty of natural resources. The lagoon is fed by number of small rivers and the Dutch canal. It is linked to the Indian Ocean by a narrow channel to the north, near Negombo city. The lagoon and the marsh land area also support local agriculture and forestry. It has extensive mangrove swamps and attracts a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon supports so many distinct species of flora, fauna and as well as another species of birds and variety of animals. [[Negombo Lagoon]] is a major local and tourist attraction primarily for sightseeing and boating tours.\n\nThe fishermen who are based at the Negombo lagoon live in abject poverty in shanty [[thatch palm]] villages along the water's edge. They rely mainly on their traditional knowledge of the seasons for their livelihood, using [[outrigger canoe]]s carved out of tree trunks and nylon nets to bring in modest catches from September through April. Their boats are made in two forms \u2013 oruvas (a type of [[sailing canoe]]) and paruvas (a large, man-powered [[catamaran]] fitted with kurlon dividers). The men are regularly forced to head out to the ocean to fish, often losing money in the [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] process.

Other factors, including the continued hostility from the Kandian government and a rival cinnamon trade from China, led to a 40% decline in the volume of cinnamon exported between 1785 and 1791. Despite attempts to clear land around Negombo and create cinnamon plantations, by the time the British commander [[Colonel Stuart]] took over the trade in 1796, it was clear that the industry was in decline. Poor policies put in place by [[Frederick North]] the first [[Governor of British Ceylon]] exacerbated the problem. By the 1830s commercial interest had moved elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the British takeover of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815, Negombo lost its strategic value as an outpost of Colombo. However it continued to develop in commercial influence. The Negombo fishery was at the heart of the seafood trade in Ceylon, and many migrant fisherman arrived annually with the profits of their ventures going into the small, prosperous town. In 1907 Negombo was connected to the massive railway project that was linking the island together under British control and encouraging the growth of plantations in coconuts, tea and coffee.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - SRI LANKAN FISHING BOAT. 2.jpg|thumb|A traditional fishing boat]]\nNegombo is about 2 meters above sea level, and Negombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The Dutch canal flows in the heart of the city. The lagoon is one of the most scenic landmarks of Negombo. There are over 190 species of wildlife and plenty of birds in its mangroves. The northern border of the city is formed by the Ma Oya river which meets the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nNegombo features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The city receives rainfall mainly from the Southwestern monsoons from May to August and October to January. During the remaining months there is a little precipitation due to [[Convective]] rains. The average annual precipitation is about 2400 millimetres. The average temperature varies 24 to 30 degrees Celsius, and there are high humidity levels from February to April.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Negombo, Sri Lanka\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 30\n|Feb high C = 31\n|Mar high C = 31\n|Apr high C = 31\n|May high C = 31\n|Jun high C = 29\n|Jul high C = 29\n|Aug high C = 29\n|Sep high C = 29\n|Oct high C = 29\n|Nov high C = 29\n|Dec high C = 29\n|year high C = 30\n|Jan low C = 22\n|Feb low C = 22\n|Mar low C = 23\n|Apr low C = 24\n|May low C = 26\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 25\n|Aug low C = 25\n|Sep low C = 25\n|Oct low C = 24\n|Nov low C = 23\n|Dec low C = 22\n|year low C = 24\n|Jan precipitation mm = 89\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69\n|Mar precipitation mm = 147\n|Apr precipitation mm = 231\n|May precipitation mm = 371\n|Jun precipitation mm = 224\n|Jul precipitation mm = 135\n|Aug precipitation mm = 109\n|Sep precipitation mm = 160\n|Oct precipitation mm = 348\n|Nov precipitation mm = 315\n|Dec precipitation mm = 147\n|year precipitation mm = 2345\n|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Negombo Lagoon ==\n\n[[Negombo Lagoon]] is large semi-enclosed coastal water body with plenty of natural resources. The lagoon is fed by number of small rivers and the Dutch canal. It is linked to the Indian Ocean by a narrow channel to the north, near Negombo city. The lagoon and the marsh land area also support local agriculture and forestry. It has extensive mangrove swamps and attracts a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon supports so many distinct species of flora, fauna and as well as another species of birds and variety of animals. [[Negombo Lagoon]] is a major local and tourist attraction primarily for sightseeing and boating tours.\n\nThe fishermen who are based at the Negombo lagoon live in abject poverty in shanty [[thatch palm]] villages along the water's edge. They rely mainly on their traditional knowledge of the seasons for their livelihood, using [[outrigger canoe]]s carved out of tree trunks and nylon nets to bring in modest catches from September through April. Their boats are made in two forms \u2013 oruvas (a type of [[sailing canoe]]) and paruvas (a large, man-powered [[catamaran]] fitted with kurlon dividers). The men are regularly forced to head out to the ocean to fish, often losing money in the [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] process.
