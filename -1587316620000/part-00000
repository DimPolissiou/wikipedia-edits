Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]]. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]]. Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]]. Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system. Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevent the action of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis.

Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]]. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]]. Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture.

A total of 204 aircraft were produced from 1957 to 1978 powered by several different engines; four {{convert|3300|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] [[turbojet]]s, then [[Garrett TFE731]] turbofans for a {{convert|44500|lb|t}} [[MTOW]], then two [[General Electric CF700]] turbofans.\n\nThe smaller, {{convert|17760|lb|t}} MTOW [[North American Sabreliner]] first flew on 16 September 1958. Powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] turbojet engines then [[Garrett TFE731]]s, more than 800 were produced from 1959 to 1982.\n\nDesigned in 1957, the [[McDonnell 119]] was delayed by the cancellation of the [[Fairchild J83]] engine program, and first flew on 11 February 1959 powered by four [[Westinghouse J34]] turbojets. The 119 was certified for a {{convert|45328|lb|t|1}} MTOW with four Pratt & Whitney JT12 or General Electric CF700 engines, but no firm orders were received, and only the single prototype was completed.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Francillon |first=Ren\u00e9 |date=1990 |title=McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Since 1920 |volume=II  |location=Annapolis, Maryland |publisher=Naval Institute Press |pages=241\u2013243 |isbn=1-55750-550-0 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1960s first flight ===\n[[File:Air Zoo Learjet II.JPG|thumb|The 1963 [[Learjet 23]] was the first light jet.]]\n[[File:Grumman G-1159 Gulfstream II-SP AN0489926.jpg|thumb|The first large, long range jet was the [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] in 1966.]]\n\nThe {{convert|25000|lb|t}} MTOW [[British Aerospace 125]] first flew on 13 August 1962 as the de Havilland DH.125, powered by two {{convert|3000|lbf|kN}}  [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] turbojets. Its engines were replaced by Garrett TFE731s, then [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300]] turbofans. Almost 1,700 aircraft of all variants, including the [[Hawker 800]], were produced between 1962 and 2013.\n\nThe Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander, which later became the [[IAI Westwind]], first flew on 27 January 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CJ610]] turbojets, then [[Garrett TFE731]]s. Production of Jet Commanders and Westwinds from 1965 to 1987 came to 442 aircraft; and it was developed as the [[IAI Astra]], later re-branded as the [[Gulfstream G100]].\n\nThe {{convert|29,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Dassault Falcon 20]] first flew on 4 May 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CF700]]s, then [[Garrett ATF3]] turbofans and [[Garrett TFE731]]s. A total of 508 were built from 1963 to 1988, and it is the basis of the [[Dassault Falcon]] family.\n\nThe first light jet first flew on 7 October 1963 : the [[Learjet 23]]. Powered by two {{convert|2,850|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CJ610]]s, its {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} MTOW complies with [[FAR Part 23]] regulations. The first member of the [[Learjet]] family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.\n\nThe forward wing sweep, {{convert|20,280|lb|t}} MTOW [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet]] first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.\nThe joint Piaggo-Douglas, {{convert|18,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Piaggio PD.808]] first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]]s, 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.\n\nOn 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the {{convert|65,500|lb|t}} MTOW [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], powered by two {{convert|11,400|lbf|kN}} [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofans. From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs.

Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:NASA JetStar.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed JetStar]] is the earliest business jet]]\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Lockheed JetStar]], seating ten passengers and two crew, first flew on 4 September 1957. A total of 204 aircraft were produced from 1957 to 1978 powered by several different engines; four {{convert|3300|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] [[turbojet]]s, then [[Garrett TFE731]] turbofans for a {{convert|44500|lb|t}} [[MTOW]], then two [[General Electric CF700]] turbofans.\n\nThe smaller, {{convert|17760|lb|t}} MTOW [[North American Sabreliner]] first flew on 16 September 1958. Powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] turbojet engines then [[Garrett TFE731]]s, more than 800 were produced from 1959 to 1982.\n\nDesigned in 1957, the [[McDonnell 119]] was delayed by the cancellation of the [[Fairchild J83]] engine program, and first flew on 11 February 1959 powered by four [[Westinghouse J34]] turbojets. The 119 was certified for a {{convert|45328|lb|t|1}} MTOW with four Pratt & Whitney JT12 or General Electric CF700 engines, but no firm orders were received, and only the single prototype was completed.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Francillon |first=Ren\u00e9 |date=1990 |title=McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Since 1920 |volume=II  |location=Annapolis, Maryland |publisher=Naval Institute Press |pages=241\u2013243 |isbn=1-55750-550-0 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1960s first flight ===\n[[File:Air Zoo Learjet II.JPG|thumb|The 1963 [[Learjet 23]] was the first light jet.]]\n[[File:Grumman G-1159 Gulfstream II-SP AN0489926.jpg|thumb|The first large, long range jet was the [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] in 1966.]]\n\nThe {{convert|25000|lb|t}} MTOW [[British Aerospace 125]] first flew on 13 August 1962 as the de Havilland DH.125, powered by two {{convert|3000|lbf|kN}}  [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] turbojets. Its engines were replaced by Garrett TFE731s, then [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300]] turbofans. Almost 1,700 aircraft of all variants, including the [[Hawker 800]], were produced between 1962 and 2013.\n\nThe Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander, which later became the [[IAI Westwind]], first flew on 27 January 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CJ610]] turbojets, then [[Garrett TFE731]]s. Production of Jet Commanders and Westwinds from 1965 to 1987 came to 442 aircraft; and it was developed as the [[IAI Astra]], later re-branded as the [[Gulfstream G100]].\n\nThe {{convert|29,000|lb|t}} MOTW [[Dassault Falcon 20]] first flew on 4 May 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CF700]]s, then [[Garrett ATF3]] turbofans and [[Garrett TFE731]]s. A total of 508 were built from 1963 to 1988, and it is the basis of the [[Dassault Falcon]] family.\n\nThe first light jet first flew on 7 October 1963 : the [[Learjet 23]]. Powered by two {{convert|2,850|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CJ610]]s, its {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} MTOW complies with [[FAR Part 23]] regulations. The first member of the [[Learjet]] family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.\n\nThe forward wing sweep, {{convert|20,280|lb|t}} MOTW [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet]] first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.\nThe joint Piaggo-Douglas, {{convert|18,000|lb|t}} MOTW [[Piaggio PD.808]] first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]]s, 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.\n\nOn 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the {{convert|65,500|lb|t}} MTOW [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], powered by two {{convert|11,400|lbf|kN}} [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofans. From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].\n\n{{As of|2020|01}}, IMDb has approximately {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum:6,534,894 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> titles (including episodes) and {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum: 10,378,806 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> personalities in its database,<ref name=\"stats\"/> as well as 83 million registered users.\n\nIMDb began as a movie database on the [[Usenet]] group \"rec.arts.movies\" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.\n\n==Features==\nThe movie and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all internet users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.\n\nMost data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting factual data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.\n\nAll registered users choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a ''profile page'' which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, \"badges\" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb ''page'', then that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in IMDbPRO.<ref>{{cite web |title=Submission guide for users |series=Help Center |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=2&file=contact_information&ref_=hlp_sr_1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages.\n\nUsers are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]]-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter [[ballot-stuffing]].\n\nIn January 2019, IMDb launched a free movie streaming platform called Freedive, an [[ad-supported]] service offering Hollywood movie titles and TV shows. Many Freedive titles are licensed from [[Sony Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Mehta |first=Ivan |url=https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/01/11/amazons-new-imdb-freedive-service-streams-ad-supported-movies-and-tv-shows-in-the-us/ |title=Amazon's new IMDb Freedive service streams ad-supported movies and TV shows in the US |work=[[The Next Web]] |date=2019-01-11 |accessdate=2019-01-11 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===History before website===\nIMDb originated with a [[Usenet]] posting entitled \"Those Eyes\", by the British film fan and computer programmer [[Col Needham]],<ref>{{cite newsgroup\n | title = Re: Frequently Asked Questions List (2/28/90)\n | author = Jeff Dalton\n | date = 1 March 1990 \n | newsgroup = rec.arts.movies\n | message-id = 1892@skye.ed.ac.uk\n | url = https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.arts.movies/_3XDw1YOp6A/11SgWWh24wsJ\n | access-date = 13 August 2019\n }}</ref> about actresses with beautiful eyes. Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List\", while Dave Knight began a \"[[film director|Directors]] List\", and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List\". Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors/Actresses List\". Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\n\nBy late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000&nbsp;movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of [[Unix]] [[shell script]]s that could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chmielewski |first=Dawn C. |date=January 19, 2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/business/la-fi-himi-needham-20130120 |title=Col Needham created IMDb |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> At the time, it was known as the \"rec.arts.movies movie database\".\n\n===On the web===\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, in 1993, it moved onto the fledgling [[World Wide Web]] under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |title=Historical Internet Movie Database Site |publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science & Informatics |access-date=March 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324121844/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in Wales. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[Web mirror|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB History |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===As an independent company===\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. founder Col&nbsp;Needham became the primary owner.

On January 15, 2002, it added a subscription service known as IMDbPro, aimed at entertainment professionals. IMDbPro was announced and launched at the 2002 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It provides a variety of services including film production and box office details, a company directory, and the ability of subscribers to add personal information pages with details at variance.\n\nAs an additional incentive for users, {{as of|2003|lc=y}}, users identified as one of \"the top 100&nbsp;contributors\" of hard data received complimentary free access to IMDbPro for the following calendar year; for 2006 this was increased to the top&nbsp;150 contributors, and for 2010 to the top&nbsp;250.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/updates/guide/top_contributors#top2010 |series=IMD; announcement |title=Top&nbsp;250 contributors for 2010 |access-date=August 25, 2011 |first=Col |last=Needham |date=January 1, 2011 |website=IMDb}}</ref> In 2008, IMDb launched their first official foreign-language version with the German IMDb.de.

IMDbPro can be accessed by anyone willing to pay the fee, which is US$19.99&nbsp;per month, or if paid annually, US$149.99. Membership enables a user to access the rank order of each industry personality, as well as agent contact information for any actor, producer, director etc. that has an IMDb page. Enrolling in IMDbPro enables members who are industry personnel to upload a head shot to open their page, as well as to upload hundreds of photos to accompany their page. Anyone can register as an IMDb user and contribute to the site as well as view its content; however those users enrolled in IMDbPro have greater access and privileges.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://secure.imdb.com/signup/index.html |title=IMDbPro signup |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==Characters' filmography==\nOn October 2, 2007,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} the characters' filmography was added. Character entries are created from character listings in the main filmography database, and as such do not need any additional verification by IMDb staff. They have already been verified when they are added to the main filmography.\n\n==IMDb TV==\nOn January 10, 2019, IMDb launched Freedive, a [[streaming service]] that offers certain films free with [[advertisements]]. Due to international licensing restrictions, the service currently is only available in the [[United States]] as of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazons-imdb-launches-freedive-free-movie-tv-streaming-service-ads/|title=Amazon's IMDb launches Freedive, a free movie and TV streaming service \u2014 with ads|date=2019-01-10|website=GeekWire|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nFreedive was the company's second attempt at a streaming service.

Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like  [[Discogs]], or [[OpenStreetMap]], or [[Wikipedia]], in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/interfaces#plain |title=The plain text data files |series=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: \"We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an 'edit page.'

Since 2007, IMDb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses, parental guides, and FAQs about titles as determined by (and answered by) individual contributors.\n\n===Data format and access===\nIMDb does not provide an [[Web API|API]] for automated queries. However, most of the data can be downloaded as [[data compression|compressed]] plain text files and the information can be extracted using the [[command-line interface]] tools provided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/interfaces |title=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb |access-date=January 15, 2007}}</ref> There is also a Java-based [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information.<ref name=\"jmdb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.de/ |title=Java Movie Database (JMDB) |website=Jmdb.de |access-date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb.

The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb's [[English language]] sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and USA to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).\n\n==Ancillary features==\n===User ratings of films===\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a [[rating scale]] that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten. It has been alleged that the rating system is flawed, for several reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/imdbs-top-250-discussion/|title=Why IMDb's Top&nbsp;250 matters ... and why it doesn't |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=April 13, 2010 |access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a [[weighted mean]] that is displayed for each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used to avoid [[ballot stuffing]]; the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.\n\n====Rankings====\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. {{As of|2019|10|21}}, ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' is #1 on the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/top |title=Top&nbsp;250 movies as voted by our users |publisher=IMDb |access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The \"Top&nbsp;250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top&nbsp;250 list they \"''deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter''\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=1&file=notintop250 |title=The user votes average on film or show ''X'' is 9.4, so it should appear in your Top&nbsp;250 Movies or TV list, yet it doesn't. Why? |website=IMDb}}</ref> In addition to other weightings, the Top&nbsp;250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in [[actuarial science]] as a ''credibility formula''.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |title=Encyclopedia of Actuarial Science |last=Norberg |first=Ragnar |doi=10.1002/9780470012505.tac068 |chapter=Credibility Theory |year=2006 |isbn=0470846763|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515175331/http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf|archive-date=May 15, 2004}}</ref> This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB's statement on their voting calculation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4Ze0vwNLI |website=imdb.com |access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB Vote FAQ |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<math display=\"block\">W = \\frac{\\ R \\cdot v + C \\cdot m\\ }{v + m} </math>\nwhere:\n*<math>W\\ </math> = weighted rating\n*<math>R\\ </math> = average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)\n*<math>v\\ </math> = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\n*<math>m\\ </math> = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25,000)\n*<math>C\\ </math> = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)\n\nThe <math>W\\ </math> in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (''see [[Bayesian statistics]]'').\n\nThe IMDb also has a Bottom&nbsp;100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 1500&nbsp;votes must be received to qualify for the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom |title=Bottom&nbsp;100 |publisher=IMDb |access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Top&nbsp;250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV&nbsp;episodes are not currently included.\n\nSince 2015, there has been a Top&nbsp;250 list devoted to ranking television shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/ |title=Top&nbsp;250 TV |website=IMDb |access-date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Message boards===\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, TV episodes<ref>Each TV episode uses the same message board for the whole series</ref>) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. In order to post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company [[Amazon.com]].

An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].\n\n{{As of|2020|01}}, IMDb has approximately {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum:6,534,894 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> titles (including episodes) and {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum: 10,378,806 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> personalities in its database,<ref name=\"stats\"/> as well as 83 million registered users.\n\nIMDb began as a movie database on the [[Usenet]] group \"rec.arts.movies\" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.\n\n==Features==\nThe movie and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all internet users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.\n\nMost data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting factual data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.\n\nAll registered users choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a ''profile page'' which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, \"badges\" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb ''page'', then that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in IMDbPRO.<ref>{{cite web |title=Submission guide for users |series=Help Center |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=2&file=contact_information&ref_=hlp_sr_1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages.\n\nUsers are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]]-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter [[ballot-stuffing]].\n\nIn January 2019, IMDb launched a free movie streaming platform called Freedive, an [[ad-supported]] service offering Hollywood movie titles and TV shows.

Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List\", while Dave Knight began a \"[[film director|Directors]] List\", and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List\". Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors/Actresses List\". Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\n\nBy late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000&nbsp;movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of [[Unix]] [[shell script]]s that could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chmielewski |first=Dawn C. |date=January 19, 2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/business/la-fi-himi-needham-20130120 |title=Col Needham created IMDb |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> At the time, it was known as the \"rec.arts.movies movie database\".\n\n===On the web===\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, in 1993, it moved onto the fledgling [[World Wide Web]] under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |title=Historical Internet Movie Database Site |publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science & Informatics |access-date=March 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324121844/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in Wales. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[Web mirror|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB History |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===As an independent company===\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. founder Col&nbsp;Needham became the primary owner.

Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like  [[Discogs]], or [[OpenStreetMap]], or [[Wikipedia]], in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/interfaces#plain |title=The plain text data files |series=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: \"We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an 'edit page.'

However, most of the data can be downloaded as [[data compression|compressed]] plain text files and the information can be extracted using the [[command-line interface]] tools provided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/interfaces |title=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb |access-date=January 15, 2007}}</ref> There is also a Java-based [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information.<ref name=\"jmdb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.de/ |title=Java Movie Database (JMDB) |website=Jmdb.de |access-date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb.

The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb's [[English language]] sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and USA to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).\n\n==Ancillary features==\n===User ratings of films===\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a [[rating scale]] that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten. It has been alleged that the rating system is flawed, for several reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/imdbs-top-250-discussion/|title=Why IMDb's Top&nbsp;250 matters ... and why it doesn't |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=April 13, 2010 |access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a [[weighted mean]] that is displayed for each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used to avoid [[ballot stuffing]]; the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.\n\n====Rankings====\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. {{As of|2019|10|21}}, ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' is #1 on the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/top |title=Top&nbsp;250 movies as voted by our users |publisher=IMDb |access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The \"Top&nbsp;250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top&nbsp;250 list they \"''deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter''\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=1&file=notintop250 |title=The user votes average on film or show ''X'' is 9.4, so it should appear in your Top&nbsp;250 Movies or TV list, yet it doesn't. Why? |website=IMDb}}</ref> In addition to other weightings, the Top&nbsp;250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in [[actuarial science]] as a ''credibility formula''.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |title=Encyclopedia of Actuarial Science |last=Norberg |first=Ragnar |doi=10.1002/9780470012505.tac068 |chapter=Credibility Theory |year=2006 |isbn=0470846763|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515175331/http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf|archive-date=May 15, 2004}}</ref> This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB's statement on their voting calculation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4Ze0vwNLI |website=imdb.com |access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB Vote FAQ |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<math display=\"block\">W = \\frac{\\ R \\cdot v + C \\cdot m\\ }{v + m} </math>\nwhere:\n*<math>W\\ </math> = weighted rating\n*<math>R\\ </math> = average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)\n*<math>v\\ </math> = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\n*<math>m\\ </math> = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25,000)\n*<math>C\\ </math> = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)\n\nThe <math>W\\ </math> in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (''see [[Bayesian statistics]]'').\n\nThe IMDb also has a Bottom&nbsp;100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 1500&nbsp;votes must be received to qualify for the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom |title=Bottom&nbsp;100 |publisher=IMDb |access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Top&nbsp;250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV&nbsp;episodes are not currently included.\n\nSince 2015, there has been a Top&nbsp;250 list devoted to ranking television shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/ |title=Top&nbsp;250 TV |website=IMDb |access-date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Message boards===\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, TV episodes<ref>Each TV episode uses the same message board for the whole series</ref>) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. In order to post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company [[Amazon.com]]. Message boards expanded in recent years. The Soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects.

{"title_page": "Asesela Ravuvu", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\n'''Asesela Ravuvu''' (10 May 1931 \u2014 11 March 2008) was a [[Fiji]]an academic and political leader.  The Director of Pacific Studies at the [[University of the South Pacific]], [[Professor]] Ravuvu was appointed to the Fijian [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]] by the [[Great Council of Chiefs]] in 2001, to one of the 14 Senate seats (out of 32 in total) allocated to the Great Council.  As of September 2005, he held the position of [[Leader of the House (Fiji)|Leader of the House]] in the Senate, but retired from this body in 2006.\n\nHe is from the Province of Naitasiri and was born and brought up in the highlands of Viti Levu in the village of Nakorosule. He deems himself a \"Kai-Colo\" meaning from the highlands and remained a true Fijian at heart.till his passing.\n\n== Attitudes towards Fiji's chiefly system ==\nDuring the [[2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|Fiji coup of 2000]], Ravuvu told [[Pacific Journalism Online]] on 28 May 2000 that most chiefs had lost the power to influence their own people.  Traditionally, he said, chiefs had been selected on merit and could be overthrown if they failed to perform up to the expectations of their people.  [[British Empire|Colonial rule]] from 1874 onwards, however, had seen the British rulers establish an elite group of chiefs who supported their interests.  This had led to a system that became ''\"increasingly hereditary and difficult to change,\"'' which in turn had ultimately resulted in a loss of chiefly power.  ''\"(When) the people of the land no longer have the power to select and install their leaders, the chiefs lose their mana or power,\"'' he said.  This he blamed for the actions of rebel leader [[George Speight]], who led the putsch against the elected government of [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] and called for the resignation of the [[President of Fiji|President]], [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]], the [[Tui Nayau|Paramount Chief]] of the [[Lau Islands]].\n\nWhen the common people became better educated, Ravuvu said, chiefs felt their hold on the community to be under threat.  To reinforce their authority, many chiefs reacted by emphasizing [[traditional values]], particularly those that reinforced the status quo.  Many of these \"traditions,\" according to Ravuvu, were in fact colonial legacies and constructions that had been relabelled as indigenous traditions.  He called for a democratizing of the chiefly system.  ''\"It is high time that the people are given back the flexibility and power to select and install their leaders who will be accountable to them if they are to prosper and forge ahead in the present modern and increasingly global context,\"'' he declared.\n\n== Calls for political and judicial reform ==\nOn 29 August 2005, Ravuvu said that discussions on major issues like [[land reform]] and politics were being hampered by the way parliament had become too politicized.  He said it would be more constructive to hold a summit of leaders, with input from the Great Council of Chiefs and from the private sector, to discuss national issues in a more informal setting.\n\nRavuvu also called for the [[Judiciary of Fiji|judicial system]] to be reorganized.  The existing system of using trial assessors was not conducive to justice and fairness, he considered, and the former [[jury]] system should be reinstated.  He called for the [[England|English]] judicial model to be scrapped in favour of the [[United States|American]] one.\n\n== Career ==\nRavuvu worked with the Fiji Ministry of Education for 24 years. In 1963 he was the recipient of the United States Government \"Fulbright\" Scholarship to study in the United States of America with a focus on elementary education system.\n\nHe was a polling Officer in Fiji's first general election in 1968 and saw at first hand the consternation and fear of the indigenous Fijians when they first went to the poll.\n\nIn the early 1970s he joined Nasinu Teachers Training College as a Lecturer. During his tenure he was also appointed Vice Principal.\n\nHe joined the United States Peace Corps Fiji Office for two years before joining the University of the South Pacific as a Lecturer.\n\nRavuvu was one of the first graduates of the University of The South Pacific in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Education. He received his Doctor of Philosophy  (PHD) in Anthropology from the University of Auckland.\n\nRavuvu was appointed Professor of Pacific Studies at the USP in the wake of the [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|Fiji coups of 1987]]. Prior to his professorship, he was also holding the appointment of the Director of Pacific Studies at the University of the South Pacific. During this time he had published some of his writings, The Fijian Way of Life 1976, The Fijian Ethos 1987, Development or Dependence 1988, The Facade of Democracy 1991. His last book, ''Fa\u00e7ade of Democracy,'' published in 1991, argued for ''\"a degree of political paramountcy\"'' in order to allow all races to live together peacefully.  He also wrote that ''\"Fijians generally perceive Indians as mean and stingy, crafty and demanding to the extent of being considered greedy, inconsiderate and grasping, uncooperative, egotistic, and calculating. Indians on the other hand, view Fijians as \"jungalis\" or bushwhackers, still behind the times and backward, naive and foolish, and generally poor. They are seen as lazy, proud and extravagant, pound-foolish and undependable. These perceptions of each other are nearly always subdued and latent yet only need some slight provocations to bring them to the fore, which at times culminates in open physical confrontations.\"''\n\nIn the 1999 [[1999 Fijian general election|parliamentary election]], Ravuvu was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Christian Democratic Alliance (Fiji)|Christian Democratic Alliance]].\n\nFollowing the 2000 coup, the interim government of Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]] named Ravuvu to head a Commission to rewrite the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]], which [[Fijians|Fijian]] [[Ethni-nationalism|ethno-nationalists]] criticized as giving too many concessions to the Indo-Fijian community.  On 15 November 2000, however, the [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] reinstated the suspended Constitution, a decision upheld by the [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Court of Appeal]] on 1 March 2001.  Between the High Court decision and the appeal, the Commission continued to function.  Ravuvu defended this by saying on 20 November that politics must come before law and legalities, a comment that sparked considerable public outrage.'\n\nRavuvu was first married to '''Paulini Kinisimere, '''who hailed from [[Bua Province|Bua]]) and with whom he had six daughters and one son - Vuki, Amelia, Lusi, Josese, Merewalesi, Makelesi and Evisake.

He spent most of his career at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], from 1962 to 1978. Internationally, Reaney was a regular squad member for the [[England national football team]], making his debut in 1968, and was capped two more times after that. However, he missed out on two [[FIFA World Cup]] squads \u2013 for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 edition]], he was put on standby, and for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 edition]], he suffered a season-ending injury.\n\n==Career==\n===Leeds United===\nHe moved to the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] from London as a child and left school at 15. He was briefly a [[automobile|car]] [[mechanic]] before [[Don Revie]] signed him for Leeds as an [[apprentice]]. Reaney made his professional debut shortly before his 18th birthday, and went on to make 35 League appearances in his first season, and was part of the team which won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1964.\n\nIn the [[1964\u201365 in English football|1964\u201365]] season, Reaney missed just one League game, and scored the first of his League goals as Leeds challenged for both the [[Football League First Division|League championship]] and [[FA Cup]]; however, Leeds lost out on both trophies, with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] winning the title, whilst [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the FA Cup.\n\nReaney quickly earned a reputation as a fiercely competitive, disciplined defender, capable of closing out the most talented of attackers \u2013 [[George Best]] rated Reaney as one of the two best defenders he played against.<ref name=1on1>{{cite web |title= George Best: One-on-One |url= http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/george-best-one-one |accessdate= 29 September 2016 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140308060508/http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/george-best-one-one |archivedate= 8 March 2014 |quote= Who was the best defender you played against?

Leeds progressed in [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370]] towards a \"treble\" of League championship, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], but a broken leg suffered in a game against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] meant that he missed the run-in to the end of the season \u2013 a factor that contributed to Leeds missing out on all three trophies. In addition, the broken leg meant that Reaney missed the summer's [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in [[Mexico]].\n\nHe eventually returned in the [[1970\u201371 in English football|1970\u201371]] season to make 18 League appearances and be part of the team which won its second Fairs Cup, but which missed out on the League championship again. In the [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]] season he was part of the team that won the FA Cup, but which missed out the League Championship yet again. The following season saw more disappointment for Reaney as Leeds lost the FA Cup final to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and a controversial [[European Cup Winners Cup]] final to [[A.C. Milan]].\n\nReaney's career at Leeds passed 500 appearances in [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]] as Leeds embarked on a 29-match unbeaten start to the season to earn the League title for the second time under Revie, who then left to take over the England job. Reaney was in the team which duly progressed to the [[1975 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] the following season in [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] but was controversially defeated 2\u20130 by [[Bayern Munich]].\n\n===Later career===\nReaney continued to play at Elland Road until the end of the [[1977\u201378 in English football|1977\u201378]] season when he was given a free transfer after 745 appearances. He joined neighbours [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and then completed his playing career in Australia with [[Newcastle KB United]].\n\n==International career==\nIn 1968, Reaney won his first [[England national football team|England]] cap, when he came on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a match against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. From that point on, he was regularly selected for the England squad (albeit not as first choice full-back) until a broken leg in 1970 prevented him from playing in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]]. The following year, he made his third and final appearance for England in a match against [[Malta national football team|Malta]].\n\nReaney's appearance for England has assumed greater importance in recent years as even though he was regarded as \"white\" during his playing career, he is viewed by many as \"black\" or mixed race now. His England debut was nine years before that of [[Viv Anderson]], who is widely credited as the first black player to appear for England.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an7Vc7XIXsYC&pg=PT81|title=When Saturday Comes: The Half Decent Football Book |publisher=Penguin Books |author= Tim Bradford |year=2006|page=81|isbn=9780141015569}}</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nSince returning to England from Australia, Reaney has been running coaching sessions during school holidays for children at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.placesandfaces.co.uk/articles/13/meet-a-footballing-legend.html | work=Places & Faces | title=Meet A Footballing Legend | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116060033/http://www.placesandfaces.co.uk/articles/13/meet-a-footballing-legend.html | archivedate=16 January 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, burglars broke into Reaney's home and stole a safe containing his collection of medals, though left behind his trophies, caps and other honours.\n\n==Honours==\n;Leeds United\n\n* [[Football League First Division]]: '''winner''' '''(2)''': [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]], runners-up: (5): [[1964\u201365 in English football|1964\u201365]], [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]], [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370]], [[1970\u201371 in English football|1970\u201371]], [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]]\n* [[Football League Second Division]]: '''winner''' '''(1)''': [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]]\n* [[FA Cup]]: '''winner''' '''(1)''': [[1972 FA Cup Final|1972]], runners-up (2): [[1965 FA Cup Final|1965]], [[1973 FA Cup Final|1973]]\n* [[Football League Cup]]: '''winner''' '''(1)''': [[1968 Football League Cup Final|1968]]\n* [[FA Charity Shield]]: '''winner''' '''(1)''': [[1969 FA Charity Shield|1969]], runners-up (1): [[1974 FA Charity Shield|1974]]\n* [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]: '''winner''' '''(2)''': [[1968 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1968]], [[1971 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1971]], runners-up (1): [[1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1967]]\n* [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]: runners-up (1): [[1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1973]]\n* [[European Cup]]: runners-up (1): [[1975 European Cup Final|1975]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{NeilBrownPlayers|player/paulreaney}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reaney, Paul}}\n[[Category:1944 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Footballers from Fulham]]\n[[Category:Association football fullbacks]]\n[[Category:English footballers]]\n[[Category:England international footballers]]\n[[Category:England under-23 international footballers]]\n[[Category:Leeds United F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players]]\n[[Category:English Football League players]]\n[[Category:National Soccer League (Australia) players]]\n[[Category:Newcastle KB United players]]\n[[Category:English Football League representative players]]\n[[Category:English expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Expatriate soccer players in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{BLP sources|date=March 2010}}\n{{Infobox football biography\n| name = Paul Reaney\n| image = File:Paul Reaney 1969.jpg\n| caption = Reaney in 1969\n| fullname = \n| birth_date  = {{birth date and age|df=y|1944|10|22}}\n| birth_place = [[Fulham]], [[London]], England\n| position = [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|Right back]]\n| youthyears1 = 1962\u20131964| youthclubs1 = [[Leeds United F.C.

The following season saw more disappointment for Reaney as Leeds lost the FA Cup final to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and a controversial [[European Cup Winners Cup]] final to [[A.C. Milan]].\n\nReaney's career at Leeds passed 500 appearances in [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]] as Leeds embarked on a 29-match unbeaten start to the season to earn the League title for the second time under Revie, who then left to take over the England job. Reaney was in the team which duly progressed to the [[1975 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] the following season in [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] but was controversially defeated 2\u20130 by [[Bayern Munich]].\n\n===Later career===\nReaney continued to play at Elland Road until the end of the [[1977\u201378 in English football|1977\u201378]] season when he was given a free transfer after 745 appearances. He joined neighbours [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and then completed his playing career in Australia with [[Newcastle KB United]].\n\n==International career==\nIn 1968, Reaney won his first [[England national football team|England]] cap, when he came on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a match against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. From that point on, he was regularly selected for the England squad (albeit not as first choice full-back) until a broken leg in 1970 prevented him from playing in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]]. The following year, he made his third and final appearance for England in a match against [[Malta national football team|Malta]].\n\nReaney's appearance for England has assumed greater importance in recent years as even though he was regarded as \"white\" during his playing career, he is viewed by many as \"black\" or mixed race now. His England debut was nine years before that of [[Viv Anderson]], who is widely credited as the first black player to appear for England.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an7Vc7XIXsYC&pg=PT81|title=When Saturday Comes: The Half Decent Football Book |publisher=Penguin Books |author= Tim Bradford |year=2006|page=81|isbn=9780141015569}}</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nSince returning to England from Australia, Reaney has been running coaching sessions during school holidays for children at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.placesandfaces.co.uk/articles/13/meet-a-footballing-legend.html | work=Places & Faces | title=Meet A Footballing Legend | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116060033/http://www.placesandfaces.co.uk/articles/13/meet-a-footballing-legend.html | archivedate=16 January 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, burglars broke into Reaney's home and stole a safe containing his collection of medals, though left behind his trophies, caps and other honours.\n\n==Honours==\n;Leeds United\n\n* [[Football League First Division]]: '''winner''' '''(2)''': [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]], runners-up: (5): [[1964\u201365 in English football|1964\u201365]], [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]], [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370]], [[1970\u201371 in English football|1970\u201371]], [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]]\n* [[Football League Second Division]]: '''winner''' '''(1)''': [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]]\n* [[FA Cup]]: '''winner''' '''(1)''': [[1972 FA Cup Final|1972]], runners-up (2): [[1965 FA Cup Final|1965]], [[1973 FA Cup Final|1973]]\n* [[Football League Cup]]: '''winner''' '''(1)''': [[1968 Football League Cup Final|1968]]\n* [[FA Charity Shield]]: '''winner''' '''(1)''': [[1969 FA Charity Shield|1969]], runners-up (1): [[1974 FA Charity Shield|1974]]\n* [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]: '''winner''' '''(2)''': [[1968 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1968]], [[1971 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1971]], runners-up (1): [[1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1967]]\n* [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]: runners-up (1): [[1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1973]]\n* [[European Cup]]: runners-up (1): [[1975 European Cup Final|1975]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{NeilBrownPlayers|player/paulreaney}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reaney, Paul}}\n[[Category:1944 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Footballers from Fulham]]\n[[Category:Association football fullbacks]]\n[[Category:English footballers]]\n[[Category:England international footballers]]\n[[Category:England under-23 international footballers]]\n[[Category:Leeds United F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players]]\n[[Category:English Football League players]]\n[[Category:National Soccer League (Australia) players]]\n[[Category:Newcastle KB United players]]\n[[Category:English Football League representative players]]\n[[Category:English expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Expatriate soccer players in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Orenburg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Reaney"}
