Jews continued to live in the oasis for several more years until they were expelled by [[caliph]] [[Umar]]. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews served as a precedent for provisions in the [[sharia|Islamic law]] requiring the exaction of tribute known as ''[[jizya]]'' from [[Dhimmi]] subjects in areas under Muslim rule, and confiscation of land belonging to non-Muslims into the collective property of the [[ummah|Muslim community]].<ref name=\"EI\" /><ref name=\"Stillman 18\u201319\">Stillman 18&ndash;19.</ref><ref name=\"Lewis 10\">Lewis 10.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Khaybar in the 7th century===\n{{Main|Jewish community of Khaybar}}\n\nIn the seventh century, Khaybar was inhabited by Jews. The inhabitants had stored in a redoubt at Khaybar a siege-engine, swords, lances, shields and other weaponry. In the past some scholars attempted to explain the presence of the weapons, suggesting that they were used for settling quarrels among the families of the community. Vaglieri suggests that it is more logical to assume that the weapons were stored in a dep\u00f4t for future sale. Similarly the Jews kept 20 bales of cloth and 500 cloaks for sale, and other luxury goods.  These commercial activities as a cause of hostility, Vaglieri argues, are similar to the economic causes behind persecutions in many other countries throughout history.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\nThe oasis was divided into three regions: al-Natat, al-Shikk, and al-Katiba, probably separated by natural divisions, such as the desert, [[lava]] drifts, and swamps. Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts including homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a separate family and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the fortresses were raised up on hills or [[basalt]] rocks.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\n===Banu Nadir===\n{{see also|Banu Nadir}}\nAfter they were sent into exile in 625 from Medina by Muslim forces, the Banu Nadir had settled in Khaybar. In 627, the Nadir chief [[Huyayy ibn Akhtab]] together with his son joined the Meccans and Bedouins besieging Medina during the [[Battle of the Trench]].<ref>Stillman 14, 16-17.</ref> In addition, the Nadir paid Arabian tribes to go to war against the Muslims. Bribing [[Banu Ghatafan]] with half of their harvest, Banu Nadir secured 2,000 men and 300 horsemen from the tribe to attack Muhammad,<ref name=\"Watt35-6\">Watt, ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 34-37.</ref><ref name=\"Nomani368\">Nomani, ''Sirat al-Nabi'', p. 368-370.</ref> and similarly persuaded the Bani Asad.<ref name = \"halabi1\">al-Halabi, ''Sirat-i-Halbiyyah'' (Vol. II, part 12), p. 19.</ref> They attempted to get the Banu Sulaym to attack the Muslims, but the tribe gave them only 700 men, since some of its leaders were sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir refused to join them all together, as they had a pact with Muhammad.<ref name =\"trenchLing\">Lings, ''Muhammad: his life based on the earliest sources'', p. 215-16.</ref> Once the battle started, Huyayy ibn Akhtab persuaded the [[Banu Qurayza]] to go against their covenant with Muhammad and turn against him during the battle.<ref>Peterson, ''Muhammad: the prophet of God'', p. 127.</ref> After the defeat of the confederates in the battle, and Qurayza's subsequent surrender, Huyayy (who was at that time in the Qurayza strongholds of Medina) was killed alongside the men of the Qurayza. After Huyayy's death, [[Abu al-Rafi ibn Abi al-Huqayq]] took charge of the Banu Nadir at Khaybar. Al-Huqayq soon approached neighboring tribes to raise an army against Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nomani 1979, vol. II, pg. 156\">Nomani (1979), vol. II, pg. 156.</ref><ref>Urwa, ''Fath al-Bari'', Vol. VII, pg. 363.</ref> After learning this, the Muslims, aided by an Arab with a Jewish dialect, assassinated him.<ref name=\"st17\">Stillman 17.</ref>\n\nAl-Huqayq was succeeded by [[Usayr ibn Zarim]]. It has been recorded by one source<ref>Zurqani, Ala al-Mawahib, Vol. II, p. 196, Egypt.</ref> that Usayr also approached the Ghatafan and rumors spread that he intended to attack the \"capital of Muhammad\". The latter sent Abdullah bin Rawaha with a number of his companions, among whom was Abdullah bin Unays, an ally of Banu Salima, a clan hostile to the Jews. When they came to Usayr, they told him that if he would come to Muhammad, Muhammad would give him an appointment and honour him. They kept on at him until he went with them with a number of Jews. Abdullah bin Unays mounted him on his beast until he was in al-Qarqara, about six miles from Khaybar. Usayr suddenly changed his mind about going with them. Abdullah perceived Usayr's bad intention as the latter was preparing to draw his sword. So Abdullah rushed at him and struck him with his sword cutting off his leg. Usayr hit Abdullah with a stick of shauhat wood which he had in his hand and wounded his head. All Muhammad's emissaries fell upon the thirty Jewish companions and killed them except one man who escaped on his feet.<ref>Ibn Ishaq, A. Guillaume, p. 665-666.</ref> Abdullah bin Unays is the assassin who volunteered and got permission to kill Banu Nadir's [[Sallam ibn Abu al-Huqayq]] at a previous night mission in Khaybar.\n\nMany scholars have considered the above machinations of the Nadir as a reason for the battle. According to [[Montgomery Watt]], their intriguing and use of their wealth to incite tribes against Muhammad left him no choice but to attack.<ref>Watt (1956), p. 189.</ref> Vaglieri concurs that one reason for attack was that the Jews of Khaybar were responsible for the Confederates that attacked Muslims during the Battle of the Trench.<ref name=\"EI\" /> [[Shibli Numani]] also sees Khaybar's actions during the Battle of the Trench, and draws particular attention to Banu Nadir's leader Huyayy ibn Akhtab, who had gone to the Banu Qurayza during the battle to instigate them to attack Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nomani 1979, vol. II, pg. 156\"/>\n\n===Treaty of Hudaybiyya===\n{{see also|Treaty of Hudaybiyya}}\nIn 628, when the Muslims attempted to perform the Umrah (lesser pilgrimage),<ref>Lings (1987), p. 249.</ref> after much negotiations, the Muslims entered a peace treaty with the Quresh, ending the Muslim-Quresh wars. The treaty also gave Muhammad the assurance of not being attacked in the rear by the Meccans during the expedition.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\n===Political situation===\nAs war with Muhammad seemed imminent, the Jews of Khaybar entered into an alliance with the Jews of [[Fadak]] oasis. They also successfully persuaded the Bedouin Ghatafan tribe to join their side in the war in exchange for half their produce. However, in comparison to the power of the north, Muhammad's army did not seem to pose enough of a threat for the Khaybar to sufficiently prepare themselves for the upcoming battle.  Along with the knowledge that Muhammad's army was small, and in need of resources, the lack of central authority at Khaybar prevented any unified defensive preparations, and quarrels between different families left the Jews disorganized.<ref name=\"EI\" /> The [[Banu Fazara]], related to the Ghatafan, also offered their assistance to Khaybar, after their unsuccessful negotiations with the Muslims.<ref>Nomani (1979), vol. II, pg. 159.</ref>\n\n===Failure of Banu Ghatafan===\n\nDuring the battle, the Muslims were able to prevent Khaybar's Ghatafan allies (consisting of 4,000 men) from providing them with reinforcements. One reason given is that the Muslims were able to buy off the Bedouin allies of the Jews. Watt, however, suggests that rumors of a Muslim attack on Ghatafan strongholds might also have played a role.<ref name=\"st18\">Stillman 18.</ref><ref>Watt (1956), pg. 93.</ref> According to Tabari, Muhammad's first stop in his conquest of Khaybar was in the valley of al-Raji, which was directly between the Ghatafan people and the Khaybar. In hearing the news of the Muslim army's position, the Ghatafan organized and rode out to honor their alliance with the Khaybar. After a day of travel, the Ghatafan thought they heard their enemy behind them and turned around in order to protect their families and possessions, thus opening the path for Muhammad's army.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://muslim-library.com/books/2019/05/en_Tabari_Volume_08.pdf|last=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Albany: State University Of New York|page=116}}</ref> Another story says that a mysterious voice warned the Ghatafan of danger and convinced them to return to their homes.<ref name=\"P.

It also made Khaybar overconfident.<ref>Lings (1983), pg. 263.</ref> As a result, the Jews failed to mount a centrally organized defense, leaving each family to defend its own fortified redoubt.<ref name=\"EI\" /><ref name=\"st18\" /> This underestimation of the Muslims allowed Muhammad to conquer each fortress one by one with relative ease, claiming food, weapons, and land as he went.<ref name=\"al-Tabari 1997 117\">{{cite book|last=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Albany: State University Of New York|page=117}}</ref> \n\nOne Muslim reported:  \"We met the workers of Khaybar coming out in the morning with their spades and baskets. When they saw the apostle and the army they cried, 'Muhammad with his force,' and turned tail and fled. The apostle said, 'Allah Akbar! Khaybar is destroyed.

Most of the fighting consisted of shooting arrows at a great distance. On at least one occasion the Muslims were able to storm the fortresses. The besieged Jews managed to organize, under the cover of darkness, the transfer of people and treasures from one fortress to another as needed to make their resistance more effective.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\nNeither the Jews nor the Muslims were prepared for an extended siege, and both suffered from a lack of provisions. The Jews, initially overconfident in their strength, failed to prepare even enough water supplies for a short siege.<ref>Watt (1956), pg. 219.</ref> Early in the campaign, the Muslims' hunger caused them to slaughter and cook several asses which they had taken during their conquest. Yet no one in the Muslim army had eaten that meat as Muhammad didn't see the men were at the point of starvation to allow it.  Muhammad, who had determined that the eating of horse, mule, and ass meat was forbidden, made the exception that one can eat forbidden foods so long as scarcity leaves no other option.<ref name=\"P.

Ali came to Muhammad, who cured him of his ophthalmia, an inhibitive inflammation of the eyes, by applying his saliva to Ali's eyes. The apostle sent him with his flag and Ali, with new vigor, set out to meet the enemy, bearing the banner of Muhammad. When he got near the fort the garrison came out and he fought them. During the battle, a Jew struck him so that his shield fell from his hand and Ali lost his shield. In need of a substitute, he picked up a door and used it to defend himself. The door was said to be so heavy that it took eight men to replace it on its hinges.<ref name=\"P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P.

Bukhari has given different portions of the story but has not mentioned the name of the fort. Ibn Hisham relates that Marhab was killed by Muhammad B.

Marhab called out: \"Khaybar knows well that I am Marhab, whose weapon is sharp, a warrior tested.

I give my opponents the measure of sandara in exchange for sa'(goblet) (i. e. return their attack with one that is much more fierce).<ref name=\"muslim\" />\n\nThe two soldiers struck at each other, and after the second blow, Ali cleaved through Marhab's helmet, splitting his skull and landing his sword in his opponent's teeth.<ref>{{cite book|last=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Albany: State University Of New York|page=121}}</ref> Another narration described, \"Ali struck at the head of Mirhab and killed him\u201d.<ref name=\"muslim\" />\n\nThe narration related to [[Muhammad bin Maslama]] from Ibn Hisham's prophetic biography is below:\n\n\u201cWhen the apostle had conquered some of their forts and got possession of some of their property he came to their two forts al-Watih and al-Sulalim, the last to be taken, and the apostle besieged them for some ten night.\n\nMarhab the Jew came out from their fort carrying his weapons and saying:\n:Khaybar knows that I am Marhab,\n:An experienced warrior armed from head to foot,\n:Now piercing, now slashing,\n:As when lions advance in their rage.\n:The hardened warrior gives way before my onslaught;\n:My hima (The sacred territory of an idol or a sanctuary and so any place that a man is\nbound to protect from violation) cannot be approached.\n\nWith these words he challenged all to single combat and Ka'b b. Malik answered him thus:\n:Khaybar knows that I am Ka'b,\n:The smoother of difficulties, bold and dour.\n:When war is stirred up another follows.\n:I carry a sharp sword that glitters like lightning- We will tread you down till the\nstrong are humbled;\n:We will make you pay till the spoil is divided-\n:In the hand of a warrior sans reproche.\n\nThe apostle said, 'Who will deal with this fellow?' Muhammad bin Maslama said that he would, for he was bound to take revenge on the man who had killed his brother the day before. The apostle told him to go and prayed Allah to help him. When they approached the one the other an old tree with soft wood lay between them and they began to hide behind it. Each took shelter from the other. When one hid behind the tree the other slashed at it with his sword so that the intervening branches were cut away and they came face to face. The tree remained bereft of its branches like a man standing upright. Then Marhab attacked Muhammad b. Maslama and struck him. He took the blow on his shield and the sword bit into it and remained fast. Muhammad (bin Maslama) then gave Marhab a fatal wound.<ref name=\"ibnhisham\"/>\u201d\n\nAlthough, many of the sources quoted that, Muhammad bin Maslama also fought bravely at Khaybar as well as Ali ibn abi Talib and also killed a number of well-known Jewish warriors.<ref name=\"Marhab\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n[[Muhammad]] met with Ibn Abi al-Huqaiq, al-Katibah and al-Watih<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Watt 1956), pg. 218.</ref> to discuss the terms of surrender. As part of the agreement, the Jews of Khaybar were to evacuate the area, and surrender their wealth. The Muslims would cease warfare and not hurt any of the Jews. After the agreement, some Jews approached Muhammad with a request to continue to cultivate their orchards and remain in the oasis. In return, they would give one-half of their produce to the Muslims.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Ibn Hisham's version of the pact with Khaybar, it was concluded on the condition that the Muslims \"may expel you [Jews of Khaybar] if and when we wish to expel you.\" Norman Stillman believes that this is probably a later interpolation intended to justify the expulsion of Jews in 642.<ref name = \"Hisham\" /> The agreement with the Jews of Khaybar served as an important precedent for Islamic Law in determining the status of [[dhimmi]]s, (non-Muslims under Muslim rule).<ref name=\"EI\" /><ref name=\"Stillman 18\u201319\" /><ref name=\"Lewis 10\"/>\n\nAfter hearing about this battle, the people of Fadak, allied with Khaybar during the battle, sent Mu\u1e25ayyisa b.

A treaty similar to that of Khaybar was drawn with Fadak as well.<ref name = \"Hisham\" />\n\nAmong the captives was [[Safiyya bint Huyayy]], daughter of the killed Banu Nadir chief Huyayy ibn Akhtab and widow of [[Kenana ibn al-Rabi]], the treasurer of Banu Nadir. [[Sahabah|The companions]] informed Muhammad of Safiyya's good family status, and requested him to accept her as his wife so as to preserve her prestige and status. Muhammad acceded to the request, and freed and married her.<ref name=\"Haykal 2008, p. 400\">Haykal (2008), p. 400.</ref> Thus, Safiyya became one of the [[Mothers of the Believers]].\n\nKenana ibn al-Rabi, when asked about the treasure they brought with them at the time of leaving Medina, denied having any such treasure. He was told that in case the treasure could be found hidden, he would face death-penalty for his false promise. Kenana agreed to this. A Jew told Muhammad that he had seen Al-Rabi near a certain ruin every morning. When the ruin was excavated, it was found to contain some of the treasure.

She poisoned a piece of lamb that she cooked for Muhammad and his companions, putting the most poison into Muhammad's favorite part, the shoulder.

Having lost his shield, Ali is said to have lifted both of the doors of the fortress from their hinges, climbed into the moat and held them up to make a bridge whereby the attackers gained access to the redoubt. The door was so heavy that forty men were required to put it back in place. This story is the basis for the [[Shi'ites]] viewing Ali as the prototype of heroes.<ref name=\"EI\" /><ref>Jafri_</ref>\n\nOn one occasion, Muslim soldiers, without Muhammad's opinion and permission, killed and cooked a score of donkeys, which had escaped from a farm.

The Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman al Mubarakpuri mentions that the hadith below regarding Amir's accidental death is related to Khaibar:\n\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Salama. He heard the tradition from his father who said: ... .By God, we had stayed there only three nights when we set out to Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah. (On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following rajaz verses for the people:\n\nBy God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright,\n\nWe would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers.\n\n(O God! ) We cannot do without Thy favours;\n\nKeep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy,\n\nAnd descend tranquillity upon us.\n\nThe Messenger of Allah said: Who is this? 'Amir said: it is 'Amir. He said: May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar b. Khattab who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from Amir. Salama continued: When we reached Khaibar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and chanting:\n\nKhaibar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like)\n\nA fully armed, and well-tried warrior.\n\nWhen the war comes spreading its flames.\n\nMy uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying:\n\nKhaibar certainly knows that I am 'Amir,\n\nA fully armed veteran who plunges into battles.\n\nThey exchanged blows. Marbab's sword struck the shield of 'Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery: in his forearm which caused his death. Salama said: I came out and heard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) as saying: Amir's deed has gone waste; he has killed himself. So I came to the Holy Prophet weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. Amir's deed has gone waste. The Messenger said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: \"He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for 'Amir there is a double reward.\" ... {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|19|4450}}<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/>\n\nAllah's Apostle offered the Fajr prayer when it was still dark, then he rode and said, 'Allah Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. When we approach near to a nation, the most unfortunate is the morning of those who have been warned.\" The people came out into the streets saying, \"Muhammad and his army.\" Allah's Apostle vanquished them by force and their warriors were killed; the children and women were taken as captives.

The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews served as a precedent for provisions in the [[sharia|Islamic law]] requiring the exaction of tribute known as ''[[jizya]]'' from [[Dhimmi]] subjects in areas under Muslim rule, and confiscation of land belonging to non-Muslims into the collective property of the [[ummah|Muslim community]].<ref name=\"EI\" /><ref name=\"Stillman 18\u201319\">Stillman 18&ndash;19.</ref><ref name=\"Lewis 10\">Lewis 10.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Khaybar in the 7th century===\n{{Main|Jewish community of Khaybar}}\n\nIn the seventh century, Khaybar was inhabited by Jews. The inhabitants had stored in a redoubt at Khaybar a siege-engine, swords, lances, shields and other weaponry. In the past some scholars attempted to explain the presence of the weapons, suggesting that they were used for settling quarrels among the families of the community. Vaglieri suggests that it is more logical to assume that the weapons were stored in a dep\u00f4t for future sale. Similarly the Jews kept 20 bales of cloth and 500 cloaks for sale, and other luxury goods.  These commercial activities as a cause of hostility, Vaglieri argues, are similar to the economic causes behind persecutions in many other countries throughout history.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\nThe oasis was divided into three regions: al-Natat, al-Shikk, and al-Katiba, probably separated by natural divisions, such as the desert, [[lava]] drifts, and swamps. Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts including homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a separate family and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the fortresses were raised up on hills or [[basalt]] rocks.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\n===Banu Nadir===\n{{see also|Banu Nadir}}\nAfter they were sent into exile in 625 from Medina by Muslim forces, the Banu Nadir had settled in Khaybar. In 627, the Nadir chief [[Huyayy ibn Akhtab]] together with his son joined the Meccans and Bedouins besieging Medina during the [[Battle of the Trench]].<ref>Stillman 14, 16-17.</ref> In addition, the Nadir paid Arabian tribes to go to war against the Muslims. Bribing [[Banu Ghatafan]] with half of their harvest, Banu Nadir secured 2,000 men and 300 horsemen from the tribe to attack Muhammad,<ref name=\"Watt35-6\">Watt, ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 34-37.</ref><ref name=\"Nomani368\">Nomani, ''Sirat al-Nabi'', p. 368-370.</ref> and similarly persuaded the Bani Asad.<ref name = \"halabi1\">al-Halabi, ''Sirat-i-Halbiyyah'' (Vol. II, part 12), p. 19.</ref> They attempted to get the Banu Sulaym to attack the Muslims, but the tribe gave them only 700 men, since some of its leaders were sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir refused to join them all together, as they had a pact with Muhammad.<ref name =\"trenchLing\">Lings, ''Muhammad: his life based on the earliest sources'', p. 215-16.</ref> Once the battle started, Huyayy ibn Akhtab persuaded the [[Banu Qurayza]] to go against their covenant with Muhammad and turn against him during the battle.<ref>Peterson, ''Muhammad: the prophet of God'', p. 127.</ref> After the defeat of the confederates in the battle, and Qurayza's subsequent surrender, Huyayy (who was at that time in the Qurayza strongholds of Medina) was killed alongside the men of the Qurayza. After Huyayy's death, [[Abu al-Rafi ibn Abi al-Huqayq]] took charge of the Banu Nadir at Khaybar. Al-Huqayq soon approached neighboring tribes to raise an army against Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nomani 1979, vol. II, pg. 156\">Nomani (1979), vol.

It has been recorded by one source<ref>Zurqani, Ala al-Mawahib, Vol. II, p. 196, Egypt.</ref> that Usayr also approached the Ghatafan and rumors spread that he intended to attack the \"capital of Muhammad\". The latter sent Abdullah bin Rawaha with a number of his companions, among whom was Abdullah bin Unays, an ally of Banu Salima, a clan hostile to the Jews. When they came to Usayr, they told him that if he would come to Muhammad, Muhammad would give him an appointment and honour him. They kept on at him until he went with them with a number of Jews. Abdullah bin Unays mounted him on his beast until he was in al-Qarqara, about six miles from Khaybar. Usayr suddenly changed his mind about going with them. Abdullah perceived Usayr's bad intention as the latter was preparing to draw his sword. So Abdullah rushed at him and struck him with his sword cutting off his leg.

The treaty also gave Muhammad the assurance of not being attacked in the rear by the Meccans during the expedition.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\n===Political situation===\nAs war with Muhammad seemed imminent, the Jews of Khaybar entered into an alliance with the Jews of [[Fadak]] oasis. They also successfully persuaded the Bedouin Ghatafan tribe to join their side in the war in exchange for half their produce. However, in comparison to the power of the north, Muhammad's army did not seem to pose enough of a threat for the Khaybar to sufficiently prepare themselves for the upcoming battle.  Along with the knowledge that Muhammad's army was small, and in need of resources, the lack of central authority at Khaybar prevented any unified defensive preparations, and quarrels between different families left the Jews disorganized.<ref name=\"EI\" /> The [[Banu Fazara]], related to the Ghatafan, also offered their assistance to Khaybar, after their unsuccessful negotiations with the Muslims.<ref>Nomani (1979), vol. II, pg. 159.</ref>\n\n===Failure of Banu Ghatafan===\n\nDuring the battle, the Muslims were able to prevent Khaybar's Ghatafan allies (consisting of 4,000 men) from providing them with reinforcements. One reason given is that the Muslims were able to buy off the Bedouin allies of the Jews. Watt, however, suggests that rumors of a Muslim attack on Ghatafan strongholds might also have played a role.<ref name=\"st18\">Stillman 18.</ref><ref>Watt (1956), pg. 93.</ref> According to Tabari, Muhammad's first stop in his conquest of Khaybar was in the valley of al-Raji, which was directly between the Ghatafan people and the Khaybar. In hearing the news of the Muslim army's position, the Ghatafan organized and rode out to honor their alliance with the Khaybar. After a day of travel, the Ghatafan thought they heard their enemy behind them and turned around in order to protect their families and possessions, thus opening the path for Muhammad's army.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://muslim-library.com/books/2019/05/en_Tabari_Volume_08.pdf|last=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Albany: State University Of New York|page=116}}</ref> Another story says that a mysterious voice warned the Ghatafan of danger and convinced them to return to their homes.<ref name=\"P.

Malik answered him thus:\n:Khaybar knows that I am Ka'b,\n:The smoother of difficulties, bold and dour.\n:When war is stirred up another follows.\n:I carry a sharp sword that glitters like lightning- We will tread you down till the\nstrong are humbled;\n:We will make you pay till the spoil is divided-\n:In the hand of a warrior sans reproche.\n\nThe apostle said, 'Who will deal with this fellow?' Muhammad bin Maslama said that he would, for he was bound to take revenge on the man who had killed his brother the day before. The apostle told him to go and prayed Allah to help him. When they approached the one the other an old tree with soft wood lay between them and they began to hide behind it. Each took shelter from the other. When one hid behind the tree the other slashed at it with his sword so that the intervening branches were cut away and they came face to face. The tree remained bereft of its branches like a man standing upright. Then Marhab attacked Muhammad b. Maslama and struck him. He took the blow on his shield and the sword bit into it and remained fast. Muhammad (bin Maslama) then gave Marhab a fatal wound.<ref name=\"ibnhisham\"/>\u201d\n\nAlthough, many of the sources quoted that, Muhammad bin Maslama also fought bravely at Khaybar as well as Ali ibn abi Talib and also killed a number of well-known Jewish warriors.<ref name=\"Marhab\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n[[Muhammad]] met with Ibn Abi al-Huqaiq, al-Katibah and al-Watih<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Watt 1956), pg. 218.</ref> to discuss the terms of surrender. As part of the agreement, the Jews of Khaybar were to evacuate the area, and surrender their wealth. The Muslims would cease warfare and not hurt any of the Jews. After the agreement, some Jews approached Muhammad with a request to continue to cultivate their orchards and remain in the oasis. In return, they would give one-half of their produce to the Muslims.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Ibn Hisham's version of the pact with Khaybar, it was concluded on the condition that the Muslims \"may expel you [Jews of Khaybar] if and when we wish to expel you.\" Norman Stillman believes that this is probably a later interpolation intended to justify the expulsion of Jews in 642.<ref name = \"Hisham\" /> The agreement with the Jews of Khaybar served as an important precedent for Islamic Law in determining the status of [[dhimmi]]s, (non-Muslims under Muslim rule).<ref name=\"EI\" /><ref name=\"Stillman 18\u201319\" /><ref name=\"Lewis 10\"/>\n\nAfter hearing about this battle, the people of Fadak, allied with Khaybar during the battle, sent Mu\u1e25ayyisa b.

Having lost his shield, Ali is said to have lifted both of the doors of the fortress from their hinges, climbed into the moat and held them up to make a bridge whereby the attackers gained access to the redoubt.

(On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following rajaz verses for the people:\n\nBy God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright,\n\nWe would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers.\n\n(O God! ) We cannot do without Thy favours;\n\nKeep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy,\n\nAnd descend tranquillity upon us.\n\nThe Messenger of Allah said: Who is this? 'Amir said: it is 'Amir. He said: May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar b. Khattab who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from Amir. Salama continued: When we reached Khaibar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and chanting:\n\nKhaibar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like)\n\nA fully armed, and well-tried warrior.\n\nWhen the war comes spreading its flames.\n\nMy uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying:\n\nKhaibar certainly knows that I am 'Amir,\n\nA fully armed veteran who plunges into battles.\n\nThey exchanged blows. Marbab's sword struck the shield of 'Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery: in his forearm which caused his death. Salama said: I came out and heard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) as saying: Amir's deed has gone waste; he has killed himself. So I came to the Holy Prophet weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. Amir's deed has gone waste. The Messenger said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions.

This dates to 1739 and bears a statue of the blind [[Saint Herv\u00e9]] with his guide Guic'haran. The enclos has a [[Calvary (sanctuary)|calvary]] comprising three crosses inscribed \"Jehan Le Faloder Fabricque Feist Iceste Croix Faire MVCXLIIII\". The bell tower porch is elaborate and was built in various stages between 1668 and 1773. It has a lanterned dome imitating that in Rome. The chapel's frontage gives onto the enclos' grass patch (plac\u00eetre) and the building itself has used granite from the Logonna quarries for the southern section, a tougher granite from another area for the middle section and grey granite from [[Armorica]] for the surrounds to the doors and windows for the section built from 1570 to 1591.\n\n==The baroque altarpieces==\nInside the chapel are three baroque [[altarpieces]], that belonging to the master altar and those in the altars placed in the south and north of the chapel. . All three are dated to between 1703 and 1710 and have been listed as historic monuments since 24 December 1912. The master altar includes depictions of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] and the [[Holy Family]] (Sainte Famille) with [[Joachim|Saint Joachim]], [[Saint Joseph]] and [[Saint Anne]]. It was the work of Jean Le S\u00e9ven and Jean C\u00e9va\u00ebr. The altarpiece in the south of the church celebrates [[Saint Peter]], Saint James, [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] whilst that in the north of the church depicts [[John the Baptist]], Saint Louis, [[Saint Lawrence]] and [[Mary Magdalene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.topic-topos.com/retables-du-xviiiesiecle-plomodiern|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717113119/http://fr.topic-topos.com/retables-du-xviiiesiecle-plomodiern|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 July 2014|title=The enclos paroissial at Plomodiern|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=220>\nFile:14 Sainte-Marie du M\u00e9nez-Hom Autel central retable.JPG|The sumptuous altarpiece of the main altar in the  Sainte-Marie du M\u00e9nez-Hom  chapel\nFile:18 Sainte-Marie du M\u00e9nez-Hom Le Christ marchant sur les eaux et saint Pierre tentant de le faire.JPG|Part of the altarpiece in the north of the chapel.

Quickly losing blood from a bullet in his side, Sullivan tells his story, confessing to the murder he has just committed and revealing the identity of the person who may have murdered him.  The mystery Sullivan unravels takes him from the beaches of Malibu to the grand estates in San Marino to a dimly-lit jazz club in Santa Monica to a ritzy fertility clinic in Beverly Hills, ultimately exposing what is perhaps the first case of \"embryo-napping.\"<ref>{{ISBN|978-1-4681-5630-0}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n<big>'''Plays'''</big>\n\n* ''A Fine Romance'' (A Romantic Comedy) (1984)\n* ''When Pig Fly!''

This [[neo-noir]] mystery series features ex-cop turned private investigator Tom Sullivan and his cat, Stella.  The story begins in the confessional booth of a church in Southern California as Tom Sullivan makes what appears to be his final confession. Quickly losing blood from a bullet in his side, Sullivan tells his story, confessing to the murder he has just committed and revealing the identity of the person who may have murdered him.  The mystery Sullivan unravels takes him from the beaches of Malibu to the grand estates in San Marino to a dimly-lit jazz club in Santa Monica to a ritzy fertility clinic in Beverly Hills, ultimately exposing what is perhaps the first case of \"embryo-napping.\"<ref>{{ISBN|978-1-4681-5630-0}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n<big>'''Plays'''</big>\n\n* ''A Fine Romance'' (A Romantic Comedy) (1984)\n* ''When Pig Fly!''

Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away.\n\nA massive evacuation begins in the South Tower below its impact zone. One of the stairwells in the South Tower remains unblocked from the top to the bottom of the tower because of the plane hitting at an offset from the vertical center line of the building, but it is filled with [[smoke]]. This leads many people to mistakenly go upwards towards the roof for a rooftop rescue that never comes. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] kept the two sets of heavy metal doors leading to the building's only roof exit tightly locked.<ref>Paltrow, Scott J., Kim, Queens Sook, ''Wall St. Journal'', Could Helicopters Have Saved People From the Top of the Trade Center?</ref> The impact severs communication with several television and radio broadcast towers at the WTC; local station [[WPIX]]'s satellite feed freezes on an image of the second impact which is all the station broadcasts until alternate transmitters are set up hours later.\n\nBecause of the North Tower's obstruction of the South Tower from certain camera angles, some are originally unaware that a second plane has struck the South Tower, and instead mistakenly believe that the second explosion has occurred in the North Tower. As instant replays of the second plane crash are shown, the anchors on the three major broadcast networks speculate on whether they are witnessing a terrorist attack or some sort of very rare accident. CNN changes its headline to read \"Second plane crashes into World Trade Center.\" On the local station [[WABC-TV]] (which CNN was simulcasting at that moment), anchor [[Steve Bartelstein]] first assumes that the explosion seen was caused when the fuselage of the first plane exploded. As he first views videotape footage showing that it was actually a plane that had hit the South Tower, the WABC anchor then initially suggests it was a rare accident, saying that the two crashes might have been caused by navigational system failure.\n\n[[Image:Wtc burning on 9-11 (5).jpg|thumb|The Twin Towers burning from the impact of flights 11 and 175.]]\nSeveral eyewitness accounts and camera footage reveal that the plane was coming in at an [[angle]], and was seen to turn drastically to the left to be able to hit the tower, unlike its predecessor, Flight 11, which had been able to hit the North Tower straight on. Thus, it is believed that had the plane continued flying straight, it would have at least simply clipped the side of the building with its left wing, or even missed the building entirely.

It appeared to be the lower half of the northwest corner column of the North Tower, which, like a spire, grew larger and had more structure still standing near the bottom. The portion rose to a fairly good height considering the collapse around it, as it appeared to rise nearly forty stories off the ground. This piece remained standing for a few seconds after the initial collapse before it also came down.\n\n'''10:31''': NORAD first communicates the Vice President's shootdown authority to NEADS.\n\n'''10:35''': Air Force One, carrying the President, turns for [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]].\n\n'''10:37''': Associated Press reports that officials at the Somerset County airport confirm that a large plane has crashed in western Pennsylvania.

As the building lacks a traditional full cage frame and depends almost entirely on the strength of a narrow structural core running up the center, fire at the center of the impact zone is in a position to compromise the integrity of all internal columns.

By this time, several media organizations, including [[Big Three television networks|the three major broadcast networks]] (who have interrupted their morning shows), are covering the first plane crash\u2014millions see the impact live. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away.\n\nA massive evacuation begins in the South Tower below its impact zone. One of the stairwells in the South Tower remains unblocked from the top to the bottom of the tower because of the plane hitting at an offset from the vertical center line of the building, but it is filled with [[smoke]]. This leads many people to mistakenly go upwards towards the roof for a rooftop rescue that never comes. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] kept the two sets of heavy metal doors leading to the building's only roof exit tightly locked.<ref>Paltrow, Scott J., Kim, Queens Sook, ''Wall St. Journal'', Could Helicopters Have Saved People From the Top of the Trade Center?</ref> The impact severs communication with several television and radio broadcast towers at the WTC; local station [[WPIX]]'s satellite feed freezes on an image of the second impact which is all the station broadcasts until alternate transmitters are set up hours later.\n\nBecause of the North Tower's obstruction of the South Tower from certain camera angles, some are originally unaware that a second plane has struck the South Tower, and instead mistakenly believe that the second explosion has occurred in the North Tower. As instant replays of the second plane crash are shown, the anchors on the three major broadcast networks speculate on whether they are witnessing a terrorist attack or some sort of very rare accident. CNN changes its headline to read \"Second plane crashes into World Trade Center.\" On the local station [[WABC-TV]] (which CNN was simulcasting at that moment), anchor [[Steve Bartelstein]] first assumes that the explosion seen was caused when the fuselage of the first plane exploded. As he first views videotape footage showing that it was actually a plane that had hit the South Tower, the WABC anchor then initially suggests it was a rare accident, saying that the two crashes might have been caused by navigational system failure.\n\n[[Image:Wtc burning on 9-11 (5).jpg|thumb|The Twin Towers burning from the impact of flights 11 and 175.]]\nSeveral eyewitness accounts and camera footage reveal that the plane was coming in at an [[angle]], and was seen to turn drastically to the left to be able to hit the tower, unlike its predecessor, Flight 11, which had been able to hit the North Tower straight on. Thus, it is believed that had the plane continued flying straight, it would have at least simply clipped the side of the building with its left wing, or even missed the building entirely. (Flight 175 came in from the southwest, apparently heading for the [[Empire State Building]], but turned right, then left into the South Tower.){{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n'''9:03''': President Bush enters a classroom as part of his school visit.\n\n'''9:03''': FAA's New York Center notifies NORAD (NEADS) of the hijacking of Flight 175, at the same time it crashes.\n\n'''9:04''': [[Fox News Channel]] anchor [[Jon Scott]] mentions [[Osama bin Laden]] as a possible suspect.\n\n'''9:04''' (approximately): The FAA's Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center stops all departures from airports in its jurisdiction ([[New England]] and eastern [[New York State]]).\n\n'''9:05''': After brief introductions to the Booker elementary students, President Bush is about to begin reading ''[[The Pet Goat]]'' with the students when [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Andrew Card]] interrupts to whisper to the president, \"A second plane has hit the second tower.
