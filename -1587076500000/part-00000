She is considered to be a central figure in one of the great art movements of the century.  Throughout her career, Noskowiak photographed quite a few subjects those including landscapes, still lives and portraits. Her most well-known, and unacknowledged, portraits are of the author, John Steinbeck. In 1936, Noskowiak was awarded a prize at the annual exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artist. She was also represented in the San Francisco Museum of Art\u2019s 1939 \u201cScenes from San Francisco\u201d exhibit.

{"title_page": "SS Columbia Eagle incident", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:SS ''Columbia Eagle'' incident}}\nThe '''SS ''Columbia Eagle'' incident''' refers to a [[mutiny]] that occurred aboard the U.S. flagged merchant vessel ''Columbia Eagle'' in March 1970 when two crewmembers seized the vessel with the threat of a bomb and handgun, and forced the master to sail to [[Cambodia]]. The ship was under contract with the [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] to carry [[napalm]] bombs to be used by the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the Vietnam War and was originally bound for [[Sattahip]], [[Thailand]]. During the mutiny, 24 of the crew were forced into two lifeboats and set adrift in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] while the remainder of the crew were forced to take the ship to a bay near [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]], Cambodia. The two mutineers requested political asylum from the Cambodian government which was initially granted but they were later arrested and jailed. ''Columbia Eagle'' was returned to U.S. control in April 1970.

She was designed to carry all types of dry supplies and munitions to Pacific theaters of World War II. SS ''Pierre Victory'' survived three separate [[kamikaze]] attacks by the Japanese in 1945.<ref>[https://www.sdhspress.com/blog/naval-ships-and-a-land-locked-state ''Pierre Victory'' and landlock state, 14 February 2019]</ref> After World War II the ''Pierre Victory'' was converted to a [[livestock]] ship, also called a [[Seagoing cowboys]] ship.

Like most of the ships of the Victory-type, ''Pierre Victory'' was decommissioned after the war then sold to commercial shipping company. In 1968, she was purchased by the Columbia Steamship Company, renamed ''Columbia Eagle'' and contracted out to the Military Sea Transportation Service for the purpose of hauling supplies and ammunition to Southeast Asian ports in South Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War.<ref name=Linnett67>Linnett, pp 67\u201368</ref> Because ''Columbia Eagle'' was a U.S. flagged ship, she was a part of the [[Merchant Marine]] fleet and therefore eligible under government contracting rules to haul military supplies to the war zone.<ref name=Cutler142>Cutler, p 142</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Clyde William McKay, Jr.===\nClyde McKay was born on 20 May 1944 near [[Hemet, California]]. His father was in the military at the time and often had duty away from the family. While a teenager, he suffered a misdiagnosed bowel obstruction and was seriously ill for a year. Because of this, he lost a year in school and never finished high school and decided to join the merchant marine. McKay received his [[Merchant Mariner's Document|merchant marine documents]] on 23 October 1963 and joined the [[Seafarers International Union]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=Linnett13>Linnett, pp 13\u201315</ref>\n\n===Alvin Leonard Glatkowski===\nAlvin Glatkowski was born on 11 September 1949 at [[Augusta, Georgia]]. His father was also in the military at the time of his birth but shortly after Glatkowski was born, his father abandoned the family. His mother married a Navy third-class machinist mate named Ralph Hagan when Glatkowski was three. Hagan was abusive to Glatkowski when he was home, but was often on duty or cruises and Glatkowski learned to be independent at an early age. As a teenager, Glatkowski assumed the role of head of the household when Hagan was at sea and this made Hagan very angry when he returned home. He often took out his frustrations on Glatkowski violently, which led him to leave home at eighteen.

The ship was under contract with the [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] to carry [[napalm]] bombs to be used by the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the Vietnam War and was originally bound for [[Sattahip]], [[Thailand]]. During the mutiny, 24 of the crew were forced into two lifeboats and set adrift in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] while the remainder of the crew were forced to take the ship to a bay near [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]], Cambodia. The two mutineers requested political asylum from the Cambodian government which was initially granted but they were later arrested and jailed. ''Columbia Eagle'' was returned to U.S. control in April 1970.

She was designed to carry all types of dry supplies and munitions to Pacific theaters of World War II. SS ''Pierre Victory'' survived three separate [[kamikaze]] attacks by the Japanese in 1945.<ref>[https://www.sdhspress.com/blog/naval-ships-and-a-land-locked-state ''Pierre Victory'' and landlock state, 14 February 2019]</ref> After World War II the ''Pierre Victory'' was converted to a [[livestock]] ship, also called a [[Seagoing cowboys]] ship.

Like most of the ships of the Victory-type, ''Pierre Victory'' was decommissioned after the war then sold to commercial shipping company. In 1968, she was purchased by the Columbia Steamship Company, renamed ''Columbia Eagle'' and contracted out to the Military Sea Transportation Service for the purpose of hauling supplies and ammunition to Southeast Asian ports in South Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War.<ref name=Linnett67>Linnett, pp 67\u201368</ref> Because ''Columbia Eagle'' was a U.S. flagged ship, she was a part of the [[Merchant Marine]] fleet and therefore eligible under government contracting rules to haul military supplies to the war zone.<ref name=Cutler142>Cutler, p 142</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Clyde William McKay, Jr.===\nClyde McKay was born on 20 May 1944 near [[Hemet, California]]. His father was in the military at the time and often had duty away from the family. While a teenager, he suffered a misdiagnosed bowel obstruction and was seriously ill for a year. Because of this, he lost a year in school and never finished high school and decided to join the merchant marine. McKay received his [[Merchant Mariner's Document|merchant marine documents]] on 23 October 1963 and joined the [[Seafarers International Union]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=Linnett13>Linnett, pp 13\u201315</ref>\n\n===Alvin Leonard Glatkowski===\nAlvin Glatkowski was born on 11 September 1949 at [[Augusta, Georgia]]. His father was also in the military at the time of his birth but shortly after Glatkowski was born, his father abandoned the family. His mother married a Navy third-class machinist mate named Ralph Hagan when Glatkowski was three. Hagan was abusive to Glatkowski when he was home, but was often on duty or cruises and Glatkowski learned to be independent at an early age. As a teenager, Glatkowski assumed the role of head of the household when Hagan was at sea and this made Hagan very angry when he returned home. He often took out his frustrations on Glatkowski violently, which led him to leave home at eighteen. Glatkowski went to New York and enrolled in the [[Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship]] operated by the [[Seafarers International Union]]. Lundeberg School taught the skills needed to get deck, engine and steward jobs on merchant marine ships. On 17 April 1967, Glatkowski received his merchant mariner papers stating he was eligible for entry-level jobs on U.S. flagged ships.<ref name=Linnett43>Linnett, pp 43\u201356</ref>\n\n===Mutiny===\nOn 14 March 1970, McKay and Glatkowski used guns they had smuggled aboard to seize control of their ship, SS ''Columbia Eagle'', in the first armed [[mutiny]] aboard an American ship in 150 years.

[[United States federal judge]] [[Manuel Real]] heard the testimony of four psychiatrists; three of the [[psychiatrist]]s reported that Glatkowski was currently sane and was sane at the time of the mutiny incident. On 2 March 1971 Glatkowski pleaded guilty in a Los Angeles District Court to mutiny and assault as pleaded deal. He was sentenced by Judge Manuel Real to 10 years in [[Federal prison]] and served seven of the ten years in a [[Lompoc, California]] [[Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc|federal prison]].<ref>True Crime and Punishment: Mutinies, By Barry Stone, page 314</ref><ref>[https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2002-02-25-0202250247-story.html Baltimore Sun, Echoes of 1970 in Lindh case, by Roberto Loiederman, 25 February 2002]</ref><ref>Fourth Arm of Defense: Sealift and Maritime Logistics in the Vietnam War, By Salvatore R.

Eighth Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.</ref>]]\n\nIn [[classical music]], '''musical development''' is a process by which a musical [[idea]] is communicated in the course of a [[Musical piece|composition]]. It refers to the [[Transformation (music)|transformation]] and [[Theme (music)|restatement]] of initial material. Development is often contrasted with musical [[Variation (music)|variation]], which is a slightly different means to the same end. ''Development'' is carried out upon portions of material treated in many ''different'' presentations and combinations at a time, while ''variation'' depends upon ''one'' type of presentation at a time.<ref>Wennerstrom, Mary (1975). \"Form in Twentieth-Century Music\" (chap. 1), ''Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music''. Wittlich, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-049346-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn this process, certain central ideas are repeated in different contexts or in altered form so that the mind of the listener consciously or unconsciously compares the various incarnations of these ideas. Listeners may apprehend a \"tension between expected and real results\" (see [[irony]]), which is one \"element of surprise\" in music. This practice has its roots in [[counterpoint]], where a theme or subject might create an impression of a pleasing or affective sort, but delight the mind further as its [[contrapuntal]] capabilities are gradually unveiled.\n\nIn [[sonata form]], the middle section (between the [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] and the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]]) is called the ''development''. Typically, in this section, material from the exposition section is developed. In some older texts, this section may be referred to as ''free fantasia''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford Companion to Music]]''<ref>Temperley, N. (2002, p. 355) \u201cDevelopment\u201d in Oxford Companion to Music.  Oxford University Press.</ref> there are several ways of developing a theme. These include:\n\n* The division of a theme into parts, each of which can be developed in any of the above ways or recombined in a new way. Similarly, two or more themes can be developed in combination; in some cases, themes are composed with this possibility in mind.\n* Alteration of pitch intervals while retaining the original rhythm.\n* Rhythmic displacement, so that the metrical stress occurs at a different point in the otherwise unchanged theme.\n* [[Sequence (music)|Sequence]], either diatonically within a key or through a succession of keys.\n\nThe [[Scherzo]] movement from [[Piano Sonata No. 15 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 15]] in D major, Op 28 (the \"Pastoral\" Sonata) shows a number of these processes at work on a small scale.

It refers to the [[Transformation (music)|transformation]] and [[Theme (music)|restatement]] of initial material. Development is often contrasted with musical [[Variation (music)|variation]], which is a slightly different means to the same end. ''Development'' is carried out upon portions of material treated in many ''different'' presentations and combinations at a time, while ''variation'' depends upon ''one'' type of presentation at a time.<ref>Wennerstrom, Mary (1975). \"Form in Twentieth-Century Music\" (chap. 1), ''Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music''. Wittlich, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-049346-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn this process, certain central ideas are repeated in different contexts or in altered form so that the mind of the listener consciously or unconsciously compares the various incarnations of these ideas. Listeners may apprehend a \"tension between expected and real results\" (see [[irony]]), which is one \"element of surprise\" in music. This practice has its roots in [[counterpoint]], where a theme or subject might create an impression of a pleasing or affective sort, but delight the mind further as its [[contrapuntal]] capabilities are gradually unveiled.\n\nIn [[sonata form]], the middle section (between the [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] and the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]]) is called the ''development''. Typically, in this section, material from the exposition section is developed. In some older texts, this section may be referred to as ''free fantasia''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford Companion to Music]]''<ref>Temperley, N. (2002, p. 355) \u201cDevelopment\u201d in Oxford Companion to Music.  Oxford University Press.</ref> there are several ways of developing a theme. These include:\n\n* The division of a theme into parts, each of which can be developed in any of the above ways or recombined in a new way. Similarly, two or more themes can be developed in combination; in some cases, themes are composed with this possibility in mind.\n* Alteration of pitch intervals while retaining the original rhythm.\n* Rhythmic displacement, so that the metrical stress occurs at a different point in the otherwise unchanged theme.\n* [[Sequence (music)|Sequence]], either diatonically within a key or through a succession of keys.\n\nThe [[Scherzo]] movement from [[Piano Sonata No. 15 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 15]] in D major, Op 28 (the \"Pastoral\" Sonata) shows a number of these processes at work on a small scale.

It uses ''kilobyte'' to mean 2<sup>10</sup> bytes (= 1024 bytes), because of the [[Mathematical coincidence#Concerning base 2|mathematical coincidence]] that 2<sup>10</sup> is approximately 10<sup>3</sup>. The reason for this application is that digital hardware and architectures natively use [[base 2]] exponentiation, and not [[base 10|decimal]] systems. [[JEDEC memory standards]] still permit this definition, but acknowledge the correct SI usage.\n\nNIST comments on the confusion caused by these contrasting definitions: \"Faced with this reality, the ''IEEE Standards Board'' decided that IEEE standards will use the conventional, internationally adopted, definitions of the SI prefixes\", instead of kilo for 1024.<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html Definition of binary prefixes at NIST]</ref>  To address this conflict, a new set of [[binary prefix]]es has been introduced, which is based on powers of 2. Therefore, 1024 bytes are defined as one [[kibibyte]] (1 KiB).\n\n==Exponentiation==\nWhen units occur in [[exponentiation]], such as in square and cubic forms, any multiplier prefix is considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation.\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> means one square kilometre or the area of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] that measures 1000&nbsp;m on each side or 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (as opposed to 1000 square meters, which is the area of a square that measures 31.6&nbsp;m on each side).\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> means one cubic kilometre or the volume of a [[cube]] that measures 1000&nbsp;m on each side or 10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (as opposed to 1000 cubic meters, which is the volume of a cube that measures 10&nbsp;m on each side).\n\n==See also==\n* [[milli-]] (inverse of kilo- prefix, denoting a factor of 1/1000)\n* [[kibi-]] (binary prefix, denoting a factor of 1024)\n* [[RKM code]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\n[[Category:SI prefixes]]\n[[Category:1000 (number)]]\n\n[[he:\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea#\u05e7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Kilo (disambiguation)}}\n{{Wiktionary|kilo-}}\n\n'''Kilo''' is a [[decimal prefix|decimal]] [[metric prefix|unit prefix]] in the [[metric system]] denoting multiplication by one [[thousand]] (10<sup>3</sup>).

It uses ''kilobyte'' to mean 2<sup>10</sup> bytes (= 1024 bytes), because of the [[Mathematical coincidence#Concerning base 2|mathematical coincidence]] that 2<sup>10</sup> is approximately 10<sup>3</sup>. The reason for this application is that digital hardware and architectures natively use [[base 2]] exponentiation, and not [[base 10|decimal]] systems. [[JEDEC memory standards]] still permit this definition, but acknowledge the correct SI usage.\n\nNIST comments on the confusion caused by these contrasting definitions: \"Faced with this reality, the ''IEEE Standards Board'' decided that IEEE standards will use the conventional, internationally adopted, definitions of the SI prefixes\", instead of kilo for 1024.<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html Definition of binary prefixes at NIST]</ref>  To address this conflict, a new set of [[binary prefix]]es has been introduced, which is based on powers of 2. Therefore, 1024 bytes are defined as one [[kibibyte]] (1 KiB).\n\n==Exponentiation==\nWhen units occur in [[exponentiation]], such as in square and cubic forms, any multiplier prefix is considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation.\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> means one square kilometre or the area of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] that measures 1000&nbsp;m on each side or 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (as opposed to 1000 square meters, which is the area of a square that measures 31.6&nbsp;m on each side).\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> means one cubic kilometre or the volume of a [[cube]] that measures 1000&nbsp;m on each side or 10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (as opposed to 1000 cubic meters, which is the volume of a cube that measures 10&nbsp;m on each side).\n\n==See also==\n* [[milli-]] (inverse of kilo- prefix, denoting a factor of 1/1000)\n* [[kibi-]] (binary prefix, denoting a factor of 1024)\n* [[RKM code]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\n[[Category:SI prefixes]]\n[[Category:1000 (number)]]\n\n[[he:\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea#\u05e7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5]]\n", "name_user": "2a01:cb19:38e:5d00:9803:ce6b:f350:5307", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-"}

[https://www.aynva.com/2019/12/benefits-of-gooseberry-amla.html Gooseberry] (Amla) is an Ayurvedic plant with many implied benefits\nIn [[Great Britain|Britain]], it is often found in [[copse]]s and [[hedgerow]]s and about old ruins, but the gooseberry has been cultivated for so long that it is difficult to distinguish wild bushes from feral ones, or to determine where the gooseberry fits into the native flora of the island. Common as it is now on some of the lower slopes of the [[Alps]] of [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] and [[Savoy]], it is uncertain whether the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] were acquainted with the gooseberry, though it may possibly be alluded to in a vague passage of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]''; the hot summers of [[Italy]], in ancient times as at present, would be unfavourable to its cultivation. Although gooseberries are now abundant in [[Germany]] and [[France]], it does not appear to have been much grown there in the [[Middle Ages]], though the wild fruit was held in some esteem [[Pharmacology|medicinally]] for the cooling properties of its [[acid]] juice in [[fever]]s; while the old [[English language|English]] name, ''Fea-berry'', still surviving in some provincial dialects, indicates that it was similarly valued in Britain, where it was planted in gardens at a comparatively early period.\n\n[[William Turner (ornithologist)|William Turner]] describes the gooseberry in his ''Herball'', written about the middle of the 16th century, and a few years later it is mentioned in one of Thomas Tusser's quaint rhymes as an ordinary object of garden culture. Improved varieties were probably first raised by the skillful gardeners of [[Holland]], whose name for the fruit, ''Kruisbezie'', may have been corrupted into the present English vernacular word. Towards the end of the 18th century, the gooseberry became a favorite object of cottage-horticulture, especially in [[Lancashire, England|Lancashire]], where the working [[cotton]]-spinners raised numerous varieties from [[seed]], their efforts having been chiefly directed to increasing the size of the fruit.<ref name=Baynes/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stachelbeere (Ribes uva-crispa).jpg|thumb|upright|Red gooseberries]]\n\n<blockquote>Of the many hundred sorts enumerated in recent horticultural works, few perhaps equal in flavor some of the older denizens of the fruit-garden, such as the ''Old Rough Red'' and ''Hairy Amber''. The [[climate]] of the [[British Isles]] seems peculiarly adapted to bring the gooseberry to perfection, and it may be grown successfully even in the most northern parts of [[Scotland]]; indeed, the flavor of the fruit is said to improve with increasing latitude. In [[Norway]] even, the bush flourishes in gardens on the west coast nearly up to the [[Arctic]] Circle, and it is found wild as far north as 63\u00b0. The dry summers of the French and German plains are less suited to it, though it is grown in some hilly districts with tolerable success. The gooseberry in the south of England will grow well in cool situations and may sometimes be seen in gardens near [[London]] flourishing under the partial shade of [[Apple (fruit)|apple]] [[tree]]s, but in the north it needs full exposure to the sun to bring the fruit to perfection. It will succeed in almost any [[soil]] but prefers a rich loam or black alluvium, and, though naturally a plant of rather dry places, will do well in moist land, if drained.<ref name=Baynes/></blockquote>\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Gooseberry sectioned.jpg|thumb|right|Sectioned gooseberries showing seeds]]\n[[File:Gooseberry flower1.jpg|thumb|right| A blossom of ''Ribes uva-crispa'']]\nOne method of propagating gooseberries is by cuttings rather than raising from seed; cuttings planted in the autumn will take root quickly and can begin to bear fruit within a few years. Those growing from seeds will rapidly produce healthy heavily yielding bushes.\nPruning should be carried out to allow light in and give the new growth for next year's branches an opportunity to grow. Fruit is produced on lateral spurs and on the previous year's shoots.<ref name=Baynes/> The main aim is to let the light in and a subsidiary purpose is to allow picking without excessive scratching from the spines.\n\nHeavy nitrogen composting must be avoided as too much nitrogen will produce extensive growth and weaken the bush. This will make the bush susceptible to mildew. The fruit should best be picked off when large to reach maximum sweetness. Supermarkets tend to have theirs picked early and before they are ripe and sweet to give a long shelf life. Heavily laden branches should be cut off complete with berries, this really benefits future crops as it lets the light reach the new growth.\nCultivar 'Invicta' now is a popular green gooseberry which has some mildew resistance.<ref name=\"apps.rhs.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/agm/Award2.asp?User2=Fr&crit=ribes|title=Results > Search for AGM plants / RHS Gardening|work=rhs.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Illustration Ribes uva-crispa0.jpg|thumb|upright|''Ribes uva-crispa''<ref>[[Otto Wilhelm Thom\u00e9|Thom\u00e9, Otto Wilhelm]] (1885).

Scribner's sons   |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3c87AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA779 |page=779}}</ref>\n<blockquote>The gooseberry is indigenous to many parts of Europe and western [[Asia]], growing naturally in [[alpine climate|alpine]] thickets and [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] [[Forest|woods]] in the lower country, from [[France]] eastward, well into the Himalayas and peninsular India.\nIn [[Great Britain|Britain]], it is often found in [[copse]]s and [[hedgerow]]s and about old ruins, but the gooseberry has been cultivated for so long that it is difficult to distinguish wild bushes from feral ones, or to determine where the gooseberry fits into the native flora of the island. Common as it is now on some of the lower slopes of the [[Alps]] of [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] and [[Savoy]], it is uncertain whether the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] were acquainted with the gooseberry, though it may possibly be alluded to in a vague passage of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]''; the hot summers of [[Italy]], in ancient times as at present, would be unfavourable to its cultivation. Although gooseberries are now abundant in [[Germany]] and [[France]], it does not appear to have been much grown there in the [[Middle Ages]], though the wild fruit was held in some esteem [[Pharmacology|medicinally]] for the cooling properties of its [[acid]] juice in [[fever]]s; while the old [[English language|English]] name, ''Fea-berry'', still surviving in some provincial dialects, indicates that it was similarly valued in Britain, where it was planted in gardens at a comparatively early period.\n\n[[William Turner (ornithologist)|William Turner]] describes the gooseberry in his ''Herball'', written about the middle of the 16th century, and a few years later it is mentioned in one of Thomas Tusser's quaint rhymes as an ordinary object of garden culture. Improved varieties were probably first raised by the skilful gardeners of [[Holland]], whose name for the fruit, ''Kruisbezie'', may have been corrupted into the present English vernacular word. Towards the end of the 18th century the gooseberry became a favourite object of cottage-horticulture, especially in [[Lancashire, England|Lancashire]], where the working [[cotton]]-spinners raised numerous varieties from [[seed]], their efforts having been chiefly directed to increasing the size of the fruit.<ref name=Baynes/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stachelbeere (Ribes uva-crispa).jpg|thumb|upright|Red gooseberries]]\n\n<blockquote>Of the many hundred sorts enumerated in recent horticultural works, few perhaps equal in flavour some of the older denizens of the fruit-garden, such as the ''Old Rough Red'' and ''Hairy Amber''. The [[climate]] of the [[British Isles]] seems peculiarly adapted to bring the gooseberry to perfection, and it may be grown successfully even in the most northern parts of [[Scotland]]; indeed, the flavour of the fruit is said to improve with increasing latitude. In [[Norway]] even, the bush flourishes in gardens on the west coast nearly up to the [[Arctic]] Circle, and it is found wild as far north as 63\u00b0. The dry summers of the French and German plains are less suited to it, though it is grown in some hilly districts with tolerable success. The gooseberry in the south of England will grow well in cool situations and may sometimes be seen in gardens near [[London]] flourishing under the partial shade of [[Apple (fruit)|apple]] [[tree]]s, but in the north it needs full exposure to the sun to bring the fruit to perfection. It will succeed in almost any [[soil]] but prefers a rich loam or black alluvium, and, though naturally a plant of rather dry places, will do well in moist land, if drained.<ref name=Baynes/></blockquote>\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Gooseberry sectioned.jpg|thumb|right|Sectioned gooseberries showing seeds]]\n[[File:Gooseberry flower1.jpg|thumb|right| A blossom of ''Ribes uva-crispa'']]\nOne method of propagating gooseberries is by cuttings rather than raising from seed; cuttings planted in the autumn will take root quickly and can begin to bear fruit within a few years. Those growing from seeds will rapidly produce healthy heavily yielding bushes.\nPruning should be carried out to allow light in and give the new growth for next year's branches an opportunity to grow. Fruit is produced on lateral spurs and on the previous year's shoots.<ref name=Baynes/> The main aim is to let the light in and a subsidiary purpose is to allow picking without excessive scratching from the spines.\n\nHeavy nitrogen composting must be avoided as too much nitrogen will produce extensive growth and weaken the bush. This will make the bush susceptible to mildew. The fruit should best be picked off when large to reach maximum sweetness. Supermarkets tend to have theirs picked early and before they are ripe and sweet to give a long shelf life. Heavily laden branches should be cut off complete with berries, this really benefits future crops as it lets the light reach the new growth.\nCultivar 'Invicta' now is a popular green gooseberry which has some mildew resistance.<ref name=\"apps.rhs.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/agm/Award2.asp?User2=Fr&crit=ribes|title=Results > Search for AGM plants / RHS Gardening|work=rhs.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Illustration Ribes uva-crispa0.jpg|thumb|upright|''Ribes uva-crispa''<ref>[[Otto Wilhelm Thom\u00e9|Thom\u00e9, Otto Wilhelm]] (1885).

([[Foxglove]] and [[tobacco]] infusions were also sometimes used.) A 2008 study concluded that a solution of [[magnesium sulfate]] applied to a bush's leaves has a good residual action on the eggs and larvae of gooseberry sawfly, and also appears to deter egg-laying female sawflies.<ref name=\"pmid19226775\">{{cite journal| last1=Wenneker |first1=M. |last2=Helsen |first2=H. | title=Non-chemical control of leaf curling midges and sawflies in berries and currants | journal=Communications in Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences | year= 2008 | volume= 73 | issue= 3 | pages= 361\u201370 | pmid=19226775 }}</ref> Careful removal of fallen leaves and [[tilling (agriculture)|tilling]] of the ground around the plant will also destroy most eggs and chrysalises of these insects.\n\nLike most ''[[Ribes]]'', the gooseberry is an alternate host for [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]], which can cause serious damage to American [[Pinus classification|white pines]].<ref>American Phytopathological Society.
