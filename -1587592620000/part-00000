The population of the hamlet was 239, most of whom were workers in [[agriculture]] and related [[rural]] industries. There were three agricultural labourers and only one farmer; the next most important occupation was that of stonemason of whom there were eight. There were three shoemakers, two [[tailor]]s and two [[Shipbuilding|shipwrights]] as well as the following: rope-maker, joiner, [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]], carpenter, gardener, [[Occupational surname|sawyer]], [[wheelwright]], [[Weaver (occupation)|weaver]] and [[saddle]]r.\n\nIn the 18th century, smuggling was a key part of the economy, with tea, salt, rum and tobacco being some of the things smuggled into the local area.

The plans for many of these buildings can be found at the [[National Library of Wales]].\n\nA famous feature that existed in Penparcau was the [[toll house]]. It was built in 1771 and stood at the southern junction of Penparcau (hence the name Southgate). It was built of local [[slate]] stone and was roofed with [[Pembrokeshire]] slates. David Jones of Dihewyd was appointed as the first gatekeeper in November 1771, and the first tolls were charged on 23 March 1772. The building contains just one room, one end being used for the collection of tolls. A single fireplace at the opposite end of the house was used for heating and cooking. Toll houses were very unpopular with people in rural areas who had to pay to travel along the roads. At St Fagans the house has been furnished in the style of 1843, the period of the [[Rebecca Riots]] when many tollgates were destroyed in Wales. Turnpike Trusts were eventually abolished in 1864 with county councils taking over responsibility for building and maintaining the roads but the Penparcau toll house remained a residence until the 1960s.\n\n==Culture==\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] reported that over 40% of the residents of Penparcau spoke Welsh and used Welsh daily, larger than any other individual census zone within that area, when compared to the other census data sets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neighbourhood Statistics |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6116466&c=aberystwyth&d=14&e=16&g=415738&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1255081495663&enc=1&dsFamilyId=197 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604061541/http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6116466&c=aberystwyth&d=14&e=16&g=415738&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1255081495663&enc=1&dsFamilyId=197 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-06-04 |title=Check Browser Settings |publisher=Neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Residents==\nThe [[bard]] and academic writer [[D.

The last elections were held in May 2017.\n\nPenparcau is governed by [[Ceredigion County Council]] and Aberystwyth itself elects six of the 42 councillors in five separate wards (Bronglais, Central, North, [[Aberystwyth Rheidol|Rheidol]] and Penparcau - the Penparcau ward elects two of these). The two county councillors for Aberystwyth-Penparcau, elected in May 2017 were [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] and [[Plaid Cymru]].\n\nPenparcau has five [[Welsh Assembly]] members, one of whom is elected as a constituency AM for [[Ceredigion (Assembly constituency)|Ceredigion]], [[Elin Jones]] and four who are elected on the regional list for [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales electoral region)|Mid and West Wales]].\n\nThe village is also within the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion]] constituency for elections to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

There were three agricultural labourers and only one farmer; the next most important occupation was that of stonemason of whom there were eight. There were three shoemakers, two [[tailor]]s and two [[Shipbuilding|shipwrights]] as well as the following: rope-maker, joiner, [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]], carpenter, gardener, [[Occupational surname|sawyer]], [[wheelwright]], [[Weaver (occupation)|weaver]] and [[saddle]]r.\n\nIn the 18th century, smuggling was a key part of the economy, with tea, salt, rum and tobacco being some of the things smuggled into the local area.

The plans for many of these buildings can be found at the [[National Library of Wales]].\n\nA famous feature that existed in Penparcau was the [[toll house]]. It was built in 1771 and stood at the southern junction of Penparcau (hence the name Southgate). It was built of local [[slate]] stone and was roofed with [[Pembrokeshire]] slates. David Jones of Dihewyd was appointed as the first gatekeeper in November 1771, and the first tolls were charged on 23 March 1772. The building contains just one room, one end being used for the collection of tolls. A single fireplace at the opposite end of the house was used for heating and cooking. Toll houses were very unpopular with people in rural areas who had to pay to travel along the roads. At St Fagans the house has been furnished in the style of 1843, the period of the [[Rebecca Riots]] when many tollgates were destroyed in Wales. Turnpike Trusts were eventually abolished in 1864 with county councils taking over responsibility for building and maintaining the roads but the Penparcau toll house remained a residence until the 1960s.\n\n==Culture==\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] reported that over 40% of the residents of Penparcau spoke Welsh and used Welsh daily, larger than any other individual census zone within that area, when compared to the other census data sets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neighbourhood Statistics |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6116466&c=aberystwyth&d=14&e=16&g=415738&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1255081495663&enc=1&dsFamilyId=197 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604061541/http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6116466&c=aberystwyth&d=14&e=16&g=415738&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1255081495663&enc=1&dsFamilyId=197 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-06-04 |title=Check Browser Settings |publisher=Neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Residents==\nThe [[bard]] and academic writer [[D.

The two county councillors for Aberystwyth-Penparcau, elected in May 2017 were [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] and [[Plaid Cymru]].\n\nPenparcau has five [[Welsh Assembly]] members, one of whom is elected as a constituency AM for [[Ceredigion (Assembly constituency)|Ceredigion]], [[Elin Jones]] and four who are elected on the regional list for [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales electoral region)|Mid and West Wales]].\n\nThe village is also within the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion]] constituency for elections to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

Villagers followed these hoofprints and found that the creature had walked through fields, roads and even managed to walk over walls and roofs in one uninterrupted path.

It was thought that such a stadium could attract [[Davis Cup]] tennis matches, polo tournaments and the annual [[Army\u2013Navy Game|Army-Navy football game]]. A later effort by DC Director of Public Buildings and Parks [[Ulysses S. Grant III]] and Congressman [[Hamilton Fish III|Hamilton Fish]] of [[New York's 26th congressional district|New York]] sought to turn the National Stadium into a 100,000-seat memorial to [[Theodore Roosevelt]], suitable for hosting inaugurations, possibly on the [[National Mall]] or [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]]. This attracted the attention of the RMA, which suggested the East Capital location. This would allow the [[Lincoln Memorial]], then under construction west of the Capitol, and the Roosevelt memorial to become bookend monuments to the two great Republican presidents. The effort lost steam when Congress chose not to fund the stadium in time to move the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]] from [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dyersson|first1=Mark|last2=Trumpboer|first2=Robert|title=The Rise of Stadiums in the Modern United States: Cathedrals of Sport|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317989288|pages=59\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of a stadium gained support in 1938, when Senator [[Robert Rice Reynolds|Robert Reynolds]] of [[North Carolina]] pushed for the creation of a municipal outdoor stadium within the District, citing the \"fact that America is the only major country not possessing a stadium with facilities to accommodate the Olympic Games\". The following year a model of the proposed stadium, to be located near the current site of RFK Stadium, was presented to the public. By 1941, the National Capital Planning Commission had begun buying property for a stadium, purchasing the land between East Capitol, C, 19th and 21st NE.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nearly All Land for D.C.

Congressman [[Charles R. Howell]] of [[New Jersey's 4th congressional district|New Jersey]] proposed legislation to build a stadium, again with hopes of attracting the Olympics. He pushed for a report, completed in 1956 by the National Capital Planning Commission entitled \"Preliminary Report on Sites for National Memorial Stadium\", which identified the \"East Capitol Site\" to be used for the stadium. In September 1957, \"The District of Columbia Stadium Act\" was introduced and authorized a 50,000-seat stadium to be used by the Senators and Redskins at the Armory site. It was signed into law by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] on July 29, 1958, with an estimated cost of $7.5 to $8.6 million.<ref name=\"Return\"/> The lease for the stadium was signed by the D.C. Armory Board and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] on December 12, 1958. The stadium, the first major multisport facility built for both football and baseball, was designed by [[George Dahl]], Ewin Engineering Associates (since 1954 part of what became [[Volkert, Inc.]]) and [[Osborn Engineering]]. Groundbreaking for the {{nowrap|$24 million}} venue was in 1960 on July 8, and construction proceeded over the following 14 months.<ref name=\"History\"/> The existing venue for baseball (and football) in Washington was [[Griffith Stadium]], about {{convert|4|mi|0|spell=in}} northwest.\n\nWhile Redskins\u2019 owner [[George Preston Marshall]] was pleased with the stadium, Senators' owner [[Calvin Griffith]] was not.

In [[1974 North American Soccer League season|1974]], two Maryland businessmen purchased the rights to the Baltimore Bays of the semi-professional [[American Soccer League (1933\u201383)|American Soccer League]], moved the team to the District and renamed it the Washington Diplomats. They signed a lease calculating that an average of 12,000 spectators would allow them to break even. Despite [[white flight]], owners thought that recent completion of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Beltway]], the stadium's 12,000 parking spaces and future completion of a [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station would facilitate attendance. Games were scheduled for Saturday and prices were set low. The Diplomats inaugural game was on May 4 with an attendance of 10,175; Mayor [[Walter Washington]] ceremonially kicked off the game, but the Dips lost 5\u20131 to the [[1973 North American Soccer League season|defending]] [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL]] champion [[Philadelphia Atoms]]. Attendance dropped throughout the season.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\">{{cite book|last1=Elzey|first1=Chris|last2=Wiggins|first2=David K.|title=DC Sports: The Nation's Capital at Play|date=Jul 15, 2015|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=9781610755665|pages=159\u2013161}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the Diplomats were informed that the recently installed natural turf at RFK would not be ready for opening day, so they scheduled their first two home games that season for [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T. Woodson High School]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]]. After the games attracted more than 10,000 fans each, the Diplomats moved most of their home games to Woodson, but then moved the last five back to RFK once soccer superstar [[Pel\u00e9]] was added to the roster of the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]]. Pel\u00e9 was so popular that the 1975 Cosmos-Diplomats match broke the NASL attendance record at 35,620.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pele Packs Stands at RFK Stadium|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43269802|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=The Capitol|date=30 June 1975}}</ref> Even with the success of the Cosmos game, attendance declined again and before the [[1976 North American Soccer League season|1976]] season the Diplomats announced that they had scheduled every home game, except the one against the Cosmos, at Woodson. During the season, they moved that game to Woodson.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nAfter averaging 5,963 at Woodson, the Diplomats decided to ramp up their marketing and move back to RFK in [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977]]. The team changed everything from the uniforms to the cheerleaders, but the team's disappointing on-the-field performance hurt attendance (a ~31,000 fan game against Pel\u00e9 and the Cosmos notwithstanding). In [[1978 North American Soccer League season|1978]], attendance continued to fall, even though the Dips made the playoffs. Success on the field during the 1978 and [[1979 North American Soccer League season|1979]] seasons (including a franchise-best 19 wins in '79) did not translate to ticket a sales and even with a negligible amount of revenue from \u201c[[Indoor soccer|indoor]] Dips\u201d games at the D.C. Armory during the offseason, the franchise continued to lose money.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn [[1980 North American Soccer League season|1980]], they signed Dutch international superstar [[Johan Cruyff]], the Pel\u00e9 of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], from the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]]. Needing 20,000 fans per game to break even, they managed to attract 24,000 for the opener and a District record 53,351 for the game against the Pele-less Cosmos (the fifth-largest soccer crowd at RFK ever), but the team failed to break-even financially. After racking up debts of $5 million, the first incarnation of the Dips folded.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nThree months later, the [[Detroit Express]] announced a move to D.C. for [[1981 North American Soccer League season|1981]], and that they would also be the Diplomats. They had trouble attracting fans;<!--after the NASL championship game, the \"[[Soccer Bowl '80|Soccer Bowl]]\", was held at RFK,--> and soon folded.\n\nThe Diplomats of the NASL, racked up an impressive {{winning percentage|60|29|record=y}} record at RFK, the best winning percentage of any RFK home team, and were {{nowrap|1\u20131}} in the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Washington Diplomats Games|url=http://soccerstats.us/teams/washington-diplomats/games/|website=Soccer Stats|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn 1987, a new soccer team also called the [[Washington Diplomats (1988\u201390)|Washington Diplomats]], was formed. They played at RFK, and sometimes at the RFK auxiliary field, for three seasons as part of the [[American Soccer League (1988\u201389)|ASL]] and then the [[American Professional Soccer League|APSL]]. They won the ASL Championship in 1988 but often drew fewer than 1000 fans. In 1990 they finished last in the Southern Division of the APSL East, were unable to pay the rent and folded in October 1990.<ref name=\"Merger\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=James H.|title=Bays, Stars merger Diplomats kick in|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-10-30/sports/1990303001_1_maryland-bays-diplomats-baltimore-washington-area|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=30 October 1990}}</ref> Over the course of 4 seasons they were {{winning percentage|18|15|record=y}} at RFK, and 2-0 at the RFK auxiliary field.\n\n===George Washington Colonials (1961\u20131966)===\nThe other team to move from Griffith to D.C. Stadium was the [[George Washington Colonials football|George Washington University Colonials]] [[college football]] team. The stadium was dedicated during the October 7, 1961 game against VMI, the first college football game there, which GWU won 30-6. The Colonials were forced to play their first three games on the road to allow the stadium to be completed. In the following years, because the Senators had priority, GWU waited until October (when baseball season was over) to schedule games. From 1961 to 1964 they played road games in September, and in 1965 and 1966 they played at high school stadiums in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"History\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=George Washington U Drops Grid Program|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522053/|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=20 January 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Colonials, Like Cats, Seek First Win Saturday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522071/|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Daily Herald|date=27 September 1962}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonials had no real success at D.C.

The Nationals played their first three seasons ([[2005 Washington Nationals season|2005]]\u2013[[2007 Washington Nationals season|2007]]) at RFK, then moved to [[Nationals Park]] in [[2008 Washington Nationals season|2008]].

However, in his lone season with the team in [[2006 Washington Nationals season|2006]], [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit 46 home runs.\n\nDuring their three seasons at RFK, the Nationals failed to make the playoffs or post a winning record. They went 41-40 at home in 2005 and 2006 and 40-41 in 2007 to finish with a {{winning percentage|122|121|record=y}} record at RFK.\n\n=== Howard Bison (1970\u20132016) ===\nNo team has a long history with RFK Stadium than the [[Howard Bison football]] team, who played there 42 times over nearly 46 years (the Detroit Tigers are 2nd by ~8 months, having played their first game there April 9, 1962, and they're last on June 20, 2007).

Over three years, the Freedom racked up a 15-9-6 record at RFK and finished as one of the league's top teams. They came in 2nd in 2002 and won the league's Founder's Cup in 2003. They played all of their home games at RFK, except for one in 2001 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis to avoid the Washington Grand Prix. Their last game at RFK as part of WUSA was on August 2, 2003, when they defeated the San Jose Cyber Rays. They won the final Founder's Cup in August 2003 and returned to RFK a few days later - minus the players who were playing in the 2003 Women's World Cup - for a victory celebration with the fans, which would be their final WUSA event at RFK. WUSA suspended operation the next month. Their victory in the Founders Cup means that the Freedom won both the first and last games in WUSA history. For a time, their championship banner hung in RFK, but when the Nationals moved in, the banner was moved to the [[Maryland SoccerPlex|Maryland Soccerplex]].\n\nThe Freedom continued, first as an exhibition team called the Washington Freedom Soccer Club, and then as a member of the W-League and the Women's Professional Soccer league in 2006.

Towards the end of the 1967 season, the Whips resorted to organizing British Isles sporting contests such as cricket, hurling, and rugby before games in hopes of luring expatriates.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn 1968, to stay viable, they negotiated a reduction in the lease payment and reduced admission prices by one-third; among other discounts. The USA merged with the [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] to form the new [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]]. Despite problems on and off the field, the team found itself in a battle for a playoff spot and towards the end of the season crowds swelled to as much as 14,227 in what proved to be the deciding match for the NASL Atlantic Division title. This September 7, 1968 match against the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] was the last for the Whips at D.C. Stadium. That season, the team went 15-10-7 drawing an average of 6,586 fans.

But attendance quickly dropped off, with as few as 7,303 showing up for a late-season game against the [[Boston Breakers]]. The team went 4-14 in 1983 and 3-15 in 1984, averaging 7,700 fans.\n\nWith six games remaining in the 1984 season, owner Berl Bernhard sold the team to Florida real estate developer Woody Weiser. In the off-season, that deal fell through. Donald Dizney bought the team, moved it to Orlando and renamed it the Renegades.\n\nAfter going {{winning percentage|7|29|record=y}} overall, and {{winning percentage|5|18|record=y}} at RFK, the Federals ended their run with a 20-17 win over the [[New Orleans Breakers]] on June 24, 1984.\n\n===Team America (1983)===\n[[Team America (NASL)|Team America]] was a professional version of the United States men's national soccer team which played like a franchise in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL) during the 1983 season.

It was the first to use the so-called \"[[cookie-cutter stadium|cookie-cutter]]\" concept, an approach also used in [[Veterans Stadium|Philadelphia]], [[Shea Stadium|New York]], [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston]], [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium|Atlanta]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]], [[Qualcomm Stadium|San Diego]], [[Riverfront Stadium|Cincinnati]], [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum|Oakland]], and [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]]. RFK Stadium ultimately outlasted all of them except Houston, San Diego, and Oakland (the former is still standing but is no longer actively used, while the latter two are still active).\n\nWhile the perimeter of the stadium is circular, the front edge of the upper and lower decks form a \"V\" shape in deference to the baseball configuration.  The rows of seating in the upper and lower decks follow the \"V\" layout, and the discrepancy between the shapes of the inner and outer rings permits more rows of seats to be inserted along the foul lines than at home plate and in the outfield.  As a result, the height of the outside wall rises and falls in waves, and this is echoed in the roof, resulting in a \"butterfly\" appearance when seen at ground level from the west.  This feature is unique among the circular stadiums of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, the stadium represented a new level of luxury. It offered 50,000 seats, each {{convert|22|in|cm}} wide (at a time when the typical seat was only {{convert|15|\u2013|16|in|cm|abbr=on}}), air-conditioned locker rooms and a lounge for player's wives. It had a machine-operated tarpaulin to cover the field, yard-wide aisles, and ramps that made it possible to empty the stadium in just 15 minutes. The ticket office was connected to the ticket windows by pneumatic tubes. The press boxes could be enclosed and expanded for big events. The stadium had a holding cell for drunks and brawlers. It had 12,000 parking spaces and was served by 300 buses. It had lighting that was twice as bright as Griffith Stadium.<ref name=\"Jail\"/>\n\nIt was not ideal for either sport, due to the different geometries of the playing fields. As the playing field dimensions for football and baseball vary greatly, seating had to accommodate the larger playing surface. This would prove to be the case at nearly every multi-purpose/cookie-cutter stadium.\n\nAs a baseball park, RFK was a target of scorn from baseball purists, largely because it was one of the few stadiums with no lower-deck seats in the outfield. The only outfield seats were in the upper deck, above a high wall. According to ''[[The Sporting News|Sporting News]]'' publications in the 1960s, over 27,000 seats\u2014roughly 60% of the listed capacity of 45,000 for baseball\u2014were in the upper tier or mezzanine levels. The lower-to-upper proportion improved for the Redskins with end-zone seats. The first ten rows of the football configuration were nearly at the field level, making it difficult to see over the players. The baseball diamond was aligned due east (home plate to center field), and the football field ran along the first baseline (northwest to southeast).\n\n{{wide image|DC United.jpg|800px<!--|align-cap=center-->|Panoramic view <!--of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium--> in 2012, from the west corner (home plate to center field, due east)}}\n\nA [[Movable seating|complex conversion]] was necessary, at a cost of $40,000 each time, to change the stadium from a football configuration to baseball and back again; in its final form, this included rolling the third-base lower-level seats into the outfield along a buried rail, dropping the hydraulic pitcher's mound {{convert|3|ft|1}} into the ground, and laying sod over the infield dirt. Later facilities were designed so the seating configuration could be changed more quickly and at a lower cost. The conversion was required several times per year during the Senators' joint tenancy with the Redskins (1962\u201371) but became much more frequent during the Nationals/D.C. United era; in 2005, the conversion was made over twenty times.\n\nOriginally the seats located behind the stadium's third-base dugout were removed for baseball games and put back in place when the stadium was converted to the football (and later soccer) configuration. When these sections were in place, RFK seated approximately 56,000. With the Nationals' arrival in 2005, this particular segment of the stands was permanently removed to facilitate the switch between the baseball and soccer configurations. These seats were not restored following the Nationals' move to Nationals Park, leaving the stadium's [[seating capacity]] at approximately 46,000. The majority of the upper-deck seats normally were not made available for D.C. United matches, so the stadium's reduced capacity normally was not problematic for the club.\n\n<!--The football/soccer field alignment is northwest to southeast, approximately along the baseball diamond's first base line.-->\nDuring the years when the stadium was without baseball (1972\u20132004)<!--used only for Redskins games (1972\u201396)-->, the rotating seats remained in the football configuration. If an exhibition baseball game was scheduled, the left-field wall was only {{convert|250|ft|0}} from home plate, and a large screen was erected in left field for some games.\n\n[[File:Capitol from top of Washington Monument.JPG|250px|thumb|View east from [[Washington Monument]],<br>RFK Stadium in background]]\nSome of RFK's quirks endear the venue to fans and players.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The large rolling bleacher section is less stable than other seating, allowing fans to jump in rhythm to cause the whole area to bounce. Also, despite its small size (it never seated more than 58,000), because of the stadium's design and the proximity of the fans to the field when configured for football, the stadium was extremely loud when the usual sell-out Redskins crowds became vocal. Legend has it that Redskins head coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] would order a large rolling door in the side of the stadium to be opened when visiting teams were attempting field goals at critical moments in games so that a swirling wind from off the Potomac and Anacostia rivers might interfere with the flight of the kicked ball.\n\nSince the stadium is on a direct sightline with the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], light towers were not allowed; instead, [[Arc lamp|arc lights]] were placed on its curved, dipping roof.\n\nEvents D.C.\u2014the city agency which operates RFK Stadium\u2014began a strategic planning process in November 2013 to study options for the future of the stadium, its {{convert|80|acre|ha}} campus and the nonmilitary portions of the adjacent [[D.C. Armory]]. Events D.C. said one option to be studied was demolition within a decade, while another would be the status quo. The strategic planning process also included the design and development of options. The agency said that RFK Stadium has generated $4 million to $5 million a year in revenues since 1997, which did not cover operating expenses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/top-shelf/2013/11/events-dc-looks-at-next-steps-for-rfk.html|last=Cooper|first=Rebecca|title=Events D.C.

It was thought that such a stadium could attract [[Davis Cup]] tennis matches, polo tournaments and the annual [[Army\u2013Navy Game|Army-Navy football game]]. A later effort by DC Director of Public Buildings and Parks [[Ulysses S. Grant III]] and Congressman [[Hamilton Fish III|Hamilton Fish]] of [[New York's 26th congressional district|New York]] sought to turn the National Stadium into a 100,000-seat memorial to [[Theodore Roosevelt]], suitable for hosting inaugurations, possibly on the [[National Mall]] or [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]]. This attracted the attention of the RMA, which suggested the East Capital location. This would allow the [[Lincoln Memorial]], then under construction west of the Capitol, and the Roosevelt memorial to become bookend monuments to the two great Republican presidents. The effort lost steam when Congress chose not to fund the stadium in time to move the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]] from [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dyersson|first1=Mark|last2=Trumpboer|first2=Robert|title=The Rise of Stadiums in the Modern United States: Cathedrals of Sport|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317989288|pages=59\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of a stadium gained support in 1938, when Senator [[Robert Rice Reynolds|Robert Reynolds]] of [[North Carolina]] pushed for the creation of a municipal outdoor stadium within the District, citing the \"fact that America is the only major country not possessing a stadium with facilities to accommodate the Olympic Games\". The following year a model of the proposed stadium, to be located near the current site of RFK Stadium, was presented to the public. By 1941, the National Capital Planning Commission had begun buying property for a stadium, purchasing the land between East Capitol, C, 19th and 21st NE.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nearly All Land for D.C.

Congressman [[Charles R. Howell]] of [[New Jersey's 4th congressional district|New Jersey]] proposed legislation to build a stadium, again with hopes of attracting the Olympics. He pushed for a report, completed in 1956 by the National Capital Planning Commission entitled \"Preliminary Report on Sites for National Memorial Stadium\", which identified the \"East Capitol Site\" to be used for the stadium. In September 1957, \"The District of Columbia Stadium Act\" was introduced and authorized a 50,000-seat stadium to be used by the Senators and Redskins at the Armory site. It was signed into law by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] on July 29, 1958, with an estimated cost of $7.5 to $8.6 million.<ref name=\"Return\"/> The lease for the stadium was signed by the D.C. Armory Board and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] on December 12, 1958. The stadium, the first major multisport facility built for both football and baseball, was designed by [[George Dahl]], Ewin Engineering Associates (since 1954 part of what became [[Volkert, Inc.]]) and [[Osborn Engineering]]. Groundbreaking for the {{nowrap|$24 million}} venue was in 1960 on July 8, and construction proceeded over the following 14 months.<ref name=\"History\"/> The existing venue for baseball (and football) in Washington was [[Griffith Stadium]], about {{convert|4|mi|0|spell=in}} northwest.\n\nWhile Redskins\u2019 owner [[George Preston Marshall]] was pleased with the stadium, Senators' owner [[Calvin Griffith]] was not.

In [[1974 North American Soccer League season|1974]], two Maryland businessmen purchased the rights to the Baltimore Bays of the semi-professional [[American Soccer League (1933\u201383)|American Soccer League]], moved the team to the District and renamed it the Washington Diplomats. They signed a lease calculating that an average of 12,000 spectators would allow them to break even. Despite [[white flight]], owners thought that recent completion of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Beltway]], the stadium's 12,000 parking spaces and future completion of a [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station would facilitate attendance. Games were scheduled for Saturday and prices were set low. The Diplomats inaugural game was on May 4 with an attendance of 10,175; Mayor [[Walter Washington]] ceremonially kicked off the game, but the Dips lost 5\u20131 to the [[1973 North American Soccer League season|defending]] [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL]] champion [[Philadelphia Atoms]]. Attendance dropped throughout the season.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\">{{cite book|last1=Elzey|first1=Chris|last2=Wiggins|first2=David K.|title=DC Sports: The Nation's Capital at Play|date=Jul 15, 2015|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=9781610755665|pages=159\u2013161}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the Diplomats were informed that the recently installed natural turf at RFK would not be ready for opening day, so they scheduled their first two home games that season for [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T. Woodson High School]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]]. After the games attracted more than 10,000 fans each, the Diplomats moved most of their home games to Woodson, but then moved the last five back to RFK once soccer superstar [[Pel\u00e9]] was added to the roster of the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]]. Pel\u00e9 was so popular that the 1975 Cosmos-Diplomats match broke the NASL attendance record at 35,620.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pele Packs Stands at RFK Stadium|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43269802|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=The Capitol|date=30 June 1975}}</ref> Even with the success of the Cosmos game, attendance declined again and before the [[1976 North American Soccer League season|1976]] season the Diplomats announced that they had scheduled every home game, except the one against the Cosmos, at Woodson. During the season, they moved that game to Woodson.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nAfter averaging 5,963 at Woodson, the Diplomats decided to ramp up their marketing and move back to RFK in [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977]]. The team changed everything from the uniforms to the cheerleaders, but the team's disappointing on-the-field performance hurt attendance (a ~31,000 fan game against Pel\u00e9 and the Cosmos notwithstanding). In [[1978 North American Soccer League season|1978]], attendance continued to fall, even though the Dips made the playoffs. Success on the field during the 1978 and [[1979 North American Soccer League season|1979]] seasons (including a franchise-best 19 wins in '79) did not translate to ticket a sales and even with a negligible amount of revenue from \u201c[[Indoor soccer|indoor]] Dips\u201d games at the D.C. Armory during the offseason, the franchise continued to lose money.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn [[1980 North American Soccer League season|1980]], they signed Dutch international superstar [[Johan Cruyff]], the Pel\u00e9 of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], from the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]]. Needing 20,000 fans per game to break even, they managed to attract 24,000 for the opener and a District record 53,351 for the game against the Pele-less Cosmos (the fifth-largest soccer crowd at RFK ever), but the team failed to break-even financially. After racking up debts of $5 million, the first incarnation of the Dips folded.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nThree months later, the [[Detroit Express]] announced a move to D.C. for [[1981 North American Soccer League season|1981]], and that they would also be the Diplomats. They had trouble attracting fans;<!--after the NASL championship game, the \"[[Soccer Bowl '80|Soccer Bowl]]\", was held at RFK,--> and soon folded.\n\nThe Diplomats of the NASL, racked up an impressive {{winning percentage|60|29|record=y}} record at RFK, the best winning percentage of any RFK home team, and were {{nowrap|1\u20131}} in the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Washington Diplomats Games|url=http://soccerstats.us/teams/washington-diplomats/games/|website=Soccer Stats|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn 1987, a new soccer team also called the [[Washington Diplomats (1988\u201390)|Washington Diplomats]], was formed. They played at RFK, and sometimes at the RFK auxiliary field, for three seasons as part of the [[American Soccer League (1988\u201389)|ASL]] and then the [[American Professional Soccer League|APSL]]. They won the ASL Championship in 1988 but often drew fewer than 1000 fans. In 1990 they finished last in the Southern Division of the APSL East, were unable to pay the rent and folded in October 1990.<ref name=\"Merger\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=James H.|title=Bays, Stars merger Diplomats kick in|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-10-30/sports/1990303001_1_maryland-bays-diplomats-baltimore-washington-area|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=30 October 1990}}</ref> Over the course of 4 seasons they were {{winning percentage|18|15|record=y}} at RFK, and 2-0 at the RFK auxiliary field.\n\n===George Washington Colonials (1961\u20131966)===\nThe other team to move from Griffith to D.C. Stadium was the [[George Washington Colonials football|George Washington University Colonials]] [[college football]] team. The stadium was dedicated during the October 7, 1961 game against VMI, the first college football game there, which GWU won 30-6. The Colonials were forced to play their first three games on the road to allow the stadium to be completed. In the following years, because the Senators had priority, GWU waited until October (when baseball season was over) to schedule games. From 1961 to 1964 they played road games in September, and in 1965 and 1966 they played at high school stadiums in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"History\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=George Washington U Drops Grid Program|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522053/|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=20 January 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Colonials, Like Cats, Seek First Win Saturday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522071/|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Daily Herald|date=27 September 1962}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonials had no real success at D.C.

The Nationals played their first three seasons ([[2005 Washington Nationals season|2005]]\u2013[[2007 Washington Nationals season|2007]]) at RFK, then moved to [[Nationals Park]] in [[2008 Washington Nationals season|2008]].

However, in his lone season with the team in [[2006 Washington Nationals season|2006]], [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit 46 home runs.\n\nDuring their three seasons at RFK, the Nationals failed to make the playoffs or post a winning record.

Over three years, the Freedom racked up a 15-9-6 record at RFK and finished as one of the league's top teams. They came in 2nd in 2002 and won the league's Founder's Cup in 2003. They played all of their home games at RFK, except for one in 2001 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis to avoid the Washington Grand Prix. Their last game at RFK as part of WUSA was on August 2, 2003, when they defeated the San Jose Cyber Rays. They won the final Founder's Cup in August 2003 and returned to RFK a few days later - minus the players who were playing in the 2003 Women's World Cup - for a victory celebration with the fans, which would be their final WUSA event at RFK. WUSA suspended operation the next month. Their victory in the Founders Cup means that the Freedom won both the first and last games in WUSA history.

The USA merged with the [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] to form the new [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]]. Despite problems on and off the field, the team found itself in a battle for a playoff spot and towards the end of the season crowds swelled to as much as 14,227 in what proved to be the deciding match for the NASL Atlantic Division title. This September 7, 1968 match against the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] was the last for the Whips at D.C. Stadium. That season, the team went 15-10-7 drawing an average of 6,586 fans.

For the opening game, 38,000 fans showed up to see the return of former Redskins coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]], the coach of the [[Chicago Blitz]], in a game, the Federals lost, 28\u20137. But attendance quickly dropped off, with as few as 7,303 showing up for a late-season game against the [[Boston Breakers]]. The team went 4-14 in 1983 and 3-15 in 1984, averaging 7,700 fans.\n\nWith six games remaining in the 1984 season, owner Berl Bernhard sold the team to Florida real estate developer Woody Weiser. In the off-season, that deal fell through. Donald Dizney bought the team, moved it to Orlando and renamed it the Renegades.\n\nAfter going {{winning percentage|7|29|record=y}} overall, and {{winning percentage|5|18|record=y}} at RFK, the Federals ended their run with a 20-17 win over the [[New Orleans Breakers]] on June 24, 1984.\n\n===Team America (1983)===\n[[Team America (NASL)|Team America]] was a professional version of the United States men's national soccer team which played like a franchise in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL) during the 1983 season. The team played its home games at RFK Stadium and was intended by the NASL and the United States Soccer Federation to build fan support for the league and create a cohesive and internationally competitive national team. However, the team finished in the last place drawing 12,000 fans per game.\n\nTeam America played 19 games at RFK. In those games they went 5-10 in NASL matches and tied three friendlies against [[Watford F.C.]] (from the [[United Kingdom]]), [[FC Dinamo Minsk]] (from the [[Soviet Union]]), and [[Juventus F.C.]] (from [[Italy]]) for a final record of {{winning percentage|5|10|3|record=y}}.\n\nThe team's attendance averaged 19,952 through the first seven home matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com:80/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121147/index.htm|title=Red, White, Black and Blue|publisher=Sports Illustrated|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504211958/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121147/index.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> including the 50,108 who attended a match vs. Fort Lauderdale that featured a free [[Beach Boys]] concert. Losses led to declining attendance as the season wore on. Attendance averaged 13,002 for the entire 1983 season, having played only a single season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenn.com/the_blog/?page_id=496|title=Attendance Project: NASL \u2013 kenn.com blog|website=www.kenn.com}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe stadium's design was circular, attempting to facilitate both football and baseball. It was the first to use the so-called \"[[cookie-cutter stadium|cookie-cutter]]\" concept, an approach also used in [[Veterans Stadium|Philadelphia]], [[Shea Stadium|New York]], [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston]], [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium|Atlanta]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]], [[Qualcomm Stadium|San Diego]], [[Riverfront Stadium|Cincinnati]], [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum|Oakland]], and [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]]. RFK Stadium ultimately outlasted all of them except Houston, San Diego, and Oakland (the former is still standing but is no longer actively used, while the latter two are still active).\n\nWhile the perimeter of the stadium is circular, the front edge of the upper and lower decks form a \"V\" shape in deference to the baseball configuration.  The rows of seating in the upper and lower decks follow the \"V\" layout, and the discrepancy between the shapes of the inner and outer rings permits more rows of seats to be inserted along the foul lines than at home plate and in the outfield.  As a result, the height of the outside wall rises and falls in waves, and this is echoed in the roof, resulting in a \"butterfly\" appearance when seen at ground level from the west.  This feature is unique among the circular stadiums of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, the stadium represented a new level of luxury. It offered 50,000 seats, each {{convert|22|in|cm}} wide (at a time when the typical seat was only {{convert|15|\u2013|16|in|cm|abbr=on}}), air-conditioned locker rooms and a lounge for player's wives. It had a machine-operated tarpaulin to cover the field, yard-wide aisles, and ramps that made it possible to empty the stadium in just 15 minutes. The ticket office was connected to the ticket windows by pneumatic tubes. The press boxes could be enclosed and expanded for big events. The stadium had a holding cell for drunks and brawlers. It had 12,000 parking spaces and was served by 300 buses. It had lighting that was twice as bright as Griffith Stadium.<ref name=\"Jail\"/>\n\nIt was not ideal for either sport, due to the different geometries of the playing fields. As the playing field dimensions for football and baseball vary greatly, seating had to accommodate the larger playing surface. This would prove to be the case at nearly every multi-purpose/cookie-cutter stadium.\n\nAs a baseball park, RFK was a target of scorn from baseball purists, largely because it was one of the few stadiums with no lower-deck seats in the outfield. The only outfield seats were in the upper deck, above a high wall. According to ''[[The Sporting News|Sporting News]]'' publications in the 1960s, over 27,000 seats\u2014roughly 60% of the listed capacity of 45,000 for baseball\u2014were in the upper tier or mezzanine levels. The lower-to-upper proportion improved for the Redskins with end-zone seats. The first ten rows of the football configuration were nearly at the field level, making it difficult to see over the players. The baseball diamond was aligned due east (home plate to center field), and the football field ran along the first baseline (northwest to southeast).\n\n{{wide image|DC United.jpg|800px<!--|align-cap=center-->|Panoramic view <!--of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium--> in 2012, from the west corner (home plate to center field, due east)}}\n\nA [[Movable seating|complex conversion]] was necessary, at a cost of $40,000 each time, to change the stadium from a football configuration to baseball and back again; in its final form, this included rolling the third-base lower-level seats into the outfield along a buried rail, dropping the hydraulic pitcher's mound {{convert|3|ft|1}} into the ground, and laying sod over the infield dirt. Later facilities were designed so the seating configuration could be changed more quickly and at a lower cost. The conversion was required several times per year during the Senators' joint tenancy with the Redskins (1962\u201371) but became much more frequent during the Nationals/D.C. United era; in 2005, the conversion was made over twenty times.\n\nOriginally the seats located behind the stadium's third-base dugout were removed for baseball games and put back in place when the stadium was converted to the football (and later soccer) configuration. When these sections were in place, RFK seated approximately 56,000. With the Nationals' arrival in 2005, this particular segment of the stands was permanently removed to facilitate the switch between the baseball and soccer configurations. These seats were not restored following the Nationals' move to Nationals Park, leaving the stadium's [[seating capacity]] at approximately 46,000. The majority of the upper-deck seats normally were not made available for D.C. United matches, so the stadium's reduced capacity normally was not problematic for the club.\n\n<!--The football/soccer field alignment is northwest to southeast, approximately along the baseball diamond's first base line.-->\nDuring the years when the stadium was without baseball (1972\u20132004)<!--used only for Redskins games (1972\u201396)-->, the rotating seats remained in the football configuration. If an exhibition baseball game was scheduled, the left-field wall was only {{convert|250|ft|0}} from home plate, and a large screen was erected in left field for some games.\n\n[[File:Capitol from top of Washington Monument.JPG|250px|thumb|View east from [[Washington Monument]],<br>RFK Stadium in background]]\nSome of RFK's quirks endear the venue to fans and players.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The large rolling bleacher section is less stable than other seating, allowing fans to jump in rhythm to cause the whole area to bounce. Also, despite its small size (it never seated more than 58,000), because of the stadium's design and the proximity of the fans to the field when configured for football, the stadium was extremely loud when the usual sell-out Redskins crowds became vocal. Legend has it that Redskins head coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] would order a large rolling door in the side of the stadium to be opened when visiting teams were attempting field goals at critical moments in games so that a swirling wind from off the Potomac and Anacostia rivers might interfere with the flight of the kicked ball.\n\nSince the stadium is on a direct sightline with the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], light towers were not allowed; instead, [[Arc lamp|arc lights]] were placed on its curved, dipping roof.\n\nEvents D.C.\u2014the city agency which operates RFK Stadium\u2014began a strategic planning process in November 2013 to study options for the future of the stadium, its {{convert|80|acre|ha}} campus and the nonmilitary portions of the adjacent [[D.C. Armory]]. Events D.C. said one option to be studied was demolition within a decade, while another would be the status quo. The strategic planning process also included the design and development of options. The agency said that RFK Stadium has generated $4 million to $5 million a year in revenues since 1997, which did not cover operating expenses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/top-shelf/2013/11/events-dc-looks-at-next-steps-for-rfk.html|last=Cooper|first=Rebecca|title=Events D.C.

Initially produced by [[Verity Lambert]], it was made by [[Euston Films]], a subsidiary of [[Thames Television]] and shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (originally by Thames, then [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]] in 1993 and 1994 after Thames lost its franchise). The original show ran for ten series between 29 October 1979 and 10 March 1994. The series was notable for using a range of leading British actors, as well as many up-and-coming performers before they found their greatest success; at its peak it was one of ITV's most watched shows.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that a new version of ''Minder'' would go into production for broadcast in 2009 (on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]), although none of the original cast would appear in the new episodes. The new show focused on Arthur's nephew Archie (created solely for this new version), played by [[Shane Richie]]. The series began broadcast on 4 February 2009. In 2010, it was announced that no further episodes would be made following lukewarm reception to the first series.<ref name=\"Richie\">{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7535370.stm|title= Shane Richie to star in Minder|publisher= BBC Online|date= 31 July 2008|accessdate= 27 January 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Return\">{{cite news|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5654203.ece|title= Shane Richie: Grease is the path to Minder life|publisher= Times Online|date= 4 February 2009|accessdate= 4 February 2009 | location=London | first=Adam | last=Sherwin}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe original show starred [[Dennis Waterman]] as Terry McCann, an honest and likeable bodyguard (''minder'' in [[London slang]]) and [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] as Arthur Daley, a socially ambitious, but highly unscrupulous importer-exporter, wholesaler, used-car salesman and purveyor of anything else from which there was money to be made, whether within the law or not.\n\nThe series is principally set in inner west London ([[Shepherd's Bush]]/[[Ladbroke Grove]]/[[Fulham]]/[[Acton, London|Acton]]), and was largely responsible for putting the word [[Wiktionary:Minder|minder]], meaning personal bodyguard, into the UK popular lexicon. The characters often drank at the local members-only Winchester Club, where owner and barman Dave Harris ([[Glynn Edwards]]) acted, often unwillingly, as a message service for Arthur, and turned a blind eye to his shady deals. \n\nLike many British sitcoms, the show is set firmly within a certain social class, in this case working class west London. It shares strong similarities with ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' and ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' in the sense that much of the storyline revolves around a dysfunctional, co-dependent relationship between the two protagonists. In the case of ''Minder'', they are not family members but friends. These relationships are marked by the older person (Arthur, Del Boy, Albert Steptoe) controlling and frustrating the life of his younger, dimmer counterpart (Terry, Rodney, Harold Steptoe). In each case of both ''Only Fools and Horses'' and ''Minder'', this older character is also the sharp, aspirant dreamer whereas in ''Steptoe and Son'', Harold is aspirant dreamer trapped by his lot having to inherit the family business.\n\n===Series 1-7===\nAlthough initially developed to focus on Terry's character, as the series progressed, the focus shifted to feature Terry and Arthur more evenly, with more screen time to Arthur and his dealings. Barman Dave (whose last name was given on a couple of occasions as Harris) at first made only occasional appearances, but the rapport between Arthur, Terry and Dave also become popular and by the second series he too was given more screen time: In Series 7, the final series to feature Dennis Waterman as Terry and thus the last to feature the original opening credits, the sequence was modified very slightly to include shots of Terry, Arthur and Dave at the Winchester, giving Edwards his own billing (previously he had been credited amongst the guest cast).\n\n===Series 8-10===\nIn 1989, after filming the seventh series, Waterman announced he had left the series, feeling that the character had run its course, and that it was becoming harder for the writers to come up with plots as sharp as had been customary in the series. This seemed to signify the end, but the series made another return in 1991, with another character replacing Terry. Waterman's final broadcast episode, Series 7's coincidentally titled \"The Wrong Goodbye\", had closed as a standard episode, filmed before Waterman's announcement that he was to leave and so with no clue as to Terry's forthcoming departure. In the opening episode of series 8, \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Entrepreneur\", Arthur finds Terry (unseen in the episode) had married and emigrated to Australia (despite the character's criminal background making the likelihood of emigration almost impossible) to finally escape his influence. At the same time, he is stuck with looking after his nephew Ray Daley ([[Gary Webster (actor)|Gary Webster]]), at the request of Arthur's brother to give him employment and keep him out of trouble.\n\nWith Terry out of the scene, local undesirables start to muscle in on Arthur, but it soon emerges that Ray is able to handle himself in a fight, and indeed in a tight situation, and Arthur appoints him his new \"minder\". Ray was portrayed as smarter, having a well expressed intelligence and basic education ('O' Level French and woodwork) as well as being able to fight (instances of which, by this stage, were far less frequent and far less graphic than seen in the show's early episodes). He was also a snappy dresser, typically seen in designer suits, and not a heavy drinker, usually seen sipping [[mineral water]] or a soft drink. Ray did not have a regular car and was usually lumbered with the beaten up old blue [[Ford Transit]] van from Arthur's lock-up.\n\nThe original theme tune was replaced by a rock-style instrumental version, credited to \"Kenny\" (Gerard Kenny). By this stage, the rough and ready elements of the early series had been toned down, concentrating on the comedic aspects of Arthur's dodgy dealings. Waterman praised Gary Webster for fitting into the series, but was vocal in his comments that the series was no longer about a minder and that the revamped version should go under a different title, reflecting its orientation almost solidly around Arthur.\n\nOther new characters in this revamped version were Sidney Livingstone (who had previously appeared as casino bouncer in the episode, \"You Lose Some, You Win Some\") as Bert Daley, Arthur's gullible, over-trusting brother (and Ray's father), who views Arthur as a successful businessman and not a con-man and entrusts Ray into his care; Bert's wife and Ray's mum, Doreen ([[Lill Roughley]]); and Ray's recurring girlfriend Gloria (Emma Cunningham), who is frustrated with Ray being torn between her and Arthur's lackey. The new police nemesis was Detective Sergeant Michael Morley ([[Nick Day]]), paired with D.C. Park ([[Stephen Tompkinson]]) in series 8, who in turn, was replaced by D.C. Field (Jonty Stephens) in series 9.\n\nThe end of the final episode of Series 10, \"The Long Good Thursday\", saw Arthur (with Ray, Dave and crazy prisoner, Frankie ([[Matthew Scurfield]]) finally being caught and driven away in a police convoy. In a final monologue over closing credits, Arthur was bemused, citing himself as a hardworking, upstanding citizen. The following week, a repeat showing of the first episode, \"Gunfight at the O.K. Laundrette\" (slightly edited for its pre-watershed start) was broadcast. Cole made an opening introduction, saying he had been asked to choose his favourite episode, but all were of such quality that he couldn't. He closed with \"Goodbye... for now\", hinting that he or the show may return.\n\n===Series 11===\n\n[[File:Minder 2009 Titles.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Final [[title sequence]]]]\n\nIn July 2008, it was announced ''Minder'' was to resume on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] after a 15-year break. The first episode of the six-part series was broadcast on 4 February 2009. The makers emphasised that it was a revival, rather than a remake.\n\nThe show focused on Arthur's nephew Archie, played by [[Shane Richie]], and a new 'minder' character, Jamie Cartwright, played by [[Lex Shrapnel]]. Channel 5 stated in July 2008, that there were no plans for Cole, Waterman or Webster to reprise their roles in the relaunched series. The series was produced by [[Talkback Thames]].<ref name=\"Richie\"/><ref name=\"Metro13Jan09\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?Shane_Richies_Minder_is_launched&in_article_id=475852&in_page_id=7&in_a_source=\n|title=Shane Richie's Minder is launched!\n|publisher=Metro\n|date=13 January 2009\n|accessdate=14 January 2009\n|quote=Shane plays Archie Daley, with Royal Shakespeare Company actor Lex Shrapnel taking on the role of his minder, Jamie Cartwright...

These featured a series of adverts on television and billboards. Other promotions included advertisements on taxi receipts, a social networking campaign and branded beer mats, all designed to attract the young male audience Channel 5 was targeting. ''The Sun'' reported that Richie banned Waterman from appearing in the series remake, but Richie told fans to ignore this story, saying it would be an honour to be in the company of Waterman and Cole, let alone work with them on television.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/20/minder-campaign-to-hit-streets|title= Minder campaign to hit streets|publisher= The Guardian|date= 20 January 2009|accessdate= 4 February 2009 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney}}</ref> Although a Christmas episode was initially planned and announced ahead of the intended second series, on 31 May 2009, UK newspaper ''The Mirror'' reported that, due to alleged poor ratings, Channel 5 would not be commissioning a new series of Minder.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/05/31/minder-s-flop-axed-115875-21402376/|title= Shane Richie Five remake of Minder axed after alleged ratings flop|publisher= Daily Mirror|date= 31 May 2009|accessdate= 31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Minder cast members}}\n\n===Terry McCann===\nTerry is a former professional [[Boxing|boxer]] who has served time in [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] [[prison]] (\"two years for [[Grievous bodily harm|GBH]] and three for attempted robbery\" according to a police sergeant in the first episode, \"Gunfight at the OK Laundrette\", although other episodes slightly contradict this and the overall charges are often quite vague), having served a substantial term because he would not become an [[informant]] against his co-accused. With few options, Terry is employed as Arthur's minder on vague and ungenerous terms, with it often being hinted that Arthur has [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] him into this job, and indeed is seen to continue to manipulate Terry throughout the character's run in the series, despite his often attempting to find other means of employment and break free from Arthur's control. (The later feature-length special \"An Officer and a Car Salesman\", which leads into Series 7, Terry's last stint in the series, begins with Terry once again inside, this time after being caught with some of Arthur's hookey merchandise). In Terry and Arthur's final episode \"The Wrong Goodbye\", it is suggested that one of Terry's prison terms was taken in place of Arthur and explains why Arthur and Terry have a deep bond, though casts Arthur's treatment of Terry in far less flattering light.\n\nIn the title sequence, Arthur is shown meeting Terry at the prison gates following his release. He drives a white [[Ford Capri]], although it is never made clear whether Terry had bought the vehicle from Arthur, hence their meeting, or if Arthur had given to Terry this car as part of their ensuing working deal, in the same manner as the flat that Arthur houses Terry in. (Terry drives a copper coloured Capri in some mid-run episodes, and a silver Capri in several others, and the exact model is seen to vary between different episodes). Terry enjoys a drink but usually responsibly, does not smoke and has an eye for the ladies. Despite his incarceration, he is honest, trustworthy and loyal, particularly to Arthur, although the scrapes that Arthur lands him in make him wonder why. He is intelligent and [[Know-how|streetwise]] enough to disperse situations that his role as minder often lands himself, and Arthur or those around him, in, although at the same time is seen not to be strong willed enough to break free of Arthur's often devious ways of keeping their working relationship in place.\n\nIndeed, it is Terry's romantic interests who are far less impressed with Arthur's hold on Terry and frequently suggest that he should break free from Arthur and start making his own path in life (often as a precursor to a deeper relationship). Arthur sees these women as a threat to his workforce and is not adverse to breaking up any relationship which may interfere in Terry's availability. While Terry resents this, he is also commitment shy and resists attempts to settle down often, which Arthur exploits through a thinly veiled desire for him to be independent of women.\n\n===Arthur Daley===\nArthur is a mid-level professional [[criminal]] of rather mature years, a minor [[confidence trick|con man]] eternally involved in dodgy dealings and usually seen puffing Castella [[Panatella]] [[cigars]]. In the series 3 episode \"In\", we discover from a German police officer reading Arthur's file that Arthur served 18 months in prison during the 1950s, although we do not learn what for. It is revealed in the episode \"The Balance of Power\" that Arthur's middle name is Edward.\n\nArthur typically drives an upmarket car, beginning with a silver [[Jaguar XJ6]] 4.2 Series II. In the latter part of Series 3, Arthur has changed over to a silver [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] 280E and in Series 4 he drives a Portland beige [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] Sovereign 4.2 Series III. Series 7 again sees Arthur driving a silver Jaguar XJ6. As a used-car salesman, it is not surprising that Arthur occasionally makes use of other cars. In the Series 3 episode \"Broken Arrow\", he uses a [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] Mk.II. However, due to an accident, this car has to go in for repair and Arthur is forced to borrow a friend's customised [[Chevrolet Corvette C3]] Stingray that he is trying to sell. Also in Series 3, Arthur uses a brown Jaguar XJR in the episodes \"Dead Men Do Tell Tales\" and \"Looking for Micky\". In the Series 7 episode \"[[It's a Sorry Lorry, Morrie|It's a Sorry Lorry, Morrie!]]\", Arthur is down on his luck and has to resort to driving a clapped-out mustard yellow [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] Mk.II. In the episode \"A Nice Little Wine\" Daley drives, in order to test, a pale blue [[Rover SD1]].\nIn the special episode \"[[An Officer and a Car Salesman]]\", Arthur has moved up in the world and drives a yellow [[Rolls Royce Silver Shadow]].\n\nHe survives by his wiles and self-belief, and exploits everyone, especially Terry. He is always trying to make a quick few [[Pound sterling|quid]] which he often describes as a \"nice little earner\", and his schemes usually backfire and leave him either in debt to local underworld figures, or with his activities coming under the scrutiny of the police (or often a combination of both) - with Terry ultimately being left to sort out the mess and get him out of trouble. Arthur thinks of himself as an \"[[entrepreneur]]\", but his tailored three-piece suits, Jaguar and social affectations do not disguise his [[working class]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and origins. Arthur tests Terry's patience with dishonest and doomed schemes to make money (\"nice little earners\"), then uses his cunning to persuade Terry to stay with him. In the same way, Arthur manipulates friends such as Dave, the barman (and part owner with Arthur) of the private, if [[downmarket]], Winchester [[Club (organization)|Club]]. Arthur refers to his wife, who [[Unseen character|never appeared]], as \"'er indoors\"; the implication that she is a fierce and formidable woman is reinforced by the appearance of actress [[Claire Davenport]] (famous for such roles) as her sister. Arthur is not above bending the law and sometimes attracts the keen attention of the local police. Despite being the one who we know has been to prison (Arthur having served time as well but this is only mentioned in one episode (Series 3, episode 13, \"In\") with an additional oblique reference to \"minor misdemeanours in the dim and distant past\" (Series 3, episode 11, \"Poetic Justice, innit?\")) it is Terry who serves as the show\u2019s moral conscience, keeping Arthur from straying too far outside the law and persuading him to do the right thing whether Arthur likes it or not. The name Arthur Daley has become synonymous with a dishonest salesman or small-time crook.<ref>See ''From Fulham with Love'', Series 6.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3066615.stm |title=Politics &#124; Tories blast 'Arthur Daley' Blair |publisher=BBC News |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=21 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith Arthur's dodgy schemes, the duo encounter undesirable underworld figures, many of whom Arthur deals with and many of whom turn nasty, leaving Terry to fight and outwit their way out of trouble. But for all Arthur's obsession with [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s, he is never malicious, usually simply being blinded by greed, and the pair often end up putting some other wrong right or helping others in need or who have been done wrong by, even if it proves to be Arthurs's [[Achilles' heel]] to his latest scheme fully succeeding. Most of Arthur's schemes fail in the end, owing to his greediness, but he does occasionally have the odd minor victory and puts one over on the law or more serious criminals.\n\nArthur's favourite drink was a large [[vodka]] and [[Tonic water|tonic]], which was referred to as a \"large V.A.T\", a [[wordplay]] on [[Value Added Tax]] (the UK tax on sales).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minderphenomenon.com/inside2.php |title=Minder: A phenomenon in the making |website=Minderphenomenon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Dave Harris===\nDave is a childhood friend, part owner (with Arthur) and barman of the local members-only, the Winchester Club. Arthur and Terry regularly drink there and Dave acts, often unwillingly, as a message service for Arthur, and turns a blind eye to the shady deals being arranged by the patrons. As a counsel and resource of last resort, he on occasion helps Arthur and Terry get out of tight spots through offering advice, money, space at the Winchester to store items or people and reluctantly, personal information through a brother-in-law working in the police.\n\nWith a trading licence to maintain, he is a wise character keeping the delicate balance of a legitimate private members' drinking establishment and a safe space for the local villains to congregate. Frequently given first refusal on Arthur's dodgy merchandise, he has been offered cars, watches, clothing and various consumer goods.\n\nVarious episodes give snippets of his home life, where we learn he has a wife (Lucy, whose only appearance is in Series 7, episode 2, \"Days of Fines and Closures\"), a daughter (Naomi, mentioned in Series 2, episode 10 \"The Old School Tie\" ) and a dead cat.\n\n===Police adversaries===\nGiven the nature of Arthur's activities and Terry's criminal past, they were always in the spotlight of the local police and crossed paths with several regular and occasional characters:\n\n'''DS Albert Chisholm'''; Detective Sergeant Albert \"Cheerful Charlie\" Chisholm (played by [[Patrick Malahide]]) made a brief appearance in the first episode and appeared in another 23 episodes in the first six series. Chisholm frequently arrested Arthur, but was not clever enough to make charges stick. Beginning in Series 3, he was accompanied by:\n\n'''DC/DS 'Taff' Jones'''; (played by [[Meic Povey]]), a Welshman. Although, not seeming particularly bright on first sight, Jones often proved sharper (though only mildly) than his superior, and was quietly amused by Arthur's frequent humiliation of Chisholm, even occasionally going into the Winchester for a social drink, away from Chisholm's domination. He tolerated the put-downs of his senior officer with 'Celtic willpower and a morbid fear of unemployment'. Jones was promoted to Detective Sergeant in Series 7, with DC MacDonald (Robin Cameron) as his assistant.\n\n'''DC/DS Ronald Rycott'''; Detective Constable Ronald \"Kenny\" Rycott (played by [[Peter Childs]]) made his first appearance in Episode 3, \"The Smaller They Are\". Rycott previously had a 'spot of bother', which prevented him from rising through the ranks, although, he later became a detective sergeant. A lone figure, not afraid of violent situations and more than willing to do a bit of \"freelance\" work, he was frequently on the edge of a nervous attack as Arthur slipped through his fingers. Rycott appeared in another 14 episodes up to the end of Series 7. His regular assistant was:\n\n'''DC Melish'''; ([[Michael Troughton]]). DC Melish was, like DC Jones, mainly amused at Arthur's activities.\n\nMany episodes in the first seven series featured either Chisholm and Jones or Rycott and Mellish, and the two pairs sometimes appeared together, emphasising the professional rivalry between them, much to the annoyance of their superior officer, Detective (Chief) Inspector Norton ([[Tony Caunter]]). This rivalry reached fever pitch in the episode \"Around the Corner\" (which closed Series 5) when all four officers, in two cars, crashed head-on whilst attempting to arrest Arthur and Terry. D.I. Norton's subsequent comments were scathing. Although Norton's appearances were always brief, they demonstrated the personal nature of Chisholm's and Rycott's campaigns. In the Series 6 episode \"From Fulham with Love\", Norton appears for less than a minute, but spends that entire appearance denouncing Chisholm for his \"personal vendetta against Arthur Daley\".\n\nIn the feature-length, \"[[An Officer and a Car Salesman]]\" that preceded series 7, Chisholm was written out (he was seen to have taken a job as a security officer), and Jones was promoted to DS. Although, he took over the probing of Arthur's plots, he was less hell-bent on nabbing him, finding most of Arthur's schemes humorous.\n\nNew police officers appeared from Series 8:\n\n'''DS Michael Morley'''; ([[Nicholas Day (actor)|Nicholas Day]]) DS Michael Morley was also a highly driven officer, but tempered with a sense of humour that Chisholm lacked. He also failed to make charges against Arthur stand up in court. His assistants were:\n\n'''DC Park'''; ([[Stephen Tompkinson]]). DC Johnny Park was openly amused at Arthur and Ray's activities, but knew his duty, as did\n\n'''DC Field'''; DC Field (Jonty Stephens) was a conscientious officer but occasionally did Arthur a good turn when he deserved it (which was rare).\n\n'''DS Rogerson'''; (James Warrior). DS Richard Rogerson was a loyal and tenacious 'old school' officer. On occasion, he even assisted Ray to prove that Arthur was innocent of police charges.\n\n===Other characters===\nArthur's world was mainly populated by petty crooks, fellow minders, dropouts, 'tea leaves', 'fences' and those happy to quickly turn over dodgy goods, usually (but not always) without violence. They included such memorable characters as fellow car dealer Wally West, Jewish travel agent-cum undertaker Monty Wiseman, 'Dirty 'arry', 'Mournful Morris', 'Incapable' (a drunk surgeon) 'Self Inflicted Sid', 'Freddy, the Fly', 'Scotch Harry', 'Pongo Harris', 'Dipso Pete' and 'Oily Wragg' (played by [[Pete Postlethwaite]]). As the series progressed, the guest stars became more prestigious, including [[Derek Jacobi]] as criminal Freddy Fenton, [[Brian Glover]] as Arthur's old army buddy Yorkie, [[Suzi Quatro]] as Terry's singer girlfriend Nancy, and [[Michael Kitchen]] as 'Maltese Tony'. The last series starring Cole and Waterman featured [[Billy Connolly]] playing Tick-tack, a bookie and grifter, [[Brian Blessed]] as DI Dyer, [[Ian McShane]] as gangster Jack Last and [[Roy Kinnear]] as Fat Charlie.\n\nIndeed, the show gave roles to young actors who have since achieved considerable fame including [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Steve McFadden]], [[Peter Capaldi]] and [[Bill Nighy]].\n\nIn practically every other episode, Arthur would refer to his wife as \"'er indoors\" (Ray would call her \"Auntie\" in the later series). This character was never named or appeared throughout the entire series.\n\nRecurring characters included professional gambler Maurice Michaelson ([[Anthony Valentine]]) (series 1-2), Des ([[George Layton]]) (series 1-3), a back-street mechanic friend of Terry's who was friendly and likable, but not beyond car theft when called for; kind-hearted stripper Debbie Mitchell (Diana Malin) and air stewardess Penny ([[Gennie Nevinson]]), both recurring girlfriends of Terry's; [[Ray Winstone]] as mechanic Arnie (series 4-7, conceived as a replacement for George Layton's Des and as dim as Des was sharp); and [[wide boy]] Justin James ([[Mark Farmer (actor)|Mark Farmer]]) (series 5-7), who idolised Arthur and aspired to be like him, seeing him as a kind of godfather. [[Royce Mills]] also starred as Arthur's financial adviser, Andrew, whose character appeared in a number of episodes across several series.\n\n[[Rula Lenska]] played a number of roles in the show and was married to Dennis Waterman.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Minder'' was devised by writer [[Leon Griffiths]] as a vehicle for Dennis Waterman after his success in ''[[The Sweeney]]''. George Cole's wheeler-dealer character is almost secondary, with Arthur assigning Terry a new \"minding\" job in each episode. A number of early episodes focus on Terry in such assignments, with Arthur remaining in the background. However, as the comedy potential of Cole's dodgy-dealing character emerged, as well as the successful on-screen pairing of Waterman and Cole (which proved to be one of the series' most popular elements), the emphasis increasingly focused more on Arthur's exploits, and by a few series into the show's life, typical plots revolved more around Arthur's latest shady scams instead of some of the more \"gritty\" plots of Terry's minding jobs.\n\nDespite its eventual success, ''Minder'' was a slow burner, not helped by being delayed by a nine-week technicians' strike which effectively blacked out the ITV network. In the light of initially poor viewing figures, management at Thames were intent on scrapping the show but managing director [[Bryan Cowgill]] persuaded them to commission one further series and repeat the first. Both attracted much larger audiences and by series 3, the show had become a major hit, and at its peak was often cited as the jewel in ITV's Drama crown.\n\n===Storylines===\nThe tone of the programme in series one and two, and much of series three, mixed poignant drama and [[action film|action sequences]] with offbeat comic moments, and many of these tales had a grittier feel to them than the more light-hearted storylines that would go on to be more familiar. As the series progressed over 15 years, more emphasis was placed on the comedic aspects of the minder-principal relationship, and the show became more a comedy driven by a dramatic plot. [[Satire|Social satire]] played a strong part throughout the series, grounded in the cinematic and social ethos of the 1980s. In the earlier series, Terry would succeed in seducing a 'dolly bird', resulting in at least one scene of female semi-nudity per average episode, though as the series became more popular these instances were reduced (and some repeat viewings, even those post-[[watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]], toned such scenes down). Although always an element of the series, the fights - common and brutal in early episodes - were also toned down and became less frequent.\n\nAnother significant element of the series were the subplots typically found in a Minder episode. Although subplots weren't necessarily found in all of the episodes, they were found in most and usually consisted of one of Arthur's dodgy deals, Terry's minding jobs and/or favours done for friends and in a few instances involved the police tackling particular cases.\n\nThe series has a number of parallels with long-running [[BBC]] comedy ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', with both being set in London and involving lovable dodgy dealers with endless get-rich-quick schemes that invariably backfire and get them into trouble (and both of whom tried to make out to be of a higher status than they really were), and both having a blend of comedy and drama. Indeed, ''Only Fools and Horses'' creator / writer [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]] claimed that one of the ways he persuaded the BBC to commission the series was by pointing to the success of ITV's ''Minder'', which had begun the previous year. After both having lukewarm starts, both series went on to become huge hits, and share much of the same fan base. At Christmas 1985, specials of ''Only Fools and Horses'' and ''Minder'' were scheduled against each other, angering many viewers in the days before [[Videocassette recorder|video recorders]] were commonplace in UK homes.\n\nWhen the series was first broadcast, some viewers complained about the use of swearing and foul language in the episodes.  Even though this gave the storylines a sense of gritty reality, it was noticed that as the series progressed from season to season, the amount of swearing steadily decreased up to the point that when the special episode TV feature film \"Minder on the [[Orient Express]]\" was broadcast, there was practically none at all.\n\n===Recurring features===\nAs well as heavy use of leading British actors, other features were Arthur's constant [[rhyming slang]] and other [[Malapropism|misquoted sayings]] (one being \"the world is your [[lobster]]\" and \"I had a dream\"), the derelict sites used as locations, and the episode titles, which contained references to films (e.g. \"Gunfight at the O.K. Launderette\", \"Monday Night Fever\", \"National Pelmet\", \"The Beer Hunter\", \"Days of Fines and Closures\", \"The Wrong Goodbye\" and \"Guess Who's Coming to [[Pinner]]?\").\n\n===Opening and closing credits===\nThe show's opening credit sequence shows the Arthur Daley and Terry McCann characters negotiating over the sale of the white Ford Capri interspersed with still photos of the two main characters, highlighting Terry's credentials as a retired boxer and ex-convict, this presumably symbolising the characters' first meeting and the terms of their partnership. During the Dennis Waterman era, the closing credits consisted of a number of black and white (with blue tint) still photographs of Arthur and Terry together outside famous London landmarks, and a few hinting of (unseen) previous escapades typical of a standard episode plot. In the later Gary Webster series, this changed to Arthur and Ray walking along [[Southend Pier]], which is over a mile long: at the end Arthur realises he has left his lighter at the other end of the pier and they start to walk back to find it.\n\n===Theme tune===\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = I Could Be So Good for You\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Dennis Waterman]]\n| album      =\n| B-side     = Nothing at All\n| released   = {{release date|1980|10|13|df=yes}}\n| format     = [[gramaphone record|7\" vinyl]]\n| recorded   = 1979\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = Pop\n| length     = 3:17\n| label      = [[EMI]]\n| writer     = [[Gerard Kenny]] <br /> [[Patricia Maynard|Patricia Waterman]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe theme tune, \"I Could Be So Good for You\", was released on 13 October 1980 and originally written in 1979 by [[Gerard Kenny]] and [[Patricia Maynard|Patricia Waterman]] and sung by [[Dennis Waterman]], the official credits of Kenny/Waterman often lead people to mis-credit Dennis as co-writer. The record reached No.3 in the UK charts in November 1980 and led Waterman to tour as a singer. Dennis Waterman also sang the theme songs to other programmes he starred in, including ''[[On the Up]]'', ''[[Stay Lucky]]'', and ''[[New Tricks]]'', and this led to a parody in ''[[Little Britain]]'' where Dennis Waterman is offered acting work; he always assumes he will also \"write the theme tune, sing the theme tune...\". Dennis Waterman surprised the audience of a ''[[Comic Relief]]'' stage show where he came on stage in the middle of a Little Britain sketch, bemoaning the impact it has had on his work as a 'classically trained actor'. He does however forgive the sketch so long as he gets to sing his 'theme tune', which he does to rapturous applause.\n\nGlasgow band [[Attic Lights]] re-worked the theme for the 2009 series.<ref>[http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/tv-showbiz-news/music-news/2008/11/02/attic-lights-win-deal-to-record-new-theme-tune-for-minder-comeback-78057-20862115/ Attic Lights win deal to record new theme tune for Minder comeback] Sunday Mail, 2 November 2008</ref>\n\nWriter Gerard Kenny has also released his own version of the song, appearing on his 1994 album ''Time Between the Time''. A live version of the song sung in duet between Gerard Kenny and Dennis Waterman was released on 1997's ''The Best of Gerard Kenny - The Singles'' album. Also, in 2004, Kenny released yet another album ''Coming Home'' which featured a \"chilled\" (and slower) recording of the song as its opening track.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Minder episodes}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The highest rated episode was 1984's \"Second Hand Pose\", with 16.4 million viewers. In 2005, Arthur Daley came second in ITV's 50th anniversary poll to find its favourite TV characters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4275032.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; TV and Radio &#124; Emmerdale tops ITV 50th ratings |publisher=BBC News |date=23 September 2005 |accessdate=21 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe show was a number of times said to have come to its end, only to reappear. For example, in 1984, ''[[TV Times]]'' reported that series 5 would be the last. In 1985, it again seemed as if that the current series was the last one, and it was off-air (bar repeats) for three years, to reappear in 1988. This series appeared to be the last as Dennis Waterman announced his departure at the end of its run. However, after a two-and-a-half-year break, the show was back again for a further two-and-a-half-year run, which ended with the 10th series in 1994.\n\n==In other media==\n===Music===\nThe series inspired a hit single, \"Arthur Daley (E's Alright!)\" by [[The Firm (novelty band)|The Firm]], which made the UK Top 20 in 1982. George Cole and Dennis Waterman released a Christmas record in 1983 called \"What are We Gonna Get 'Er Indoors?\" which reached No. 21 in the charts. The duo performed it on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 22 December 1983.\n\n===Annuals===\nIn 1980, an [[annual publication|annual]] based on the series was released by Grandreams. It was based upon the early concept of the series being based around Terry, and made no reference to Arthur. Two further annuals were released by World International Publishing for 1985 and 1986. These annuals featured both Terry and Arthur, with illustrations of both Dennis Waterman and George Cole.\n\n===Computer game===\nIn 1985, an officially licensed ''Minder'' computer game was published for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. The player's aim was to make money by buying and selling goods. The game was written by [[Don Priestley]] and published by [[DK'Tronics]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* ''I Could Be So Good For You''/''Nothing At All'' (single), Dennis Waterman & The Dennis Waterman Band (1979), EMI5009.\n* {{cite book | title=Arthur Daley's Guide to Doing It Right | author=Leon Griffiths | isbn=978-0-00-218176-1 | year = 1985}}\n* {{cite book | title=Back to Basics: Arthur Daley's Anatomy of Britain | author=Andrew Nickolds | isbn=978-0-434-00021-0 | year = 1994}}\n* {{cite book | title=Straight Up: The autobiography of Arthur Daley | author=Paul Ableman & Leon Griffiths | isbn=978-0-434-00066-1 | year = 1991}}\n* {{cite book | title=Minder | author=Anthony Masters | isbn=978-0-7221-5824-1 | year = 1984}}\n* {{cite book | title=Minder&nbsp;\u2013 Back Again | author=Anthony Masters | isbn=978-0-7221-5823-4 | year = 1984}}\n* {{cite book | title=Minder&nbsp;\u2013 Yet Again! | author=Anthony Masters | isbn=978-0-7221-5827-2 | year = 1985}}\n* {{cite book | title=Leave It Out, Arthur: The Minder Series | author=Anthony Masters | isbn=978-0-7474-0482-8 | year = 1987}}\n* {{cite book | title=The Phenomenon that was Minder | author=Brian Hawkins | isbn=978-962-86812-1-1 | year = 2002}}\n* {{cite book | title=ReMinder | author=Dennis Waterman & Jill Arlon | isbn=978-0-09-180108-3 | year = 2000}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{External links|date=May 2016}}\n* [http://www.minderphenomenon.com/ The Complete Minder Book released in 2014]\n* [http://www.minder.org/ Minder website]\n* {{IMDb title|id=0078657|title=Minder}}\n* {{Screenonline TV title|508417|Minder}}\n* [http://www.britishdrama.org.uk/minder.html The British Drama website]\n* [http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/drama/minder.htm Minder] at Nostalgia Central\n* [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/minder/minder.htm Encyclopedia of Television] - [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]\n* {{IMDb title|id=1285075|title=Minder (2009)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minder (Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1979 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2009 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1970s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British comedy-drama television series]]\n[[Category:1990s British comedy-drama television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British comedy-drama television series]]\n[[Category:Channel 5 (British TV channel) television programmes]]\n[[Category:ITV comedy]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:ITV comedy-dramas]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremantle (company)]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Thames Television]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Central Independent Television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:British television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Television series by Euston Films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Television series}}\n{{Redirect|Arthur Daley|the American journalist|Arthur Daley (sportswriter)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox television|\n | show_name = Minder\n | image = Minder 1979 Titles.png\n | caption = Original [[title sequence]] featuring<br>[[Dennis Waterman]] (1979\u20131989).\n | language = English\n | country = United Kingdom\n | runtime = 60 minutes <small><br>(including commercials)\n | genre = [[Comedy-drama]]\n | creator = [[Leon Griffiths]]\n | starring = [[Dennis Waterman]]<br>[[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]]<br>[[Glynn Edwards]]<br>[[Gary Webster]]<br>[[Shane Richie]]<br>[[Lex Shrapnel]]\n | channel = [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] <small>(1979\u20131994)</small><br>[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] <small>(2009)</small>\n | first_aired ='''ITV series:'''<br />{{start date|1979|10|29|df=yes}} \u2013 {{end date|1994|3|10|df=yes}}<br />'''Channel 5 series:'''<br />{{start date|2009|2|4|df=yes}} \u2013 {{end date|2009|3|11|df=yes}}\n | num_series = 11\n | num_episodes = 114 ([[List of Minder episodes|List of episodes]])\n | company = [[Euston Films]] <small>(1979\u20131994)</small><br>[[Thames Television|Thames]] <small>(1979\u20131991)</small><br>[[ITV Central|Central]] <small>(1993\u20131994)</small><br>[[Talkback Thames]] <small>(2009)</small>\n | distributor = [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]]\n | audio_format = [[Monaural|Mono]] <small>(1979\u20131991)</small><br>[[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]] <small>(1993\u20131994, 2009)</small>\n | picture_format = [[4:3]] <small>(1979\u20131994)</small><br>[[16:9]] <small>(2009)</small>\n |}}\n\n'''''Minder''''' is a British [[comedy-drama]] series about the London [[Organized crime|criminal underworld]]. Initially produced by [[Verity Lambert]], it was made by [[Euston Films]], a subsidiary of [[Thames Television]] and shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (originally by Thames, then [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]] in 1993 and 1994 after Thames lost its franchise). The original show ran for ten series between 29 October 1979 and 10 March 1994. The series was notable for using a range of leading British actors, as well as many up-and-coming performers before they found their greatest success; at its peak it was one of ITV's most watched shows.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that a new version of ''Minder'' would go into production for broadcast in 2009 (on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]), although none of the original cast would appear in the new episodes. The new show focused on Arthur's nephew Archie (created solely for this new version), played by [[Shane Richie]]. The series began broadcast on 4 February 2009. In 2010, it was announced that no further episodes would be made following lukewarm reception to the first series.<ref name=\"Richie\">{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7535370.stm|title= Shane Richie to star in Minder|publisher= BBC Online|date= 31 July 2008|accessdate= 27 January 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Return\">{{cite news|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5654203.ece|title= Shane Richie: Grease is the path to Minder life|publisher= Times Online|date= 4 February 2009|accessdate= 4 February 2009 | location=London | first=Adam | last=Sherwin}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe original show starred [[Dennis Waterman]] as Terry McCann, an honest and likeable bodyguard (''minder'' in [[London slang]]) and [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] as Arthur Daley, a socially ambitious, but highly unscrupulous importer-exporter, wholesaler, used-car salesman and purveyor of anything else from which there was money to be made, whether within the law or not.\n\nThe series is principally set in inner west London ([[Shepherd's Bush]]/[[Ladbroke Grove]]/[[Fulham]]/[[Acton, London|Acton]]), and was largely responsible for putting the word [[Wiktionary:Minder|minder]], meaning personal bodyguard, into the UK popular lexicon. The characters often drank at the local members-only Winchester Club, where owner and barman Dave Harris ([[Glynn Edwards]]) acted, often unwillingly, as a message service for Arthur, and turned a blind eye to his shady deals. \n\nLike many British sitcoms, the show is set firmly within a certain social class, in this case working class west London. It shares strong similarities with ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' and ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' in the sense that much of the storyline revolves around a dysfunctional, co-dependent relationship between the two protagonists. In the case of ''Minder'', they are not family members but friends. These relationships are marked by the older person (Arthur, Del Boy, Albert Steptoe) controlling and frustrating the life of his younger, dimmer counterpart (Terry, Rodney, Harold Steptoe). In each case of both ''Only Fools and Horses'' and ''Minder'', this older character is also the sharp, aspirant dreamer whereas in ''Steptoe and Son'', Harold is aspirant dreamer trapped by his lot having to inherit the family business.\n\n===Series 1-7===\nAlthough initially developed to focus on Terry's character, as the series progressed, the focus shifted to feature Terry and Arthur more evenly, with more screen time to Arthur and his dealings. Barman Dave (whose last name was given on a couple of occasions as Harris) at first made only occasional appearances, but the rapport between Arthur, Terry and Dave also become popular and by the second series he too was given more screen time: In Series 7, the final series to feature Dennis Waterman as Terry and thus the last to feature the original opening credits, the sequence was modified very slightly to include shots of Terry, Arthur and Dave at the Winchester, giving Edwards his own billing (previously he had been credited amongst the guest cast).\n\n===Series 8-10===\nIn 1989, after filming the seventh series, Waterman announced he had left the series, feeling that the character had run its course, and that it was becoming harder for the writers to come up with plots as sharp as had been customary in the series. This seemed to signify the end, but the series made another return in 1991, with another character replacing Terry. Waterman's final broadcast episode, Series 7's coincidentally titled \"The Wrong Goodbye\", had closed as a standard episode, filmed before Waterman's announcement that he was to leave and so with no clue as to Terry's forthcoming departure. In the opening episode of series 8, \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Entrepreneur\", Arthur finds Terry (unseen in the episode) had married and emigrated to Australia (despite the character's criminal background making the likelihood of emigration almost impossible) to finally escape his influence. At the same time, he is stuck with looking after his nephew Ray Daley ([[Gary Webster]]), at the request of Arthur's brother to give him employment and keep him out of trouble.\n\nWith Terry out of the scene, local undesirables start to muscle in on Arthur, but it soon emerges that Ray is able to handle himself in a fight, and indeed in a tight situation, and Arthur appoints him his new \"minder\". Ray was portrayed as smarter, having a well expressed intelligence and basic education ('O' Level French and woodwork) as well as being able to fight (instances of which, by this stage, were far less frequent and far less graphic than seen in the show's early episodes). He was also a snappy dresser, typically seen in designer suits, and not a heavy drinker, usually seen sipping [[mineral water]] or a soft drink. Ray did not have a regular car and was usually lumbered with the beaten up old blue [[Ford Transit]] van from Arthur's lock-up.\n\nThe original theme tune was replaced by a rock-style instrumental version, credited to \"Kenny\" (Gerard Kenny). By this stage, the rough and ready elements of the early series had been toned down, concentrating on the comedic aspects of Arthur's dodgy dealings. Waterman praised Gary Webster for fitting into the series, but was vocal in his comments that the series was no longer about a minder and that the revamped version should go under a different title, reflecting its orientation almost solidly around Arthur.\n\nOther new characters in this revamped version were Sidney Livingstone (who had previously appeared as casino bouncer in the episode, \"You Lose Some, You Win Some\") as Bert Daley, Arthur's gullible, over-trusting brother (and Ray's father), who views Arthur as a successful businessman and not a con-man and entrusts Ray into his care; Bert's wife and Ray's mum, Doreen ([[Lill Roughley]]); and Ray's recurring girlfriend Gloria (Emma Cunningham), who is frustrated with Ray being torn between her and Arthur's lackey. The new police nemesis was Detective Sergeant Michael Morley ([[Nick Day]]), paired with D.C. Park ([[Stephen Tompkinson]]) in series 8, who in turn, was replaced by D.C. Field (Jonty Stephens) in series 9.\n\nThe end of the final episode of Series 10, \"The Long Good Thursday\", saw Arthur (with Ray, Dave and crazy prisoner, Frankie ([[Matthew Scurfield]]) finally being caught and driven away in a police convoy. In a final monologue over closing credits, Arthur was bemused, citing himself as a hardworking, upstanding citizen. The following week, a repeat showing of the first episode, \"Gunfight at the O.K. Laundrette\" (slightly edited for its pre-watershed start) was broadcast. Cole made an opening introduction, saying he had been asked to choose his favourite episode, but all were of such quality that he couldn't. He closed with \"Goodbye... for now\", hinting that he or the show may return.\n\n===Series 11===\n\n[[File:Minder 2009 Titles.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Final [[title sequence]]]]\n\nIn July 2008, it was announced ''Minder'' was to resume on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] after a 15-year break. The first episode of the six-part series was broadcast on 4 February 2009. The makers emphasised that it was a revival, rather than a remake.\n\nThe show focused on Arthur's nephew Archie, played by [[Shane Richie]], and a new 'minder' character, Jamie Cartwright, played by [[Lex Shrapnel]]. Channel 5 stated in July 2008, that there were no plans for Cole, Waterman or Webster to reprise their roles in the relaunched series. The series was produced by [[Talkback Thames]].<ref name=\"Richie\"/><ref name=\"Metro13Jan09\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?Shane_Richies_Minder_is_launched&in_article_id=475852&in_page_id=7&in_a_source=\n|title=Shane Richie's Minder is launched!\n|publisher=Metro\n|date=13 January 2009\n|accessdate=14 January 2009\n|quote=Shane plays Archie Daley, with Royal Shakespeare Company actor Lex Shrapnel taking on the role of his minder, Jamie Cartwright...

These featured a series of adverts on television and billboards. Other promotions included advertisements on taxi receipts, a social networking campaign and branded beer mats, all designed to attract the young male audience Channel 5 was targeting. ''The Sun'' reported that Richie banned Waterman from appearing in the series remake, but Richie told fans to ignore this story, saying it would be an honour to be in the company of Waterman and Cole, let alone work with them on television.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/20/minder-campaign-to-hit-streets|title= Minder campaign to hit streets|publisher= The Guardian|date= 20 January 2009|accessdate= 4 February 2009 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney}}</ref> Although a Christmas episode was initially planned and announced ahead of the intended second series, on 31 May 2009, UK newspaper ''The Mirror'' reported that, due to alleged poor ratings, Channel 5 would not be commissioning a new series of Minder.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/05/31/minder-s-flop-axed-115875-21402376/|title= Shane Richie Five remake of Minder axed after alleged ratings flop|publisher= Daily Mirror|date= 31 May 2009|accessdate= 31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Minder cast members}}\n\n===Terry McCann===\nTerry is a former professional [[Boxing|boxer]] who has served time in [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] [[prison]] (\"two years for [[Grievous bodily harm|GBH]] and three for attempted robbery\" according to a police sergeant in the first episode, \"Gunfight at the OK Laundrette\", although other episodes slightly contradict this and the overall charges are often quite vague), having served a substantial term because he would not become an [[informant]] against his co-accused. With few options, Terry is employed as Arthur's minder on vague and ungenerous terms, with it often being hinted that Arthur has [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] him into this job, and indeed is seen to continue to manipulate Terry throughout the character's run in the series, despite his often attempting to find other means of employment and break free from Arthur's control. (The later feature-length special \"An Officer and a Car Salesman\", which leads into Series 7, Terry's last stint in the series, begins with Terry once again inside, this time after being caught with some of Arthur's hookey merchandise). In Terry and Arthur's final episode \"The Wrong Goodbye\", it is suggested that one of Terry's prison terms was taken in place of Arthur and explains why Arthur and Terry have a deep bond, though casts Arthur's treatment of Terry in far less flattering light.\n\nIn the title sequence, Arthur is shown meeting Terry at the prison gates following his release. He drives a white [[Ford Capri]], although it is never made clear whether Terry had bought the vehicle from Arthur, hence their meeting, or if Arthur had given to Terry this car as part of their ensuing working deal, in the same manner as the flat that Arthur houses Terry in. (Terry drives a copper coloured Capri in some mid-run episodes, and a silver Capri in several others, and the exact model is seen to vary between different episodes). Terry enjoys a drink but usually responsibly, does not smoke and has an eye for the ladies. Despite his incarceration, he is honest, trustworthy and loyal, particularly to Arthur, although the scrapes that Arthur lands him in make him wonder why. He is intelligent and [[Know-how|streetwise]] enough to disperse situations that his role as minder often lands himself, and Arthur or those around him, in, although at the same time is seen not to be strong willed enough to break free of Arthur's often devious ways of keeping their working relationship in place.\n\nIndeed, it is Terry's romantic interests who are far less impressed with Arthur's hold on Terry and frequently suggest that he should break free from Arthur and start making his own path in life (often as a precursor to a deeper relationship). Arthur sees these women as a threat to his workforce and is not adverse to breaking up any relationship which may interfere in Terry's availability. While Terry resents this, he is also commitment shy and resists attempts to settle down often, which Arthur exploits through a thinly veiled desire for him to be independent of women.\n\n===Arthur Daley===\nArthur is a mid-level professional [[criminal]] of rather mature years, a minor [[confidence trick|con man]] eternally involved in dodgy dealings and usually seen puffing Castella [[Panatella]] [[cigars]]. In the series 3 episode \"In\", we discover from a German police officer reading Arthur's file that Arthur served 18 months in prison during the 1950s, although we do not learn what for. It is revealed in the episode \"The Balance of Power\" that Arthur's middle name is Edward.\n\nArthur typically drives an upmarket car, beginning with a silver [[Jaguar XJ6]] 4.2 Series II. In the latter part of Series 3, Arthur has changed over to a silver [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] 280E and in Series 4 he drives a Portland beige [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] Sovereign 4.2 Series III. Series 7 again sees Arthur driving a silver Jaguar XJ6. As a used-car salesman, it is not surprising that Arthur occasionally makes use of other cars. In the Series 3 episode \"Broken Arrow\", he uses a [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] Mk.II. However, due to an accident, this car has to go in for repair and Arthur is forced to borrow a friend's customised [[Chevrolet Corvette C3]] Stingray that he is trying to sell. Also in Series 3, Arthur uses a brown Jaguar XJR in the episodes \"Dead Men Do Tell Tales\" and \"Looking for Micky\". In the Series 7 episode \"[[It's a Sorry Lorry, Morrie|It's a Sorry Lorry, Morrie!]]\", Arthur is down on his luck and has to resort to driving a clapped-out mustard yellow [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] Mk.II. In the episode \"A Nice Little Wine\" Daley drives, in order to test, a pale blue [[Rover SD1]].\nIn the special episode \"[[An Officer and a Car Salesman]]\", Arthur has moved up in the world and drives a yellow [[Rolls Royce Silver Shadow]].\n\nHe survives by his wiles and self-belief, and exploits everyone, especially Terry. He is always trying to make a quick few [[Pound sterling|quid]] which he often describes as a \"nice little earner\", and his schemes usually backfire and leave him either in debt to local underworld figures, or with his activities coming under the scrutiny of the police (or often a combination of both) - with Terry ultimately being left to sort out the mess and get him out of trouble. Arthur thinks of himself as an \"[[entrepreneur]]\", but his tailored three-piece suits, Jaguar and social affectations do not disguise his [[working class]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and origins. Arthur tests Terry's patience with dishonest and doomed schemes to make money (\"nice little earners\"), then uses his cunning to persuade Terry to stay with him. In the same way, Arthur manipulates friends such as Dave, the barman (and part owner with Arthur) of the private, if [[downmarket]], Winchester [[Club (organization)|Club]]. Arthur refers to his wife, who [[Unseen character|never appeared]], as \"'er indoors\"; the implication that she is a fierce and formidable woman is reinforced by the appearance of actress [[Claire Davenport]] (famous for such roles) as her sister. Arthur is not above bending the law and sometimes attracts the keen attention of the local police. Despite being the one who we know has been to prison (Arthur having served time as well but this is only mentioned in one episode (Series 3, episode 13, \"In\") with an additional oblique reference to \"minor misdemeanours in the dim and distant past\" (Series 3, episode 11, \"Poetic Justice, innit?\")) it is Terry who serves as the show\u2019s moral conscience, keeping Arthur from straying too far outside the law and persuading him to do the right thing whether Arthur likes it or not. The name Arthur Daley has become synonymous with a dishonest salesman or small-time crook.<ref>See ''From Fulham with Love'', Series 6.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3066615.stm |title=Politics &#124; Tories blast 'Arthur Daley' Blair |publisher=BBC News |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=21 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith Arthur's dodgy schemes, the duo encounter undesirable underworld figures, many of whom Arthur deals with and many of whom turn nasty, leaving Terry to fight and outwit their way out of trouble. But for all Arthur's obsession with [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s, he is never malicious, usually simply being blinded by greed, and the pair often end up putting some other wrong right or helping others in need or who have been done wrong by, even if it proves to be Arthurs's [[Achilles' heel]] to his latest scheme fully succeeding. Most of Arthur's schemes fail in the end, owing to his greediness, but he does occasionally have the odd minor victory and puts one over on the law or more serious criminals.\n\nArthur's favourite drink was a large [[vodka]] and [[Tonic water|tonic]], which was referred to as a \"large V.A.T\", a [[wordplay]] on [[Value Added Tax]] (the UK tax on sales).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minderphenomenon.com/inside2.php |title=Minder: A phenomenon in the making |website=Minderphenomenon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Dave Harris===\nDave is a childhood friend, part owner (with Arthur) and barman of the local members-only, the Winchester Club. Arthur and Terry regularly drink there and Dave acts, often unwillingly, as a message service for Arthur, and turns a blind eye to the shady deals being arranged by the patrons. As a counsel and resource of last resort, he on occasion helps Arthur and Terry get out of tight spots through offering advice, money, space at the Winchester to store items or people and reluctantly, personal information through a brother-in-law working in the police.\n\nWith a trading licence to maintain, he is a wise character keeping the delicate balance of a legitimate private members' drinking establishment and a safe space for the local villains to congregate. Frequently given first refusal on Arthur's dodgy merchandise, he has been offered cars, watches, clothing and various consumer goods.\n\nVarious episodes give snippets of his home life, where we learn he has a wife (Lucy, whose only appearance is in Series 7, episode 2, \"Days of Fines and Closures\"), a daughter (Naomi, mentioned in Series 2, episode 10 \"The Old School Tie\" ) and a dead cat.\n\n===Police adversaries===\nGiven the nature of Arthur's activities and Terry's criminal past, they were always in the spotlight of the local police and crossed paths with several regular and occasional characters:\n\n'''DS Albert Chisholm'''; Detective Sergeant Albert \"Cheerful Charlie\" Chisholm (played by [[Patrick Malahide]]) made a brief appearance in the first episode and appeared in another 23 episodes in the first six series. Chisholm frequently arrested Arthur, but was not clever enough to make charges stick. Beginning in Series 3, he was accompanied by:\n\n'''DC/DS 'Taff' Jones'''; (played by [[Meic Povey]]), a Welshman. Although, not seeming particularly bright on first sight, Jones often proved sharper (though only mildly) than his superior, and was quietly amused by Arthur's frequent humiliation of Chisholm, even occasionally going into the Winchester for a social drink, away from Chisholm's domination. He tolerated the put-downs of his senior officer with 'Celtic willpower and a morbid fear of unemployment'. Jones was promoted to Detective Sergeant in Series 7, with DC MacDonald (Robin Cameron) as his assistant.\n\n'''DC/DS Ronald Rycott'''; Detective Constable Ronald \"Kenny\" Rycott (played by [[Peter Childs]]) made his first appearance in Episode 3, \"The Smaller They Are\". Rycott previously had a 'spot of bother', which prevented him from rising through the ranks, although, he later became a detective sergeant. A lone figure, not afraid of violent situations and more than willing to do a bit of \"freelance\" work, he was frequently on the edge of a nervous attack as Arthur slipped through his fingers. Rycott appeared in another 14 episodes up to the end of Series 7. His regular assistant was:\n\n'''DC Melish'''; ([[Michael Troughton]]). DC Melish was, like DC Jones, mainly amused at Arthur's activities.\n\nMany episodes in the first seven series featured either Chisholm and Jones or Rycott and Mellish, and the two pairs sometimes appeared together, emphasising the professional rivalry between them, much to the annoyance of their superior officer, Detective (Chief) Inspector Norton ([[Tony Caunter]]). This rivalry reached fever pitch in the episode \"Around the Corner\" (which closed Series 5) when all four officers, in two cars, crashed head-on whilst attempting to arrest Arthur and Terry. D.I. Norton's subsequent comments were scathing. Although Norton's appearances were always brief, they demonstrated the personal nature of Chisholm's and Rycott's campaigns. In the Series 6 episode \"From Fulham with Love\", Norton appears for less than a minute, but spends that entire appearance denouncing Chisholm for his \"personal vendetta against Arthur Daley\".\n\nIn the feature-length, \"[[An Officer and a Car Salesman]]\" that preceded series 7, Chisholm was written out (he was seen to have taken a job as a security officer), and Jones was promoted to DS. Although, he took over the probing of Arthur's plots, he was less hell-bent on nabbing him, finding most of Arthur's schemes humorous.\n\nNew police officers appeared from Series 8:\n\n'''DS Michael Morley'''; ([[Nicholas Day (actor)|Nicholas Day]]) DS Michael Morley was also a highly driven officer, but tempered with a sense of humour that Chisholm lacked. He also failed to make charges against Arthur stand up in court. His assistants were:\n\n'''DC Park'''; ([[Stephen Tompkinson]]). DC Johnny Park was openly amused at Arthur and Ray's activities, but knew his duty, as did\n\n'''DC Field'''; DC Field (Jonty Stephens) was a conscientious officer but occasionally did Arthur a good turn when he deserved it (which was rare).\n\n'''DS Rogerson'''; (James Warrior). DS Richard Rogerson was a loyal and tenacious 'old school' officer. On occasion, he even assisted Ray to prove that Arthur was innocent of police charges.\n\n===Other characters===\nArthur's world was mainly populated by petty crooks, fellow minders, dropouts, 'tea leaves', 'fences' and those happy to quickly turn over dodgy goods, usually (but not always) without violence. They included such memorable characters as fellow car dealer Wally West, Jewish travel agent-cum undertaker Monty Wiseman, 'Dirty 'arry', 'Mournful Morris', 'Incapable' (a drunk surgeon) 'Self Inflicted Sid', 'Freddy, the Fly', 'Scotch Harry', 'Pongo Harris', 'Dipso Pete' and 'Oily Wragg' (played by [[Pete Postlethwaite]]). As the series progressed, the guest stars became more prestigious, including [[Derek Jacobi]] as criminal Freddy Fenton, [[Brian Glover]] as Arthur's old army buddy Yorkie, [[Suzi Quatro]] as Terry's singer girlfriend Nancy, and [[Michael Kitchen]] as 'Maltese Tony'. The last series starring Cole and Waterman featured [[Billy Connolly]] playing Tick-tack, a bookie and grifter, [[Brian Blessed]] as DI Dyer, [[Ian McShane]] as gangster Jack Last and [[Roy Kinnear]] as Fat Charlie.\n\nIndeed, the show gave roles to young actors who have since achieved considerable fame including [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Steve McFadden]], [[Peter Capaldi]] and [[Bill Nighy]].\n\nIn practically every other episode, Arthur would refer to his wife as \"'er indoors\" (Ray would call her \"Auntie\" in the later series). This character was never named or appeared throughout the entire series.\n\nRecurring characters included professional gambler Maurice Michaelson ([[Anthony Valentine]]) (series 1-2), Des ([[George Layton]]) (series 1-3), a back-street mechanic friend of Terry's who was friendly and likable, but not beyond car theft when called for; kind-hearted stripper Debbie Mitchell (Diana Malin) and air stewardess Penny ([[Gennie Nevinson]]), both recurring girlfriends of Terry's; [[Ray Winstone]] as mechanic Arnie (series 4-7, conceived as a replacement for George Layton's Des and as dim as Des was sharp); and [[wide boy]] Justin James ([[Mark Farmer (actor)|Mark Farmer]]) (series 5-7), who idolised Arthur and aspired to be like him, seeing him as a kind of godfather. [[Royce Mills]] also starred as Arthur's financial adviser, Andrew, whose character appeared in a number of episodes across several series.\n\n[[Rula Lenska]] played a number of roles in the show and was married to Dennis Waterman.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Minder'' was devised by writer [[Leon Griffiths]] as a vehicle for Dennis Waterman after his success in ''[[The Sweeney]]''. George Cole's wheeler-dealer character is almost secondary, with Arthur assigning Terry a new \"minding\" job in each episode. A number of early episodes focus on Terry in such assignments, with Arthur remaining in the background. However, as the comedy potential of Cole's dodgy-dealing character emerged, as well as the successful on-screen pairing of Waterman and Cole (which proved to be one of the series' most popular elements), the emphasis increasingly focused more on Arthur's exploits, and by a few series into the show's life, typical plots revolved more around Arthur's latest shady scams instead of some of the more \"gritty\" plots of Terry's minding jobs.\n\nDespite its eventual success, ''Minder'' was a slow burner, not helped by being delayed by a nine-week technicians' strike which effectively blacked out the ITV network. In the light of initially poor viewing figures, management at Thames were intent on scrapping the show but managing director [[Bryan Cowgill]] persuaded them to commission one further series and repeat the first. Both attracted much larger audiences and by series 3, the show had become a major hit, and at its peak was often cited as the jewel in ITV's Drama crown.\n\n===Storylines===\nThe tone of the programme in series one and two, and much of series three, mixed poignant drama and [[action film|action sequences]] with offbeat comic moments, and many of these tales had a grittier feel to them than the more light-hearted storylines that would go on to be more familiar. As the series progressed over 15 years, more emphasis was placed on the comedic aspects of the minder-principal relationship, and the show became more a comedy driven by a dramatic plot. [[Satire|Social satire]] played a strong part throughout the series, grounded in the cinematic and social ethos of the 1980s. In the earlier series, Terry would succeed in seducing a 'dolly bird', resulting in at least one scene of female semi-nudity per average episode, though as the series became more popular these instances were reduced (and some repeat viewings, even those post-[[watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]], toned such scenes down). Although always an element of the series, the fights - common and brutal in early episodes - were also toned down and became less frequent.\n\nAnother significant element of the series were the subplots typically found in a Minder episode. Although subplots weren't necessarily found in all of the episodes, they were found in most and usually consisted of one of Arthur's dodgy deals, Terry's minding jobs and/or favours done for friends and in a few instances involved the police tackling particular cases.\n\nThe series has a number of parallels with long-running [[BBC]] comedy ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', with both being set in London and involving lovable dodgy dealers with endless get-rich-quick schemes that invariably backfire and get them into trouble (and both of whom tried to make out to be of a higher status than they really were), and both having a blend of comedy and drama. Indeed, ''Only Fools and Horses'' creator / writer [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]] claimed that one of the ways he persuaded the BBC to commission the series was by pointing to the success of ITV's ''Minder'', which had begun the previous year. After both having lukewarm starts, both series went on to become huge hits, and share much of the same fan base. At Christmas 1985, specials of ''Only Fools and Horses'' and ''Minder'' were scheduled against each other, angering many viewers in the days before [[Videocassette recorder|video recorders]] were commonplace in UK homes.\n\nWhen the series was first broadcast, some viewers complained about the use of swearing and foul language in the episodes.  Even though this gave the storylines a sense of gritty reality, it was noticed that as the series progressed from season to season, the amount of swearing steadily decreased up to the point that when the special episode TV feature film \"Minder on the [[Orient Express]]\" was broadcast, there was practically none at all.\n\n===Recurring features===\nAs well as heavy use of leading British actors, other features were Arthur's constant [[rhyming slang]] and other [[Malapropism|misquoted sayings]] (one being \"the world is your [[lobster]]\" and \"I had a dream\"), the derelict sites used as locations, and the episode titles, which contained references to films (e.g. \"Gunfight at the O.K. Launderette\", \"Monday Night Fever\", \"National Pelmet\", \"The Beer Hunter\", \"Days of Fines and Closures\", \"The Wrong Goodbye\" and \"Guess Who's Coming to [[Pinner]]?\").\n\n===Opening and closing credits===\nThe show's opening credit sequence shows the Arthur Daley and Terry McCann characters negotiating over the sale of the white Ford Capri interspersed with still photos of the two main characters, highlighting Terry's credentials as a retired boxer and ex-convict, this presumably symbolising the characters' first meeting and the terms of their partnership. During the Dennis Waterman era, the closing credits consisted of a number of black and white (with blue tint) still photographs of Arthur and Terry together outside famous London landmarks, and a few hinting of (unseen) previous escapades typical of a standard episode plot. In the later Gary Webster series, this changed to Arthur and Ray walking along [[Southend Pier]], which is over a mile long: at the end Arthur realises he has left his lighter at the other end of the pier and they start to walk back to find it.\n\n===Theme tune===\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = I Could Be So Good for You\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Dennis Waterman]]\n| album      =\n| B-side     = Nothing at All\n| released   = {{release date|1980|10|13|df=yes}}\n| format     = [[gramaphone record|7\" vinyl]]\n| recorded   = 1979\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = Pop\n| length     = 3:17\n| label      = [[EMI]]\n| writer     = [[Gerard Kenny]] <br /> [[Patricia Maynard|Patricia Waterman]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe theme tune, \"I Could Be So Good for You\", was released on 13 October 1980 and originally written in 1979 by [[Gerard Kenny]] and [[Patricia Maynard|Patricia Waterman]] and sung by [[Dennis Waterman]], the official credits of Kenny/Waterman often lead people to mis-credit Dennis as co-writer. The record reached No.3 in the UK charts in November 1980 and led Waterman to tour as a singer. Dennis Waterman also sang the theme songs to other programmes he starred in, including ''[[On the Up]]'', ''[[Stay Lucky]]'', and ''[[New Tricks]]'', and this led to a parody in ''[[Little Britain]]'' where Dennis Waterman is offered acting work; he always assumes he will also \"write the theme tune, sing the theme tune...\". Dennis Waterman surprised the audience of a ''[[Comic Relief]]'' stage show where he came on stage in the middle of a Little Britain sketch, bemoaning the impact it has had on his work as a 'classically trained actor'. He does however forgive the sketch so long as he gets to sing his 'theme tune', which he does to rapturous applause.\n\nGlasgow band [[Attic Lights]] re-worked the theme for the 2009 series.<ref>[http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/tv-showbiz-news/music-news/2008/11/02/attic-lights-win-deal-to-record-new-theme-tune-for-minder-comeback-78057-20862115/ Attic Lights win deal to record new theme tune for Minder comeback] Sunday Mail, 2 November 2008</ref>\n\nWriter Gerard Kenny has also released his own version of the song, appearing on his 1994 album ''Time Between the Time''. A live version of the song sung in duet between Gerard Kenny and Dennis Waterman was released on 1997's ''The Best of Gerard Kenny - The Singles'' album. Also, in 2004, Kenny released yet another album ''Coming Home'' which featured a \"chilled\" (and slower) recording of the song as its opening track.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Minder episodes}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The highest rated episode was 1984's \"Second Hand Pose\", with 16.4 million viewers. In 2005, Arthur Daley came second in ITV's 50th anniversary poll to find its favourite TV characters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4275032.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; TV and Radio &#124; Emmerdale tops ITV 50th ratings |publisher=BBC News |date=23 September 2005 |accessdate=21 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe show was a number of times said to have come to its end, only to reappear. For example, in 1984, ''[[TV Times]]'' reported that series 5 would be the last. In 1985, it again seemed as if that the current series was the last one, and it was off-air (bar repeats) for three years, to reappear in 1988. This series appeared to be the last as Dennis Waterman announced his departure at the end of its run. However, after a two-and-a-half-year break, the show was back again for a further two-and-a-half-year run, which ended with the 10th series in 1994.\n\n==In other media==\n===Music===\nThe series inspired a hit single, \"Arthur Daley (E's Alright!)\" by [[The Firm (novelty band)|The Firm]], which made the UK Top 20 in 1982. George Cole and Dennis Waterman released a Christmas record in 1983 called \"What are We Gonna Get 'Er Indoors?\" which reached No. 21 in the charts. The duo performed it on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 22 December 1983.\n\n===Annuals===\nIn 1980, an [[annual publication|annual]] based on the series was released by Grandreams. It was based upon the early concept of the series being based around Terry, and made no reference to Arthur. Two further annuals were released by World International Publishing for 1985 and 1986.

There was no universal track listing or cover art for the album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles had been released there and which were successful. In 1991, the US version of the album ''[[Classic Queen]]'' was released following the band's rekindled popularity in the nation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Greatest Hits'' was a commercial success worldwide with sales of over 25 million copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. It reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], spending four weeks at the top and sold consistently well throughout the 1980s, becoming the fourth-biggest selling album of the decade. The single \"Under Pressure\", which was released the same week as ''Greatest Hits'', also topped the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nAs of October 2019, ''Greatest Hits'' has spent 868 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified [[BPI certification|20\u00d7 platinum]] with sales of over 6 million copies, making it the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album of all time in the UK]]. Among the [[Billboard 200#Most weeks on the chart|longest charting albums in the US]], as of April 2020, it has spent 380 weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|8\u00d7 platinum]] in the US, 15\u00d7 platinum in Australia, 10\u00d7 platinum in New Zealand, and 3\u00d7 platinum in Canada. Following the release of the Queen biopic ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' in 2018, it re-entered the charts of countries worldwide.\n\n== Release ==\nThere was no universal track listing or cover art for the ''Greatest Hits'' album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles were released there and what tracks charted. In some cases, despite the band's popularity, not enough songs were issued as singles to fill a compilation album, and a few album tracks were used as filler. Some examples of these were \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\" and \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\", neither was released as a single in any country, but appear on some regions' ''1981 Hits'' release. In the UK and the US, where solid numbers could be collected, the album included only top 20 hits.\n\nThe US ended up with its original edit of Queen's first single release, \"[[Keep Yourself Alive]]\", which had been re-released in the US in 1975 (original release was 1973) after the success of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". The US version also added \"[[Under Pressure]]\", Queen's collaboration with [[David Bowie]], which was released the same week as ''Greatest Hits'' and subsequently topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reached the top ten in many charts around the world. However, the song was not included on the European versions of ''Greatest Hits'' \u2013 according to Queen's business manager Jim Beach, this was because the longer manufacturing time required to press records in Europe meant that several hundred thousand copies of the album had already been pressed up before the song had been recorded.<ref name=\"Billboard19811017\">{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Grein |title=Row over Rent-Only Plan for Queen Vid |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |pages=3 & 84 |date=17 October 1981}}</ref>\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the LP edition included the same list of UK Greatest Hits minus \"[[Seven Seas of Rhye]]\", and including \"Love of My Life\" ([[Live Killers]] version). CD version is the same as the British.\n\nThe cover photo that appeared on the UK and US release was taken by [[Lord Snowdon]] at his home studio using only natural light. For the 1981 release the photo was skewed but later presented as it was originally taken for the 2011 re-release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbjan17a.html#05|title=January 2017|website=www.brianmay.com|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/greatest-hits/|title=Greatest Hits|website=Queen official website|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Queen sought to issue a [[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|second ''Greatest Hits'']] collection worldwide, this time with a standard track listing. However, the band had just changed record labels in the US, from Capitol to [[Hollywood Records]], who were keen on a massive promotion of the band's back catalogue. The problem was that Elektra still held the US rights to that first 1981 collection (despite being Hollywood's US licensee). Hollywood Records decided to not release ''Greatest Hits II'' to the US market, but instead created their own collection, ''[[Classic Queen]]'' (1992), peaking at number four.<ref name=\":0\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=hxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=queen+waynes+world#v=onepage Billboard 25 Jul 1992] p.8.

Commonly referred to as the ''Red Greatest Hits'', it features most of the '70s tracks absent from ''Classic Queen'' (including \"Another One Bites the Dust\" [1980], \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Killer Queen\").

There was no universal track listing or cover art for the album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles had been released there and which were successful. In 1991, the US version of the album ''[[Classic Queen]]'' was released following the band's rekindled in popularity in the nation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Greatest Hits'' was a commercial success worldwide with sales of over 25 million copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. It reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], spending four weeks at the top and sold consistently well throughout the 1980s, becoming the fourth-biggest selling album of the decade. The single \"Under Pressure\", which was released the same week as ''Greatest Hits'', also topped the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nAs of October 2019, ''Greatest Hits'' has spent 868 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified [[BPI certification|20\u00d7 platinum]] with sales of over 6 million copies, making it the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album of all time in the UK]]. Among the [[Billboard 200#Most weeks on the chart|longest charting albums in the US]], as of April 2020, it has spent 380 weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|8\u00d7 platinum]] in the US, 15\u00d7 platinum in Australia, 10\u00d7 platinum in New Zealand, and 3\u00d7 platinum in Canada. Following the release of the Queen biopic ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' in 2018, it re-entered the charts of countries worldwide.\n\n== Release ==\nThere was no universal track listing or cover art for the ''Greatest Hits'' album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles were released there and what tracks charted. In some cases, despite the band's popularity, not enough songs were issued as singles to fill a compilation album, and a few album tracks were used as filler. Some examples of these were \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\" and \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\", neither was released as a single in any country, but appear on some regions' ''1981 Hits'' release. In the UK and the US, where solid numbers could be collected, the album included only top 20 hits.\n\nThe US ended up with its original edit of Queen's first single release, \"[[Keep Yourself Alive]]\", which had been re-released in the US in 1975 (original release was 1973) after the success of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". The US version also added \"[[Under Pressure]]\", Queen's collaboration with [[David Bowie]], which was released the same week as ''Greatest Hits'' and subsequently topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reached the top ten in many charts around the world. However, the song was not included on the European versions of ''Greatest Hits'' \u2013 according to Queen's business manager Jim Beach, this was because the longer manufacturing time required to press records in Europe meant that several hundred thousand copies of the album had already been pressed up before the song had been recorded.<ref name=\"Billboard19811017\">{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Grein |title=Row over Rent-Only Plan for Queen Vid |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |pages=3 & 84 |date=17 October 1981}}</ref>\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the LP edition included the same list of UK Greatest Hits minus \"[[Seven Seas of Rhye]]\", and including \"Love of My Life\" ([[Live Killers]] version). CD version is the same as the British.\n\nThe cover photo that appeared on the UK and US release was taken by [[Lord Snowdon]] at his home studio using only natural light. For the 1981 release the photo was skewed but later presented as it was originally taken for the 2011 re-release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbjan17a.html#05|title=January 2017|website=www.brianmay.com|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/greatest-hits/|title=Greatest Hits|website=Queen official website|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Queen sought to issue a [[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|second ''Greatest Hits'']] collection worldwide, this time with a standard track listing. However, the band had just changed record labels in the US, from Capitol to [[Hollywood Records]], who were keen on a massive promotion of the band's back catalogue. The problem was that Elektra still held the US rights to that first 1981 collection (despite being Hollywood's US licensee). Hollywood Records decided to not release ''Greatest Hits II'' to the US market, but instead created their own collection, ''[[Classic Queen]]'' (1992), peaking at number four.<ref name=\":0\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=hxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=queen+waynes+world#v=onepage Billboard 25 Jul 1992] p.8.

Commonly referred to as the ''Red Greatest Hits'', it features most of the '70s tracks absent from ''Classic Queen'' (including \"Another One Bites the Dust\" [1980], \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Killer Queen\"). In 2004, to promote the Las Vegas production of the musical ''We Will Rock You'', Hollywood Records released ''Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition'' which was the UK ''Greatest Hits'' with three bonus tracks.\n\n== ''Greatest Flix'' and ''Greatest Pix'' ==\nThe release of ''Greatest Hits'' was accompanied simultaneously by ''Greatest Flix'', a 60-minute compilation released on [[VHS]] video and [[LaserDisc]] of all the videos Queen had made up until that point in chronological order, and ''Greatest Pix'', a 96-page paperback book edited by [[Jacques Lowe]] which featured photos of the band taken by [[Neal Preston]].<ref name=\"Billboard19811017\" /> Although ''Greatest Flix'' only listed 17 videos on its sleeve, it contained two videos for \"We Will Rock You\".

It lies about {{convert|9|mi|km}} east of [[Birmingham]] city centre. The [[Smith's Wood]] area of [[Solihull]] borders it to the north and east, [[Fordbridge]] to the south and the [[Shard End]] area of Birmingham to the west.\n\n==History==\nThe name Kingshurst comes from having previously been a Royal Manor, and \"hurst\" meaning wood. The earliest record of Kingshurst is in documents from the late 13th and early 14th centuries, when it is referred to as part of the Manor of [[Coleshill, Warwickshire|Coleshill]]. Tenant farming was administered from here and [[Simon de Montford]] of Coleshill was an [[English people|English]] nobleman who built a moated manor house near Kingshurst. The Hall had its own park and farmlands.\n\n===The Mountfords 1332-1618===\nKingshurst took on an independent existence from Coleshill with the arrival of the Mountfords. It is unclear how Kingshurst came into their possession although it is probable that they bought the area around 1332 from the Clintons, who were then Lords of the Manor at Coleshill. What is certain is that they were in possession by about 1352.\n\n===The end of Kingshurst Hall===\nThe last proprietor of Kingshurst Hall, Walter Townsend, lacked the means to prevent the house from falling into a state of disrepair. All plans to salvage it came to nothing, due to a lack of funds. In 1960, Walter was moved to a house in [[Castle Bromwich]] and in 1962 the hall was demolished.\n\nThe remains of the [[moat]] of Kingshurst Hall are still visible today.\n\n===Yorkswood===\nDuring [[World War I]], much of the woodland in Kingshurst was cut down to help with the war effort. The Birmingham and District Association of [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts]] were able to buy a patch of land at a bargain price and set up a permanent camp there. This land was halfway between Kingshurst and [[Shard End]]. It was called Yorkswood and opened in 1923. There were five camp fields, covering an area of {{convert|25|acre|m2}}. The total site was over {{convert|200|acre|km2}}. The site benefited from permanent washhouses and latrines, a swimming-pool, a training centre and headquarters, guesthouse, warden\u2019s hut and other huts. A small brook from a fresh water spring ran past the camp and Cock Sparrow Farm was about {{convert|100|yd}} away to provide fresh milk.\n\nThe entrance to the camp was flanked by a series of griffin statues. These had come from the roof of Lewis's Department Store on [[Corporation Street, Birmingham|Corporation Street]] in Birmingham when it was being renovated. After the camp closed in 1972, they were placed on the housing estate (Kendrick Avenue and nearby roads) built upon the site of the camp.\n\n==Kingshurst today==\nKingshurst is now a mainly residential area.  Built as an overspill housing estate built in the early 1950s for the City of Birmingham, it became part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]] in 1974.\n\nThere are three [[primary schools]], Kingshurst, St. Anthonys and Yorkswood, a library and a small shopping area. The [[Anglican]] church is dedicated to St Barnabas and is situated off Church Close, the [[Catholic]] church is dedicated to St Anthony, the [[Methodist]] Church situated in Gilson Way and there is an evangelical church, [http://www.kecchurch.co.uk Kingshurst Evangelical Church (KEC Church)] situated on Cooks Lane corner with Forth Drive, which is much involved within Kingshurst Community.

First planned and laid out during the rule of [[Hyder Ali]] and later adorned with unique plant species by his son [[Tipu Sultan]], it was later managed under numerous British Superintendents before Indian Independence. It was responsible for the introduction and propagation of numerous ornamental plants as well as those of economic value. It also served a social function as a park and recreational space, with a central [[Greenhouse|glass house]] dating from 1890 which was used for flower shows.
