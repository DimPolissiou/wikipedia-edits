Young Hrdli\u010dka attended evening courses to improve his English, and at the age of 18, he decided to study medicine since he had suffered from tuberculosis and experienced the treatment difficulties of those times. In 1889, Hrdli\u010dka began studies at Eclectic Medical College and then continued at [[Homeopatic College in New York]]. To finish his medical studies, Hrdli\u010dka sat for exams in [[Baltimore]] in 1894. At first, he worked in the [[Middletown asylum]] for mentally affected where he learnt of [[anthropometry]].

He argued that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] migrated across the [[Bering Strait]] from Asia, supporting this theory with detailed field research of skeletal remains as well as studies of the people in [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], [[Siberia]], [[Alaska]], and [[Aleutian Islands]]. The findings backed up the argument which later contributed to the theory of global origin of human species that was awarded by the [[Thomas Henry Huxley Award]] in 1927.\n\nAle\u0161 Hrdli\u010dka founded and became the first [[curator]] of physical anthropology of the U.S. National Museum, now the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of Natural History]] in 1903.

In late November 1949, the Nationalist KMT government retreated from the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.needham.k12.ma.us/nhs/cur/wwii/06/p1/mjm/WWII-Chang.html |title=WWII Era History of Chongqing |publisher=.needham.k12.ma.us |date=23 October 1944 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606163106/http://www2.needham.k12.ma.us/nhs/cur/wwii/06/p1/mjm/WWII-Chang.html |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Municipality status===\n\n[[File:A Sunset View of Chongqing Central Business District.jpg|thumb|right|A sunset view of Chongqing Central Business District and Hongya Cave, taken in 2017]]\nOn 14 March 1997, the Eighth [[National People's Congress]] decided to merge the [[Sub-provincial city]] with the neighbouring [[Fuling]], [[Wanxian]], and [[Qianjiang, Chongqing|Qianjiang]] prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996.

The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]], the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired [[nomenklatura]] system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include [[He Guoqiang]], [[Wang Yang (politician)|Wang Yang]], [[Bo Xilai]], [[Zhang Dejiang]], and [[Sun Zhengcai]], the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal [[party standing committee]], the ''de facto'' top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\n\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Page |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |title=Chongqing Party Chief Position |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124203540/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |archive-date=24 November 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (''zhengxie'') meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues.

However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]]. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river.

The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]], the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired [[nomenklatura]] system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include [[He Guoqiang]], [[Wang Yang (politician)|Wang Yang]], [[Bo Xilai]], [[Zhang Dejiang]], and [[Sun Zhengcai]], the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal [[party standing committee]], the ''de facto'' top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\n\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Page |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |title=Chongqing Party Chief Position |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124203540/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |archive-date=24 November 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (''zhengxie'') meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The ''zhengxie'' is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n===Military===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946,<ref name=\"Chongqing: The modern period\">{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Chongqing/Administration-and-society#toc10770 | title=Chongqing History: The Modern Period | publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | accessdate=2016-07-31 | author=Kuo, Ping-chia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622174649/http://www.britannica.com/place/Chongqing/Administration-and-society#toc10770 | archive-date=22 June 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to [[Nanjing]] and then [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |title=Chongqing, once a wartime capitol |publisher=En.cq.gov.cn |date=14 March 1997 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630171340/http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |archive-date=30 June 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese [[Korean War]] hero [[Qiu Shaoyun]].<ref name=\"sxrtvu\">{{cite web|url=http://vod.sxrtvu.edu:8081/englishonline/culture/chinaculture/chinaculture/en_museum/2003-09/24/content_30254.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010137/http://vod.sxrtvu.edu:8081/englishonline/culture/chinaculture/chinaculture/en_museum/2003-09/24/content_30254.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-12-03|title=Qiu Shaoyun Memorial Hall |accessdate=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\nChongqing used to be the headquarters of the [[13th Group Army]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]], one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the [[Chengdu Military Region]], which in 2016 was re-organized into the [[Western Theater Command]].<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/13ga.htm |title=A history of the 13th Army Group |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=21 November 2003 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313004857/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/13ga.htm |archive-date=13 March 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Main list|List of administrative divisions of Chongqing}}\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China.

However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]]. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river.
