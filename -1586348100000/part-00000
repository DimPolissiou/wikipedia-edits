One example completed the first transcontinental non-stop roundtrip flight, made in 1929 by the CA-6 ''Spokane Sun-God'',<ref name=Meister>{{cite web|last=Meister Jr.|first=Richard L.|url=http://www.aerofiles.com/sungod.html|title=The Flight of the Buhl Airsedan Spokane Sun-God|date=February 2000|accessdate=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and the first [[Pope]] to have flown did so in a Buhl Airsedan.<ref name=goldenwingsmuseum/>\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Airsedan series were designed by [[Etienne Dormoy]] following the departure of [[Alfred V. Verville]] from Buhl, with whom he had worked previously. Dormoy had worked with [[Deperdussin]] before [[World War one]], flew combat operations during the war before returning to work with [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'aviation et ses d\u00e9riv\u00e9s|SPAD]], travelled to the US to coordinate production of SPADs with [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] until the project was cancelled with the end of the war. He then worked with [[Packard]] on automobiles for a year in 1919 before working as a civilian with the [[United States Army Air Corps]] with Verville, who convinced him to work at Buhl.<ref name=Bleneau1>Bleneau, Les berlines Buhl  (Premi\u00e8re partie), p.2-3</ref> As a Frenchman, he was familiar with the advantages of the sesquiplane concept as it was a popular configuration in France, such as with the [[Breguet 26T]] airliner, but rare in the US.<ref name=Bleneau1/>\n\nThe fuselage framework, lower wing and [[empennage]] were welded [[41xx steel|chromium-molybdenum alloy steel]] tubes faired with wooden battens, with the lower wing integral with the fuselage structure.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> The upper wings were built around spruce spars, with built up ribs made from spruce and plywood. The entire airframe was covered with [[doped]] aircraft-grade fabric.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/>\nTo reduce control forces, projecting aerodynamic balance horns on rudder and elevators, while inset aerodynamic horns were used on the ailerons, which were fitted to the upper wing only.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> To provide trim control, the rudder was ground adjustable while the elevators could be adjustable in flight.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> Depending on the models, three different designs of lower wings were used - either constant chord with reversed N struts on the CA-5, a triangular wing with a vee strut on the CA-3, CA-6 and CA-8, or a constant chord wing with two rigged struts, on Canadian built CA-6Ms.\nAll were conventional [[sesquiplane]]s with fully enclosed [[cockpit]]s, fitted with dual controls in front of a passenger cabin. The number in the designation generally referred to the number of occupants as originally designed, with a larger number of seats corresponding to a larger airframe. \nThe first variant built was the CA-5, while later variants had a much slimmer [[fuselage]], a greatly improved windscreen design and a modified cockpit. The CA-5 had the undercarriage legs connected to the fuselage, and part way out from the fuselage, on the lower wing. The CA-3 had the undercarriage mounted solely to the fuselage, while the CA-6 and CA-8 had additional bracing struts from the top of the fuselage to the lower wing which allowed the undercarriage track to be widened. Buhl asserted that its undercarriage design reduced camber changes during landing, and the tendency to yaw due to bumpy ground. The CA-6 was certified to use [[Edo Aircraft Corporation|Edo J-5300 floats]].<ref name=CAHS>Anderson, 1990, p.20</ref>\n\n===Canadian production===\n[[File:Buhl Airsedan CA-6M CF-OAR, Ontario Provincial Air Service, front port side.jpg|thumb|Canadian-built Buhl CA-6M Airsedan with enlarged lower wings.]]\nAfter Buhl had ceased operations in 1932 due to declining sales as the [[Great Depression]] deepened, the drawings and jigs were purchased by the [[Ontario Provincial Air Service|Ontario Provincial Air Service (OPAS)]] in [[Canada]] who then built four CA-6M's for use as fire spotting aircraft at their facility in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] between 1935 and 1937. These differed from the original aircraft in having [[Canadian Vickers]] floats, a new fin and rudder and larger lower wings.<ref name=OPAS>{{cite web|author=Various|title=Government Of Ontario Buhl Air Sedan|url=https://www.bushplane.com/opas-aircraft/histories-opas-buhl/|work=www.bushplane.com|date=2011\u20132018|accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> Due to the excessive weight of the Canadian-Vickers built floats, the first [[Ontario Provincial Air Service]]-built CA-6M refused to leave the water until given a more powerful {{cvt|440|hp}} [[Pratt & Whitney Wasp]] engine.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Buhl CA-3C The Angelino Junior NC7448 Oakland-Cleveland race August 1929.jpg|thumb|''The Angelino Junior'' after winning the 1929 Oakland-Cleveland race]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-5 Air Sedan NR3763 The Angeleno in flight.jpg|thumb|''The Angeleno'' (L) being refueled in flight from a [[Curtiss Carrier Pigeon]]]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-6 Air Sedan. Spokane Sun God (cropped).jpg|thumb|CA-6 Air Sedan ''Spokane Sun God'' after non-stop round trip crossing of the United States]]\nA CA-5 Airsedan NC2915, dubbed ''Miss Doran'', and flown by [[Auggie Pedlar]] with [[V. P. Knope]] navigating, was one of the entrants in the disastrous August 1927 [[Dole Air Race]] and like many competitors, was lost at sea.<ref name=Aerofiles/><ref name=Juptner1962p44/> Two other aviators lost their lives in a Swallow monoplane while searching for them. <ref name=Juptner1962p44/>\n\nA CA-3C Sport Airsedan NC7448, named ''Angelino Jr'' was piloted by [[Loren Mendell]] to first place in the [[National Air Race|Oakland-Cleveland Air Derby during the 1929 National Air Races]].<ref name=Aerofiles/>\n\n''The Angeleno'', CA-5A NR3763, set an endurance record of 246 hours, 43 minutes and 2 seconds on July 12th 1929 using [[inflight refuelling]].<ref name=Juptner1962p96/> They had just barely beaten the previous record when trash tossed from the aircraft jammed the tail and ended their run - and worse, their record would be bested within two weeks with a [[Curtiss Robin]].<ref name=Parks>Parks, 2015, p.25</ref>\n\nAnother Airsedan, a CA-6 Special NC9628 named ''Spokane Sun God'' made the first nonstop round-trip crossing the United States by air. [[Nick Mamer]] and [[Art Walker (aviator)|Art Walker]] flew from [[Spokane, Washington]] to [[New York City]] and back from between the 15th and 21st of August 1929, taking 120 hours, 1 minute and 40 seconds for the trip, using inflight refuelling.<ref name=Meister/> They covered {{cvt|7200|miles}} and made 11 fuel transfers.<ref name=Juptner1964p81/> That was not Nick Mamer's only connection to the Airsedans, as his airlines operated five examples in addition to the record breaking aircraft. \n\nAfter having served as a technology demonstrator for [[Packard]], the [[Packard DR-980]] Diesel powered CA-3E NC8451 was re-engined with a [[Wright J-6 Whirlwind]] and exported to [[Argentina]] for use by [[Aeroposta Argentina]] in 1931. In 1934 it made a flight over [[Buenos Aires]] with Cardinal Monsignor Pacelli, shortly before he was elected as [[Pope Pius XII]], becoming the first Pope to have made a flight in an aircraft.<ref name=goldenwingsmuseum>{{cite web|author=Various|title=1929 Buhl Sport Airsedan|work=www.goldenwingsmuseum.com|url=http://www.goldenwingsmuseum.com/collection/AC-Pages/Buhl.htm|date=1 December 2015|accessdate=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAfter a career spent seeking out forest fires in the northern [[Ontario]] bush, as an airborne counterpart to [[fire lookout tower]]s, the last of the Ontario Provincial Air Service CA-6Ms would be sold off to private operators in 1948.<ref name=OPAS/> Their service predated the use of aircraft for directly extinguishing fires, so after spotting a fire, the Buhls would transport firemen to the fire, equipped with portable firefighting equipment, supplanting or replacing earlier types of aircraft such as the [[Curtiss HS-2L]] and [[Canadian Vickers Vedette]]. If this sounds laborious, aircraft replaced the [[canoe]]s which had been used previously. \n\nAfter passing through a number of owners and undergoing unspecified modifications ostensibly for movie photography, CA-6 NC9629 was seized on 9 May 1933 while smuggling {{cvt|660|l|usgal|order=flip}} of alcohol from [[Mexico]] during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] near [[Fallbrook, California]] by the American [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] while the alcohol was being transferred to a waiting [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon coupe]].<ref name=Bleneau2>Bleneau, Les berlines Buhl (Seconde et derni\u00e8re partie), p.3</ref> Prohibition would end later that same year.\n\n[[Lineas Aereas del Balsas]] imported one CA-6, and [[Carlos Panini]] imported four CA-6s into Mexico for airline work, however during the 1929 [[Escobar Rebellion]] when the Mexican government faced a large scale mutiny led by General [[Jos\u00e9 Gonzalo Escobar]] against the office of President going to a civilian, one of these was operated by the [[Mexican Air Force|''Fuerza A\u00e9rea Mexicana'']] as a light utility transport with standard military red-white-green triangle markings.<ref name=Hagedorn>Hagedorn, 2006, p.37</ref> It is likely the sole example to have seen military service.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Packard company demonstrator Buhl CA-3E Airsedan powered with DR-980 diesel, in flight.jpg|thumb|[[Packard DR-980]] demonstrator CA-3E NC8451 in flight]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-5A N1451 (cropped).jpg|thumb|CA-5A N1451 was operated by Mamer Flying Service]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-8 Senior Airsedan NX7705.jpg|thumb|Buhl CA-8 Senior Airsedan with airliner seat parachute advertising]]\n* '''CA-3 Airsedan''' (1928) -

One example completed the first transcontinental non-stop roundtrip flight, made in 1929 by the CA-6 ''Spokane Sun-God'',<ref name=Meister>{{cite web|last=Meister Jr.|first=Richard L.|url=http://www.aerofiles.com/sungod.html|title=The Flight of the Buhl Airsedan Spokane Sun-God|date=February 2000|accessdate=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and the first [[Pope]] to have flown did so in a Buhl Airsedan.<ref name=goldenwingsmuseum/>\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Airsedan series were designed by [[Etienne Dormoy]] following the departure of [[Alfred V. Verville]] from Buhl, with whom he had worked previously. Dormoy had worked with [[Deperdussin]] before [[World War one]], flew combat operations during the war before returning to work with [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'aviation et ses d\u00e9riv\u00e9s|SPAD]], travelled to the US to coordinate production of SPADs with [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] until the project was cancelled with the end of the war. He then worked with [[Packard]] on automobiles for a year in 1919 before working as a civilian with the [[United States Army Air Corps]] with Verville, who convinced him to work at Buhl.<ref name=Bleneau1>Bleneau, Les berlines Buhl  (Premi\u00e8re partie), p.2-3</ref> As a Frenchman, he was familiar with the advantages of the sesquiplane concept as it was a popular configuration in France, such as with the [[Breguet 26T]] airliner, but rare in the US.<ref name=Bleneau1/>\n\nThe fuselage framework, lower wing and [[empennage]] were welded [[41xx steel|chromium-molybdenum alloy steel]] tubes faired with wooden battens, with the lower wing integral with the fuselage structure.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> The upper wings were built around spruce spars, with built up ribs made from spruce and plywood. The entire airframe was covered with [[doped]] aircraft-grade fabric.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/>\nTo reduce control forces, projecting aerodynamic balance horns on rudder and elevators, while inset aerodynamic horns were used on the ailerons, which were fitted to the upper wing only.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> To provide trim control, the rudder was ground adjustable while the elevators could be adjustable in flight.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> Depending on the models, three different designs of lower wings were used - either constant chord with reversed N struts on the CA-5, a triangular wing with a vee strut on the CA-3, CA-6 and CA-8, or a constant chord wing with two rigged struts, on Canadian built CA-6Ms.\nAll were conventional [[sesquiplane]]s with fully enclosed [[cockpit]]s, fitted with dual controls in front of a passenger cabin. The number in the designation generally referred to the number of occupants as originally designed, with a larger number of seats corresponding to a larger airframe. \nThe first variant built was the CA-5, while later variants had a much slimmer [[fuselage]], a greatly improved windscreen design and a modified cockpit. The CA-5 had the undercarriage legs connected to the fuselage, and part way out from the fuselage, on the lower wing. The CA-3 had the undercarriage mounted solely to the fuselage, while the CA-6 and CA-8 had additional bracing struts from the top of the fuselage to the lower wing which allowed the undercarriage track to be widened. Buhl asserted that its undercarriage design reduced camber changes during landing, and the tendency to yaw due to bumpy ground. The CA-6 was certified to use [[Edo Aircraft Corporation|Edo J-5300 floats]].<ref name=CAHS>Anderson, 1990, p.20</ref>\n\n===Canadian production===\n[[File:Buhl Airsedan CA-6M CF-OAR, Ontario Provincial Air Service, front port side.jpg|thumb|Canadian-built Buhl CA-6M Airsedan with enlarged lower wings.]]\nAfter Buhl had ceased operations in 1932 due to declining sales as the [[Great Depression]] deepened, the drawings and jigs were purchased by the [[Ontario Provincial Air Service|Ontario Provincial Air Service (OPAS)]] in [[Canada]] who then built four CA-6M's for use as fire spotting aircraft at their facility in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] between 1935 and 1937. These differed from the original aircraft in having [[Canadian Vickers]] floats, a new fin and rudder and larger lower wings.<ref name=OPAS>{{cite web|author=Various|title=Government Of Ontario Buhl Air Sedan|url=https://www.bushplane.com/opas-aircraft/histories-opas-buhl/|work=www.bushplane.com|date=2011\u20132018|accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> Due to the excessive weight of the Canadian-Vickers built floats, the first [[Ontario Provincial Air Service]]-built CA-6M refused to leave the water until given a more powerful {{cvt|440|hp}} [[Pratt & Whitney Wasp]] engine.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Buhl CA-3C The Angelino Junior NC7448 Oakland-Cleveland race August 1929.jpg|thumb|''The Angelino Junior'' after winning the 1929 Oakland-Cleveland race]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-5 Air Sedan NR3763 The Angeleno in flight.jpg|thumb|''The Angeleno'' (L) being refueled in flight from a [[Curtiss Carrier Pigeon]]]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-6 Air Sedan.

P. Knope]] navigating, was one of the entrants in the disastrous August 1927 [[Dole Air Race]] and like many competitors, was lost at sea.<ref name=Aerofiles/><ref name=Juptner1962p44/> Two other aviators lost their lives in a Swallow monoplane while searching for them. <ref name=Juptner1962p44/>\n\nA CA-3C Sport Airsedan NC7448, named ''Angelino Jr'' was piloted by [[Loren Mendell]] to first place in the [[National Air Race|Oakland-Cleveland Air Derby during the 1929 National Air Races]].<ref name=Aerofiles/>\n\n''The Angeleno'', CA-5A NR3763, set an endurance record of 246 hours, 43 minutes and 2 seconds on July 12th 1929 using [[inflight refuelling]].<ref name=Juptner1962p96/> They had just barely beaten the previous record when trash tossed from the aircraft jammed the tail and ended their run - and worse, their record would be bested within two weeks with a [[Curtiss Robin]].<ref name=Parks>Parks, 2015, p.25</ref>\n\nAnother Airsedan, a CA-6 Special NC9628 named ''Spokane Sun God'' made the first nonstop round-trip crossing the United States by air. [[Nick Mamer]] and [[Art Walker (aviator)|Art Walker]] flew from [[Spokane, Washington]] to [[New York City]] and back from between the 15th and 21st of August 1929, taking 120 hours, 1 minute and 40 seconds for the trip, using inflight refuelling.<ref name=Meister/> They covered {{cvt|7200|miles}} and made 11 fuel transfers.<ref name=Juptner1964p81/> That was not Nick Mamer's only connection to the Airsedans, as his airlines operated five examples in addition to the record breaking aircraft. \n\nAfter having served as a technology demonstrator for [[Packard]], the [[Packard DR-980]] Diesel powered CA-3E NC8451 was re-engined with a [[Wright J-6 Whirlwind]] and exported to [[Argentina]] for use by [[Aeroposta Argentina]] in 1931. In 1934 it made a flight over [[Buenos Aires]] with Cardinal Monsignor Pacelli, shortly before he was elected as [[Pope Pius XII]], becoming the first Pope to have made a flight in an aircraft.<ref name=goldenwingsmuseum>{{cite web|author=Various|title=1929 Buhl Sport Airsedan|work=www.goldenwingsmuseum.com|url=http://www.goldenwingsmuseum.com/collection/AC-Pages/Buhl.htm|date=1 December 2015|accessdate=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAfter a career spent seeking out forest fires in the northern [[Ontario]] bush, as an airborne counterpart to [[fire lookout tower]]s, the last of the Ontario Provincial Air Service CA-6Ms would be sold off to private operators in 1948.<ref name=OPAS/> Their service predated the use of aircraft for directly extinguishing fires, so after spotting a fire, the Buhls would transport firemen to the fire, equipped with portable firefighting equipment, supplanting or replacing earlier types of aircraft such as the [[Curtiss HS-2L]] and [[Canadian Vickers Vedette]]. If this sounds laborious, aircraft replaced the [[canoe]]s which had been used previously. \n\nAfter passing through a number of owners and undergoing unspecified modifications ostensibly for movie photography, CA-6 NC9629 was seized on 9 May 1933 while smuggling {{cvt|660|l|usgal|order=flip}} of alcohol from [[Mexico]] during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] near [[Fallbrook, California]] by the American [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] while the alcohol was being transferred to a waiting [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon coupe]].<ref name=Bleneau2>Bleneau, Les berlines Buhl (Seconde et derni\u00e8re partie), p.3</ref> Prohibition would end later that same year.\n\n[[Lineas Aereas del Balsas]] imported one CA-6, and [[Carlos Panini]] imported four CA-6s into Mexico for airline work, however during the 1929 [[Escobar Rebellion]] when the Mexican government faced a large scale mutiny led by General [[Jos\u00e9 Gonzalo Escobar]] against the office of President going to a civilian, one of these was operated by the [[Mexican Air Force|''Fuerza A\u00e9rea Mexicana'']] as a light utility transport with standard military red-white-green triangle markings.<ref name=Hagedorn>Hagedorn, 2006, p.37</ref> It is likely the sole example to have seen military service.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Packard company demonstrator Buhl CA-3E Airsedan powered with DR-980 diesel, in flight.jpg|thumb|[[Packard DR-980]] demonstrator CA-3E NC8451 in flight]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-5A N1451 (cropped).jpg|thumb|CA-5A N1451 was operated by Mamer Flying Service]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-8 Senior Airsedan NX7705.jpg|thumb|Buhl CA-8 Senior Airsedan with airliner seat parachute advertising]]\n* '''CA-3 Airsedan''' (1928) -

St. Peter's is affiliated with the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers of St. John Baptist de la Salle]], and is a member of the [[Catholic High School Athletic Association|CHSAA]]. The school is located at 200 Clinton Avenue and is part of [[St. Peter's Church (Staten Island, New York)|St. Peter's parish]] on Staten Island, which also ran a grammar school and all-girls high school.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe origins of St. Peter's Boys' High School can be traced back to 1839, with the dedication of St. Peter's parish. With the arrival of three Christian Brothers in 1917, the school was founded on Richmond Terrace in the New Brighton area of Staten Island. [[Joseph Farrell (priest)|Father Joseph Farrell]] and other local clergy took over operation of the school in 1920 when the Brothers were withdrawn due to [[World War I]]. The Brothers would return ten years later in 1930. At this time, there were more Brothers at the school than ever before. In 1937, the main campus of St. Peter's Boys' HS, was designated as a junior college of [[Manhattan College]], another Lasallian institution. By 1943, the junior college closed and St. Peter's Boys High School relocated to that campus. The main campus of St. Peter's Boys High School has remained there since, on the corner of Clinton and Henderson Avenues. \n\nThe institution maintains an  alumni community, including the ''St. Peter's High School Glee Club and Seton Chorale Alumni'' who organize an annual scholarship benefit Christmas concert for their late instructor, [[Carl Lesch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petersalumniremembercarl.com/-_show_details |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224212639/http://www.petersalumniremembercarl.com/-_show_details |archivedate=2011-12-24 }} St. Peter's Glee Club & Seton Chorale Alumni Christmas Concert</ref><ref>http://www.silive.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2010/12/a_real-life_glee_club_reunion.html A real-life 'Glee' club reunion on Staten Island</ref>\n\n===The modern era===\nIn 1965, the [[Archdiocese of New York]] agreed to assist in the funding of a new gymnasium, which would also serve as the school's auditorium. By 1969, however, the school's closing was imminent. The community rallied around St. Peter's and local support prevented the school from closing. As of 2001, the school's enrollment was 740 students. The Brothers' involvement in the school has been in decline due to a continual decrease in men entering the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. In 2001, eight Brothers taught at the school along with two [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] and 31 lay faculty members. In 2009, the varsity football team won the CHSAA single A championship 41\u20130 against the Bishop Ford Falcons.<ref>http://nychsfl.org/</ref> In 1989, senior Sal Kader and junior John Schwall won the NYC CHSAA wrestling individual championships at 177 and 119 pounds respectively.

Produced by [[Lorimar Television]], the series marked the return of [[Suzanne Somers]] to television for the first time since she left her role as [[Chrissy Snow]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Three's Company]]''.\n\nIn 2002, ''She's the Sheriff'' was ranked #44 on [[TV Guide]]'s \"50 Worst TV Shows of All Time\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2002 |title=50 Worst Shows of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= }}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nSomers stars as Hildy Granger, a young wife suddenly widowed with two children to support. Her employment worries end when the Commissioner of fictional Lakes County, Nevada (near [[Lake Tahoe]]), offers to appoint her sheriff, the job held by her husband until his untimely death. Hildy accepts the position and is immediately forced to handle the daily problems of locals and tourists, with extra trouble created by the four deputies on her staff. In addition, Hildy has regular battles with colleague Max Rubin, who doesn't feel Hildy should be in the job.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[George Wyner]] co-stars as Deputy Max Rubin, indignant that he has been passed over for the job of Sheriff.\n* [[Pat Carroll]] portrays Gussie Holt, Hildy's mother, and part-time writer.\n* [[Lou Richards (actor)|Lou Richards]] co-stars as Deputy Dennis Putnam, a naive man who takes things too literally.\n* Guich Koock co-stars as Deputy Hugh Mulcahy, a man admired for his intelligence.\n* Leonard Lightfoot co-stars as Deputy Alvin Wiggins who tries to be a voice of reason.\n* [[Taliesin Jaffe]] and Nicky Rose portray Hildy's son Kenny and daughter Allison, respectively.\n\n==Episode list==\n* '''N\u00ba''' = Overall episode number\n* '''Ep''' = Episode number by season\n\n===Season 1: 1987\u201388===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#D2B48C; width:20px\"| N\u00ba\n! style=\"background:#D2B48C; width:20px\"| Ep\n! style=\"background:#D2B48C\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#D2B48C; width:110px\"| Directed by:\n! style=\"background:#D2B48C; width:150px\"| Written by:\n! style=\"background:#D2B48C; width:135px\"| Air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 0\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 0\n| Title = She's the Sheriff\n| DirectedBy = Alan Rafkin\n| WrittenBy = Mark Rothman\n| OriginalAirDate = N/A\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = D2B48C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n| Title = All in a Day's Work\n| DirectedBy = Alan Rafkin\n| WrittenBy = Mark Rothman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|9|19}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = D2B48C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n| Title = Butterfly Is Free\n| DirectedBy = Mark Rothman\n| WrittenBy = Barry O'Brien,<br> Juliet Law Packer\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|9|26}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = D2B48C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n| Title = Unsafe at Any Speed\n| DirectedBy = Alan Rafkin\n| WrittenBy = Juliet Law Packer\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|10|3}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = D2B48C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n| Title = A Little Romance\n| DirectedBy = Lee Miller\n| WrittenBy = Gene Braunstein,<br> Bob Perlow\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1987|10|10}}\n| ShortSummary = \n| LineColor = D2B48C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n| Title = Lover Boy\n| DirectedBy = Alan Rafkin\n| WrittenBy = Lawrence H.

series had its origins in the 1982 [[CBS]] sitcom pilot ''Cass Malloy''. Creators Dan Guntzelman and Steve Marshall pitched exactly the same format to CBS as what later made it to the air in syndication as ''She's the Sheriff'': that of a late sheriff's wife taking over her husband's job, and the challenges she faced as a woman in a male-oriented environment. [[Annie Potts]] was originally cast as the titular Cass Malloy, but she was soon dropped during development in favor of [[Caroline McWilliams]], who was in search of a starring vehicle after leaving the hit [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]''. The pilot was shot and greenlit by CBS, and aired as a one-off on July 21, 1982. The pilot did not perform to CBS' expectations, and thus was not picked up as a series.\n\nGeorge Wyner and Lou Richards appeared in both ''Cass Malloy'' and ''She's the Sheriff'', but in the CBS pilot, their characters' surnames were different. Wyner played Deputy Max Rosenkrantz, who had hoped to fill the shoes of deceased Sheriff Big Jim Malloy, but who was now miffed about being passed over in favor of Malloy's wife. Richards played Deputy Dennis Little in the pilot. The cast also featured [[Glynn Turman]] as Officer Woodrow Freeman, whose character very well served as the basis for Leonard Lightfoot's Alvin Wiggins in ''She's the Sheriff''; [[Dick Butkus]] as Officer Alvin Dimsky; [[Murphy Dunne]] as Adam Barrett; and [[Dianne Kay]] (in her first project after ''[[Eight is Enough]]'') as Tina Marie Nelson.\n\nSheriff Cass Malloy had three kids in the original pilot: teenager Colleen ([[Amanda Wyss]]), preteen Nona (Heather Hobbs) and the youngest, \"Little Big\" Jim ([[Corey Feldman]]). While ''She's the Sheriff'' was set in Lakes County, Nevada, ''Cass Malloy'' was situated in Burr County, Indiana.\n\nGuntzelman and Marshall would find success as producers a few years later with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Growing Pains (TV series)|Growing Pains]]'', which prompted them to revisit the ''Cass Malloy'' teleplay in hopes of finally getting it on the air as a series. [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] took an interest in a revised version of the script, and greenlighted a series order in 1987 for the then-burgeoning first-run syndication market. (Early in production, a two-page ad was placed in the 1/5/1987 issue of [[Broadcasting & Cable]] magazine listing the show under the working title ''Suddenly Sheriff'' and with [[Priscilla Barnes]] as the star.

This experiment was short lived, however, and although ''She's the Sheriff'' was renewed for a second season, it was moved to a weekend timeslot.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''City'''\n|'''Station'''\n|-\n|[[Atlanta]]\n|[[WXIA-TV|WXIA 11]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?667301-Who-aired-what-where-Lesser-known-syndicated-shows/page2|title=Who aired what where: Lesser-known syndicated shows|last= |first= |date=July 26, 2014|website=Radio Discussions|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Chicago]]\n|[[WGN-TV|WGN 9]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=WGN 9 commercials/superbreak, 7/28/1989 part 1|id=CbYjC1ulcQI}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]\n|[[WNHT (TV)|WNHT 21]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?714522-Retro-Boston-MA-Sunday-April-24-1988|title=Retro: Boston MA: Sunday, April 24, 1988|last= |first= |date=January 3, 2019|website=Radio Discussions|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]\n|[[KDSM-TV|KDSM 17]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=FOX commercials (May 1989)|id=5fNqbNNta3o}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Detroit]]\n|[[WMYD|WXON 20]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?697735-Retro-Detroit-Sun-July-31st-1988|title=Retro: Detroit, Sun.

series had its origins in the 1982 [[CBS]] sitcom pilot ''Cass Malloy''. Creators Dan Guntzelman and Steve Marshall pitched exactly the same format to CBS as what later made it to the air in syndication as ''She's the Sheriff'': that of a late sheriff's wife taking over her husband's job, and the challenges she faced as a woman in a male-oriented environment. [[Annie Potts]] was originally cast as the titular Cass Malloy, but she was soon dropped during development in favor of [[Caroline McWilliams]], who was in search of a starring vehicle after leaving the hit [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]''. The pilot was shot and greenlit by CBS, and aired as a one-off on July 21, 1982. The pilot did not perform to CBS' expectations, and thus was not picked up as a series.\n\nGeorge Wyner and Lou Richards appeared in both ''Cass Malloy'' and ''She's the Sheriff'', but in the CBS pilot, their characters' surnames were different. Wyner played Deputy Max Rosenkrantz, who had hoped to fill the shoes of deceased Sheriff Big Jim Malloy, but who was now miffed about being passed over in favor of Malloy's wife. Richards played Deputy Dennis Little in the pilot. The cast also featured [[Glynn Turman]] as Officer Woodrow Freeman, whose character very well served as the basis for Leonard Lightfoot's Alvin Wiggins in ''She's the Sheriff''; [[Dick Butkus]] as Officer Alvin Dimsky; [[Murphy Dunne]] as Adam Barrett; and [[Dianne Kay]] (in her first project after ''[[Eight is Enough]]'') as Tina Marie Nelson.\n\nSheriff Cass Malloy had three kids in the original pilot: teenager Colleen ([[Amanda Wyss]]), preteen Nona (Heather Hobbs) and the youngest, \"Little Big\" Jim ([[Corey Feldman]]). While ''She's the Sheriff'' was set in Lakes County, Nevada, ''Cass Malloy'' was situated in Burr County, Indiana.\n\nGuntzelman and Marshall would find success as producers a few years later with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Growing Pains (TV series)|Growing Pains]]'', which prompted them to revisit the ''Cass Malloy'' teleplay in hopes of finally getting it on the air as a series. [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] took an interest in a revised version of the script, and greenlighted a series order in 1987 for the then-burgeoning first-run syndication market. (Early in production, a two-page ad was placed in the 1/5/1987 issue of [[Broadcasting & Cable]] magazine listing the show under the working title ''Suddenly Sheriff'' and with [[Priscilla Barnes]] as the star. [Barnes was the second replacement for Suzanne Somers on ''Three's Company''.] When the show's name and casting were finalized is not known.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/87-OCR/BC-1987-01-05-OCR-Page-0028.pdf#search=%22bc-1987-01-05-ocr-page-0028%22</ref><ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/87-OCR/BC-1987-01-05-OCR-Page-0029.pdf#search=%22bc-1987-01-05-ocr-page-0029%22</ref>)\n\n==Production==\nDavid Goldsmith and Arthur Silver were the executive producers, Marty Nadler was producer, Wenda Fong was co-producer, and Lisa Lewis was associate producer.\n\n==Syndication==\n''She's the Sheriff'' was part of NBC's much-hyped \"[[Prime Time Begins at 7:30]]\" campaign, in which the network's [[owned-and-operated stations]] would run first-run sitcoms in the 7:30-8 pm time slot to counterprogram competing stations' [[game shows]], sitcom [[reruns]] and other offerings. This experiment was short lived, however, and although ''She's the Sheriff'' was renewed for a second season, it was moved to a weekend timeslot.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''City'''\n|'''Station'''\n|-\n|[[Atlanta]]\n|[[WXIA-TV|WXIA 11]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?667301-Who-aired-what-where-Lesser-known-syndicated-shows/page2|title=Who aired what where: Lesser-known syndicated shows|last= |first= |date=July 26, 2014|website=Radio Discussions|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Chicago]]\n|[[WGN-TV|WGN 9]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=WGN 9 commercials/superbreak, 7/28/1989 part 1|id=CbYjC1ulcQI}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]\n|[[WNHT (TV)|WNHT 21]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?714522-Retro-Boston-MA-Sunday-April-24-1988|title=Retro: Boston MA: Sunday, April 24, 1988|last= |first= |date=January 3, 2019|website=Radio Discussions|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]\n|[[KDSM-TV|KDSM 17]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=FOX commercials (May 1989)|id=5fNqbNNta3o}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Detroit]]\n|[[WMYD|WXON 20]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?697735-Retro-Detroit-Sun-July-31st-1988|title=Retro: Detroit, Sun.

It is one of the many baptismal surnames to have been derived from the popular given names of Gerard and Gerald in 12th-century England. Both of these names were taken to Britain by the conquering [[Normans]] and are the Old French versions of ancient [[West Germanic languages|Germanic]] personal names. The name Gerard (or Germanic: [[Gerhard]]) is composed of the Germanic elements ''g\u0113r'' or ''g\u0101r'' (meaning \"spear\") and ''hard'' (\"brave\", \"hard\" or \"strong\"), while Gerald is composed of again ''g\u0113r'' or ''g\u0101r'' (\"spear\") and ''wald'' (\"to rule\") <ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/gerald</ref><ref>http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Gerrard</ref><ref>http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Garrett</ref><ref>''Family Names And Family History'', [[David Hey]], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, {{ISBN|1852855509}}, 9781852855505. page. 42</ref> Although Garrett remains predominantly only a given name in the UK and Ireland, elsewhere in the [[English-speaking world]] it is a common last name (e.g. in the United States).\n\nOther surnames derived from Gerard and Gerald include: Gerrard, Garratt, Garret, Garred, Garrad, Garrard, Garrod, Jarrett, Jared, Jarratt, Jarrard, and Jerrold.\n\n==People with the given name==\n*[[Gear\u00f3id M\u00f3r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]] (fl. 1477\u20131513), aka \"Garrett the Great\", Lord Deputy of Ireland\n*[[Garrett Adelstein]] (born 1986), American professional poker player\n*[[Garrett Arbelbide]] (1909\u20131983), American football and baseball player and football coach\n*[[Garrett Atkins]] (born 1979), American former Major League Baseball third baseman\n*[[Garrett Birkhoff]] (1911\u20131996), American mathematician\n*[[Garrett Bradbury]] (born 1995), American football player\n*[[Garrett Bradley]] (born 1970), current representative in the Massachusetts House of Representatives for the 3rd Plymouth district\n*[[Garrett Brock Trapnell]] (1938\u20131993), con man, bank robber, and aircraft hijacker\n*[[Garrett Broshuis]] (born 1981), former professional baseball player\n*[[Garrett Brown]] (born 1942), American cinematographer\n*[[Garrett Brown, Jr.]] (born 1943), former federal judge and attorney\n*[[Garrett Burnett]] (born 1975), former professional ice hockey player\n*[[Garrett Byrne (Irish politician)|Garrett Byrne]] (1829\u20131897), Irish nationalist\n*[[Garrett Byrnes]] (born 1971), American composer\n*[[Garrett Caldwell]] (born 1973), American-born Canadian former soccer player\n*[[Garrett Camp]] (born 1978), Canadian entrepreneur\n*[[Garrett Caples]] (born 1972), American poet\n*[[Garrett Celek]] (born 1988), American football tight end\n*[[Garrett Clayton]] (born 1991), American actor, singer, and dancer\n*[[Garrett Cochran]] (1876\u20131918), American football player and coach\n*[[Garrett Davis]] (1801\u20131872), U.S. Senator and Representative from Kentucky\n*[[Garrett Dickerson]] (born 1995), American football player\n*[[Garrett Dillon]] (1640\u20131696), Irish judge, politician and soldier\n*[[Garrett Droppers]] (1860\u20131927), American academic and diplomat\n*[[Garrett Eckbo]] (1910\u20132000), American landscape architect\n*[[Garrett Epps]] (born 1950), American legal scholar, novelist, and journalist\n*[[Garrett Festerling]] (born 1986), professional ice hockey forward\n*[[Garret FitzGerald]] (1926\u20132011), Taoiseach of Ireland from 1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1987\n*[[Garrett Ford, Jr.]] (born 1970), American football running back\n*[[Garrett Ford, Sr.]] (born 1945), assistant athletics director at West Virginia University\n*[[Garrett Fort]] (1900\u20131945), American short story writer, playwright, and Hollywood screenwriter\n*[[Garrett Gardner]], American singer and songwriter\n*[[Garrett Giemont]] (born 1959), strength and conditioning coach\n*[[Garrett Gilbert]] (born 1991), American football quarterback\n*[[Garrett Gilkey]] (born 1990), American football offensive guard\n*[[Garrett Glaser]] (born 1953), retired American news reporter\n*[[Garrett Graff]] (born 1981), American editor-in-chief and instructor\n*[[Garrett Graham]] (born 1986), American football tight end\n*[[Garrett Grayson]] (born 1991), American football quarterback\n*[[Garrett Gruener]], founder of Ask.com and a co-founder of Alta Partners\n*[[Garrett Hammond]], American drummer\n*[[Garrett Hardin]] (1915\u20132003), American ecologist\n*[[Garrett Hartley]] (born 1986), American football placekicker\n*[[Garrett Heath]] (born 1985), American middle-distance and distance runner\n*[[Garrett Hedlund]] (born 1984), American actor\n*[[Garrett Hines]] (born 1969), American bobsledder\n*[[Garrett Hongo]] (born 1941), Yonsei, fourth-generation Japanese American academic and poet\n*[[Garrett Howard]] (1899\u20131995), Irish hurler\n*[[Garrett J.

It is one of the many baptismal surnames to have been derived from the popular given names of Gerard and Gerald in 12th-century England. Both of these names were taken to Britain by the conquering [[Normans]] and are the Old French versions of ancient [[West Germanic languages|Germanic]] personal names. The name Gerard (or Germanic: [[Gerhard]]) is composed of the Germanic elements ''g\u0113r'' or ''g\u0101r'' (meaning \"spear\") and ''hard'' (\"brave\", \"hard\" or \"strong\"), while Gerald is composed of again ''g\u0113r'' or ''g\u0101r'' (\"spear\") and ''wald'' (\"to rule\") <ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/gerald</ref><ref>http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Gerrard</ref><ref>http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Garrett</ref><ref>''Family Names And Family History'', [[David Hey]], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, {{ISBN|1852855509}}, 9781852855505. page. 42</ref> Although Garrett remains predominantly only a given name in the UK and Ireland, elsewhere in the [[English-speaking world]] it is a common last name (e.g. in the United States).\n\nOther surnames derived from Gerard and Gerald include: Gerrard, Garratt, Garret, Garred, Garrad, Garrard, Garrod, Jarrett, Jared, Jarratt, Jarrard, and Jerrold.\n\n==People with the given name==\n*[[Gear\u00f3id M\u00f3r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]] (fl. 1477\u20131513), aka \"Garrett the Great\", Lord Deputy of Ireland\n*[[Garrett Adelstein]] (born 1986), American professional poker player\n*[[Garrett Arbelbide]] (1909-1983), American football and baseball player and football coach\n*[[Garrett Atkins]] (born 1979), American former Major League Baseball third baseman\n*[[Garrett Birkhoff]] (1911-1996), American mathematician\n*[[Garrett Bradbury]] (born 1995), American football player\n*[[Garrett Bradley]] (born 1970), current representative in the Massachusetts House of Representatives for the 3rd Plymouth district\n*[[Garrett Brock Trapnell]] (1938-1993), con man, bank robber, and aircraft hijacker\n*[[Garrett Broshuis]] (born 1981), former professional baseball player\n*[[Garrett Brown]] (born 1942), American cinematographer\n*[[Garrett Brown, Jr.]] (born 1943), former federal judge and attorney\n*[[Garrett Burnett]] (born 1975), former professional ice hockey player\n*[[Garrett Byrne (Irish politician)|Garrett Byrne]] (1829-1897), Irish nationalist\n*[[Garrett Byrnes]] (born 1971), American composer\n*[[Garrett Caldwell]] (born 1973), American-born Canadian former soccer player\n*[[Garrett Camp]] (born 1978), Canadian entrepreneur\n*[[Garrett Caples]] (born 1972), American poet\n*[[Garrett Celek]] (born 1988), American football tight end\n*[[Garrett Clayton]] (born 1991), American actor, singer, and dancer\n*[[Garrett Cochran]] (1876-1918), American football player and coach\n*[[Garrett Davis]] (1801-1872), U.S. Senator and Representative from Kentucky\n*[[Garrett Dickerson]] (born 1995), American football player\n*[[Garrett Dillon]] (1640-1696), Irish judge, politician and soldier\n*[[Garrett Droppers]] (1860-1927), American academic and diplomat\n*[[Garrett Eckbo]] (1910-2000), American landscape architect\n*[[Garrett Epps]] (born 1950), American legal scholar, novelist, and journalist\n*[[Garrett Festerling]] (born 1986), professional ice hockey forward\n*[[Garret FitzGerald]] (1926\u20132011), Taoiseach of Ireland from 1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1987\n*[[Garrett Ford, Jr.]] (born 1970), American football running back\n*[[Garrett Ford, Sr.]] (born 1945), assistant athletics director at West Virginia University\n*[[Garrett Fort]] (1900-1945), American short story writer, playwright, and Hollywood screenwriter\n*[[Garrett Gardner]], American singer and songwriter\n*[[Garrett Giemont]] (born 1959), strength and conditioning coach\n*[[Garrett Gilbert]] (born 1991), American football quarterback\n*[[Garrett Gilkey]] (born 1990), American football offensive guard\n*[[Garrett Glaser]] (born 1953), retired American news reporter\n*[[Garrett Graff]] (born 1981), American editor-in-chief and instructor\n*[[Garrett Graham]] (born 1986), American football tight end\n*[[Garrett Grayson]] (born 1991), American football quarterback\n*[[Garrett Gruener]], founder of Ask.com and a co-founder of Alta Partners\n*[[Garrett Hammond]], American drummer\n*[[Garrett Hardin]] (1915-2003), American ecologist\n*[[Garrett Hartley]] (born 1986), American football placekicker\n*[[Garrett Heath]] (born 1985), American middle-distance and distance runner\n*[[Garrett Hedlund]] (born 1984), American actor\n*[[Garrett Hines]] (born 1969), American bobsledder\n*[[Garrett Hongo]] (born 1941), Yonsei, fourth-generation Japanese American academic and poet\n*[[Garrett Howard]] (1899-1995), Irish hurler\n*[[Garrett J.

[[Narain (actor)|Narain]], [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]], [[Sriya Reddy]], [[Seeman (director)|Seeman]] and the director himself form the cast. Narain plays Vetrivel, a collector, while Sriya Reddy is a nurse, Sneha is a teacher named Kokila and Seeman plays Muthu. The film deals with four different periods \u2013 1978, 1983, 1991 and 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe movie revolves around an ailing school in a village in Cuddalore district where the land owner wants to demolish the school while the old students prevent the school from getting shut. Kokila (Sneha) works in the school where she had also studied. The school was constructed by Kokila's grandfather years ago and dispute arises between her family members, where her uncle wanted to demolish the school and sell the land as the school is in a very bad state.\n\nThe school teachers come up with a plan of organising an alumni get together, so that the school can be saved. Kumarasamy aka Kumar (Thagar Bachan) is a poor man who lives in the same village and is the classmate of Kokila. He is sent to Kanchipuram to meet the district collector Vetrivel (Naren) who also happens to be the alumni of the same school. Vetri and Kumar were close friends during childhood and both feel happy meeting after years. Meanwhile, the two also get to meet Muthu (Seeman) who is a film director now and is also their close friend. All the three friends get united after many years.\n\nA flashback is shown where Vetri, Kumar and Muthu were close friends during schooldays. All three belong to poor families and Vetri falls in love with his classmate Kokila, who is a rich girl. Jhansi (Shriya) is a nurse who visits the village for conducting a medical camp. All three boys get closer to Jhansi as she is kind and she looks after them very well. Jhansi takes care of Muthu's education after his father's sudden death.\n\nMeanwhile, Vetri and Kokila's love affair is known to her family members and they accuse that Jhansi helped the love and insults her in front of the villagers. Jhansi gets hurt and leaves the village. Muthu also leaves the village along with Jhansi . Vetri goes out of village for undergraduation. Vetri clears civil services and comes back to village with plans of marrying Kokila in a registrar office. But Kokila refuses getting married without her family's consent and requests Vetri to meet her parents once with the hope that they would agree as he is well educated now. But, Kokila's father beat Vetri and his father and in the fight, Vetri's father dies. Kokila's family members lock her in a room. Vetri gets furious that Kokila didn't turn up at the time of his visit and also worries due to his father's death. Vetri decides to leave the village with no plans of returning again.\n\nComing back to present, all three friends meet and share their old good memories. Muthu is married and he takes care of Jhansi still. Also Kumar is married. Kumar describes the pathetic state of their old school in village and requests them to take some action to prevent it from getting shut.

The film deals with four different periods \u2013 1978, 1983, 1991 and 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe movie revolves around an ailing school in a village in Cuddalore district where the land owner wants to demolish the school while the old students prevent the school from getting shut. Kokila (Sneha) works in the school where she had also studied. The school was constructed by Kokila\u2019s grandfather years ago and dispute arises between her family members, where her uncle wanted to demolish the school and sell the land as the school is in a very bad state.\n\nThe school teachers come up with a plan of organising an alumni get together, so that the school can be saved. Kumarasamy aka Kumar (Thagar Bachan) is a poor man who lives in the same village and is the classmate of Kokila. He is sent to Kanchipuram to meet the district collector Vetrivel (Naren) who also happens to be the alumni of the same school. Vetri and Kumar were close friends during childhood and both feel happy meeting after years. Meanwhile, the two also get to meet Muthu (Seeman) who is a film director now and is also their close friend. All the three friends get united after many years.\n\nA flashback is shown where Vetri, Kumar and Muthu were close friends during schooldays. All three belong to poor families and Vetri falls in love with his classmate Kokila, who is a rich girl. Jhansi (Shriya) is a nurse who visits the village for conducting a medical camp. All three boys get closer to Jhansi as she is kind and she looks after them very well. Jhansi takes care of Muthu's education after his father\u2019s sudden death.\n\nMeanwhile, Vetri and Kokila\u2019s love affair is known to her family members and they accuse that Jhansi helped the love and insults her in front of the villagers. Jhansi gets hurt and leaves the village. Muthu also leaves the village along with Jhansi . Vetri goes out of village for undergraduation. Vetri clears civil services and comes back to village with plans of marrying Kokila in a registrar office. But Kokila refuses getting married without her family's consent and requests Vetri to meet her parents once with the hope that they would agree as he is well educated now. But, Kokila's father beat Vetri and his father and in the fight, Vetri's father dies. Kokila's family members lock her in a room. Vetri gets furious that Kokila didn't turn up at the time of his visit and also worries due to his father's death. Vetri decides to leave the village with no plans of returning again.\n\nComing back to present, all three friends meet and share their old good memories. Muthu is married and he takes care of Jhansi still. Also Kumar is married. Kumar describes the pathetic state of their old school in village and requests them to take some action to prevent it from getting shut. The friends decides to try all means to conduct an alumni reunion. But Vetri is not interested to return to the village as he has been humiliated by Kokila\u2019s family members long time ago.

Founded in 1843, Holy Cross is the oldest Catholic college in [[New England]] and one of the oldest in the United States.\n\nOpened as a school for boys under the auspices of the [[Society of Jesus]], it was the first Jesuit college in New England. Today, Holy Cross is one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]] (AJCU) and is part of the [[Colleges of Worcester Consortium]] (COWC).

[[James Fitton (priest)|James Fitton]], with his lay collaborator Joseph Brigden, since 1832. On February 2, 1843, Fr. Fitton sold the land to Bishop Fenwick and the Diocese of Boston to be used to found the Roman Catholic college that the bishop had wanted in Boston.<ref name=\"thy\"/> Fenwick gave the college the name of his cathedral church, the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]]. The Bishop's letters record his enthusiasm for the project as well as for its location:\n\n<blockquote>Next May I shall lay the foundation of a splendid College in Worcester ... It is calculated to contain 100 boys and I shall take them for $125 per an. & supply them with everything but clothes. Will not this be a bold undertaking? Nevertheless I will try it. It will stand on a beautiful eminence & will command the view of the whole town of Worcester.<ref name=\"history\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe school opened in October 1843 with the Rev. [[Thomas F. Mulledy]], S.J., former president of [[Georgetown University]], as its first president, and on the second day of November, with six students aged 9 to 19, the first classes were held.<ref name=\"thy\"/> Within three years, the enrollment had increased to 100 students. Initially the education was more at the elementary and high school level; later it became a higher level institution.\n\nSince its founding, Holy Cross has produced the fifth most members of the Catholic clergy out of all American Catholic colleges. The first class graduated in 1849, led by the valedictorian [[James Augustine Healy]], the [[mixed-race]] son of an Irish planter in Georgia and his common-law wife, a [[mulatto]] former slave. Healy is now recognized as the first African-American bishop in the United States, but at the time he identified as white Irish Catholic and was largely accepted as such, without denying his African ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|author=Powell, A.

The Archives contain complete runs of all college publications including yearbooks, the college catalog, The Crusader, its predecessor The Tomahawk, the literary magazine The Purple, newsletters, pamphlets, and similar material. An extensive photograph collection documents administrators, staff, faculty, students, alumni, athletic teams, student activities, the built environment, and college life in general.\n\nThere is also an extensive collection of audiovisual material documenting theatrical plays, lectures, and sporting and other events.

It serves as the primary public space for the Center for Religion, Ethics, and Culture and other departments with offices within Smith Hall. Rehm Library provides space for hospitality, Center-sponsored lectures and events, quiet space for reading and reflection, and enhanced library resources on religion and spirituality. While not a library in the traditional sense, the shelves of Rehm Library house a non-circulating collection of primary texts from an array of religious traditions. It was named in honor of alumnus Jack Rehm '54 and his family.\n\n==Student life==\n\n===Athletics===\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders}}\nHoly Cross sponsors 27 varsity sports, all of which compete at the NCAA Division I level (FCS for football) with the exception of the women's ice hockey team which competes at the NCAA Division III level. The Crusaders are members of the Patriot League, the Atlantic Hockey Association, and the Division III New England Hockey Conference in women's hockey. Of its 27 varsity teams, Holy Cross supports 13 men's and 14 women's sports.[http://goholycross.cstv.com/calendar/holy-schedule.html] The carrying of 26 Division I varsity programs gives Holy Cross the largest ratio of teams-per-enrollment in the country.\n\nThe College is a founding member of the [[Patriot League]], and boasts that one-quarter of its student body participates in its varsity athletic programs. For the first decade of its existence, Patriot League schools did not offer athletic scholarships. The league began allowing schools to offer athletic scholarships for all sports except football in 2001, after American University joined the league, and in 2012 league members were authorized to offer football scholarships as well.<ref name=IHEFeb12>{{cite news | title=Then there was one |first=Allie | last=Grasgreen | date=February 14, 2012 | work=Inside Higher Ed| url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/02/14/football-scholarships-patriot-league-distances-self-ivies }}</ref>\n\nPrincipal athletic facilities include the [[Fitton Field]] football stadium (capacity 23,500), Hart Recreation Center's basketball court (3,600), the newly renovated Fitton Field baseball park also called Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field (3,000), Holy Cross Field House, Hart Ice Rink (1,600), [[Linda Johnson Smith Stadium]] (1,320), and Smith Wellness Center located inside the Hart Center. The Linda Johnson Smith Soccer Stadium opened in the fall of 2006.\n\nHoly Cross is one of eight schools<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlycolors.com/2013/6/25/4465326/national-championships-by-the-numbers|title=National Championships by the Numbers|website=SB Nation}}</ref> to have won an NCAA championship in both baseball and basketball, having won the [[1952 College World Series]] and the [[1947 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. The College has also won the [[1954 National Invitation Tournament]] and participated in the [[1946 Orange Bowl]]. Since electing to focus more on academics than athletics, the College has had several notable moments on the national stage. In 2006, the [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's ice hockey|Holy Cross men's ice hockey team]] upset the No. 1 seed Minnesota Golden Gophers in the [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].

With its relative distance from a major city, and without a [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]] at Holy Cross, undergraduate social life revolves around a number of school-sponsored groups, events, and off-campus houses on nearby city streets (notably Boyden, Cambridge, Caro, Chelsea, College, and Southbridge streets) which are open to upperclassmen.\n\nThe college also features a variety of student journals, media, and newspapers including The Fenwick Review, a journal of conservative thought; The Advocate, a journal based in liberal principles; and The Spire, the weekly newspaper published by Holy Cross students for the college community.<ref>[http://college.holycross.edu/studentorgs/crusader.html ''The Crusader''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206090527/http://college.holycross.edu/studentorgs/crusader.html |date=2006-12-06 }}</ref> Free copies of the 4,000-circulation paper are available online or at campus newsstands on ten Friday mornings each semester. Holy Cross also has a student-run radio station, [[WCHC]]-FM 88.1. WCHC, thanks to its position as a non-profit radio station, broadcasts commercial-free year round. The athletics department carries live broadcasts of many of the school's football, basketball, and hockey games. Holy Cross also has a unique law journal, The Holy Cross Journal of Law & Public Policy, which is published annually by undergraduate students.\n\nThe \"Campus Activities Board (CAB)\", a student-run organization, runs several committees that oversee campus-wide activities and student services with a focus on evening and weekend programming. The Student Government Association (SGA) charters and provides most of the funding for these programs, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://college.holycross.edu/sga/history.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610175736/http://college.holycross.edu/sga/history.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-06-10|title=Student Government Association: Constitution & History|publisher=}}</ref> SGA was developed under a model of shared governance with the Division of Student Affairs. The SGA maintains that it represents students through college governance, offers student services, and launches new programs and initiatives. This government consists of a dual executive of Co-Presidents along with an Executive Cabinet. The legislature is bicameral and consists of the elected Senate and the larger General Assembly which draws its membership from student organizations. The SGA Judicial Council acts as the judiciary, hearing SGA-related appeals as well as those resulting from student parking violations issued by the Department of Public Safety. Finally, an Election Committee oversees student government elections and decides on appeals that result from them.\n\nAlternate College Theatre (ACT) is a theatre group on campus where students take part in producing, designing, directing, writing, and acting in their own student-run productions. They work closely with the Theatre department on campus and put on three shows every year (two straight plays and one musical) along with various other productions and events.\n\nThe largest student organization at Holy Cross, Student Programs for Urban Development (SPUD), is a community service organization sponsored by the college Chaplains' Office consisting of over 45 different outreach programs and over 600 active members.<ref>[http://www.holycross.edu/departments/chaplains/spud.htm Holy Cross: SPUD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908003045/http://www.holycross.edu//departments/chaplains/spud.htm |date=2006-09-08 }}</ref> Other volunteer and social justice programs offered by Holy Cross include Pax Christi, the Appalachia Service Project, Oxfam America (formerly Student Coalition on Hunger and Homelessness (SCOHAH)), and the Arrupe Immersion Program, named in honor of Fr.

The event coincides with the \"10 Spot\", a weekly open mic night for Holy Cross bands and occasionally outside performers, which occurs next to the Pub.\n* Stickball: Wheeler Hall is the most storied of the residence halls, known for its unique traditions. It is also the site for a popular campus sport known as stickball, a long-standing Holy Cross tradition usually played by Wheeler residents. It is estimated that Holy Cross students began playing stickball at Wheeler Hall around 1940. The Holy Cross version's origins are the stuff of legends. The sport lends itself to neighborhood stickball, and is played with a tennis ball and broomstick. Wheeler Hall's five floors and symmetrical design makes it an ideal setting for the playing and spectating of the sport. A hill behind home plate helps contribute to the playing area's natural amphitheater-like setting.\n*Battle of the Bands: Held the weekend prior to the end of classes, student-organized music groups compete to earn a coveted opening spot in the Sprint Weekend concert held the following weekend. Judges eliminate bands through a series of sets leading up to the final round, in which student attendees vote to select the winning band.<ref name=HCCrusaderMay15>{{cite news | title=Battle of the Bands 2015 | first=John | last=Hodge | date=May 1, 2015 | work=Holy Cross Crusader | url=http://www.thehccrusader.com/battle-of-the-bands-2015/ | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205014305/http://www.thehccrusader.com/battle-of-the-bands-2015/ | archivedate=February 5, 2016 | df= }}</ref>\n* Spring Weekend: The Spring Weekend, organized by the Campus Activities Board (CAB), is an annual event which marks the end of classes. Always held the week before finals, events include the Spring Carnival, fireworks, and a Spring Concert. In the past, invited performers have included the [[Pat McGee Band]] (2001), [[Wyclef Jean]] (2002), [[Third Eye Blind]] (2003, 2016), [[Howie Day]] (2004), [[The Roots]] (2004), [[Fabolous]] and [[The Starting Line]] (2005), [[Phantom Planet]] (2006), [[Guster]] (2006), [[O.A.R.

Tradition holds that attendees make a list of fellow seniors they would like to kiss, and attempt to follow through before the night is over.\n* Purple Pride Day: Each year, the Purple Key Society chooses a day to banner the campus in the color purple, the official school color, to foster school spirit and pride. This includes giving out purple balloons, purple T-shirts, purple cookies, purple stickers, and various other items throughout the day. Purple Pride Day usually coincides with a Holy Cross sporting event.\n* Cape Week: Following the close of the Spring semester, many students spend a week of vacation on Cape Cod.  Students typically rent homes or stay in nearby hotels for a few days of parties and gatherings.  Typically, students spend the week in Hyannis or in neighboring towns.\n\n==Insignia and representations of Holy Cross==\n;Color\nThe school color is [[purple]]. There are two theories of how Holy Cross chose purple as its official color. One suggests it was derived from the royal purple used by Constantine the Great (born about 275 A.D., died in 337 A.D.) as displayed on his labarum (military standard) and on those of later Christian emperors of Rome.<ref name=\"color\"/>\n\n;College Seal\n[[File:HolyCrossSealColor.png|right|thumb|Seal of the College of the Holy Cross]]\nThe seal of the College of the Holy Cross is described as follows:\n\nThe outer circle states in Latin \"College of the Holy Cross, Society of Jesus, Worcester, Massachusetts.\"\n\nThe inner shield contains an open book (symbol of learning) and a cross of gold (symbol of Christian faith). Written in the book is the college's motto, ''[[In Hoc Signo Vinces]]''; which translates as, \"\"By this sign thou shalt conquer,\". The phrase is credited to [[Constantine]].\n\nThe cross divides the lower part of the shield into quarters, which are alternately red and sable, the colors on the ancient shield of [[Worcester, England]]. The upper part of the shield has in its center the emblem of the Society of Jesus, a blazing sun with the letters IHS, the first three letters of Jesus' name in Greek. On either side is a [[martlet]], reminiscent of those on the ancestral crest of [[Bishop Fenwick]].<ref name=\"seal\"/><ref name=\"seal\">[http://www.holycross.edu/abouthc/why/history/seal/ Holy Cross College Seal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903004723/http://www.holycross.edu/abouthc/why/history/seal/ |date=2006-09-03 }}</ref>\n\n;Mascot\nHoly Cross's athletic teams for both men and women are known as the [[Crusades|Crusaders]].

Crusader. Holy Cross opted instead for the secondary (now primary) logo of a purple shield with an interlocking \"HC.\"\n\n;Motto\nThe Latin motto ''In Hoc Signo Vinces'', \"In This Sign You Shall Conquer\", has been attributed to Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] the Great, a Roman emperor noted for his tolerance of Christians. According to some historians, Constantine had a dream or vision of a flaming cross in the sky with this inscription on the day preceding his decisive victory over Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge (October 28, 312). This victory led to his capturing Rome and convinced him of the importance of Christianity.<ref name=\"seal\"/>\n\n==Town and gown==\nIn more recent years, \"[[town and gown]]\" relations have soured, and Holy Cross has had varying levels of disagreement with the surrounding residential College Hill community.<ref name=\"hill\">[http://oxepsilon.com:1856/oxe/alumni/discussions/holycross.shtml \"Tougher enforcement sought\" ''Telegram & Gazette'' (Worcester, Mass.), October 24, 1999.]</ref> The administration and the Student Government Association (SGA) have worked to improve this situation by directing various initiatives including the redevelopment of a nearby park, and its co-sponsorship with the Society of Jesus of New England to create the Nativity School of Worcester, an all-scholarship middle school serving boys from the city of Worcester.<ref>[http://www.holycross.edu/assets/pdfs/in_the_community.pdf Holy Cross in the Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620032022/http://www.holycross.edu/assets/pdfs/in_the_community.pdf |date=2007-06-20 }}</ref> Holy Cross has also created student liaison positions to attend Community meetings and engage residents, and created new on-campus housing to lessen the off-campus population.<ref name=\"plan\">[http://www.ci.worcester.ma.us/reports/CollegeHillPlan.pdf City of Worcester: College Hill Neighborhood Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207095050/http://www.ci.worcester.ma.us/reports/CollegeHillPlan.pdf |date=2006-12-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n[[File:Clarence Thomas official.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Clarence Thomas]], class of 1971, former trustee and current Supreme Court Justice]]\n{{Main|List of College of the Holy Cross alumni}}\n\nHoly Cross had more than 35,000 alumni as of January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holycross.edu/alumni/index.html|title=Alumni and Friends|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908002604/http://www.holycross.edu//alumni/index.html|archivedate=2006-09-08|df=}}</ref> There are 39 Holy Cross alumni clubs in the U.S. and 1 international club.<ref>[http://www.holycross.edu/alumni/events/regional/ Holy Cross Regional Clubs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909050611/http://www.holycross.edu//alumni/events/regional/ |date=2006-09-09 }}</ref> A number of Holy Cross alumni have made significant contributions in the fields of government, law, academia, business, arts, journalism, and athletics, among others.

Founded in 1843, Holy Cross is the oldest Catholic college in [[New England]] and one of the oldest in the United States.\n\nOpened as a school for boys under the auspices of the [[Society of Jesus]], it was the first Jesuit college in New England. Today, Holy Cross is one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]] (AJCU) and is part of the [[Colleges of Worcester Consortium]] (COWC). Holy Cross sports teams are called the Crusaders, and their sole color is purple; they compete in [[NCAA Division I]] as members of the [[Patriot League]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Beginnings===\nHoly Cross was founded by [[Benedict Joseph Fenwick]], S.J., second [[Bishop of Boston]], after his efforts to found a Catholic college in Boston were thwarted by the city's Protestant civic leaders.<ref name=\"thy\">{{cite book|author=Kuzniewski, Anthony J. |title=Thy Honored Name: A History of the College of the Holy Cross, 1843-1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C04IVksMcN0C|year=1999|publisher=[[Catholic University of America Press|CUA Press]]|isbn=978-0-8132-0911-1}}</ref> From the beginning of his tenure as bishop, Fenwick intended to establish a Catholic college within the boundaries of his diocese.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=https://www.holycross.edu/about-us/history/|title=History|publisher=holycross.edu|}}</ref>\n[[File:fenwick.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Benedict Joseph Fenwick]], SJ, founder of Holy Cross]]\nRelations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the College of the Holy Cross {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of the city in central Massachusetts, where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy.<ref name=\"history\"/> The site of the college, Mount Saint James, was originally occupied by a [[Roman Catholic]] boarding school run by the Rev. [[James Fitton (priest)|James Fitton]], with his lay collaborator Joseph Brigden, since 1832. On February 2, 1843, Fr. Fitton sold the land to Bishop Fenwick and the Diocese of Boston to be used to found the Roman Catholic college that the bishop had wanted in Boston.<ref name=\"thy\"/> Fenwick gave the college the name of his cathedral church, the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]]. The Bishop's letters record his enthusiasm for the project as well as for its location:\n\n<blockquote>Next May I shall lay the foundation of a splendid College in Worcester ... It is calculated to contain 100 boys and I shall take them for $125 per an. & supply them with everything but clothes. Will not this be a bold undertaking? Nevertheless I will try it. It will stand on a beautiful eminence & will command the view of the whole town of Worcester.<ref name=\"history\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe school opened in October 1843 with the Rev. [[Thomas F. Mulledy]], S.J., former president of [[Georgetown University]], as its first president, and on the second day of November, with six students aged 9 to 19, the first classes were held.<ref name=\"thy\"/> Within three years, the enrollment had increased to 100 students. Initially the education was more at the elementary and high school level; later it became a higher level institution.\n\nSince its founding, Holy Cross has produced the fifth most members of the Catholic clergy out of all American Catholic colleges. The first class graduated in 1849, led by the valedictorian [[James Augustine Healy]], the [[mixed-race]] son of an Irish planter in Georgia and his common-law wife, a [[mulatto]] former slave. Healy is now recognized as the first African-American bishop in the United States, but at the time he identified as white Irish Catholic and was largely accepted as such, without denying his African ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|author=Powell, A.

The increased rate of immigration from Ireland during the famine years roused resistance from some residents of Massachusetts.<ref name=\"thy\"/> Initially, Holy Cross diplomas were signed by the president of [[Georgetown University]].

The campaign provided support for the renovation of the Mary Chapel as well as construction of new facilities on campus, including Smith Hall which houses the new Michael C. McFarland Center for Religion, Ethics and Culture; a five-story apartment-style residence housing 244 seniors; and a new 1,350-seat soccer stadium.

Healy and Lehy are also on Easy Street, but they are reserved for upperclassmen. Another housing option, near the center section of campus, is Wheeler Hall, a Sophomore Residence Hall. Upperclassmen students can choose, depending on the results of the housing lottery held in the Spring, between the Easy Street residence halls, minus Hanselman, or the upperclass residence halls in the lower portion of campus: Alumni, Carlin, and Loyola.

Originally opened in 1927, it expanded in 1978 with two new wings dedicated to the memory of Joshua and Leah Hiatt and victims of the Nazi [[Holocaust]]. The reading room of Dinand is also the scene of important College gatherings, among them the Presidential Awards Ceremony, first-year orientation presentations, and concerts. [[File:Okane hall.jpg|right|thumb|O'Kane Hall and clock tower, view from northern end of campus.]]Dinand is considered by many students the most scholarly and inspiring building on campus. Constructed in the 1920s, the room's ceiling is sectioned in a grid-like pattern and embellished with gold, painted trim, and carvings along the top of the interior walls. Large wooden candelabra are suspended from the ceiling, and Ionic columns \u2013 echoing those on the Library's exterior \u2013 anchor three sides of the room. The main reference collection of dictionaries, encyclopedias, and bibliographies are found within Dinand as well as the on-line catalog, and a staffed reference desk.\n\n;College Archives\nDinand Library also houses the College Archives which collects, preserves, and arranges records of permanent value from the college's foundation in 1843 to the present. The Archives contain complete runs of all college publications including yearbooks, the college catalog, The Crusader, its predecessor The Tomahawk, the literary magazine The Purple, newsletters, pamphlets, and similar material. An extensive photograph collection documents administrators, staff, faculty, students, alumni, athletic teams, student activities, the built environment, and college life in general.\n\nThere is also an extensive collection of audiovisual material documenting theatrical plays, lectures, and sporting and other events. The College Archives also hold a Special Collections section which consists of a Rare Book Collection and the Jesuitana Collection (material by and about Jesuits). Noted collections include the papers of James Michael Curley, David I. Walsh, Louise Imogen Guiney, and Rev. Joseph J. Williams, S.J. There are also collections of material by and about Jesuits, college alumni, and friends of the college. The first naval chaplain to receive the Medal of Honor, [[Joseph T. O'Callahan|Rev. Joseph T.

It serves as the primary public space for the Center for Religion, Ethics, and Culture and other departments with offices within Smith Hall. Rehm Library provides space for hospitality, Center-sponsored lectures and events, quiet space for reading and reflection, and enhanced library resources on religion and spirituality. While not a library in the traditional sense, the shelves of Rehm Library house a non-circulating collection of primary texts from an array of religious traditions. It was named in honor of alumnus Jack Rehm '54 and his family.\n\n==Student life==\n\n===Athletics===\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders}}\nHoly Cross sponsors 27 varsity sports, all of which compete at the NCAA Division I level (FCS for football) with the exception of the women's ice hockey team which competes at the NCAA Division III level. The Crusaders are members of the Patriot League, the Atlantic Hockey Association, and the Division III New England Hockey Conference in women's hockey. Of its 27 varsity teams, Holy Cross supports 13 men's and 14 women's sports.[http://goholycross.cstv.com/calendar/holy-schedule.html] The carrying of 26 Division I varsity programs gives Holy Cross the largest ratio of teams-per-enrollment in the country.\n\nThe College is a founding member of the [[Patriot League]], and boasts that one-quarter of its student body participates in its varsity athletic programs. For the first decade of its existence, Patriot League schools did not offer athletic scholarships.

The College has also won the [[1954 National Invitation Tournament]] and participated in the [[1946 Orange Bowl]]. Since electing to focus more on academics than athletics, the College has had several notable moments on the national stage. In 2006, the [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's ice hockey|Holy Cross men's ice hockey team]] upset the No. 1 seed Minnesota Golden Gophers in the [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].

With its relative distance from a major city, and without a [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]] at Holy Cross, undergraduate social life revolves around a number of school-sponsored groups, events, and off-campus houses on nearby city streets (notably Boyden, Cambridge, Caro, Chelsea, College, and Southbridge streets) which are open to upperclassmen.\n\nThe college also features a variety of student journals, media, and newspapers including The Fenwick Review, a journal of conservative thought; The Advocate, a journal based in liberal principles; and The Spire, the weekly newspaper published by Holy Cross students for the college community.<ref>[http://college.holycross.edu/studentorgs/crusader.html ''The Crusader''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206090527/http://college.holycross.edu/studentorgs/crusader.html |date=2006-12-06 }}</ref> Free copies of the 4,000-circulation paper are available online or at campus newsstands on ten Friday mornings each semester. Holy Cross also has a student-run radio station, [[WCHC]]-FM 88.1. WCHC, thanks to its position as a non-profit radio station, broadcasts commercial-free year round. The athletics department carries live broadcasts of many of the school's football, basketball, and hockey games. Holy Cross also has a unique law journal, The Holy Cross Journal of Law & Public Policy, which is published annually by undergraduate students.\n\nThe \"Campus Activities Board (CAB)\", a student-run organization, runs several committees that oversee campus-wide activities and student services with a focus on evening and weekend programming. The Student Government Association (SGA) charters and provides most of the funding for these programs, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://college.holycross.edu/sga/history.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610175736/http://college.holycross.edu/sga/history.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-06-10|title=Student Government Association: Constitution & History|publisher=}}</ref> SGA was developed under a model of shared governance with the Division of Student Affairs. The SGA maintains that it represents students through college governance, offers student services, and launches new programs and initiatives. This government consists of a dual executive of Co-Presidents along with an Executive Cabinet. The legislature is bicameral and consists of the elected Senate and the larger General Assembly which draws its membership from student organizations. The SGA Judicial Council acts as the judiciary, hearing SGA-related appeals as well as those resulting from student parking violations issued by the Department of Public Safety. Finally, an Election Committee oversees student government elections and decides on appeals that result from them.\n\nAlternate College Theatre (ACT) is a theatre group on campus where students take part in producing, designing, directing, writing, and acting in their own student-run productions. They work closely with the Theatre department on campus and put on three shows every year (two straight plays and one musical) along with various other productions and events.\n\nThe largest student organization at Holy Cross, Student Programs for Urban Development (SPUD), is a community service organization sponsored by the college Chaplains' Office consisting of over 45 different outreach programs and over 600 active members.<ref>[http://www.holycross.edu/departments/chaplains/spud.htm Holy Cross: SPUD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908003045/http://www.holycross.edu//departments/chaplains/spud.htm |date=2006-09-08 }}</ref> Other volunteer and social justice programs offered by Holy Cross include Pax Christi, the Appalachia Service Project, Oxfam America (formerly Student Coalition on Hunger and Homelessness (SCOHAH)), and the Arrupe Immersion Program, named in honor of Fr.

The event coincides with the \"10 Spot\", a weekly open mic night for Holy Cross bands and occasionally outside performers, which occurs next to the Pub.\n* Stickball: Wheeler Hall is the most storied of the residence halls, known for its unique traditions. It is also the site for a popular campus sport known as stickball, a long-standing Holy Cross tradition usually played by Wheeler residents. It is estimated that Holy Cross students began playing stickball at Wheeler Hall around 1940. The Holy Cross version's origins are the stuff of legends. The sport lends itself to neighborhood stickball, and is played with a tennis ball and broomstick.

Tradition holds that attendees make a list of fellow seniors they would like to kiss, and attempt to follow through before the night is over.\n* Purple Pride Day: Each year, the Purple Key Society chooses a day to banner the campus in the color purple, the official school color, to foster school spirit and pride. This includes giving out purple balloons, purple T-shirts, purple cookies, purple stickers, and various other items throughout the day. Purple Pride Day usually coincides with a Holy Cross sporting event.\n* Cape Week: Following the close of the Spring semester, many students spend a week of vacation on Cape Cod.  Students typically rent homes or stay in nearby hotels for a few days of parties and gatherings.  Typically, students spend the week in Hyannis or in neighboring towns.\n\n==Insignia and representations of Holy Cross==\n;Color\nThe school color is [[purple]]. There are two theories of how Holy Cross chose purple as its official color. One suggests it was derived from the royal purple used by Constantine the Great (born about 275 A.D., died in 337 A.D.) as displayed on his labarum (military standard) and on those of later Christian emperors of Rome.<ref name=\"color\"/>\n\n;College Seal\n[[File:HolyCrossSealColor.png|right|thumb|Seal of the College of the Holy Cross]]\nThe seal of the College of the Holy Cross is described as follows:\n\nThe outer circle states in Latin \"College of the Holy Cross, Society of Jesus, Worcester, Massachusetts.\"\n\nThe inner shield contains an open book (symbol of learning) and a cross of gold (symbol of Christian faith). Written in the book is the college's motto, ''[[In Hoc Signo Vinces]]''; which translates as, \"\"By this sign thou shalt conquer,\". The phrase is credited to [[Constantine]].\n\nThe cross divides the lower part of the shield into quarters, which are alternately red and sable, the colors on the ancient shield of [[Worcester, England]]. The upper part of the shield has in its center the emblem of the Society of Jesus, a blazing sun with the letters IHS, the first three letters of Jesus' name in Greek. On either side is a [[martlet]], reminiscent of those on the ancestral crest of [[Bishop Fenwick]].<ref name=\"seal\"/><ref name=\"seal\">[http://www.holycross.edu/abouthc/why/history/seal/ Holy Cross College Seal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903004723/http://www.holycross.edu/abouthc/why/history/seal/ |date=2006-09-03 }}</ref>\n\n;Mascot\nHoly Cross's athletic teams for both men and women are known as the [[Crusades|Crusaders]].

Crusader. Holy Cross opted instead for the secondary (now primary) logo of a purple shield with an interlocking \"HC.\"\n\n;Motto\nThe Latin motto ''In Hoc Signo Vinces'', \"In This Sign You Shall Conquer\", has been attributed to Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] the Great, a Roman emperor noted for his tolerance of Christians. According to some historians, Constantine had a dream or vision of a flaming cross in the sky with this inscription on the day preceding his decisive victory over Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge (October 28, 312). This victory led to his capturing Rome and convinced him of the importance of Christianity.<ref name=\"seal\"/>\n\n==Town and gown==\nIn more recent years, \"[[town and gown]]\" relations have soured, and Holy Cross has had varying levels of disagreement with the surrounding residential College Hill community.<ref name=\"hill\">[http://oxepsilon.com:1856/oxe/alumni/discussions/holycross.shtml \"Tougher enforcement sought\" ''Telegram & Gazette'' (Worcester, Mass.), October 24, 1999.]</ref> The administration and the Student Government Association (SGA) have worked to improve this situation by directing various initiatives including the redevelopment of a nearby park, and its co-sponsorship with the Society of Jesus of New England to create the Nativity School of Worcester, an all-scholarship middle school serving boys from the city of Worcester.<ref>[http://www.holycross.edu/assets/pdfs/in_the_community.pdf Holy Cross in the Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620032022/http://www.holycross.edu/assets/pdfs/in_the_community.pdf |date=2007-06-20 }}</ref> Holy Cross has also created student liaison positions to attend Community meetings and engage residents, and created new on-campus housing to lessen the off-campus population.<ref name=\"plan\">[http://www.ci.worcester.ma.us/reports/CollegeHillPlan.pdf City of Worcester: College Hill Neighborhood Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207095050/http://www.ci.worcester.ma.us/reports/CollegeHillPlan.pdf |date=2006-12-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n[[File:Clarence Thomas official.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Clarence Thomas]], class of 1971, former trustee and current Supreme Court Justice]]\n{{Main|List of College of the Holy Cross alumni}}\n\nHoly Cross had more than 35,000 alumni as of January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holycross.edu/alumni/index.html|title=Alumni and Friends|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908002604/http://www.holycross.edu//alumni/index.html|archivedate=2006-09-08|df=}}</ref> There are 39 Holy Cross alumni clubs in the U.S. and 1 international club.<ref>[http://www.holycross.edu/alumni/events/regional/ Holy Cross Regional Clubs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909050611/http://www.holycross.edu//alumni/events/regional/ |date=2006-09-09 }}</ref> A number of Holy Cross alumni have made significant contributions in the fields of government, law, academia, business, arts, journalism, and athletics, among others.

It is typically used by a computer chess engine during play, or by a human or computer that is retrospectively analysing a game that has already been played.\n\nThe tablebase contains the [[game theory|game-theoretical]] value (win, loss, or [[draw (chess)|draw]]) of each possible move in each possible position, and how many moves it would take to achieve that result with [[perfect play]]. Thus, the tablebase acts as an [[oracle machine|oracle]], always providing the optimal moves. Typically the database records each possible position with certain [[chess piece|pieces]] remaining on the board, and the best moves with [[White and Black in chess|White]] to move and with [[White and Black in chess|Black]] to move.\n\nTablebases are generated by [[retrograde analysis]], working backwards from a [[checkmate]]d position. By 2005, all chess positions with up to six pieces (including the two [[king (chess)|kings]]) had been solved. By August 2012, tablebases had solved chess for every position with up to seven pieces (the positions with a lone king versus a king and five pieces were omitted because they were considered to be \"rather obvious\").<ref>[https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Endgame+Tablebases#x7-man EGTBs Chessprogramming website]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lomonosov Endgame Tablebases|work=ChessOK|url=http://chessok.com/?page_id=27966}}</ref>\n\nThe solutions have profoundly advanced the chess community's understanding of [[Chess endgame#Effect of tablebases on endgame theory|endgame theory]].  Some positions which humans had analyzed as draws were proven to be winnable; the tablebase analysis could find a mate in more than five hundred moves, far beyond the [[horizon effect|horizon]] of humans, and beyond the capability of a computer during play. For this reason, they have also called into question the [[Fifty-move rule|50-move rule]] since many positions are now seen to exist that are a win for one side but would be drawn because of the 50-move rule. Tablebases have enhanced competitive play and facilitated the composition of [[endgame studies]]. They provide a powerful analytical tool.\n\nWhile endgame tablebases for other board games like [[checkers]],<ref>[http://edgilbert.org/Checkers/KingsRow.htm Website] of [[KingsRow]] about the creation of a tablebases for 8x8 and 10x10 checkers</ref> [[chess variant]]s<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114510/http://www.gothicchess.com/javascript_endings.html gothicchess.com]; examples of long endings for [[Capablanca chess]]</ref> or [[nine men's morris]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.msri.org/books/Book29/files/gasser.pdf|title=Solving nine men's morris|author=Ralpf Gasser|year=1996}}</ref> exist, when a game is not specified, it is assumed to be chess.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=tocleft}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Computer chess}}\nPhysical limitations of [[personal computer hardware|computer hardware]] aside, in principle it is possible to [[solved game|solve any game]] under the condition that the [[Perfect information|complete state is known]] and there is no [[Game of chance|random chance]].

[[Weak solution]]s exist for somewhat more complex games, such as [[English draughts|checkers]] (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and [[Go (game)|Go]], have not been solved because their [[game complexity]] is far too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.\n\n[[Computer chess]] is one of the oldest domains of [[artificial intelligence]], having begun in the early 1930s.  [[Claude Shannon]] proposed formal criteria for evaluating chess moves in 1949.  In 1951, [[Alan Turing]] designed a primitive chess playing program, which assigned values for material and [[mobility (chess)|mobility]]; the program \"played\" chess based on Turing's manual calculations.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 25-38</ref>  However, even as competent chess programs began to develop, they exhibited a glaring weakness in playing the endgame.  Programmers added specific [[heuristic]]s for the endgame \u2013 for example, the [[king (chess)|king]] should move to the center of the board.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 129-30</ref>  However, a more comprehensive solution was needed.\n\nIn 1965, [[Richard Bellman]] proposed the creation of a database to solve chess and [[checkers]] endgames using [[retrograde analysis]].<ref>Stiller, p. 84</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=R.

It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.\n\nIn 1970, Thomas Str\u00f6hlein published a doctoral thesis<ref>{{cite book | author=T.

Every position can be defined by its distance (i.e. the number of moves) from the desired endpoint.  Two metrics are generally used:\n* '''Depth to mate''' (DTM). A checkmate is the only way to win a game.\n* '''Depth to conversion''' (DTC). The stronger side can also win by capturing material, thus converting to a simpler endgame.  For example, in KQKR, conversion occurs when White captures the Black rook.\nHaworth has discussed two other metrics, namely \"depth to zeroing-move\" (DTZ) and \"depth by the rule\" (DTR). A zeroing-move is a move which resets the move count to zero under the fifty-move rule, i.e. mate, a capture, or a pawn move.<ref name=\"haworthoptimisation\">{{cite journal\n | author=G. McC.

How White should proceed depends on which metric is used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metric\n! Play\n! DTC\n! DTM\n|-\n| DTC\n| 1. Qxd1 Kc8 2. Qd2 Kb8 3. Qd8#\n| 1\n| 3\n|-\n| DTM\n| 1. Qc7+ Ka8 2. Qa7#\n| 2\n| 2\n|}\n\nAccording to the DTC metric, White should capture the rook because that leads immediately to a position which will certainly win (DTC = 1), but it will take two more moves actually to checkmate (DTM = 3). In contrast according to the DTM metric, White mates in two moves, so DTM = DTC = 2.\n\nThis difference is typical of many endgames. Usually DTC is smaller than DTM, but the DTM metric leads to the quickest checkmate. Exceptions occur where the weaker side has only a king, and in the unusual endgame of [[Two knights endgame#Troitsky line|two knights versus one pawn]]; then DTC = DTM because either there is no defending material to capture or capturing the material does no good. (Indeed, capturing the defending pawn in the latter endgame results in a draw, unless it results in immediate mate.)\n\n=== Step 1: Generating all possible positions ===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| David Levy, ''How Computers Play Chess''\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n| The ten unique squares (with symmetry)\n}}\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| The twenty four unique pawn squares (with symmetry)\n}}\nOnce a metric is chosen, the first step is to generate all the positions with a given material.  For example, to generate a DTM tablebase for the endgame of king and queen versus king (KQK), the computer must describe approximately 40,000 unique legal positions.\n\nLevy and Newborn explain that the number 40,000 derives from a [[symmetry]] argument.  The Black king can be placed on any of ten squares: a1, b1, c1, d1, b2, c2, d2, c3, d3, and d4 (see diagram).  On any other square, its position can be considered equivalent by symmetry of rotation or reflection.  Thus, there is no difference whether a Black king in a corner resides on a1, a8, h8, or h1.  Multiply this number of 10 by at most 60 (legal remaining) squares for placing the White king and then by at most 62 squares for the White queen.  The product 10\u00d760\u00d762 = 37,200.  Several hundred of these positions are illegal, impossible, or symmetrical reflections of each other, so the actual number is somewhat smaller.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 140-43</ref><ref>See also Stiller 1995:93-98.</ref>\n\nFor each position, the tablebase evaluates the situation separately for White-to-move and Black-to-move.  Assuming that White has the queen, almost all the positions are White wins, with checkmate forced in no more than ten moves.  Some positions are draws because of [[stalemate]] or the unavoidable loss of the queen.\n\nEach additional piece added to a [[pawnless chess endgame|pawnless endgame]] multiplies the number of unique positions by about a factor of sixty which is the approximate number of squares not already occupied by other pieces.\n\nEndgames with one or more pawns increase the complexity because the symmetry argument is reduced. Since pawns can move forward but not sideways, rotation and vertical reflection of the board produces a fundamental change in the nature of the position.<ref name=\"MullerEGTB\">{{cite web|title=EGTB generator|author=Muller, H.G.|url=http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/EGTB.html|accessdate=2009-05-03|quote=Pawns would break the front-back and diagonal symmetries, because they care about direction in their moves.}}</ref> The best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in the rectangle a2-a7-d7-d2.  All other pieces and pawns may be located in any of the 64 squares with respect to the pawn.  Thus, an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24/10 = 2.4 times a pawnless endgame with the same number of pieces.\n\n=== Step 2: Evaluating positions using retrograde analysis ===\n[[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] explains the process of generating a tablebase as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"The idea is that a database is made with all possible positions with a given material [note: as in the preceding section]. Then a subdatabase is made of all positions where Black is mated. Then one where White can give mate. Then one where Black cannot stop White giving mate next move. Then one where White can always reach a position where Black cannot stop him from giving mate next move. And so on, always a ply further away from mate until all positions that are thus connected to mate have been found. Then all of these positions are linked back to mate by the shortest path through the database. That means that, apart from 'equi-optimal' moves, all the moves in such a path are perfect: White's move always leads to the quickest mate, Black's move always leads to the slowest mate.\"<ref name=\"stillermonsters\">{{cite web | author=Tim Krabb\u00e9. | title=Stiller's Monsters or Perfection in Chess. | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess/perfect.htm | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[retrograde analysis]] is only necessary from the [[checkmate]]d positions, because every position that cannot be reached by moving backwards from a checkmated position must be a draw.<ref name=\"tay\">{{cite web\n | url=http://horizonchess.com/FAQ/Winboard/egtb.html\n | title=A guide to Endgames Tablebase\n | author=Aaron Tay\n | accessdate=2009-05-02\n}}</ref>\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the idea of retrograde analysis. White can force mate in two moves by playing 1. Kc6, leading to the position in Figure 2. There are only two legal moves for black from this position, both of which lead to checkmate: if 1...Kb8 2. Qb7#, and if 1...Kd8 2. Qd7# (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3, before White's second move, is defined as \"mate in one [[ply (game theory)|ply]].\" Figure 2, after White's first move, is \"mate in two ply,\" regardless of how Black plays. Finally, the initial position in Figure 1 is \"mate in three ply\" (i.e., two moves) because it leads directly to Figure 2, which is already defined as \"mate in two ply.\" This process, which links a current position to another position that could have existed one ply earlier, can continue indefinitely.\n\nEach position is evaluated as a win or loss in a certain number of moves.

Bourzutschky | title=7-man endgames with pawns | publisher=[[CCRL]] Discussion Board | date=2006-08-27 | url=http://kirill-kryukov.com/chess/discussion-board/viewtopic.php?t=805 | accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in Figure 1 above, the verification program sees the evaluation \"mate in three ply (Kc6).\"  It then looks at the position in Figure 2, ''after'' Kc6, and sees the evaluation \"mate in two ply.\"  These two evaluations are consistent with each other.  If the evaluation of Figure 2 were anything else, it would be inconsistent with Figure 1, so the tablebase would need to be corrected.{{Clarify|reason=if there were a problem and position 1 were actually mate in a lesser number (in this case mate) this verification process would miss it.|date=May 2012}}\n\n=== Captures, pawn promotion, and special moves ===\nA four-piece tablebase must rely on three-piece tablebases that could result if one piece is captured. Similarly, a tablebase containing a pawn must be able to rely on other tablebases that deal with the new set of material after [[promotion (chess)|pawn promotion]] to a queen or other piece.  The retrograde analysis program must account for the possibility of a capture or pawn promotion on the previous move.<ref>Stiller, pp. 99-100</ref>\n\nTablebases assume that [[castling]] is not possible for two reasons.  First, in practical endgames, this assumption is almost always correct. (However, castling is allowed by convention in [[Chess problem|composed problems]] and [[Endgame study|studies]].) Second, if the king and rook are on their original squares, castling may or may not be allowed. Because of this ambiguity, it would be necessary to make separate evaluations for states in which castling is or is not possible.\n\nThe same ambiguity exists for the ''[[en passant]]'' capture, since the possibility of ''en passant'' depends on the opponent's previous move.  However, practical applications of ''en passant'' occur frequently in pawn endgames, so tablebases account for the possibility of ''en passant'' for positions where both sides have at least one pawn.\n\n=== Using ''a priori'' information ===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |kl\n|rl|  |  |  |bd|kd|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pd|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| An example of the KRP(a2)KBP(a3) endgame.

Other White moves draw.\n}}\nAccording to the method described above, the tablebase must allow the possibility that a given piece might occupy any of the 64 squares.  In some positions, it is possible to restrict the search space without affecting the result.  This saves computational resources and enables searches which would otherwise be impossible.\n\nAn early analysis of this type was published in 1987, in the endgame {{abbr|KRP(a2)KBP(a3)|a king, a rook and a pawn on a2 versus a king, a bishop and a pawn on a3}}, where the Black bishop moves on the dark squares (see example position at right).<ref>{{cite journal | author=H.

Reducing the search space by a factor of 2,256 facilitates a much quicker calculation.\n\nBleicher has designed a commercial program called \"Freezer,\" which allows users to build new tablebases from existing Nalimov tablebases with ''a priori'' information.  The program could produce a tablebase for positions with seven or more pieces with blocked pawns, even before tablebases for seven pieces became available.<ref>{{cite web | author=K.

A six-piece tablebase (KQQKQQ) was used to analyze the endgame that occurred in the correspondence game [[Kasparov versus The World]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=E. V. Nalimov |author2=C. Wirth |author3=G. McC. Haworth  | title=KQQKQQ and the Kasparov\u2013World Game | journal=ICGA Journal | volume=22 | issue=4 | pages=195\u2013212 | year=1999}}</ref>  Players have also used tablebases to analyze endgames from over-the-board play after the game is over.\n\nCompetitive players need to know that some tablebases ignore the [[fifty-move rule]]. According to that rule, if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move, either player may claim a draw.  [[FIDE]] changed the rules several times, starting in 1974, to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win. In 1988, FIDE allowed seventy-five moves for KBBKN, KNNKP, KQKBB, KQKNN, KRBKR, and KQPKQ with the pawn on the seventh rank, because tablebases had uncovered positions in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win. In 1992, FIDE canceled these exceptions and restored the fifty-move rule to its original standing.<ref name=\"haworthoptimisation\"/> Thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost, when it is in fact drawn by the fifty-move rule. In 2013, [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]] changed the rules for correspondence chess tournaments starting from 2014; a player may claim a win or draw based on six-man tablebases.<ref>[http://www.iccf.com/message?message=624 The introduction of table base claims] by Eric Ruch - [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]] President</ref> In this case the fifty-move rule is not applied, and the number of moves to mate is not taken into consideration.\n\nHaworth has designed a tablebase that produces results consistent with the fifty-move rule. However most tablebases search for the theoretical limits of forced mate, even if it requires several hundred moves.\n\n=== Computer chess ===\nThe knowledge contained in tablebases affords the computer a tremendous advantage in the endgame. Not only can computers play perfectly within an endgame, but they can simplify to a winning tablebase position from a more complicated endgame.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3314\n | author=Steven A.

Sometimes even this data is compressed and the bitbase reveals only whether a position is won or not, making no difference between a lost and a drawn game.<ref name=\"tay\" /> Shredderbases, for example, used by the [[Shredder (chess)|Shredder]] program, are a type of bitbase,<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Eiko+Bleicher\n | title=Profile of Eiko Bleicher, co-developer of shredderbase\n | accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> which fits all 3-, 4- and 5-piece bitbases in 157&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]].

The adverse effect could be a premature resignation, or an inferior line of play that loses with less resistance than a play without tablebase might offer.\n\nAnother drawback is that tablebases require a lot of [[computer memory|memory]] to store the many thousands of positions. The Nalimov tablebases, which use advanced [[Data compression|compression]] techniques, require 7.05&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of hard disk space for all 5-piece endings.

Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e., without suffering from the [[horizon effect]]). It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.\n\nSyzygy tablebases were developed by Ronald de Man, released in April 2013, in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search.  This variety consists of two tables per endgame: a smaller WDL (win/draw/loss) table which contains knowledge of the 50-move rule, and a larger DTZ table (distance to zero ply, i.e., pawn move or capture).  The WDL tables were designed to be small enough to fit on a [[solid-state drive]] for quick access during search, whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game-theoretically quickest distance to resetting the 50-move rule while retaining a winning position, instead of performing a search. Syzygy tablebases are available for all 6-piece endings, and are now supported by many top engines, including Komodo, Deep Fritz, Houdini, and Stockfish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Syzygy Bases|url=http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Syzygy+Bases|website=Chess Programming Wiki|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> Since August 2018, all<ref>{{cite web|title=7-piece Syzygy tablebases are complete|url=https://lichess.org/blog/W3WeMyQAACQAdfAL/7-piece-syzygy-tablebases-are-complete}}</ref> 7-piece Syzygy tables are also available.<ref>{{cite web|title=7-man Syzygy download|url=http://tablebase.lichess.ovh/tables/standard/7/}}</ref>\n\nCurrent status of the tablebases is summarized in the following table:<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://kirill-kryukov.com/chess/nulp/results.html\n | title=Number of Unique Legal Positions in chess endgames}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

For instance, the endgame with a queen and bishop versus two rooks was thought to be a draw, but tablebases proved it to be a win for the queen and bishop, so almost all studies based on this endgame are unsound.<ref>Nunn, pp. 367-68</ref>\n\nFor example, Erik Pogosyants composed the study at right, with White to play and win. His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! A tablebase discovered that 1. h4 also wins for White in 33 moves, even though Black can capture the pawn (which is not the best move \u2013 in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves, while Kh1-g2 loses in 32 moves). Incidentally, the tablebase does not recognize the composer's solution because it includes castling.<ref>{{cite web | author=Tim Krabb\u00e9 | work=Open chess diary | title=324. A cooked, correct study | date=2006-09-15 | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diarytxt.htm | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile tablebases have cooked some studies, they have assisted in the creation of other studies.  Composers can search tablebases for interesting positions, such as [[zugzwang]], using a method called [[Examples of data mining#Games|data mining]].  For all three- to five-piece endgames and pawnless six-piece endgames, a complete list of [[Zugzwang#Reciprocal zugzwang|mutual zugzwangs]] has been tabulated and published.<ref>{{cite journal | author=G.

In 2003, the endgame composer and expert [[John Roycroft]] summarized the debate:\n\n<blockquote>[N]ot only do opinions diverge widely, but they are frequently adhered to strongly, even vehemently: at one extreme is the view that since we can never be certain that a computer has been used it is pointless to attempt a distinction, so we should simply evaluate a 'study' on its content, without reference to its origins; at the other extreme is the view that using  a 'mouse' to lift an interesting position from a ready-made computer-generated list is in no sense composing, so we should outlaw every such position.<ref name=\"EG194editorial\">{{cite journal | author=A. J. Roycroft | title=Editorial | journal=EG | issue=149 | pages=51 | date=July 2003 | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg149.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-05-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080150/http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg149.pdf | archive-date=28 September 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRoycroft himself agrees with the latter approach.  He continues, \"One thing alone is clear to us: the distinction between classical composing and computer composing should be preserved for as long as possible: if there is a name associated with a study diagram that name is a claim of authorship.\"<ref name=\"EG194editorial\"/>\n\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| Harold van der Heijden, 2001\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |pl\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|kl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |kd|rd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to play and draw\n}}\n[[Mark Dvoretsky]], an [[International Master]], chess trainer, and author, took a more permissive stance.  He was commenting in 2006 on a study by [[Harold van der Heijden]], published in 2001, which reached the position at right after three introductory moves.  The drawing move for White is 4. Kb4!! (and not 4. Kb5), based on a mutual zugzwang that may occur three moves later.\n\nDvoretsky comments: <blockquote>Here, we should touch on one delicate question. I am sure that this unique endgame position was discovered with the help of Thompson\u2019s famous computer database. Is this a 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? <p> Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no doubt, we could probably extract yet more unique positions \u2013 there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.<ref>{{cite web | author=M.

The headline read, \"Play chess with God.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://plan9.bell-labs.com/who/ken/ | author=Ken Thompson | title=Play chess with God | date=2002-08-21 | accessdate=2007-03-25 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124092512/http://plan9.bell-labs.com/who/ken/ | archivedate=24 January 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nRegarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabb\u00e9 struck a similar note: <blockquote>A grandmaster wouldn't be better at these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess that has nothing to do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm \u2013 it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.<ref name=\"stillermonsters\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nOriginally, an endgame tablebase was called an \"endgame data base\" or \"endgame database\". This name appeared in both ''[[EG (chess)|EG]]'' and the ''[[ICCA Journal]]'' starting in the 1970s, and is sometimes used today. According to Haworth, the ''ICCA Journal'' first used the word \"tablebase\" in connection with chess endgames in 1995.<ref>{{cite journal\n | journal=EG\n | issue=137\n | year=1995\n | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg137.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=Tablebases and Tables\n | author=Guy Haworth\n | accessdate=2007-05-04\n | pages=151\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206235341/http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg137.pdf\n | archive-date=6 February 2012\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref> According to that source, a tablebase contains a complete set of information, but a database might lack some information.\n\nHaworth prefers the term \"Endgame Table\", and has used it in the articles he has authored.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/view/creators/90000763.html\n | publisher=The University of Reading\n | work=Information Systems at Reading\n | title=Publications for Mr Guy Haworth\n | accessdate=2009-06-20\n}}</ref> Roycroft has used the term \"oracle database\" throughout his magazine, ''EG''.<ref>For example, in {{cite journal\n | journal=EG\n | issue=135\n | pages=9\n | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg135.pdf\n | title=Proposal For The Guidance Of Tourney Organisers, Composers And Judges: 0.

tablebase''' is a computerized [[database]] that contains precalculated exhaustive analysis of  [[chess]] [[Chess endgame|endgame]] positions.  It is typically used by a computer chess engine during play, or by a human or computer that is retrospectively analysing a game that has already been played.\n\nThe tablebase contains the [[game theory|game-theoretical]] value (win, loss, or [[draw (chess)|draw]]) of each possible move in each possible position, and how many moves it would take to achieve that result with [[perfect play]]. Thus, the tablebase acts as an [[oracle machine|oracle]], always providing the optimal moves. Typically the database records each possible position with certain [[chess piece|pieces]] remaining on the board, and the best moves with [[White and Black in chess|White]] to move and with [[White and Black in chess|Black]] to move.\n\nTablebases are generated by [[retrograde analysis]], working backwards from a [[checkmate]]d position. By 2005, all chess positions with up to six pieces (including the two [[king (chess)|kings]]) had been solved. By August 2012, tablebases had solved chess for every position with up to seven pieces (the positions with a lone king versus a king and five pieces were omitted because they were considered to be \"rather obvious\").<ref>[https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Endgame+Tablebases#x7-man EGTBs Chessprogramming website]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lomonosov Endgame Tablebases|work=ChessOK|url=http://chessok.com/?page_id=27966}}</ref>\n\nThe solutions have profoundly advanced the chess community's understanding of [[Chess endgame#Effect of tablebases on endgame theory|endgame theory]].  Some positions which humans had analyzed as draws were proven to be winnable; the tablebase analysis could find a mate in more than five hundred moves, far beyond the [[horizon effect|horizon]] of humans, and beyond the capability of a computer during play. For this reason, they have also called into question the [[Fifty-move rule|50-move rule]] since many positions are now seen to exist that are a win for one side but would be drawn because of the 50-move rule. Tablebases have enhanced competitive play and facilitated the composition of [[endgame studies]]. They provide a powerful analytical tool.\n\nWhile endgame tablebases for other board games like [[checkers]],<ref>[http://edgilbert.org/Checkers/KingsRow.htm Website] of [[KingsRow]] about the creation of a tablebases for 8x8 and 10x10 checkers</ref> [[chess variant]]s<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114510/http://www.gothicchess.com/javascript_endings.html gothicchess.com]; examples of long endings for [[Capablanca chess]]</ref> or [[nine men's morris]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.msri.org/books/Book29/files/gasser.pdf|title=Solving nine men's morris|author=Ralpf Gasser|year=1996}}</ref> exist, when a game is not specified, it is assumed to be chess.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=tocleft}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Computer chess}}\nPhysical limitations of [[personal computer hardware|computer hardware]] aside, in principle it is possible to [[solved game|solve any game]] under the condition that the [[Perfect information|complete state is known]] and there is no [[Game of chance|random chance]].

[[Weak solution]]s exist for somewhat more complex games, such as [[English draughts|checkers]] (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and [[Go (game)|Go]], have not been solved because their [[game complexity]] is far too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.\n\n[[Computer chess]] is one of the oldest domains of [[artificial intelligence]], having begun in the early 1930s.  [[Claude Shannon]] proposed formal criteria for evaluating chess moves in 1949.  In 1951, [[Alan Turing]] designed a primitive chess playing program, which assigned values for material and [[mobility (chess)|mobility]]; the program \"played\" chess based on Turing's manual calculations.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 25-38</ref>  However, even as competent chess programs began to develop, they exhibited a glaring weakness in playing the endgame.  Programmers added specific [[heuristic]]s for the endgame \u2013 for example, the [[king (chess)|king]] should move to the center of the board.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 129-30</ref>  However, a more comprehensive solution was needed.\n\nIn 1965, [[Richard Bellman]] proposed the creation of a database to solve chess and [[checkers]] endgames using [[retrograde analysis]].<ref>Stiller, p. 84</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=R.

Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.\n\nIn 1970, Thomas Str\u00f6hlein published a doctoral thesis<ref>{{cite book | author=T.

Every position can be defined by its distance (i.e. the number of moves) from the desired endpoint.  Two metrics are generally used:\n* '''Depth to mate''' (DTM). A checkmate is the only way to win a game.\n* '''Depth to conversion''' (DTC). The stronger side can also win by capturing material, thus converting to a simpler endgame.  For example, in KQKR, conversion occurs when White captures the Black rook.\nHaworth has discussed two other metrics, namely \"depth to zeroing-move\" (DTZ) and \"depth by the rule\" (DTR). A zeroing-move is a move which resets the move count to zero under the fifty-move rule, i.e. mate, a capture, or a pawn move.<ref name=\"haworthoptimisation\">{{cite journal\n | author=G. McC.

How White should proceed depends on which metric is used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metric\n! Play\n! DTC\n! DTM\n|-\n| DTC\n| 1. Qxd1 Kc8 2. Qd2 Kb8 3. Qd8#\n| 1\n| 3\n|-\n| DTM\n| 1. Qc7+ Ka8 2. Qa7#\n| 2\n| 2\n|}\n\nAccording to the DTC metric, White should capture the rook because that leads immediately to a position which will certainly win (DTC = 1), but it will take two more moves actually to checkmate (DTM = 3). In contrast according to the DTM metric, White mates in two moves, so DTM = DTC = 2.\n\nThis difference is typical of many endgames. Usually DTC is smaller than DTM, but the DTM metric leads to the quickest checkmate. Exceptions occur where the weaker side has only a king, and in the unusual endgame of [[Two knights endgame#Troitsky line|two knights versus one pawn]]; then DTC = DTM because either there is no defending material to capture or capturing the material does no good. (Indeed, capturing the defending pawn in the latter endgame results in a draw, unless it results in immediate mate.)\n\n=== Step 1: Generating all possible positions ===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| David Levy, ''How Computers Play Chess''\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n| The ten unique squares (with symmetry)\n}}\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| The twenty four unique pawn squares (with symmetry)\n}}\nOnce a metric is chosen, the first step is to generate all the positions with a given material.  For example, to generate a DTM tablebase for the endgame of king and queen versus king (KQK), the computer must describe approximately 40,000 unique legal positions.\n\nLevy and Newborn explain that the number 40,000 derives from a [[symmetry]] argument.  The Black king can be placed on any of ten squares: a1, b1, c1, d1, b2, c2, d2, c3, d3, and d4 (see diagram).  On any other square, its position can be considered equivalent by symmetry of rotation or reflection.  Thus, there is no difference whether a Black king in a corner resides on a1, a8, h8, or h1.  Multiply this number of 10 by at most 60 (legal remaining) squares for placing the White king and then by at most 62 squares for the White queen.  The product 10\u00d760\u00d762 = 37,200.  Several hundred of these positions are illegal, impossible, or symmetrical reflections of each other, so the actual number is somewhat smaller.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 140-43</ref><ref>See also Stiller 1995:93-98.</ref>\n\nFor each position, the tablebase evaluates the situation separately for White-to-move and Black-to-move.  Assuming that White has the queen, almost all the positions are White wins, with checkmate forced in no more than ten moves.  Some positions are draws because of [[stalemate]] or the unavoidable loss of the queen.\n\nEach additional piece added to a [[pawnless chess endgame|pawnless endgame]] multiplies the number of unique positions by about a factor of sixty which is the approximate number of squares not already occupied by other pieces.\n\nEndgames with one or more pawns increase the complexity because the symmetry argument is reduced. Since pawns can move forward but not sideways, rotation and vertical reflection of the board produces a fundamental change in the nature of the position.<ref name=\"MullerEGTB\">{{cite web|title=EGTB generator|author=Muller, H.G.|url=http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/EGTB.html|accessdate=2009-05-03|quote=Pawns would break the front-back and diagonal symmetries, because they care about direction in their moves.}}</ref> The best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in the rectangle a2-a7-d7-d2.  All other pieces and pawns may be located in any of the 64 squares with respect to the pawn.  Thus, an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24/10 = 2.4 times a pawnless endgame with the same number of pieces.\n\n=== Step 2: Evaluating positions using retrograde analysis ===\n[[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] explains the process of generating a tablebase as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"The idea is that a database is made with all possible positions with a given material [note: as in the preceding section]. Then a subdatabase is made of all positions where Black is mated. Then one where White can give mate. Then one where Black cannot stop White giving mate next move. Then one where White can always reach a position where Black cannot stop him from giving mate next move. And so on, always a ply further away from mate until all positions that are thus connected to mate have been found. Then all of these positions are linked back to mate by the shortest path through the database. That means that, apart from 'equi-optimal' moves, all the moves in such a path are perfect: White's move always leads to the quickest mate, Black's move always leads to the slowest mate.\"<ref name=\"stillermonsters\">{{cite web | author=Tim Krabb\u00e9. | title=Stiller's Monsters or Perfection in Chess. | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess/perfect.htm | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[retrograde analysis]] is only necessary from the [[checkmate]]d positions, because every position that cannot be reached by moving backwards from a checkmated position must be a draw.<ref name=\"tay\">{{cite web\n | url=http://horizonchess.com/FAQ/Winboard/egtb.html\n | title=A guide to Endgames Tablebase\n | author=Aaron Tay\n | accessdate=2009-05-02\n}}</ref>\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the idea of retrograde analysis. White can force mate in two moves by playing 1. Kc6, leading to the position in Figure 2. There are only two legal moves for black from this position, both of which lead to checkmate: if 1...Kb8 2. Qb7#, and if 1...Kd8 2. Qd7# (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3, before White's second move, is defined as \"mate in one [[ply (game theory)|ply]].\" Figure 2, after White's first move, is \"mate in two ply,\" regardless of how Black plays. Finally, the initial position in Figure 1 is \"mate in three ply\" (i.e., two moves) because it leads directly to Figure 2, which is already defined as \"mate in two ply.\" This process, which links a current position to another position that could have existed one ply earlier, can continue indefinitely.\n\nEach position is evaluated as a win or loss in a certain number of moves. At the end of the retrograde analysis, positions which are not designated as wins or losses are necessarily draws.\n\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 1\n\n|  |  |kd|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to move: mate in three ply (Kc6)}}\n|}\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 2\n\n|  |  |kd|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |kl|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| Black to move: mate in two ply (Kd8 or Kb8)}}\n|}\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 3\n\n|  |  |  |kd|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |kl|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to move: mate in one ply (Qd7)}}\n|}\n{{-}}\n\n=== Step 3: Verification ===\nAfter the tablebase has been generated, and every position has been evaluated, the result must be verified independently.

If the evaluation of Figure 2 were anything else, it would be inconsistent with Figure 1, so the tablebase would need to be corrected.{{Clarify|reason=if there were a problem and position 1 were actually mate in a lesser number (in this case mate) this verification process would miss it.|date=May 2012}}\n\n=== Captures, pawn promotion, and special moves ===\nA four-piece tablebase must rely on three-piece tablebases that could result if one piece is captured. Similarly, a tablebase containing a pawn must be able to rely on other tablebases that deal with the new set of material after [[promotion (chess)|pawn promotion]] to a queen or other piece.  The retrograde analysis program must account for the possibility of a capture or pawn promotion on the previous move.<ref>Stiller, pp. 99-100</ref>\n\nTablebases assume that [[castling]] is not possible for two reasons.  First, in practical endgames, this assumption is almost always correct. (However, castling is allowed by convention in [[Chess problem|composed problems]] and [[Endgame study|studies]].) Second, if the king and rook are on their original squares, castling may or may not be allowed. Because of this ambiguity, it would be necessary to make separate evaluations for states in which castling is or is not possible.\n\nThe same ambiguity exists for the ''[[en passant]]'' capture, since the possibility of ''en passant'' depends on the opponent's previous move.  However, practical applications of ''en passant'' occur frequently in pawn endgames, so tablebases account for the possibility of ''en passant'' for positions where both sides have at least one pawn.\n\n=== Using ''a priori'' information ===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |kl\n|rl|  |  |  |bd|kd|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pd|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| An example of the KRP(a2)KBP(a3) endgame.

In some positions, it is possible to restrict the search space without affecting the result.  This saves computational resources and enables searches which would otherwise be impossible.\n\nAn early analysis of this type was published in 1987, in the endgame {{abbr|KRP(a2)KBP(a3)|a king, a rook and a pawn on a2 versus a king, a bishop and a pawn on a3}}, where the Black bishop moves on the dark squares (see example position at right).<ref>{{cite journal | author=H.

Reducing the search space by a factor of 2,256 facilitates a much quicker calculation.\n\nBleicher has designed a commercial program called \"Freezer,\" which allows users to build new tablebases from existing Nalimov tablebases with ''a priori'' information.  The program could produce a tablebase for positions with seven or more pieces with blocked pawns, even before tablebases for seven pieces became available.<ref>{{cite web | author=K.

According to that rule, if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move, either player may claim a draw.  [[FIDE]] changed the rules several times, starting in 1974, to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win. In 1988, FIDE allowed seventy-five moves for KBBKN, KNNKP, KQKBB, KQKNN, KRBKR, and KQPKQ with the pawn on the seventh rank, because tablebases had uncovered positions in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win. In 1992, FIDE canceled these exceptions and restored the fifty-move rule to its original standing.<ref name=\"haworthoptimisation\"/> Thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost, when it is in fact drawn by the fifty-move rule. In 2013, [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]] changed the rules for correspondence chess tournaments starting from 2014; a player may claim a win or draw based on six-man tablebases.<ref>[http://www.iccf.com/message?message=624 The introduction of table base claims] by Eric Ruch - [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]] President</ref> In this case the fifty-move rule is not applied, and the number of moves to mate is not taken into consideration.\n\nHaworth has designed a tablebase that produces results consistent with the fifty-move rule. However most tablebases search for the theoretical limits of forced mate, even if it requires several hundred moves.\n\n=== Computer chess ===\nThe knowledge contained in tablebases affords the computer a tremendous advantage in the endgame. Not only can computers play perfectly within an endgame, but they can simplify to a winning tablebase position from a more complicated endgame.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3314\n | author=Steven A.

Sometimes even this data is compressed and the bitbase reveals only whether a position is won or not, making no difference between a lost and a drawn game.<ref name=\"tay\" /> Shredderbases, for example, used by the [[Shredder (chess)|Shredder]] program, are a type of bitbase,<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Eiko+Bleicher\n | title=Profile of Eiko Bleicher, co-developer of shredderbase\n | accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> which fits all 3-, 4- and 5-piece bitbases in 157&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]].

The adverse effect could be a premature resignation, or an inferior line of play that loses with less resistance than a play without tablebase might offer.\n\nAnother drawback is that tablebases require a lot of [[computer memory|memory]] to store the many thousands of positions. The Nalimov tablebases, which use advanced [[Data compression|compression]] techniques, require 7.05&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of hard disk space for all 5-piece endings.

Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e., without suffering from the [[horizon effect]]). It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.\n\nSyzygy tablebases were developed by Ronald de Man, released in April 2013, in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search.  This variety consists of two tables per endgame: a smaller WDL (win/draw/loss) table which contains knowledge of the 50-move rule, and a larger DTZ table (distance to zero ply, i.e., pawn move or capture).  The WDL tables were designed to be small enough to fit on a [[solid-state drive]] for quick access during search, whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game-theoretically quickest distance to resetting the 50-move rule while retaining a winning position, instead of performing a search. Syzygy tablebases are available for all 6-piece endings, and are now supported by many top engines, including Komodo, Deep Fritz, Houdini, and Stockfish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Syzygy Bases|url=http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Syzygy+Bases|website=Chess Programming Wiki|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> Since August 2018, all<ref>{{cite web|title=7-piece Syzygy tablebases are complete|url=https://lichess.org/blog/W3WeMyQAACQAdfAL/7-piece-syzygy-tablebases-are-complete}}</ref> 7-piece Syzygy tables are also available.<ref>{{cite web|title=7-man Syzygy download|url=http://tablebase.lichess.ovh/tables/standard/7/}}</ref>\n\nCurrent status of the tablebases is summarized in the following table:<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://kirill-kryukov.com/chess/nulp/results.html\n | title=Number of Unique Legal Positions in chess endgames}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Some studies have been proved unsound by the tablebases.  That can be either because the composer's solution does not work, or else because there is an equally effective alternative that the composer did not consider.  Another way tablebases [[Glossary_of_chess_problems#cook|cook]] studies is a change in the evaluation of an endgame.

His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#!

In 2003, the endgame composer and expert [[John Roycroft]] summarized the debate:\n\n<blockquote>[N]ot only do opinions diverge widely, but they are frequently adhered to strongly, even vehemently: at one extreme is the view that since we can never be certain that a computer has been used it is pointless to attempt a distinction, so we should simply evaluate a 'study' on its content, without reference to its origins; at the other extreme is the view that using  a 'mouse' to lift an interesting position from a ready-made computer-generated list is in no sense composing, so we should outlaw every such position.<ref name=\"EG194editorial\">{{cite journal | author=A. J. Roycroft | title=Editorial | journal=EG | issue=149 | pages=51 | date=July 2003 | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg149.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-05-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080150/http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg149.pdf | archive-date=28 September 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRoycroft himself agrees with the latter approach.  He continues, \"One thing alone is clear to us: the distinction between classical composing and computer composing should be preserved for as long as possible: if there is a name associated with a study diagram that name is a claim of authorship.\"<ref name=\"EG194editorial\"/>\n\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| Harold van der Heijden, 2001\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |pl\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|kl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |kd|rd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to play and draw\n}}\n[[Mark Dvoretsky]], an [[International Master]], chess trainer, and author, took a more permissive stance.  He was commenting in 2006 on a study by [[Harold van der Heijden]], published in 2001, which reached the position at right after three introductory moves.  The drawing move for White is 4. Kb4!! (and not 4. Kb5), based on a mutual zugzwang that may occur three moves later.\n\nDvoretsky comments: <blockquote>Here, we should touch on one delicate question. I am sure that this unique endgame position was discovered with the help of Thompson\u2019s famous computer database. Is this a 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? <p> Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no doubt, we could probably extract yet more unique positions \u2013 there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.<ref>{{cite web | author=M.

The headline read, \"Play chess with God.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://plan9.bell-labs.com/who/ken/ | author=Ken Thompson | title=Play chess with God | date=2002-08-21 | accessdate=2007-03-25 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124092512/http://plan9.bell-labs.com/who/ken/ | archivedate=24 January 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nRegarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabb\u00e9 struck a similar note: <blockquote>A grandmaster wouldn't be better at these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess that has nothing to do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm \u2013 it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.<ref name=\"stillermonsters\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nOriginally, an endgame tablebase was called an \"endgame data base\" or \"endgame database\". This name appeared in both ''[[EG (chess)|EG]]'' and the ''[[ICCA Journal]]'' starting in the 1970s, and is sometimes used today. According to Haworth, the ''ICCA Journal'' first used the word \"tablebase\" in connection with chess endgames in 1995.<ref>{{cite journal\n | journal=EG\n | issue=137\n | year=1995\n | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg137.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=Tablebases and Tables\n | author=Guy Haworth\n | accessdate=2007-05-04\n | pages=151\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206235341/http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg137.pdf\n | archive-date=6 February 2012\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref> According to that source, a tablebase contains a complete set of information, but a database might lack some information.\n\nHaworth prefers the term \"Endgame Table\", and has used it in the articles he has authored.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/view/creators/90000763.html\n | publisher=The University of Reading\n | work=Information Systems at Reading\n | title=Publications for Mr Guy Haworth\n | accessdate=2009-06-20\n}}</ref> Roycroft has used the term \"oracle database\" throughout his magazine, ''EG''.<ref>For example, in {{cite journal\n | journal=EG\n | issue=135\n | pages=9\n | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg135.pdf\n | title=Proposal For The Guidance Of Tourney Organisers, Composers And Judges: 0.
