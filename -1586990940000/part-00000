Russell and Szlumper were two of the proposers of the [[Vale of Rheidol Railway|Vale of Rheidol Light Railway]] from Aberystwyth to Devil's Bridge (originally proposed by the Manchester & Milford Railway), although Russell resigned from the VofR project in its infancy in 1899.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nSzlumper later worked on project in the [[Montgomeryshire]]; the South Wales Valleys including the [[Barry Railway]], the [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Pethick and Vale of Glamorgan Railway]] and the [[Pontypridd Caerphilly and Newport Railway]]; and [[Devon]] including the Plymouth, Devonport and South-Western Junction Railway, and the [[Lynton and Barnstaple Railway]].\n\n====West Wales railways====\nOn 31 December 1868, Szlumper was appointed Chief Engineer of the [[Whitland and Cardigan Railway|Whitland & Taf Vale Railway]] (W&TVR), having been recommended by business partner and Member of Parliament [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]]. The W&TVR was closely aligned to the [[Pembroke and Tenby Railway]] (P&TR), having a virtually common set of investors and board of directors. The P&TR also had close links to the Manchester and Milford Railway (M&MR), which ran over the Szlumper engineered metals of the [[Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway]] (C&CR) to connect to [[Carmarthen railway station|Carmarthen station]]\n\nThe W&TVR was driven by John Owen, the proprietor of some [[slate]] quarries near [[Glogue]], and Szlumper agreed to see the construction of the railway for \u00a350 per mile and \u00a315 per mile for out of pocket expenses, and to deal with the preparation of all plans and sections for the necessary Parliamentary Bill. By 1868, Szlumper was engineer to the C&CR, M&MR, P&TR and the W&TVR.\n\nAfter an accident with a through [[LNWR]] train to Tenby, Szlumper rebuilt the stations at Tenby and Pembroke, and extended the P&TR further into Pembroke Dock, to allow larger trains to access the line from 3 August 1870. The M&MR promoted the benefits of the P&TR to access Pembroke Dock to its customers in the Midlands, but the relationship only prospered for three years after the P&TR ceased working east of [[Whitland railway station|Whitland station]] over the Great Western metals, from 31 July 1872.\n\nThe board of the P&TR realised they needed to gain economies of scale, and so appointed the largest M&MR shareholder J.J.Barrow to their board on 31 August 1871. Barrow needed the stable income and docks of the P&TR as his own M&MR was suffering financially through lack of traffic from the Midlands to Wales. Barrow appointed A.C.Sheriff to the board of the P&TR in May 1872, the former Traffic Manager of the [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]]. Further developments had to wait until the formation of the P&TR and M&MR Joint Committee in 1879; but by this point the M&MR was totally insolvent and the GWR had developed its strength in West Wales.\n\nOn 24 March 1873 the W&TR opened to Glogue, and by October 1874 to [[Crymmych|Crymmych Arms]]. During the period 1859 to 1876, the P&TR had seen three different chairmen, two secretaries and three engineers. Due to the insolvency of the M&MR, in June 1879 the board joint board of company to investigate the costs of the railway. Szlumper was paid a salary of \u00a3150 per annum by the M&MR, and \u00a380 for the P&TR. The board felt Szlumper had not fulfilled his duties properly, particularly after incorrectly engineering the M&MR junction at [[Pencader, Carmarthenshire|Pencader]] which was investigated by the [[Railway Inspectorate]], and he was replaced by Lionel R. Woods formerly of the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] in December 1879.\n\nThe W&TVR extension to [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] was completed on 31 August 1886, after the GWR had taken over the joint companies in 1881.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/c/cardigan/index.shtml| website=Subterranea Britannica| title=SB-Sites: Cardigan Station}}</ref>\n\n===Public life===\nSzlumper was elected as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] member of [[Cardiganshire County Council]] at a by-election in 1892 but did not seek re-election in 1895.

When he took the job of Surveyor to the county of Cardiganshire, he also held the role of deputy engineer of the [[Manchester and Milford Railway]], which never reached either of the locations in its title, being restricted to a line between [[Strata Florida]] and [[Pencader, Carmarthenshire]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web| url=http://www.croesor.org.uk/Tramway/russell.htm| title=James Cholmeley Russell (1841\u20131912)| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007202137/http://www.croesor.org.uk/Tramway/russell.htm |archivedate=7 October 2007 }}</ref> However, he became good friends with the line's manager [[James Cholmeley Russell]], and resultantly later became civil engineer to the [[North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways]] and in 1906 became a director. Russell and Szlumper were two of the proposers of the [[Vale of Rheidol Railway|Vale of Rheidol Light Railway]] from Aberystwyth to Devil's Bridge (originally proposed by the Manchester & Milford Railway), although Russell resigned from the VofR project in its infancy in 1899.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nSzlumper later worked on project in the [[Montgomeryshire]]; the South Wales Valleys including the [[Barry Railway]], the [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Pethick and Vale of Glamorgan Railway]] and the [[Pontypridd Caerphilly and Newport Railway]]; and [[Devon]] including the Plymouth, Devonport and South-Western Junction Railway, and the [[Lynton and Barnstaple Railway]].\n\n====West Wales railways====\nOn 31 December 1868, Szlumper was appointed Chief Engineer of the [[Whitland and Cardigan Railway|Whitland & Taf Vale Railway]] (W&TVR), having been recommended by business partner and Member of Parliament [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]]. The W&TVR was closely aligned to the [[Pembroke and Tenby Railway]] (P&TR), having a virtually common set of investors and board of directors. The P&TR also had close links to the Manchester and Milford Railway (M&MR), which ran over the Szlumper engineered metals of the [[Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway]] (C&CR) to connect to [[Carmarthen railway station|Carmarthen station]]\n\nThe W&TVR was driven by John Owen, the proprietor of some [[slate]] quarries near [[Glogue]], and Szlumper agreed to see the construction of the railway for \u00a350 per mile and \u00a315 per mile for out of pocket expenses, and to deal with the preparation of all plans and sections for the necessary Parliamentary Bill. By 1868, Szlumper was engineer to the C&CR, M&MR, P&TR and the W&TVR.\n\nAfter an accident with a through [[LNWR]] train to Tenby, Szlumper rebuilt the stations at Tenby and Pembroke, and extended the P&TR further into Pembroke Dock, to allow larger trains to access the line from 3 August 1870. The M&MR promoted the benefits of the P&TR to access Pembroke Dock to its customers in the Midlands, but the relationship only prospered for three years after the P&TR ceased working east of [[Whitland railway station|Whitland station]] over the Great Western metals, from 31 July 1872.\n\nThe board of the P&TR realised they needed to gain economies of scale, and so appointed the largest M&MR shareholder J.J.Barrow to their board on 31 August 1871. Barrow needed the stable income and docks of the P&TR as his own M&MR was suffering financially through lack of traffic from the Midlands to Wales. Barrow appointed A.C.Sheriff to the board of the P&TR in May 1872, the former Traffic Manager of the [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]]. Further developments had to wait until the formation of the P&TR and M&MR Joint Committee in 1879; but by this point the M&MR was totally insolvent and the GWR had developed its strength in West Wales.\n\nOn 24 March 1873 the W&TR opened to Glogue, and by October 1874 to [[Crymmych|Crymmych Arms]]. During the period 1859 to 1876, the P&TR had seen three different chairmen, two secretaries and three engineers. Due to the insolvency of the M&MR, in June 1879 the board joint board of company to investigate the costs of the railway. Szlumper was paid a salary of \u00a3150 per annum by the M&MR, and \u00a380 for the P&TR. The board felt Szlumper had not fulfilled his duties properly, particularly after incorrectly engineering the M&MR junction at [[Pencader, Carmarthenshire|Pencader]] which was investigated by the [[Railway Inspectorate]], and he was replaced by Lionel R. Woods formerly of the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] in December 1879.\n\nThe W&TVR extension to [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] was completed on 31 August 1886, after the GWR had taken over the joint companies in 1881.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/c/cardigan/index.shtml| website=Subterranea Britannica| title=SB-Sites: Cardigan Station}}</ref>\n\n===Public life===\nSzlumper was elected as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] member of [[Cardiganshire County Council]] at a by-election in 1892 but did not seek re-election in 1895. Having served as a [[Justice of the Peace]], in 1898 Szlumper became [[High Sheriff of Cardiganshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/CGN/Sheriffs.html | first=S.R.| last=Meyrick| title=GENUKI: Sheriffs of the County of Cardigan|work= The History of Cardiganshire |date= 2000 |accessdate=19 September 2013| publisher= Stephen Collard}}</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\nSzlumper married Mary Culliford in 1867 and had one son and two daughters.
