This idea would require him to establish a factory and an aerodrome close to the city. A real estate office in Sydney told him of some land owned by the Kensington Race Club that was being kept as a hedge against its losing its government-owned site at [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]]. It had been used by a local abattoir which was closing down, to graze sheep and cattle. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} This land appealed to Love as the surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass. The grass had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle that it required little to make it serviceable for aircraft. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In addition, the approaches on all four sides had no obstructions, it was bounded by a racecourse, gardens, a river and [[Botany Bay]].\n\nLove established Mascot as a private concern, leasing {{Convert|200|acre|ha|sigfig=1|order=flip}} from the Kensington Race Club for three years. It initially had a small canvas structure but was later equipped with an imported Richards hangar. The first flight from Mascot was on November 1919 when Love carried freelance movie photographer Billy Marshall up in an Avro. The official opening flight took place on 9 January 1920, also performed by Love.<ref>{{cite news |date=9 January 1920 |title=Aerial joy riding.

In 1923, when Love's three-year lease expired, the Mascot land was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth Government from the racing club.<ref name=\"Bullock\"/> The first regular flights began in 1924.\n\n===1930\u20131960===\nIn 1933 the first gravel runways were built.

When Mascot was declared an [[aerodrome]] in 1920 it was known as Sydney Airport. On 14 August 1936 the airport was renamed Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport<ref>''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 9 August 1938 p.12</ref> in honour of pioneering Australian aviator [[Charles Kingsford Smith|Sir Charles Kingsford Smith]]. Up to the early 1960s the majority of Sydney-siders referred to the airport as Mascot. The first paved runway was 07/25 and the next one constructed was 16/34 (now 16R/34L), extended into Botany Bay, starting in 1959, to accommodate jet aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Runway 07/25 is used mainly by lighter aircraft, but is used by all aircraft including Airbus A380s when conditions require. Runway 16R/34L is presently the longest operational runway in Australia, with a paved length of {{Convert|14300|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{Convert|12850|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} between the zebra thresholds.\n\n===Modern history===\nBy the 1960s, the need for a new international terminal had become apparent, and work commenced in late 1966. Much of the new terminal was designed by Paynter and Dixon Industries.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paynter and Dixon|newspaper=The Sun Herald|date=26 April 1970|page=57}}</ref> The plans for the design are held by the [[State Library of New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|title=George Surtees architectural and design drawings, ca. 1950's-1989|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemdetailpaged.aspx?itemid=457408|work=Skip Navigation LinksManuscripts, Oral History and Pictures Search|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe new terminal was officially opened on 3 May 1970, by HM [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The first [[Boeing 747]] \"Jumbo Jet\" at the airport, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American's]] ''Clipper Flying Cloud'' (N734PA), arrived on 4 October 1970. The east-west runway was then {{convert|8300|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long;<ref>''Aviation Daily'' 27 July 1971</ref> in the 1970s the north-south runway was expanded to become one of the longest runways in the [[southern hemisphere]]. The international terminal was expanded in 1992 {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} and has undergone several refurbishments since then, including one that was completed in early 2000 in order to re-invent the airport in time for the [[2000 Olympic Games]] held in Sydney. The airport additionally underwent another project development that began in 2010 to extend the transit zone which brought new duty free facilities, shops & leisure areas for passengers. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe limitations of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent and governments grappled with Sydney's airport capacity for decades; eventually the controversial decision to build a third runway was made. The third runway was parallel to the existing runway 16/34, entirely on reclaimed land from [[Botany Bay]]. A [[Second Sydney Airport|proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney]] was shelved in 2004, before being re-examined in 2009\u20132012 showing that Kingsford Smith airport will not be able to cope by 2030.\n\n====Curfew====\nThe \"third runway\", which the Commonwealth government commenced development of in 1989 and completed in 1994, remained controversial because of increased aircraft movements, especially over many inner suburbs. In 1995 [[No Aircraft Noise]] was formed to contest the [[1995 New South Wales state election]].  The party did not win a seat in parliament, but came close in the electorate of [[Electoral district of Marrickville|Marrickville]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1995 Election (various)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/archive/|website=Antony Green's Electoral Publication Archive|publisher=ABC Australia|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref> It also contested the [[1996 Australian federal election]].\n\nIn 1995, the Australian Parliament passed the ''Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995'', which [[night flying restrictions|limits the operating hours of the airport]]. This was done in an effort to curb complaints about aircraft noise. The curfew prevents aircraft from taking off or landing between the hours of 11&nbsp;pm and 6&nbsp;am. A limited number of scheduled and approved take-offs and landings are permitted respectively in the \"shoulder periods\" of 11&nbsp;pm to midnight and 5&nbsp;am to 6&nbsp;am. The Act does not stop all aircraft movements overnight, but limits movements by restricting the types of aircraft that can operate, the runways they can use and the number of flights allowed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/aviation/environmental/pdf/airport_curfews_general_information_fact_sheet.pdf |title=Airport Curfews&nbsp;\u2013 General Information |access-date=27 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101144511/http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/aviation/environmental/pdf/airport_curfews_general_information_fact_sheet.pdf |archive-date=1 November 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> During extreme weather, flights are often delayed and it is often the case that people on late flights are unable to travel on a given day. {{as of|2009}}, fines for violating curfew have been levied against four airlines, with a maximum fine of A$550,000 applicable.<ref>{{cite news|last=Creedy|first=Steve|title=Jetstar fined for airport curfew breach|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507162427/http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,28318,25436950-5014090,00.html|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=31 May 2009|work=news.com.au|publisher=News Limited}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the curfew, Sydney Airport also has a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour which cannot be exceeded, leading to increased delays during peak hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airservicesaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/Movement_Cap_Report_Sydney_December_Quarter_2010.pdf |title=Sydney Airport Runway Movement Cap Report for December quarter 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn 2002, the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] sold Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (later renamed [[Sydney Airport Corporation Limited]], SACL), the management authority for the airport, to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd. 82.93 per cent of SACL is owned by MAp Airports International Limited, a subsidiary of [[Macquarie Bank]], Sydney Airport Intervest GmbH own 12.11 per cent and Ontario Teachers' Australia Trust own 4.96 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Ownership.html |title=Ownership |publisher=Sydneyairport.com.au |access-date=26 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003235057/http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Ownership.html |archive-date=3 October 2011 }}</ref> SACL holds a 99-year lease on the airport which remains [[Crown land]] and as such is categorised as a Leased Federal Airport.<ref>[http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/aviation/airport/index.aspx Leased Federal Airports, Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development] (accessed 4 September 2014)</ref>\n\nSince the international terminal's original completion, it has undergone two large expansions.

The International Terminal is separated from the other two by a runway; therefore, connecting passengers need to allow for longer transfer times.\n\n===Terminal 1===\nTerminal 1 was opened on 3 May 1970, replacing the old Overseas Passenger Terminal (which was located where Terminal 3 stands now) and has been greatly expanded since then. Today it is known as the International Terminal, located in the airport's north western sector. It has 25 gates (thirteen in concourse B numbered 8\u201337, and twelve in concourse C numbered 50\u201363) served by aerobridges. Pier B is used by [[Qantas]], all [[Oneworld]] members and all [[Skyteam]] members (except Delta). Pier C is used by [[Virgin Australia]] and its partners (including Delta) as well as all [[Star Alliance]] members.  There are also a number of remote bays which are heavily utilised during peak periods and for parking of idle aircraft during the day.\n\nThe terminal building is split into three levels, one each for arrivals, departures and airline offices. The departure level has 20 rows of check-in desks each with 10 single desks making a total of 200 check-in desks. The terminal hosts eight [[Airport lounge|airline lounges]]: two for Qantas, and one each for [[Etihad Airways]], [[Air New Zealand]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[American Express]] and [[SkyTeam]]. The terminal underwent a major $500&nbsp;million redevelopment that was completed in 2010, by which the shopping complex was expanded, outbound customs operations were centralised and the floor space of the terminal increased to {{convert|254000|m2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Master-Plan.html |title=Master Plan 2039 |publisher=Sydneyairport.com.au |access-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003235202/http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Master-Plan.html |archive-date=3 October 2011 }}</ref> Further renovations began in 2015 with a reconfiguration and decluttering of outbound and inbound duty-free areas, extension of the airside dining areas and installation of [[Australian Border Force]] outbound immigration [[SmartGate]]s.

It features 16 parking bays served by aerobridges and several remote bays for regional aircraft. It serves [[FlyPelican]], [[Jetstar]], [[Regional Express Airlines]], [[Tigerair Australia]] and [[Virgin Australia]]. There are lounges for Regional Express Airlines and Virgin Australia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Terminal 3===\nTerminal 3 is a domestic terminal, serving Qantas with QantasLink flights having moved their operations from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 on 16 August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nickell |first=Alena |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1709818/terminal-take-off-for-country-passengers/?cs=2452 |title=Terminal take off for country passengers &#124; St George & Sutherland Shire Leader |publisher=Theleader.com.au |date=16 August 2013|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=QantasLink Terminal Change|publisher=[[Qantas]]|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/qantaslink-terminal-change/global/en|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> Originally, it was home for [[Trans Australia Airlines]] (later named Australian Airlines). Like Terminal 2 it is located in the north-eastern section.\n\nThe current terminal building is largely the result of extensions designed by [[Hassell (architecture firm)|Hassell]] that were completed in 1999. This included construction of a 60-metre roof span above a new column-free checkin hall and resulted in extending the terminal footprint to 80,000 square metres.<ref name=\"Architravel\">{{cite web|title=Qantas Domestic Terminal|url=http://www.architravel.com/architravel/building/qantas-domestic-terminal/|website=Architravel|publisher=Achitravel|accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref> There are 14 parking bays served by aerobridges, including two served by dual aerobridges. Terminal 3 features a large [[Qantas Club]] lounge, along with a dedicated [[Business Class]] and Chairmans lounge. Terminal 3 also has a 'Heritage Collection' located adjacent to gate 13, dedicated to [[Qantas]] and including many collections from the airline's 90-plus years of service. It also has a view of the airport's apron and is used commonly by [[aircraft spotting|plane-spotters]].\n\nQantas sold its lease of Terminal 3, which was due to continue until 2019, back to Sydney Airport for $535 million. This means Sydney Airport resumes operational responsibility of the terminal, including the lucrative retail areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-sells-sydney-airport-terminal-lease-for-535-million|first=David|last=Flynn|work=Australian Business Traveller|date=18 August 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015|title=Qantas sells Sydney Airport terminal lease for $535 million}}</ref>\n\n===Freight Terminals===\nThe airport is a major hub for freight transport to and from Australia handling approx. 45 percent of the national cargo traffic.

The DC-8 crew misinterpreted instructions on which exit to use after landing and backtracked along the runway instead of turning off it onto a taxiway; and the tower controller cleared the 727 for take-off in the mistaken belief that the runway was clear. The 727 crew saw the DC-8 during the take-off roll then proceeded with the take-off rather than take evasive measures. The 727 was damaged in the inboard right wing and the fuselage and lost pressure in one of its hydraulic systems but managed to return and land safely; a building on the ground was struck by parts of the 727's starboard landing gear doors that fell off as it approached to land. The upper eight-and-a-half feet (about 2.6m) of the DC-8's tail fin and a corresponding proportion of the rudder were torn off.<ref>{{cite web |author=Air Safety Investigation Branch |url=http://www.atsb.gov.au/media/24753/197101202.pdf |work=Accident Investigation Report |title=Canadian Pacific Airlines DC8-63 aircraft CF-CPQ and Trans-Australia Airlines Boeing 727 aircraft VH-TJA at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport New South Wales on 29 January, 1971 |date=August 1971 |publisher=Department of Civil Aviation |accessdate=22 April 2014 }}</ref>\n* On 21 February 1980, a [[Beechcraft Super King Air]] registered VH-AAV and operating [[Advance Airlines Flight 4210]] took off from Sydney Airport and suffered an engine failure.

This idea would require him to establish a factory and an aerodrome close to the city. A real estate office in Sydney told him of some land owned by the Kensington Race Club that was being kept as a hedge against its losing its government-owned site at [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]]. It had been used by a local abattoir which was closing down, to graze sheep and cattle. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} This land appealed to Love as the surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass. The grass had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle that it required little to make it serviceable for aircraft. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In addition, the approaches on all four sides had no obstructions, it was bounded by a racecourse, gardens, a river and [[Botany Bay]].\n\nLove established Mascot as a private concern, leasing {{Convert|200|acre|ha|sigfig=1|order=flip}} from the Kensington Race Club for three years. It initially had a small canvas structure but was later equipped with an imported Richards hangar. The first flight from Mascot was on November 1919 when Love carried freelance movie photographer Billy Marshall up in an Avro. The official opening flight took place on 9 January 1920, also performed by Love.<ref>{{cite news |date=9 January 1920 |title=Aerial joy riding.

In 1923, when Love's three-year lease expired, the Mascot land was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth Government from the racing club.<ref name=\"Bullock\"/> The first regular flights began in 1924.\n\n===1930\u20131960===\nIn 1933 the first gravel runways were built.

When Mascot was declared an [[aerodrome]] in 1920 it was known as Sydney Airport. On 14 August 1936 the airport was renamed Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport<ref>''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 9 August 1938 p.12</ref> in honour of pioneering Australian aviator [[Charles Kingsford Smith|Sir Charles Kingsford Smith]]. Up to the early 1960s the majority of Sydney-siders referred to the airport as Mascot. The first paved runway was 07/25 and the next one constructed was 16/34 (now 16R/34L), extended into Botany Bay, starting in 1959, to accommodate jet aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Runway 07/25 is used mainly by lighter aircraft, but is used by all aircraft including Airbus A380s when conditions require. Runway 16R/34L is presently the longest operational runway in Australia, with a paved length of {{Convert|14300|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{Convert|12850|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} between the zebra thresholds.\n\n===Modern history===\nBy the 1960s, the need for a new international terminal had become apparent, and work commenced in late 1966. Much of the new terminal was designed by Paynter and Dixon Industries.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paynter and Dixon|newspaper=The Sun Herald|date=26 April 1970|page=57}}</ref> The plans for the design are held by the [[State Library of New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|title=George Surtees architectural and design drawings, ca. 1950's-1989|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemdetailpaged.aspx?itemid=457408|work=Skip Navigation LinksManuscripts, Oral History and Pictures Search|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe new terminal was officially opened on 3 May 1970, by HM [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The first [[Boeing 747]] \"Jumbo Jet\" at the airport, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American's]] ''Clipper Flying Cloud'' (N734PA), arrived on 4 October 1970. The east-west runway was then {{convert|8300|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long;<ref>''Aviation Daily'' 27 July 1971</ref> in the 1970s the north-south runway was expanded to become one of the longest runways in the [[southern hemisphere]]. The international terminal was expanded in 1992 {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} and has undergone several refurbishments since then, including one that was completed in early 2000 in order to re-invent the airport in time for the [[2000 Olympic Games]] held in Sydney. The airport additionally underwent another project development that began in 2010 to extend the transit zone which brought new duty free facilities, shops & leisure areas for passengers. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe limitations of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent and governments grappled with Sydney's airport capacity for decades; eventually the controversial decision to build a third runway was made. The third runway was parallel to the existing runway 16/34, entirely on reclaimed land from [[Botany Bay]]. A [[Second Sydney Airport|proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney]] was shelved in 2004, before being re-examined in 2009\u20132012 showing that Kingsford Smith airport will not be able to cope by 2030.\n\n====Curfew====\nThe \"third runway\", which the Commonwealth government commenced development of in 1989 and completed in 1994, remained controversial because of increased aircraft movements, especially over many inner suburbs. In 1995 [[No Aircraft Noise]] was formed to contest the [[1995 New South Wales state election]].  The party did not win a seat in parliament, but came close in the electorate of [[Electoral district of Marrickville|Marrickville]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1995 Election (various)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/archive/|website=Antony Green's Electoral Publication Archive|publisher=ABC Australia|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref> It also contested the [[1996 Australian federal election]].\n\nIn 1995, the Australian Parliament passed the ''Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995'', which [[night flying restrictions|limits the operating hours of the airport]]. This was done in an effort to curb complaints about aircraft noise. The curfew prevents aircraft from taking off or landing between the hours of 11&nbsp;pm and 6&nbsp;am. A limited number of scheduled and approved take-offs and landings are permitted respectively in the \"shoulder periods\" of 11&nbsp;pm to midnight and 5&nbsp;am to 6&nbsp;am. The Act does not stop all aircraft movements overnight, but limits movements by restricting the types of aircraft that can operate, the runways they can use and the number of flights allowed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/aviation/environmental/pdf/airport_curfews_general_information_fact_sheet.pdf |title=Airport Curfews&nbsp;\u2013 General Information |access-date=27 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101144511/http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/aviation/environmental/pdf/airport_curfews_general_information_fact_sheet.pdf |archive-date=1 November 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> During extreme weather, flights are often delayed and it is often the case that people on late flights are unable to travel on a given day. {{as of|2009}}, fines for violating curfew have been levied against four airlines, with a maximum fine of A$550,000 applicable.<ref>{{cite news|last=Creedy|first=Steve|title=Jetstar fined for airport curfew breach|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507162427/http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,28318,25436950-5014090,00.html|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=31 May 2009|work=news.com.au|publisher=News Limited}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the curfew, Sydney Airport also has a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour which cannot be exceeded, leading to increased delays during peak hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airservicesaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/Movement_Cap_Report_Sydney_December_Quarter_2010.pdf |title=Sydney Airport Runway Movement Cap Report for December quarter 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn 2002, the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] sold Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (later renamed [[Sydney Airport Corporation Limited]], SACL), the management authority for the airport, to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd. 82.93 per cent of SACL is owned by MAp Airports International Limited, a subsidiary of [[Macquarie Bank]], Sydney Airport Intervest GmbH own 12.11 per cent and Ontario Teachers' Australia Trust own 4.96 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Ownership.html |title=Ownership |publisher=Sydneyairport.com.au |access-date=26 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003235057/http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Ownership.html |archive-date=3 October 2011 }}</ref> SACL holds a 99-year lease on the airport which remains [[Crown land]] and as such is categorised as a Leased Federal Airport.<ref>[http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/aviation/airport/index.aspx Leased Federal Airports, Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development] (accessed 4 September 2014)</ref>\n\nSince the international terminal's original completion, it has undergone two large expansions.

The report noted Sydney Airport recorded the highest average prices at $13.63 per passenger, compared to the lowest of $7.96 at Melbourne Airport, while the price of short-term parking had almost doubled in the 2008\u201309 financial year, from $28 to $50 for four hours.

The International Terminal is separated from the other two by a runway; therefore, connecting passengers need to allow for longer transfer times.\n\n===Terminal 1===\nTerminal 1 was opened on 3 May 1970, replacing the old Overseas Passenger Terminal (which was located where Terminal 3 stands now) and has been greatly expanded since then. Today it is known as the International Terminal, located in the airport's north western sector. It has 25 gates (thirteen in concourse B numbered 8\u201337, and twelve in concourse C numbered 50\u201363) served by aerobridges. Pier B is used by [[Qantas]], all [[Oneworld]] members and all [[Skyteam]] members (except Delta). Pier C is used by [[Virgin Australia]] and its partners (including Delta) as well as all [[Star Alliance]] members.  There are also a number of remote bays which are heavily utilised during peak periods and for parking of idle aircraft during the day.\n\nThe terminal building is split into three levels, one each for arrivals, departures and airline offices. The departure level has 20 rows of check-in desks each with 10 single desks making a total of 200 check-in desks. The terminal hosts eight [[Airport lounge|airline lounges]]: two for Qantas, and one each for [[Etihad Airways]], [[Air New Zealand]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[American Express]] and [[SkyTeam]]. The terminal underwent a major $500&nbsp;million redevelopment that was completed in 2010, by which the shopping complex was expanded, outbound customs operations were centralised and the floor space of the terminal increased to {{convert|254000|m2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Master-Plan.html |title=Master Plan 2039 |publisher=Sydneyairport.com.au |access-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003235202/http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Master-Plan.html |archive-date=3 October 2011 }}</ref> Further renovations began in 2015 with a reconfiguration and decluttering of outbound and inbound duty-free areas, extension of the airside dining areas and installation of [[Australian Border Force]] outbound immigration [[SmartGate]]s.

It features 16 parking bays served by aerobridges and several remote bays for regional aircraft. It serves [[FlyPelican]], [[Jetstar]], [[Regional Express Airlines]], [[Tigerair Australia]] and [[Virgin Australia]]. There are lounges for Regional Express Airlines and Virgin Australia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Terminal 3===\nTerminal 3 is a domestic terminal, serving Qantas with QantasLink flights having moved their operations from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 on 16 August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nickell |first=Alena |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1709818/terminal-take-off-for-country-passengers/?cs=2452 |title=Terminal take off for country passengers &#124; St George & Sutherland Shire Leader |publisher=Theleader.com.au |date=16 August 2013|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=QantasLink Terminal Change|publisher=[[Qantas]]|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/qantaslink-terminal-change/global/en|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> Originally, it was home for [[Trans Australia Airlines]] (later named Australian Airlines). Like Terminal 2 it is located in the north-eastern section.\n\nThe current terminal building is largely the result of extensions designed by [[Hassell (architecture firm)|Hassell]] that were completed in 1999. This included construction of a 60-metre roof span above a new column-free checkin hall and resulted in extending the terminal footprint to 80,000 square metres.<ref name=\"Architravel\">{{cite web|title=Qantas Domestic Terminal|url=http://www.architravel.com/architravel/building/qantas-domestic-terminal/|website=Architravel|publisher=Achitravel|accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref> There are 14 parking bays served by aerobridges, including two served by dual aerobridges. Terminal 3 features a large [[Qantas Club]] lounge, along with a dedicated [[Business Class]] and Chairmans lounge. Terminal 3 also has a 'Heritage Collection' located adjacent to gate 13, dedicated to [[Qantas]] and including many collections from the airline's 90-plus years of service. It also has a view of the airport's apron and is used commonly by [[aircraft spotting|plane-spotters]].\n\nQantas sold its lease of Terminal 3, which was due to continue until 2019, back to Sydney Airport for $535 million. This means Sydney Airport resumes operational responsibility of the terminal, including the lucrative retail areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-sells-sydney-airport-terminal-lease-for-535-million|first=David|last=Flynn|work=Australian Business Traveller|date=18 August 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015|title=Qantas sells Sydney Airport terminal lease for $535 million}}</ref>\n\n===Freight Terminals===\nThe airport is a major hub for freight transport to and from Australia handling approx. 45 percent of the national cargo traffic.

In particular, blade 14 of number 2 engine (the inboard engine on the left wing) was damaged by a single bird carcass and lost power before the decision to abandon the take-off (which occurred at or near [[V speeds#V1 definitions|V<sub>1</sub>]] or takeoff decision speed). The aircraft came to rest {{convert|560|ft|abbr=on}} beyond the end of runway 16 (now runway 16R).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.aussieairliners.org/scrapbook/n892pa/n892pa.html |title = N892PA Boeing 707-321B}}</ref> During the crash, number 2 engine hit the ground and was damaged. The nose and left main landing gears failed and the aircraft came to rest supported by engines 1 and 2, the nose, and the remainder of the main landing gear. There were no injuries or fatalities amongst the 125 passengers and 11 crew. The accident investigation concluded that the overrun was not inevitable.<ref>{{cite book |title=Accident Investigation Report&nbsp;\u2013 Boeing 707-321B Aircraft N892PA at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, on 1st&nbsp;December 1969 |author=Air Safety Investigation Branch |authorlink=Australian Transport Safety Bureau |year=1970 |publisher=[[Department of Civil Aviation (Australia)|Department of Civil Aviation]], Australia |url=http://www.atsb.gov.au/media/24225/196901184.pdf |accessdate=26 October 2010 }}</ref>\n* On 29 January 1971, a [[Boeing 727]] of [[Trans Australia Airlines]] registered VH-TJA and taking off as Flight 592, struck the tail of a taxiing [[Douglas DC-8]] of [[Canadian Pacific Air Lines]] registered CF-CPQ that had just landed as Flight 301. The DC-8 crew misinterpreted instructions on which exit to use after landing and backtracked along the runway instead of turning off it onto a taxiway; and the tower controller cleared the 727 for take-off in the mistaken belief that the runway was clear. The 727 crew saw the DC-8 during the take-off roll then proceeded with the take-off rather than take evasive measures. The 727 was damaged in the inboard right wing and the fuselage and lost pressure in one of its hydraulic systems but managed to return and land safely; a building on the ground was struck by parts of the 727's starboard landing gear doors that fell off as it approached to land. The upper eight-and-a-half feet (about 2.6m) of the DC-8's tail fin and a corresponding proportion of the rudder were torn off.<ref>{{cite web |author=Air Safety Investigation Branch |url=http://www.atsb.gov.au/media/24753/197101202.pdf |work=Accident Investigation Report |title=Canadian Pacific Airlines DC8-63 aircraft CF-CPQ and Trans-Australia Airlines Boeing 727 aircraft VH-TJA at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport New South Wales on 29 January, 1971 |date=August 1971 |publisher=Department of Civil Aviation |accessdate=22 April 2014 }}</ref>\n* On 21 February 1980, a [[Beechcraft Super King Air]] registered VH-AAV and operating [[Advance Airlines Flight 4210]] took off from Sydney Airport and suffered an engine failure.

The engine was feathered but airspeed decayed and it was found to be impossible to maintain height. A successful ditching was carried out into Botany Bay. All four crew and 21 passengers - pupils and teachers of [[Scots College (Sydney)|Scots College]] and journalists, travelling to participate in [[Anzac Day]] commemorations on Norfolk Island - safely evacuated the aircraft.

Approximately one hour after departure the crew shut down the number one engine because of an oil leak. They returned the aircraft to Sydney where the approach proceeded normally until the landing gear was extended. The landing gear warning horn began to sound because the nose landing gear had not extended. The flight crew unsuccessfully attempted to establish the reason for the warning. Believing the gear to be down, the crew elected to complete the landing, with the result that the aircraft was landed with the nose gear retracted. There was no fire and the pilot in command decided not to initiate an emergency evacuation.

For much of its early history it was known either as the '''South African Tour''' or '''Sunshine Circuit'''; through sponsorship deals, it has also been known as the '''Vodacom Tour''' and the '''FNB Tour'''. For the [[2000\u201301 Sunshine Tour|2000\u201301 season]] the tour rebranded itself as the ''Sunshine Tour'' in an attempt to broaden its appeal. A large majority of the tour events are still staged in South Africa.\n\nThe tour is one of the six leading men's tours which before 2009 made up the membership of the [[International Federation of PGA Tours]], but it offers much less prize money than some of the leading tours, and leading Southern African golfers traditionally prefer to play on the [[PGA Tour]] or the [[European Tour]] if they can qualify to do so, typically returning to play in Sunshine Tour events a couple of times a year.\n\nMost of the tour's leading official money events, including the [[South African Open (golf)|South African Open]], are co-sanctioned with the European Tour to attract stronger fields.  The 2015 season included 27 official money events. The co-sanctioned events had purses ranging from [[euro|\u20ac]]1 million to [[United States dollar|$]]6.5 million, while the other 21 events had purses designated in [[South African Rand]] and ranging from 650,000 rand to 4.5 million rand. There was at least one tournament every month of the year except July, but the main events took place in the South African summer from November to February.\n\nThe tour has been open to non-White players since 1991. Five black golfers have won events: South Africa's [[John Mashego]] at the 1991 Bushveld Classic; South Africa's [[Lindani Ndwandwe]] at the 2001 Western Cape Classic and 2009 [[Highveld Classic]]; Zimbabwe's [[Tongoona Charamba]] at the 2006 SAA Pro-Am Invitational<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.co.za/default.asp?AID=179665 |title=Charamba rewrites history at SAA Pro-Am Invitational |work=Sunshine Tour |date=22 May 2006 |access-date=1 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020244/http://www.pgatour.co.za/default.asp?AID=179665 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and 2008 [[MTC Namibia PGA Championship]]; Zambia's [[Madalitso Muthiya]] at the 2016 [[Vodacom Origins of Golf]] (Wild Coast); and South Africa's Toto Thimba Jr. at the 2019 [[KCB Karen Masters]].\n\nIn 2016, the Sunshine Tour announced an affiliation with the [[MENA Golf Tour]], allowing the top five MENA Tour players Sunshine Tour cards and those 6th-15th into the final stage of Q School. A number of events would also be co-sanctioned among the Sunshine Tour, MENA Tour, and developmental [[Big Easy Tour]].\n\n==Schedule==\n{{main|2019\u201320 Sunshine Tour}}\nThe Sunshine Tour consists of two distinct parts, commonly referred to as the \"Summer Swing\" and \"Winter Swing\". Tournaments held during the Summer Swing generally have much higher prize funds and attract stronger fields. The Winter Swing runs from March to November, dividing the Summer Swing in two.\n\nTournament prize funds do not count directly towards the Order of Merit. The richest events on the tour are those that are co-sanctioned with the [[European Tour]].\n\n==Order of Merit winners==\nThe winner of the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit is awarded the Sid Brews Trophy. The Order of Merit winners are shown below. Players are required to play in a minimum number of tournaments (eight in 2013) to qualify for the Order of Merit. As the richest events on the tour (those co-sanctioned by the European Tour) tend to be won by players who don't play enough events to qualify, in recent years the Order of Merit winner has often not actually been the player who won most money in Sunshine Tour sanctioned events. The winner of the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit also earns entry into [[The Open Championship]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season !! Player !! Country !!

As the richest events on the tour (those co-sanctioned by the European Tour) tend to be won by players who don't play enough events to qualify, in recent years the Order of Merit winner has often not actually been the player who won most money in Sunshine Tour sanctioned events. The winner of the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit also earns entry into [[The Open Championship]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season !! Player !! Country !!

He was the leading career money winner on the European Tour until overtaken by [[Lee Westwood]] in 2011, and was the first member of the tour to earn over \u20ac25,000,000 from European Tour events.

He has written a popular golf instructional column in ''[[Golf Digest]]'' magazine for several years.\n\n== Background and family ==\nGrowing up in Lambton, [[Germiston]], South Africa, he played rugby, cricket, tennis and, starting at age 8, golf. He was a skilled junior tennis player and won the Eastern Transvaal Junior Championships at age 13. Els first learned the game of golf from his father Neels, a trucking executive, at the Germiston Golf course, He was soon playing better than his father (and his older brother, Dirk), and by the age of 14 he was a scratch handicap. It was around this time that he decided to focus exclusively on golf.\n\nEls first achieved prominence in 1984, when he won the [[Junior World Golf Championship]] in the Boys 13\u201314 category. [[Phil Mickelson]] was second to Els that year. Els won the South African Amateur Championship a few months after his 17th birthday, becoming the youngest-ever winner of that event, breaking the record which had been held by [[Gary Player]].\n\nEls married his wife Liezl in 1998 in [[Cape Town]] and they have two children, Samantha and Ben. In 2008 after Els started to display an \"[[Autism Speaks]]\" logo on his golf bag it was announced that their then five-year-old son was [[autism|autistic]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/03/11/sgels111.xml |title=Ernie Els speaks out over son's autism |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 March 2008}}</ref> Their main residence is at the [[Wentworth Estate]] near [[Wentworth Golf Club]] in the south of England.

Els won his first professional tournament in 1991 on the Southern Africa Tour (today the [[Sunshine Tour]]). He won the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit in the 1991/92 and 1994/95 seasons. In 1993, Els won his first tournament outside of South Africa at the [[Dunlop Phoenix]] in Japan. In 1994 Els won his first major championship at the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. Els was tied with [[Colin Montgomerie]] and [[Loren Roberts]] after 72 holes and they went to an 18-hole playoff the next day. In spite of starting the playoff bogey-triple bogey,<ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Dorman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/21/sports/golf-forget-finesse-remember-a-name-els-wins-open.html |title=Forget Finesse, Remember a Name: Els Wins Open |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 June 1994 |accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> Els was able to match Roberts' score of 74. Els birdied the second hole of sudden death to win his first U.S. Open title.\n\nEls brought his game all around the world in his young career winning the [[Dubai Desert Classic]] on the European Tour, and the [[Toyota World Match Play Championship]] defeating once again Colin Montgomerie 4 & 2. The following year, Els defended his World Match Play Championship, defeating Steve Elkington 3 & 1. Els won the [[GTE Byron Nelson Classic]] in the United States then headed back home to South Africa and won twice more. In 1996, Els won his third straight World Match Play Championship at Wentworth, defeating [[Vijay Singh]] in the final 3 & 2. No player in history had ever managed to win three successive titles in the one-on-one tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/od/progolftours/p/world-match-play-championship.htm |title=Volvo World Match Play Championship |first=Brent |last=Kelley |publisher=About.com |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Els finished the year with a win at his home tournament at the South African Open.\n\n=== 1997\u20132002: Career years and multi-major championships ===\n1997 was a career year for Els first winning his second U.S. Open (once again over Colin Montgomerie) this time at [[Congressional Country Club]], making him the first foreign player since [[Alex Smith (golfer)|Alex Smith]] (1906, 1910) to win the U.S. Open twice. He defended his Buick Classic title and added the Johnnie Walker Classic to his list of victories. Els nearly won the World Match Play Championship for a fourth consecutive year, but lost to Vijay Singh in the final. 1998 and 1999 continued to be successful years for Els with 4 wins on both the PGA and European tours.\n\n2000 started with Els being given a special honour by the Board of Directors of the [[European Tour]] awarding him with honorary life membership of the European Tour because of his two U.S. Opens and three World Match Play titles. 2000 was the year of runners-up for Els; with three runner-up finishes in the Majors (Masters, U.S. Open and The Open Championship) and seven second-place finishes in tournaments worldwide. In 2001 Els failed to win a US PGA tour event for the first time since 1994 although he ended the year with nine second-place finishes.\n\n2002 was arguably Els's best year, which started with a win at the Heineken Classic at the [[Royal Melbourne Golf Club]]. Then went to America and outplayed World Number one [[Tiger Woods]] to lift the [[Genuity Championship]] title. The premier moment of the season was surely his [[Open Championship]] triumph in very tough conditions at [[Muirfield]]. Els overcame a four-man playoff to take home the famous [[Claret Jug (golf trophy)|Claret Jug]] trophy for the first time, also quieting his critics about his mental toughness. The South African also won his fourth World Match Play title, along with his third Nedbank Challenge in the last four years, dominating a world-class field and winning by 8 shots.\n\n=== 2003\u20132005: The Big Five ===\n[[Image:Ernie checking shot.JPG|thumb|Els at [[Westchester Country Club|Westchester]] in [[2004 PGA Tour|2004]]]]\n2003 gave Els his first European Tour [[Order of Merit]]. Although playing fewer events than his competitors Els won four times and had three runners-up. He also performed well in the United States with back to back victories at the Mercedes Championship \u2013 where he set the all-time PGA Tour 72-hole record for most strokes under par at 31 under \u2013 and Sony Open and achieved top-20 spots in all four majors, including a fifth-place finish at the U.S Open and sixth-place finishes at both the Masters and PGA Championship. To top off the season Els won the World Match Play title for a record-tying fifth time. In 2003 he was voted 37th on the [[SABC3's Great South Africans]].\n\n[[Image:Ernie smiling 800.jpg|thumb|left|Els shares a laugh during the practice round for the 2004 [[Buick Classic]]]]\n2004 was another successful year as Els won 6 times on both tours, including big wins at Memorial, [[WGC-American Express Championship]] and his sixth World Match Play Championship, a new record. His success did not stop there. Els showed remarkable consistency in the Majors but lost to [[Phil Mickelson]] in the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] when Mickelson birdied the 18th for the title, finished ninth in the U.S. Open after playing in the final group with friend and fellow countryman [[Retief Goosen]] and surprisingly lost in a playoff in the Open to the then unknown [[Todd Hamilton]]. Els had a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=on}} putt for birdie on the final hole of regulation for the Open at Royal Troon, but he missed the putt and lost in the playoff. Els ended the major season with a fourth-place finish in the PGA Championship, where a three-putt on the 72nd hole would cost him a place in the playoff. In total, Els had 16 top-10 finishes, a second European Order of Merit title in succession and a second-place finish on the United States money list.\n\n2004 was the start of the \"Big Five Era\", which is used in describing the era in golf where [[Tiger Woods]], [[Vijay Singh]], Ernie Els, [[Retief Goosen]] and [[Phil Mickelson]] dominated the game of golf. The five switched up and down the top five positions in the [[Official World Golf Ranking|World Golf Ranking]]; most notably Vijay Singh's derailment of Tiger Woods as the best golfer in the world. The five stayed, for the most part, in the top five spots from 2004 until the start of 2007. Nine majors were won between them, many fighting against each other head to head.\n\nIn July 2005, Els injured his left knee while sailing with his family in the Mediterranean. Despite missing several months of the 2005 season due to the injury, Els won the second event on his return, the [[Alfred Dunhill Championship|Dunhill Championship]].\n\nWith his victory at the 2005 [[Qatar Masters]], an event co-sanctioned by the [[Asian Tour]], Els became the second golfer after [[Lee Westwood]] to win on all six of the big tours on the [[International Federation of PGA Tours]].\n\n=== 2006\u20132011: Gradual recovery and comeback ===\nAt the start of the 2007 season Ernie Els laid out a three-year battle plan to challenge Tiger Woods as world number one. \"I see 2007 as the start of a three-year plan where I totally re-dedicate myself to the game,\"<ref>{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/golf/12/20/bc.golf.els/ |title=Els has 3-year plan to catch Woods as world's No. 1 |work=Sports Illustrated/CNN |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Els told his official website.\n\nWhen he missed the cut by two strokes at the 2007 [[Masters Tournament]], Els ended tour-leading consecutive cut streaks on both the PGA Tour and the European Tour. On the PGA Tour, his streak began at the 2004 [[The Players Championship]] (46 events) and on the European Tour it began at the 2000 [[Johnnie Walker Classic]] (82 events)\n[[File:Ernie Els 3-wood tee.jpg|thumb|left|Els at Torrey Pines for the [[2008 U.S. Open (golf)|2008 U.S. Open]]]]\nEls has often been compared to [[Greg Norman]] in the sense that both men\u2019s careers could be looked back on and think what could have been. Although the two of them are multiple major championship winners, both share disappointment in majors. Their disappointments have ranged from nerves, bad luck, and being outplayed. 1996 was the year where Norman collapsed in the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], whereas the year before Els did in the [[PGA Championship]]. Nearly four years later, Els finished runner-up in the 2000 Masters Tournament, and again in 2004, losing to Phil Mickelson. Els has finished runner-up in six majors, finishing runner-up to Tiger Woods more than any other golfer, and has often been described as having the right game to finally be the golfer to beat Woods in a major.\n\nOn 2 March 2008, Els won the [[Honda Classic]] contested at PGA National's Championship Course in [[Palm Beach Gardens, Florida]]. Els shot a final round 67 in tough windy conditions, which was enough to give him the win by one stroke over [[Luke Donald]]. The win marked the end of a three and a half-year-long stretch without a win on the PGA Tour for Els. The win was also his 16th victory on the PGA Tour.\n\nOn 8 April 2008, Els officially announced that he was switching swing coaches from [[David Leadbetter (golf instructor)|David Leadbetter]] (whom Els had worked with since 1990) to noted swing coach [[Butch Harmon]]. During Els 2008 Masters press conference Els said the change is in an effort to tighten his swing, shorten his swing, and get a fresh perspective.\n\nOn 8 November 2009, Els almost ended his year-long slump by shooting a course-tying record 9-under 63 in the final round of the [[WGC-HSBC Champions]] to finish at 16-under par 272, a stroke back of [[Phil Mickelson]] who finished with a 17-under 271 total, including a final round of 3-under 69.\n\nEls finally did break his winless streak by capturing the [[WGC-CA Championship]] at Doral in 2010, winning by four strokes over fellow countryman [[Charl Schwartzel]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=4995357 |title=Els gets first win in two years |date=14 March 2010 |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref> It was Els's second WGC tournament title.

Els was next in contention at the [[Transitions Championship]], where he needed a win to qualify for the 2012 Masters.  Els led the tournament for most of the final round and had the lead outright until the 16th hole. However, he finished the tournament bogey-bogey missing a short three footer on the last hole to make a playoff. The tournament was eventually won by [[Luke Donald]]. In April, Els failed to qualify for the Masters for the first time since 1993. He was ranked 58th in the world prior to the tournament (the top 50 are given automatic invitations).

In 2009, Els launched an annual charity golf event, the Els for Autism Pro-Am, held at the [[PGA National Resort & Spa]] in [[Palm Beach Gardens, Florida|Palm Beach Gardens]] near his South Florida residence during the PGA Tour's March swing into the area. The first event, which featured many PGA Tour and [[Champions Tour]] golfers, raised $725,000 for The Renaissance Learning Center, a nonprofit [[charter school]] in the area for autistic children. The couple has also established the [[Els Center of Excellence]], which began as a drive to build a new campus for the aforementioned school in [[Jupiter, Florida]], but has since expanded into a $30&nbsp;million plan to combine the school with a research facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://together.pgatour.com/stories/liezl-els-committed-to-autism-awareness.html |title=Liezl Els Committed to Autism Awareness |publisher=PGA Tour Charities |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314060255/http://together.pgatour.com/stories/liezl-els-committed-to-autism-awareness.html |archivedate=14 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Quotes ==\nOn his technique:\n{{cquote|I've never been a very technical player.

South African professional golfer. A former [[Official World Golf Ranking|World No. 1]], he is known as '''\"The Big Easy\"''' due to his imposing physical stature (he stands {{height|ft=6|in=3}}) along with his fluid golf swing. Among his 71 career victories are four [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]]: the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] in [[1994 U.S. Open (golf)|1994]] at [[Oakmont Country Club|Oakmont]] and in [[1997 U.S. Open (golf)|1997]] at [[Congressional Country Club|Congressional]], and [[The Open Championship]] in [[2002 Open Championship|2002]] at [[Muirfield]] and in [[2012 Open Championship|2012]] at [[Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club|Royal Lytham & St Annes]].<ref name=\"PGA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.06522.ernie-els.html/media-guide/#uber |title=PGA Tour Media Guide \u2013 Ernie Els |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> He is one of six golfers to twice win both the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\n\nOther highlights in Els' career include topping the 2003 and 2004 [[European Tour]] Order of Merit (money list), and winning the [[HSBC World Match Play Championship|World Match Play Championship]] a record seven times. He was the leading career money winner on the European Tour until overtaken by [[Lee Westwood]] in 2011, and was the first member of the tour to earn over \u20ac25,000,000 from European Tour events.

He has written a popular golf instructional column in ''[[Golf Digest]]'' magazine for several years.\n\n== Background and family ==\nGrowing up in Lambton, [[Germiston]], South Africa, he played rugby, cricket, tennis and, starting at age 8, golf. He was a skilled junior tennis player and won the Eastern Transvaal Junior Championships at age 13. Els first learned the game of golf from his father Neels, a trucking executive, at the Germiston Golf course, He was soon playing better than his father (and his older brother, Dirk), and by the age of 14 he was a scratch handicap. It was around this time that he decided to focus exclusively on golf.\n\nEls first achieved prominence in 1984, when he won the [[Junior World Golf Championship]] in the Boys 13\u201314 category. [[Phil Mickelson]] was second to Els that year. Els won the South African Amateur Championship a few months after his 17th birthday, becoming the youngest-ever winner of that event, breaking the record which had been held by [[Gary Player]].\n\nEls married his wife Liezl in 1998 in [[Cape Town]] and they have two children, Samantha and Ben. In 2008 after Els started to display an \"[[Autism Speaks]]\" logo on his golf bag it was announced that their then five-year-old son was [[autism|autistic]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/03/11/sgels111.xml |title=Ernie Els speaks out over son's autism |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 March 2008}}</ref> Their main residence is at the [[Wentworth Estate]] near [[Wentworth Golf Club]] in the south of England.

Els won his first professional tournament in 1991 on the Southern Africa Tour (today the [[Sunshine Tour]]). He won the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit in the 1991/92 and 1994/95 seasons. In 1993, Els won his first tournament outside of South Africa at the [[Dunlop Phoenix]] in Japan. In 1994 Els won his first major championship at the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. Els was tied with [[Colin Montgomerie]] and [[Loren Roberts]] after 72 holes and they went to an 18-hole playoff the next day. In spite of starting the playoff bogey-triple bogey,<ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Dorman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/21/sports/golf-forget-finesse-remember-a-name-els-wins-open.html |title=Forget Finesse, Remember a Name: Els Wins Open |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 June 1994 |accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> Els was able to match Roberts' score of 74. Els birdied the second hole of sudden death to win his first U.S. Open title.\n\nEls brought his game all around the world in his young career winning the [[Dubai Desert Classic]] on the European Tour, and the [[Toyota World Match Play Championship]] defeating once again Colin Montgomerie 4 & 2. The following year, Els defended his World Match Play Championship, defeating Steve Elkington 3 & 1. Els won the [[GTE Byron Nelson Classic]] in the United States then headed back home to South Africa and won twice more. In 1996, Els won his third straight World Match Play Championship at Wentworth, defeating [[Vijay Singh]] in the final 3 & 2. No player in history had ever managed to win three successive titles in the one-on-one tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/od/progolftours/p/world-match-play-championship.htm |title=Volvo World Match Play Championship |first=Brent |last=Kelley |publisher=About.com |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Els finished the year with a win at his home tournament at the South African Open.\n\n=== 1997\u20132002: Career years and multi-major championships ===\n1997 was a career year for Els first winning his second U.S. Open (once again over Colin Montgomerie) this time at [[Congressional Country Club]], making him the first foreign player since [[Alex Smith (golfer)|Alex Smith]] (1906, 1910) to win the U.S. Open twice. He defended his Buick Classic title and added the Johnnie Walker Classic to his list of victories. Els nearly won the World Match Play Championship for a fourth consecutive year, but lost to Vijay Singh in the final. 1998 and 1999 continued to be successful years for Els with 4 wins on both the PGA and European tours.\n\n2000 started with Els being given a special honour by the Board of Directors of the [[European Tour]] awarding him with honorary life membership of the European Tour because of his two U.S. Opens and three World Match Play titles. 2000 was the year of runners-up for Els; with three runner-up finishes in the Majors (Masters, U.S. Open and The Open Championship) and seven second-place finishes in tournaments worldwide. In 2001 Els failed to win a US PGA tour event for the first time since 1994 although he ended the year with nine second-place finishes.\n\n2002 was arguably Els's best year, which started with a win at the Heineken Classic at the [[Royal Melbourne Golf Club]]. Then went to America and outplayed World Number one [[Tiger Woods]] to lift the [[Genuity Championship]] title. The premier moment of the season was surely his [[Open Championship]] triumph in very tough conditions at [[Muirfield]]. Els overcame a four-man playoff to take home the famous [[Claret Jug (golf trophy)|Claret Jug]] trophy for the first time, also quieting his critics about his mental toughness. The South African also won his fourth World Match Play title, along with his third Nedbank Challenge in the last four years, dominating a world-class field and winning by 8 shots.\n\n=== 2003\u20132005: The Big Five ===\n[[Image:Ernie checking shot.JPG|thumb|Els at [[Westchester Country Club|Westchester]] in [[2004 PGA Tour|2004]]]]\n2003 gave Els his first European Tour [[Order of Merit]]. Although playing fewer events than his competitors Els won four times and had three runners-up. He also performed well in the United States with back to back victories at the Mercedes Championship \u2013 where he set the all-time PGA Tour 72-hole record for most strokes under par at 31 under \u2013 and Sony Open and achieved top-20 spots in all four majors, including a fifth-place finish at the U.S Open and sixth-place finishes at both the Masters and PGA Championship. To top off the season Els won the World Match Play title for a record-tying fifth time. In 2003 he was voted 37th on the [[SABC3's Great South Africans]].\n\n[[Image:Ernie smiling 800.jpg|thumb|left|Els shares a laugh during the practice round for the 2004 [[Buick Classic]]]]\n2004 was another successful year as Els won 6 times on both tours, including big wins at Memorial, [[WGC-American Express Championship]] and his sixth World Match Play Championship, a new record. His success did not stop there. Els showed remarkable consistency in the Majors but lost to [[Phil Mickelson]] in the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] when Mickelson birdied the 18th for the title, finished ninth in the U.S. Open after playing in the final group with friend and fellow countryman [[Retief Goosen]] and surprisingly lost in a playoff in the Open to the then unknown [[Todd Hamilton]]. Els had a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=on}} putt for birdie on the final hole of regulation for the Open at Royal Troon, but he missed the putt and lost in the playoff. Els ended the major season with a fourth-place finish in the PGA Championship, where a three-putt on the 72nd hole would cost him a place in the playoff. In total, Els had 16 top-10 finishes, a second European Order of Merit title in succession and a second-place finish on the United States money list.\n\n2004 was the start of the \"Big Five Era\", which is used in describing the era in golf where [[Tiger Woods]], [[Vijay Singh]], Ernie Els, [[Retief Goosen]] and [[Phil Mickelson]] dominated the game of golf. The five switched up and down the top five positions in the [[Official World Golf Ranking|World Golf Ranking]]; most notably Vijay Singh's derailment of Tiger Woods as the best golfer in the world. The five stayed, for the most part, in the top five spots from 2004 until the start of 2007. Nine majors were won between them, many fighting against each other head to head.\n\nIn July 2005, Els injured his left knee while sailing with his family in the Mediterranean. Despite missing several months of the 2005 season due to the injury, Els won the second event on his return, the [[Alfred Dunhill Championship|Dunhill Championship]].\n\nWith his victory at the 2005 [[Qatar Masters]], an event co-sanctioned by the [[Asian Tour]], Els became the second golfer after [[Lee Westwood]] to win on all six of the big tours on the [[International Federation of PGA Tours]].\n\n=== 2006\u20132011: Gradual recovery and comeback ===\nAt the start of the 2007 season Ernie Els laid out a three-year battle plan to challenge Tiger Woods as world number one. \"I see 2007 as the start of a three-year plan where I totally re-dedicate myself to the game,\"<ref>{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/golf/12/20/bc.golf.els/ |title=Els has 3-year plan to catch Woods as world's No. 1 |work=Sports Illustrated/CNN |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Els told his official website.\n\nWhen he missed the cut by two strokes at the 2007 [[Masters Tournament]], Els ended tour-leading consecutive cut streaks on both the PGA Tour and the European Tour. On the PGA Tour, his streak began at the 2004 [[The Players Championship]] (46 events) and on the European Tour it began at the 2000 [[Johnnie Walker Classic]] (82 events)\n[[File:Ernie Els 3-wood tee.jpg|thumb|left|Els at Torrey Pines for the [[2008 U.S. Open (golf)|2008 U.S. Open]]]]\nEls has often been compared to [[Greg Norman]] in the sense that both men\u2019s careers could be looked back on and think what could have been. Although the two of them are multiple major championship winners, both share disappointment in majors. Their disappointments have ranged from nerves, bad luck, and being outplayed. 1996 was the year where Norman collapsed in the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], whereas the year before Els did in the [[PGA Championship]]. Nearly four years later, Els finished runner-up in the 2000 Masters Tournament, and again in 2004, losing to Phil Mickelson. Els has finished runner-up in six majors, finishing runner-up to Tiger Woods more than any other golfer, and has often been described as having the right game to finally be the golfer to beat Woods in a major.\n\nOn 2 March 2008, Els won the [[Honda Classic]] contested at PGA National's Championship Course in [[Palm Beach Gardens, Florida]]. Els shot a final round 67 in tough windy conditions, which was enough to give him the win by one stroke over [[Luke Donald]]. The win marked the end of a three and a half-year-long stretch without a win on the PGA Tour for Els. The win was also his 16th victory on the PGA Tour.\n\nOn 8 April 2008, Els officially announced that he was switching swing coaches from [[David Leadbetter (golf instructor)|David Leadbetter]] (whom Els had worked with since 1990) to noted swing coach [[Butch Harmon]]. During Els 2008 Masters press conference Els said the change is in an effort to tighten his swing, shorten his swing, and get a fresh perspective.\n\nOn 8 November 2009, Els almost ended his year-long slump by shooting a course-tying record 9-under 63 in the final round of the [[WGC-HSBC Champions]] to finish at 16-under par 272, a stroke back of [[Phil Mickelson]] who finished with a 17-under 271 total, including a final round of 3-under 69.\n\nEls finally did break his winless streak by capturing the [[WGC-CA Championship]] at Doral in 2010, winning by four strokes over fellow countryman [[Charl Schwartzel]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=4995357 |title=Els gets first win in two years |date=14 March 2010 |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref> It was Els's second WGC tournament title.

Els was next in contention at the [[Transitions Championship]], where he needed a win to qualify for the 2012 Masters.  Els led the tournament for most of the final round and had the lead outright until the 16th hole. However, he finished the tournament bogey-bogey missing a short three footer on the last hole to make a playoff. The tournament was eventually won by [[Luke Donald]]. In April, Els failed to qualify for the Masters for the first time since 1993. He was ranked 58th in the world prior to the tournament (the top 50 are given automatic invitations). Ultimately, Els' unsuccessful bids to qualify for the Masters was viewed as the likely end of his competitiveness on the PGA Tour.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/sports/golf/els-keeps-missing-putts-and-could-miss-the-masters.html?_r=0 |title=Putts Elude Els, and So Could Masters |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Craig |last=Dolch |date=22 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nEls surprised the golfing world by winning the [[Open Championship|2012 Open Championship]] in July by birding the 72nd hole.

He says that his globe-trotting schedule is in recognition of the global nature of golf. This has caused some friction with the [[PGA Tour]], an organisation that would prefer Els to play more tournaments in the United States. In late 2004, [[Tim Finchem]], the director of the PGA Tour, wrote quite a firm letter to Els asking him to do so but Els publicized and rejected this request.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davies|first=David|date=13 October 2004|access-date=10 April 2017|title=Els ready to play hardball with US Tour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/oct/14/golf.daviddavies|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> The PGA Tour's attitude caused considerable offense in the golfing world outside of North America.\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThe Ernie Els and Fancourt Foundation was established in 1999. It has the objective of identifying youths from under-privileged backgrounds who show talent and potential in the game of golf. It provides educational assistance amongst other moral and financial help in order for these youths to reach their full potential.\n\nThe first Friendship Cup was played in 2006 which is a [[match play]] competition, played in a [[Ryder Cup]] type format. In the cup, Els's foundation plays against the foundation of [[Tiger Woods]]. Els's foundation won 12.5 points to 3.5 points.\n\nEls has also participated several times in the Gary Player Invitational series of charity golf events, to assist Player raise significant funds for underprivileged children around the world.\n\n=== Autism-related activities ===\nSince his son's autism diagnosis, Els and his wife have been active in charities devoted to that condition. This involvement has increased as Ben has reached school age. In 2009, Els launched an annual charity golf event, the Els for Autism Pro-Am, held at the [[PGA National Resort & Spa]] in [[Palm Beach Gardens, Florida|Palm Beach Gardens]] near his South Florida residence during the PGA Tour's March swing into the area. The first event, which featured many PGA Tour and [[Champions Tour]] golfers, raised $725,000 for The Renaissance Learning Center, a nonprofit [[charter school]] in the area for autistic children. The couple has also established the [[Els Center of Excellence]], which began as a drive to build a new campus for the aforementioned school in [[Jupiter, Florida]], but has since expanded into a $30&nbsp;million plan to combine the school with a research facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://together.pgatour.com/stories/liezl-els-committed-to-autism-awareness.html |title=Liezl Els Committed to Autism Awareness |publisher=PGA Tour Charities |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314060255/http://together.pgatour.com/stories/liezl-els-committed-to-autism-awareness.html |archivedate=14 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Quotes ==\nOn his technique:\n{{cquote|I've never been a very technical player.

He was inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] in 2003.\n\n==Background==\nPrice was born in [[Durban]], [[Union of South Africa]]. His parents were originally [[British people|British]]. His father was [[English people|English]] and his mother [[Welsh people|Welsh]]. His early life was spent in [[Rhodesia]] (present day [[Zimbabwe]]). He attended [[Prince Edward School]] in  [[Harare|Salisbury]] (now [[Harare]]), where he captained the golf team. After his schooling he served in the [[Rhodesian Air Force]] during that country's [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Don |last=Wade |title=Wanna Bet?

He began his professional golf career in 1977 on the [[Sunshine Tour|South African Tour]], before moving to the [[European Tour]] and finally the [[PGA Tour]] in 1983. In 1984, Price renounced his Zimbabwean citizenship and thereafter played under his British passport. It was not until 1996 that Price regained his dual citizenship. Price is married to Sue and has three children. They live in [[Hobe Sound, Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Price: Bio|url=http://www.nickprice.com/index.html|website=nickprice.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707151400/http://www.nickprice.com/index.html|archivedate=7 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Price's nephew [[Ray Price (cricketer)|Ray Price]] is a former national [[cricket]]er for the [[Zimbabwe national cricket team]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Williams |first=Jeff |title=Gentleman Nick |magazine=[[Cigar Aficionado]] |date=June 2011 |pages=80\u201388}}</ref>\n\n==Early professional years==\nPrice won his first tournament outside of South Africa at the 1980 [[Swiss Open]].

In the interim, Price shot an [[Augusta National Golf Club]] course record 63 at the [[1986 Masters Tournament]] and finished second at the [[1988 Open Championship]] to [[Seve Ballesteros]].\n\n==Career peak==\nBy the mid-1990s, Price was regarded as the best player in the world, and in 1994 he won two [[Men's major golf championships|majors]] back-to-back, [[1994 Open Championship|The Open]] and the [[1994 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]], adding to his first major, the [[1992 PGA Championship]]. He topped the PGA Tour money list in 1993 and 1994, setting a new earnings record each time, and spent 43 weeks at number one in the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].\n\nPrice won the [[Sunshine Tour]] Order of Merit for the 1982/83 season and would have won again in 1996/97 if he had met the minimum number of tournaments. In 1993 and 1997, Price was awarded the [[Vardon Trophy]]; which is given annually by the [[PGA of America]] to the player with the lowest adjusted scoring average with a minimum of 60 rounds.\n\nIn 2003, Price was inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]. In 2005, he was voted the [[Bob Jones Award]], the highest honour given by the [[United States Golf Association|USGA]] in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. Price received the 2011 [[Old Tom Morris Award]], the highest honour given by the [[Golf Course Superintendents Association of America|GCSAA]] to an individual who \"through a continuing lifetime commitment to the game of golf has helped to mold the welfare of the game in a manner and style exemplified by [[Old Tom Morris]].\"\n\n==Playing style==\nDuring his early career and peak, Price was one of the best ball strikers in the game along with his good friend and contemporary [[Greg Norman]] (who in 1996 tied Price's Augusta National course record of 63).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-04-12/sports/9604120069_1_norman-masters-augusta-bernhard-langer-final-round |title=Norman Masters Augusta |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] |date=12 April 1996 |first=Michael |last=Mayo}}</ref>\n\nLike fellow African [[Gary Player]], Price has expressed his distaste for the [[Ryder Cup]], saying of the event, \"If you like root canals and hemorrhoids, you'd love it there.\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations|editor-first=Jim|editor-last=Apfelbaum|year=2007|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60239-014-0}}</ref> but he has played five times as a member of the [[Presidents Cup]].\n\nAlthough Price continues to play professionally, he has expanded into golf design with his own company operating out of Florida, and he has his own line of signature golf apparel. He is widely regarded by fans, media and his fellow players as one of the most personable golfers on the PGA Tour. He won his first [[Champions Tour]] event at the 2009 [[Outback Steakhouse Pro-Am]] where he had three double bogeys in his final round, but he hung on to win by two strokes over [[Larry Nelson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.golfchannel.com/article/associated-press/nick-price-claims-first-champions-tour-win |title=Nick Price claims first Champions Tour win |date=9 April 2009 |work=Golf Channel |agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n==Professional wins (48)==\n\n===PGA Tour wins (18)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n|'''Legend'''\n|-style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|Major championships (3)\n|- style=\"background:#f2ecce;\"\n| Players Championships (1)\n|- \n|Other PGA Tour (14)\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Winning score\n!Margin of<br>victory\n!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|28 Aug [[1983 PGA Tour|1983]]\n|[[World Series of Golf (PGA Tour)|World Series of Golf]]\n|\u221210 (66-68-69-67=270)\n|4 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jack Nicklaus]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|5 May [[1991 PGA Tour|1991]]\n|[[GTE Byron Nelson Classic]]\n|\u221210 (68-64-70-68=270)\n|1 stroke\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Craig Stadler]]\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|align=right|8 Sep 1991\n|[[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]]\n|\u221215 (71-69-67-66=273)\n|1 stroke\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[David Edwards (golfer)|David Edwards]]\n|-style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|align=center|4\n|align=right|16 Aug [[1992 PGA Tour|1992]]\n|'''[[1992 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]]'''\n|\u22126 (70-70-68-70=278)\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[John Cook (golfer)|John Cook]], {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Nick Faldo]],<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jim Gallagher, Jr.]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Gene Sauers]]\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|align=right|25 Oct 1992\n|[[H.E.B.

He began his professional golf career in 1977 on the [[Sunshine Tour|South African Tour]], before moving to the [[European Tour]] and finally the [[PGA Tour]] in 1983. In 1984, Price renounced his Zimbabwean citizenship and thereafter played under his British passport. It was not until 1996 that Price regained his dual citizenship. Price is married to Sue and has three children. They live in [[Hobe Sound, Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Price: Bio|url=http://www.nickprice.com/index.html|website=nickprice.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707151400/http://www.nickprice.com/index.html|archivedate=7 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Price's nephew [[Ray Price (cricketer)|Ray Price]] is a former national [[cricket]]er for the [[Zimbabwe national cricket team]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Williams |first=Jeff |title=Gentleman Nick |magazine=[[Cigar Aficionado]] |date=June 2011 |pages=80\u201388}}</ref>\n\n==Early professional years==\nPrice won his first tournament outside of South Africa at the 1980 [[Swiss Open]].

In the interim, Price shot an [[Augusta National Golf Club]] course record 63 at the [[1986 Masters Tournament]] and finished second at the [[1988 Open Championship]] to [[Seve Ballesteros]].\n\n==Career peak==\nBy the mid-1990s, Price was regarded as the best player in the world, and in 1994 he won two [[Men's major golf championships|majors]] back-to-back, [[1994 Open Championship|The Open]] and the [[1994 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]], adding to his first major, the [[1992 PGA Championship]]. He topped the PGA Tour money list in 1993 and 1994, setting a new earnings record each time, and spent 43 weeks at number one in the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].\n\nPrice won the [[Sunshine Tour]] Order of Merit for the 1982/83 season and would have won again in 1996/97 if he had met the minimum number of tournaments. In 1993 and 1997, Price was awarded the [[Vardon Trophy]]; which is given annually by the [[PGA of America]] to the player with the lowest adjusted scoring average with a minimum of 60 rounds.\n\nIn 2003, Price was inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]. In 2005, he was voted the [[Bob Jones Award]], the highest honour given by the [[United States Golf Association|USGA]] in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. Price received the 2011 [[Old Tom Morris Award]], the highest honour given by the [[Golf Course Superintendents Association of America|GCSAA]] to an individual who \"through a continuing lifetime commitment to the game of golf has helped to mold the welfare of the game in a manner and style exemplified by [[Old Tom Morris]].\"\n\n==Playing style==\nDuring his early career and peak, Price was one of the best ball strikers in the game along with his good friend and contemporary [[Greg Norman]] (who in 1996 tied Price's Augusta National course record of 63).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-04-12/sports/9604120069_1_norman-masters-augusta-bernhard-langer-final-round |title=Norman Masters Augusta |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] |date=12 April 1996 |first=Michael |last=Mayo}}</ref>\n\nLike fellow African [[Gary Player]], Price has expressed his distaste for the [[Ryder Cup]], saying of the event, \"If you like root canals and hemorrhoids, you'd love it there.\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations|editor-first=Jim|editor-last=Apfelbaum|year=2007|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60239-014-0}}</ref> but he has played five times as a member of the [[Presidents Cup]].\n\nAlthough Price continues to play professionally, he has expanded into golf design with his own company operating out of Florida, and he has his own line of signature golf apparel. He is widely regarded by fans, media and his fellow players as one of the most personable golfers on the PGA Tour. He won his first [[Champions Tour]] event at the 2009 [[Outback Steakhouse Pro-Am]] where he had three double bogeys in his final round, but he hung on to win by two strokes over [[Larry Nelson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.golfchannel.com/article/associated-press/nick-price-claims-first-champions-tour-win |title=Nick Price claims first Champions Tour win |date=9 April 2009 |work=Golf Channel |agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n==Professional wins (48)==\n\n===PGA Tour wins (18)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n|'''Legend'''\n|-style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|Major championships (3)\n|- style=\"background:#f2ecce;\"\n| Players Championships (1)\n|- \n|Other PGA Tour (14)\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Winning score\n!Margin of<br>victory\n!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|28 Aug [[1983 PGA Tour|1983]]\n|[[World Series of Golf (PGA Tour)|World Series of Golf]]\n|\u221210 (66-68-69-67=270)\n|4 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jack Nicklaus]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|5 May [[1991 PGA Tour|1991]]\n|[[GTE Byron Nelson Classic]]\n|\u221210 (68-64-70-68=270)\n|1 stroke\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Craig Stadler]]\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|align=right|8 Sep 1991\n|[[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]]\n|\u221215 (71-69-67-66=273)\n|1 stroke\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[David Edwards (golfer)|David Edwards]]\n|-style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\"\n|align=center|4\n|align=right|16 Aug [[1992 PGA Tour|1992]]\n|'''[[1992 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]]'''\n|\u22126 (70-70-68-70=278)\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[John Cook (golfer)|John Cook]], {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Nick Faldo]],<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jim Gallagher, Jr.]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Gene Sauers]]\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|align=right|25 Oct 1992\n|[[H.E.B.

When he was eight years old his mother died from cancer. Although his father was often away from home working in the gold mines, he did manage to take a loan in order to buy a set of clubs for Gary to begin playing golf. The Virginia Park golf course in Johannesburg is where Player first began his love affair with golf. At the age of 14, Player played his first round of golf and parred the first three holes. At age 16, he announced that he would become number one in the world.
