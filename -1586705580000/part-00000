An alternative origin for the name is attributed to the fact that the hill is square-shaped and therefore known as \"Chathuragiri\". \nIn ancient times Sathuragiri was known as Udayagirinathar. In Udayagirinathar, a wealthy landlord owned a vast tract of land which was home to an ancient Shiva temple. The temple was looked after by an elderly priest. A stream (similar to the present Agaya Ganga Theertham at Sathuragiri) ran next to the temple.\nSathuragiri is known as the Abode of God. It is also known as Mahalingam Hill and \"Siddhargal bhoomi\".

In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and {{convert|5373|km|mi}}, and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual [[Terry Fox Run]], first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]750&nbsp;million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018.<ref name=\"Terry's Story\" />\n\nFox was a distance runner and [[basketball]] player for his [[Port Coquitlam]], British Columbia, [[Terry Fox Secondary School|high school]] and [[Simon Fraser University]]. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played [[wheelchair basketball]] in Vancouver, winning three national championships.\n\nIn 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24&nbsp;million people. He began with little fanfare from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], in April and ran the equivalent of a full [[marathon]] every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached [[Ontario]]; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside [[Thunder Bay]] when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.\n\nIn addition to being the youngest person ever named a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], Fox won the 1980 [[Lou Marsh Award]] as the nation's top sportsman and was named [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Canada's Newsmaker of the Year]] in both 1980 and 1981. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.\n\n==Early life and cancer==\nTerry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, to Rolland and [[Betty Fox]].

In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and {{convert|5373|km|mi}}, and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual [[Terry Fox Run]], first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]750&nbsp;million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018.<ref name=\"Terry's Story\" />\n\nFox was a distance runner and [[basketball]] player for his [[Port Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]], [[Terry Fox Secondary School|high school]] and [[Simon Fraser University]]. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played [[wheelchair basketball]] in [[Vancouver]], winning three national championships.\n\nIn 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24&nbsp;million people. He began with little fanfare from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], in April and ran the equivalent of a full [[marathon]] every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached [[Ontario]]; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside [[Thunder Bay]] when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.\n\nIn addition to being the youngest person ever named a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], Fox won the 1980 [[Lou Marsh Award]] as the nation's top sportsman and was named [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Canada's Newsmaker of the Year]] in both 1980 and 1981. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.\n\n==Early life and cancer==\nTerry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], to Rolland and [[Betty Fox]].

Explaining why he wanted to raise money for research, Fox described his personal experience of cancer treatment:{{quote|I soon realized that that would only be half my quest, for as I went through the 16 months of the physically and emotionally draining ordeal of chemotherapy, I was rudely awakened by the feelings that surrounded and coursed through the cancer clinic. There were faces with the brave smiles, and the ones who had given up smiling. There were feelings of hopeful denial, and the feelings of despair. My quest would not be a selfish one. I could not leave knowing these faces and feelings would still exist, even though I would be set free from mine.

I believe in miracles. I have to.\"<ref name=cosentino/> The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with [[left ventricular hypertrophy]]&nbsp;\u2013 an enlarged heart&nbsp;\u2013 a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern.
