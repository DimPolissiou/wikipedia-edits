Originally an acronym for \"South-Western Townships\", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for Blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent. These areas were designated as non-white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the South African government known as [[Apartheid]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nControversy surrounds the origin of the name. There was quite a number of people with the name \"Johannes\" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the [[Volksraad]] and was Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as [[Paul Kruger]]), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883\u20131900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.\n\nPrecise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to [[England]] to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated [[Rissik Street Post Office]] is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/thread/rissik-street-post-office-johannesburg|title=Rissik Street Post Office Johannesburg - The Heritage Portal|website=www.theheritageportal.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111105718/http://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Johannesburg City Hall|City Hall]] is also located on Rissik Street.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Johannesburg|Timeline of Johannesburg}}\n[[File:langlaagte.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886]]\nThe region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherers who used stone tools.

The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary a name and governmental organisation for the area. Jan, Johann and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some.

The original miners' camp, under the informal leadership of Col [[Ignatius Ferreira]], was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because the water was available there, and because of the site's proximity to the diggings. Following upon the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of [[Ferreirasdorp]].

The economy of Johannesburg depended upon hundreds of thousands of cheap black workers who performed most of the semi-skilled and unskilled work, and which forced the government to make some exceptions to ''apartheid'' in order to keep Johannesburg functioning as South Africa's economic capital.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 86\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 86.</ref> In the 1950s, the government began a policy of building townships for blacks outside of Johannesburg to provide workers for Johannesburg.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 86\"/> [[Soweto]], a township founded for black workers coming to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, was intended to house 50,000 people, but soon was the home of ten times that number as thousands of rural blacks came to Johannesburg.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 92.</ref> It was estimated in 1989 that the population of Soweto was equal to that of Johannesburg, if not greater.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\"/>\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Straatbeeld in Johannesburg TMnr 10004282.jpg|thumb|Street scene in Johannesburg in 1970]]\nIn March 1960, Johannesburg witnessed widespread demonstrations against ''apartheid'' in response to the [[Sharpeville massacre]].<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 80\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 80.</ref> On 11 July 1963, the [[South African Police]] raided a house in the Johannesburg suburb of [[Rivonia]] where nine members of the banned [[African National Congress]] (ANC) were arrested on charges of planning sabotage.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 92\"/> The nine arrested included one Indo-South African, two whites and six blacks, one of whom was the future president [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 91.</ref> At their trial, the accused freely admitted that they were guilty of what they were charged with, namely of planning to blow up the hydro-electric system of Johannesburg to shut down the gold mines, but Mandela argued to the court that the ANC had tried non-violent resistance to ''apartheid'' and failed, leaving him with no other choice.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\"/> The trial made Mandela into a national figure and a symbol of resistance to ''apartheid''.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 91\"/>\n \t\nOn 16 June 1976, demonstrations broke out in Soweto over a government decree that black school-children be educated in Afrikaans instead of English, and after the police fired on the demonstrations, rioting against ''apartheid'' began in Soweto and spread into the greater Johannesburg area.<ref>Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 93.</ref> About 575 people, the majority of whom were black, were killed in the [[Soweto uprising]] of 1976.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick page 80\"/> Between 1984\u201386, South Africa was in turmoil as a series of nationwide protests, strikes and riots took place against  ''apartheid'', and the black townships around Johannesburg were scenes of some of the fiercest struggles between the police and anti-''apartheid'' demonstrators.<ref>Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 100.</ref>\n\nThe central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres.

It was known throughout its redevelopment as the Newtown cultural precinct it was therefore important to stage, old renovated buildings as the setting of the new precinct. Demolishing the old structures and replacing them with new buildings would not have achieved the same effect. Everyone played their part in the marketing, branding and the new identity of the precinct, the City, heritage bodies, heritage practitioners, private companies all played a part. The old warehouse industrial buildings that once lay decaying in Newtown are now synonymous with culture and flair.\n\nLike many cities around the world, there is an increasing focus on the rejuvenation of the inner city of Johannesburg.  One of these initiatives is the Maboneng District located on the south-eastern side of the CBD.  Originally a hub for art, it has expanded to include restaurants, entertainment venues and retail stores as well as accommodation and hotels.  Maboneng calls itself \"a place of inspiration \u2013 a creative hub, a place to do business, a destination for visitors and a safe, integrated community for residents.

The former [[Central Business District]] is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the [[Jukskei River]] while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the [[Klip River]]. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.\n\nJohannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers \u2013 the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Orange River|Orange]]. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with \"fontein\", meaning \"spring\" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams&nbsp;\u2013 giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, \"the ridge of white waters\". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.<ref>Lucille Davie ''Water, water every day'' www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.</ref>\n\nThe site was not chosen solely for its streams, however. One of the main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet's gold.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Johannesburg-South-Africa|title=Johannesburg|last=Campbell|first=James T.|date=19 August 2015|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Traffic in the midst of the rain and fog.jpg|thumb|Rain and fog in July 2016]]\n[[File:A Johannesburg Summers Day.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial photograph of summer rain clouds over Johannesburg.

The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]], a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].\n\nGreater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than {{convert|200|sqmi|km2|spell=in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\":0\"/> Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the local African middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city with the city starting to sprawl northwards and multiple secondary CBDs forming in the north towards Pretoria.\n\nTraditionally the northern and north-western suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as [[Hyde Park, South Africa|Hyde Park]], [[Sandhurst, South Africa|Sandhurst]], [[Northcliff]], [[Hurlingham, Gauteng|Hurlingham]], [[Bryanston, Gauteng|Bryanston]] and [[Houghton, South Africa|Houghton]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] made his home. The north-western area, in particular, is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] once the centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring restaurants and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], [[AFDA]] (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the [[University of Johannesburg]].\n\nTo the southwest of the city centre is [[Soweto]], a township constructed during apartheid for housing displaced black South Africans then living in areas designated for white settlement. To the south of Johannesburg is [[Lenasia]], a predominantly Asian neighbourhood which was constructed during apartheid specifically to house Asians. Closer to Alexandria communities like Glenazel and Norwood have been integral in the urban landscape of Johannesburg.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Zion Christian Church]], [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Baptist Union of Southern Africa]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa]] ([[World Methodist Council]]), [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Church of Africa]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg]] ([[Catholic Church]]) and the [[Johannesburg South Africa Temple]] ([[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]).<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa SouthAfrica], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques, [[Hindu]] temples, A Sikh Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Sandton and a large number of synagogues.\n\n== Cityscape ==\nThe city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Johannesburg rebuked over 'world-class city' advert|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2013}}</ref> Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD.  Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.\n\nDue to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the [[multiple nuclei model]] in [[human geography]] terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. [[Randburg]] and [[Sandton]] form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of {{convert|6|km2|0|abbr=out}}.

Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being [[Victorian Colonial]], [[Edwardian Baroque]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernism]].\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg City Parks}}\nParks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by [[Johannesburg City Parks|Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo]].<ref name=\"cityparks-whoweare\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php/whoweare |title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage |publisher=Johannesburg City Parks |accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world.

The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nJohannesburg is served principally by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. [[Lanseria Airport]], located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of [[Sandton]], is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], Botswana, and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]]. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]] and [[Grand Central Airport]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first [[Boeing 747SP]] now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.\n\nJohannesburg shares a network of [[Metropolitan Routes in Johannesburg|metropolitan routes]] with [[Krugersdorp]] and [[Ekurhuleni]].\n\nJohannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Minibus taxi#Minibus taxi|minibus taxis]]. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination.

The northern areas, including the business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], are served by the rapid [[railway|rail]] link [[Gautrain]].\n\n[[File:Gautrain..., O R Tambo Intl Airport South Africa.jpg|thumb|Gautrain station at OR Tambo Airport]]\nA part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]] has made provision for a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the [[OR Tambo International Airport]]. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the North-South line include Johannesburg's [[Johannesburg Park Station|Park Station]] (underground), [[Rosebank (Gautrain station)|Rosebank]] (underground), [[Sandton (Gautrain station)|Sandton]] (underground), [[Marlboro (Gautrain station)|Marlboro]] (above-ground and raised), [[Midrand (Gautrain station)|Midrand]], [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria]] Station and [[Hatfield (Gautrain station)|Hatfield]]. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via [[Rhodesfield (Gautrain station)|Rhodesfield]] (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, this may sound like an insignificant amount however it is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.\n\nThe east\u2013west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], while the north\u2013the south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.\n\nThe rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Rapid Rail|url=http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/|publisher=Gautrain}}</ref> An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs.

It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]], [[Scania AB]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in [[Gandhi Square]], where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.\n\nIn 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount  ( calculated according to distance approx $0.5 per 5&nbsp; km). The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2|title=Bus Rapid Transit bleeding cash|last=|first=|date=|work=Fin24|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg freeways}}\nThe fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous \"beltways\" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, \"The Concrete Highway\". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=sanral>{{cite web|title=Busiest freeways in southern hemisphere|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26|publisher=SA National Roads Agency|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> It is claimed<ref name=sanral/><ref>{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=18 perish in road accidents|url=http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=NewsDay|date=10 May 2013}}</ref> that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.\n\nJohannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} It has the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]], [[N12 road (South Africa)|N12]], [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]], [[N17 road (South Africa)|N17]], [[R21 (Gauteng)|R21]], [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24]] and the [[R59 (Free State)|R59]], all leading to Johannesburg.

A diverse and evolving city, Johannesburg boasts a vibrant art scene and a variety of works that range from sculptures to murals to pieces by internationally renowned artists like [[William Kentridge]] and [[Gerhard Marx]]'s [[Fire Walker]]. Many pieces are developed through community workshops, such as the Vilakazi Street sculptures. Others are functional, such as street furniture found in [[Hillbrow]] and the city centre.\n\nAs part of the Johannesburg Development Agency's (JDA) policy to make city areas desirable to potential investors, the organisation has identified public art as a way to improve the urban experience of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=JDA's PUBLIC ART STRATEGY 2011-2016|url=http://www.jda.org.za/docs/publi_art_strategy.pdf|website=www.jda.org.za|publisher=Johannesburg Development Agency|accessdate=31 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401054603/http://www.jda.org.za/docs/publi_art_strategy.pdf|archive-date=1 April 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The JDA spends 1 percent of all projects of over R10-million on public art.<ref>{{cite web|title=Place making and public art|url=http://www.jda.org.za/index.php/whatwedo/programmes/inner-city|website=www.jda.org.za|publisher=Johannesburg Development Agency|accessdate=31 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331210050/http://www.jda.org.za/index.php/whatwedo/programmes/inner-city|archive-date=31 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nAfter the [[Group Areas Act]] was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by [[urban blight]]. Thousands of poor black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like [[Soweto]] and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by [[landlord]]s, especially in high-density areas, such as [[Hillbrow]].

They are based at the city's [[FNB Stadium|FNB]], [[Orlando Stadium|Orlando]], [[Dobsonville Stadium|Dobsonville]] and [[Bidvest Stadium|Bidvest]] stadiums. Several large-scale league and cup games are played at [[Soccer City]] the venue of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] final. First Division teams are [[Jomo Cosmos]] and [[FC AK]].\nKatlehong City and Alexandra United, play at [[Alexandra Stadium|Alexandra]] and Reiger Park stadium respectively.\n\n=== Cricket ===\nCricket is one of the more popular sports. In cricket, the [[Highveld Lions]] represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the [[North West Province|North West]] at the [[Wanderers Stadium]] which was the venue for the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] Final in which [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] successfully defended their title against [[India national cricket team|India]].

While gold mining no longer takes place within the [[city limits]], most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the [[JSE Limited|JSE]] although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.\n\nThe Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of [[Lesotho]], the biggest of which is the [[Lesotho Highlands Water Project]], but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.\n\nThe container terminal at [[City Deep, Gauteng|City Deep]] is known to be the largest \"[[dry port]]\" in the world,{{Citation needed|reason=Johannesburg not mentioned in dry port article, largest dry port in world is significant claim|date=March 2015}} with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]] arriving in Johannesburg.

Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of several attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred on [[History of South Africa|history]] museums, such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] (with related visits to [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]]) and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\nVisitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the [[Carlton Centre]], in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At {{convert|223|m|abbr=off}}, it is the highest office building in Africa, however soon to be eclipsed by [[The Leonardo (Sandton)]], and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The nearby [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. Also a large draw for tourists is [[Gold Reef City]], a [[theme park]] which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an [[gold mine|underground mine]] tour; other attractions include a large [[amusement park]] and a popular [[African dance|tribal dancing]] show.\n\nOn the culture front, the city has several [[art museum]]s, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The [[Joburg Theatre]] is South Africa's foremost [[Theatre#Producing vs. presenting|\"receiving house\"]] of live entertainment\u2014presenting world class theatre, both local and international. The suburbs of [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Newtown, Johannesburg|Newtown]], [[Parkhurst, Gauteng|Parkhurst]], [[Norwood, Gauteng|Norwood]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]] and [[Greenside, Gauteng|Greenside]] are popular for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars.\n\nShopping is often popular with tourists, as the city offers a range of venues and experiences, from numerous upmarket shopping malls such as [[Sandton City]], [[Mall of Africa]], and [[Nelson Mandela Square]], to various markets and [[flea market]]s, such as the [[Oriental Plaza]] and the [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank Flea Market]]; the latter are popular for souvenirs and [[African art]]. See [[Johannesburg#Retail|above]]. (Cultural) tourists also visit the \"Mai Mai Market\"<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=308&Itemid=52 Mai Mai Market] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114145111/https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=308&Itemid=52 |date=14 November 2017 }}, joburg.org.za</ref> (\"Ezinyangeni\"&nbsp;\u2013 the place of healers; located on the eastern wing of the city centre) dedicated to traditional herbs and [[sangoma|traditional healers]].\n\nThe [[Cradle of Humankind]] a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] is {{convert|25|km}} to the northwest of the city. The [[Sterkfontein]] [[fossil]] site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' and the first near-complete skeleton of an early ''[[Australopithecine]]''. Other attractions in this area include the [[Lesedi Cultural Village]], while [[Magaliesburg, Gauteng|Magaliesburg]] and the [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] are popular weekend (and holiday) destinations for Johannesburg residents. The Origins Centre Museum, see below, covers the [[Human evolution#Out of Africa|origins of humankind in Africa]], and houses an extensive collection of [[rock art]].\n\nJohannesburg and environs offer various options to visitors wishing to view [[wildlife]], in addition to the [[Johannesburg Zoo]], one of the largest in South Africa. The [[Lion Park]] nature reserve, next to Lesedi Cultural Village, is home to over 80 lions and various other game, while the [[Krugersdorp Nature Reserve]], a 1500 [[Hectare|ha]] [[game reserve]], is a forty-minute drive from the city centre. The De Wildt Cheetah Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dewildt.co.za/|title=The Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre - De Wildt|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> in the [[Magaliesberg]] runs a successful breeding program for [[cheetah]], [[African wild dog|wild dog]] and other [[endangered species]].

Originally an acronym for \"South-Western Townships\", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for Blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent. These areas were designated as non-white areas in accordance with the segregationist policies of the South African government known as [[Apartheid]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nControversy surrounds the origin of the name. There was quite a number of people with the name \"Johannes\" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the [[Volksraad]] and was Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as [[Paul Kruger]]), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883\u20131900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility.\n\nPrecise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to [[England]] to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated [[Rissik Street Post Office]] is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/thread/rissik-street-post-office-johannesburg|title=Rissik Street Post Office Johannesburg - The Heritage Portal|website=www.theheritageportal.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111105718/http://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Johannesburg City Hall|City Hall]] is also located on Rissik Street.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Johannesburg|Timeline of Johannesburg}}\n[[File:langlaagte.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886]]\nThe region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherers who used stone tools.

The former [[Central Business District]] is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the [[Jukskei River]] while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the [[Klip River]]. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.\n\nJohannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers \u2013 the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Orange River|Orange]]. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with \"fontein\", meaning \"spring\" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams&nbsp;\u2013 giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, \"the ridge of white waters\". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.<ref>Lucille Davie ''Water, water every day'' www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.</ref>\n\nThe site was not chosen solely for its streams, however. One of the main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold.

The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]], a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].\n\nGreater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than {{convert|200|sqmi|km2|spell=in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\":0\"/> Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the local African middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city with the city starting to sprawl northwards and multiple secondary CBDs forming in the north towards Pretoria.\n\nTraditionally the northern and north-western suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as [[Hyde Park, South Africa|Hyde Park]], [[Sandhurst, South Africa|Sandhurst]], [[Northcliff]], [[Hurlingham, Gauteng|Hurlingham]], [[Bryanston, Gauteng|Bryanston]] and [[Houghton, South Africa|Houghton]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] made his home. The north-western area, in particular, is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] once the centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring restaurants and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], [[AFDA]] (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the [[University of Johannesburg]].\n\nTo the southwest of the city centre is [[Soweto]], a township constructed during apartheid for housing displaced black South Africans then living in areas designated for white settlement. To the south of Johannesburg is [[Lenasia]], a predominantly Asian neighbourhood which was constructed during apartheid specifically to house Asians. Closer to Alexandria communities like Glenazel and Norwood have been integral in the urban landscape of Johannesburg.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Zion Christian Church]], [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Baptist Union of Southern Africa]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa]] ([[World Methodist Council]]), [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Church of Africa]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg]] ([[Catholic Church]]) and the [[Johannesburg South Africa Temple]] ([[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]).<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa SouthAfrica], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques, [[Hindu]] temples, A Sikh Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Sandton and a large number of synagogues.\n\n== Cityscape ==\nThe city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Johannesburg rebuked over 'world-class city' advert|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2013}}</ref> Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD.  Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.\n\nDue to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the [[multiple nuclei model]] in [[human geography]] terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. [[Randburg]] and [[Sandton]] form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of {{convert|6|km2|0|abbr=out}}.

The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as [[IBM]], [[Absa Group Limited|Absa]], [[BHP Billiton]], [[Willis Group]], [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank]], [[Nedbank]] and [[Standard Bank]]. Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being [[Victorian Colonial]], [[Edwardian Baroque]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernism]].\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg City Parks}}\nParks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by [[Johannesburg City Parks|Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo]].<ref name=\"cityparks-whoweare\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php/whoweare |title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage |publisher=Johannesburg City Parks |accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world.

The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nJohannesburg is served principally by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. [[Lanseria Airport]], located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of [[Sandton]], is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], Botswana, and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]]. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]] and [[Grand Central Airport]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first [[Boeing 747SP]] now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.\n\nJohannesburg shares a network of [[Metropolitan Routes in Johannesburg|metropolitan routes]] with [[Krugersdorp]] and [[Ekurhuleni]].\n\nJohannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Minibus taxi#Minibus taxi|minibus taxis]]. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination.

Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations.

A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, this may sound like an insignificant amount however it is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.\n\nThe east\u2013west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], while the north\u2013the south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.\n\nThe rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Rapid Rail|url=http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/|publisher=Gautrain}}</ref> An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs. This is the first new major railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.<ref>{{cite web|title=Railway country. 150 Years of Rail in South Africa|url=http://www.transnetfreightrail-tfr.net/Heritage/150years/150YearsRail.pdf|publisher=Transnet}}</ref>\n\n[[File:N1 road South Africa.jpg|thumb|The [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] is a major freeway in Johannesburg]]\nIn 2010, a [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] was proposed between Johannesburg and [[Durban]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html|accessdate=19 September 2010|title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding}}</ref>\n\nJohannesburg is served by a bus fleet operated by [http://www.mbus.co.za/ Metrobus], a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]], [[Scania AB]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in [[Gandhi Square]], where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.\n\nIn 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount  ( calculated according to distance approx $0.5 per 5&nbsp; km). The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2|title=Bus Rapid Transit bleeding cash|last=|first=|date=|work=Fin24|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Johannesburg freeways}}\nThe fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous \"beltways\" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, \"The Concrete Highway\". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=sanral>{{cite web|title=Busiest freeways in southern hemisphere|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26|publisher=SA National Roads Agency|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> It is claimed<ref name=sanral/><ref>{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=18 perish in road accidents|url=http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=NewsDay|date=10 May 2013}}</ref> that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.\n\nJohannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} It has the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]], [[N12 road (South Africa)|N12]], [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]], [[N17 road (South Africa)|N17]], [[R21 (Gauteng)|R21]], [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24]] and the [[R59 (Free State)|R59]], all leading to Johannesburg.

''[[Beeld]]'' is a leading Afrikaans newspaper for the city and the country,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} while the Sunday newspaper ''[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]'' is the third largest selling newspaper in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n''[[The Sowetan]]'' is one of a number of titles catering for the black market although in recent years it competes against newly arrived [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]]. The ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' is an investigative liberal newspaper while ''[[The Citizen (newspaper, South Africa)|The Citizen]]'' is a tabloid-style paper, and ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'' is a local newspaper that mostly covers [[Gauteng]]-related issues. The ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]'' is the most widely read national Sunday newspaper.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} ''True Love'' is the most widely read women's magazine,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} catering primarily to the up-and-coming middle class black female market, and published by Media 24. ''[[The Times (South Africa)|The Times]]'' is a national newspaper that covers current issues.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nMedia ownership is relatively complicated, with a number of cross shareholdings which have been rationalised in recent years, resulting in the movement of some ownership into the hands of black shareholders. This has been accompanied by a growth in black editorship and journalism.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Johannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as [[YFM]], Metro FM, [[Phalaphala FM]], Talk Radio 702, [[94.7 Highveld Stereo|Highveld Stereo]] now known as 947, [[5FM]], UJ FM and Kaya FM and Classic FM. The number of radio stations has increased in recent years as the government has sold off frequencies to private companies. Johannesburg is also the headquarters of state-owned broadcaster [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and pay-broadcast network Multichoice which distributes [[M-Net]] and DStv a digital satellite service, while [[etv (South Africa)|eTV]] also has a presence in the city.

Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of several attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred on [[History of South Africa|history]] museums, such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] (with related visits to [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]]) and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\nVisitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the [[Carlton Centre]], in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At {{convert|223|m|abbr=off}}, it is the highest office building in Africa, however soon to be eclipsed by [[The Leonardo (Sandton)]], and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The nearby [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. Also a large draw for tourists is [[Gold Reef City]], a [[theme park]] which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an [[gold mine|underground mine]] tour; other attractions include a large [[amusement park]] and a popular [[African dance|tribal dancing]] show.\n\nOn the culture front, the city has several [[art museum]]s, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The [[Joburg Theatre]] is South Africa's foremost [[Theatre#Producing vs. presenting|\"receiving house\"]] of live entertainment\u2014presenting world class theatre, both local and international. The suburbs of [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Newtown, Johannesburg|Newtown]], [[Parkhurst, Gauteng|Parkhurst]], [[Norwood, Gauteng|Norwood]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]] and [[Greenside, Gauteng|Greenside]] are popular for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars.\n\nShopping is often popular with tourists, as the city offers a range of venues and experiences, from numerous upmarket shopping malls such as [[Sandton City]], [[Mall of Africa]], and [[Nelson Mandela Square]], to various markets and [[flea market]]s, such as the [[Oriental Plaza]] and the [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank Flea Market]]; the latter are popular for souvenirs and [[African art]].

The [[Sterkfontein]] [[fossil]] site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' and the first near-complete skeleton of an early ''[[Australopithecine]]''. Other attractions in this area include the [[Lesedi Cultural Village]], while [[Magaliesburg, Gauteng|Magaliesburg]] and the [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] are popular weekend (and holiday) destinations for Johannesburg residents. The Origins Centre Museum, see below, covers the [[Human evolution#Out of Africa|origins of humankind in Africa]], and houses an extensive collection of [[rock art]].\n\nJohannesburg and environs offer various options to visitors wishing to view [[wildlife]], in addition to the [[Johannesburg Zoo]], one of the largest in South Africa.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

Before this pride, the [[Pink triangle]] was used as a symbol for the [[LGBT Movement]] but it represented a dark chapter in the history of same-sex rights.

Before this pride, the [[Pink triangle]] was used as a symbol for the [[LGBT Movement]] but it represented a dark chapter in the history of same-sex rights. The [[Pink triangle]] was created by the Nazis during [[World War II]] to identify and stigmatize [[homosexuals]] in the same way the [[Star of David]] was used against [[Jews]] and others regarded as viruses or sub-humans in the social fabric. It functioned as a [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] tool of oppression.

{"title_page": "Addled Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Parliaments of England 1601}}\n\nThe '''Parliament of 1614''' was the second [[Parliament of England]] of the reign of [[James VI and I]], which sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. This spreading, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. The Commons were pitted against the Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 MPs sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James fell back on new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the [[Blessed Parliament]], was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source.

Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614.

Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614.

Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament''' for this legislative failure.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. This spreading, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. The Commons were pitted against the Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 MPs sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James fell back on new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the [[Blessed Parliament]], was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Prologue===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]].

James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton was finally gratified, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.
