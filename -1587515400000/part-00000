McCarran was born in [[Reno, Nevada]], attended [[University of Nevada, Reno|Nevada State University]], and was a farmer and rancher.  In 1902 he won election to the [[Nevada Assembly]], but in 1904 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Nevada State Senate]].  He completed private law studies and was admitted to the bar in 1905; in 1906 he won election as [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]]'s [[district attorney]]. He served a two-year term, after which he relocated to Reno.\n\nFrom 1913 to 1917, McCarran was an associate justice of the [[Supreme Court of Nevada]], and he served as chief justice from 1917 to 1919.  In 1932 McCarran defeated Republican incumbent [[Tasker Oddie]] for [[List of United States Senators from Nevada|Nevada's Class 3 Senate seat]] to become the state's first U.S. Senator born in Nevada; he was reelected three times, and served from 1933 until his death. In his Senate career, McCarran served as chairman of the District of Columbia, Judiciary, and Joint Foreign Economic Cooperation Committees. He died in [[Hawthorne, Nevada]] and was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Reno. [[McCarran International Airport]] in [[Las Vegas]] was later named in his honor.\n\nMcCarran is remembered as one of the few Democrats to reject the [[New Deal]]. In addition, he was a proponent of the aviation industry; he was a sponsor of the [[Civil Aeronautics Act]] of 1938, and was a proponent of establishing the [[United States Air Force]] as a separate entity from the [[United States Army|Army]]. McCarran was also an ardent anti-Communist, to the point of supporting fascists including [[Francisco Franco]] as a way to prevent its spread, and sponsored the [[McCarran Act]], otherwise known as the [[Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nMcCarran was born in [[Reno, Nevada]], the child of [[Irish American|Irish immigrants]] Margaret Shay and Patrick McCarran.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Blaine Terry|last2=Cottrell |first2=Robert C.|date=2010|title=Lives and Times - Individuals and Issues in American History Since 1865|url=https://archive.org/details/livestimesindivi0000brow|url-access=registration|location=Lanham, MD|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=[https://archive.org/details/livestimesindivi0000brow/page/173 173]|isbn=978-0-7425-6193-9}}</ref>  He was educated in Reno and in 1897, he graduated as [[valedictorian]] of his class at [[Reno High School]].<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\">{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Jerome E.|date=1982|title=Pat McCarran, Political Boss of Nevada|url=https://archive.org/details/patmccarranpolit0000edwa|url-access=registration|location=Reno, NV|publisher=University of Nevada Press|isbn=978-0-87417-071-9}}</ref>{{rp|[https://archive.org/details/patmccarranpolit0000edwa/page/3 3]\u20134, 7}} McCarran's mother was a devout Catholic, and he inherited his mother's faith.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|1-2}}\n\nHe attended the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], but withdrew to work on the family sheep ranch when his father suffered an injury.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/> He [[reading law|studied law]] with [[William Woodburn]], and served in the [[Nevada Assembly]] from 1903 to 1905.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/> In 1904 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Nevada State Senate]].<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/> He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1905, and in 1906 he was elected [[district attorney]] of [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]].<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/> He served one term, 1907 to 1909, after which he moved to Reno to continue practicing law.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>\n\nSome sources incorrectly state that McCarran received a bachelor's degree in 1901 and a master's degree in 1915.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rocha|first=Guy|date=May 2001|title= Myth #64: Getting the Facts Down Pat|url=http://nsla.nv.gov/Archives/Myths/Getting_the_Facts_Down_Pat/ |location=Carson City|publisher=Nevada State Library and Archives|page=1}}</ref> In fact, he did not receive a bachelor's degree at all, and the [[master of arts]] he received from [[University of Nevada, Reno|Nevada State University]] in 1915 was an [[honorary degree]].<ref>{{cite book|last=University of Nevada|date=November 1, 1922|title=Quarterly Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xXOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA37&dq=mccarran+%22university+of+nevada%22+%22M.A.%22+1915#v=onepage&q=mccarran%20%22university%20of%20nevada%22%20%22M.A.%22%201915&f=false|location=Reno, NV|publisher=University of Nevada|page=33}}</ref> He also received an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] from [[Georgetown University]] in 1943,<ref>{{cite news|title=Georgetown U. to Confer Degree on Senator M'Carran|work= The Guardian (Little Rock)|page=5|date=September 10, 1943|url=http://arc.stparchive.com/Archive/ARC/ARC09101943p05.php}}</ref> and an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] from the University of Nevada in 1945.<ref>{{cite book|last=University of Nevada Board of Regents|date=1946|title=Biennial Report of the Board of Regents of the State University of Nevada|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y2RMAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22mccarran%22+%22nevada%22+%22ll.d.%22+1945&q=mccarran|location=Reno|publisher=University of Nevada|page=21}}</ref>\n\n==Judicial career==\nIn 1912, McCarran was elected to the [[Supreme Court of Nevada]], succeeding John G.

As Pittman was the senior senator, and McCarran only a freshman senator, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] tended to side with Pittman in the struggle for the control of patronage, thus earning McCarran's enmity.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|69-70}} Much of McCarran's opposition to the New Deal stemmed from his anger and spite that Pittman was able to make more patronage appointments relating to New Deal projects in Nevada than he was.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|69-70}} Pittman's increasing serious drinking problems rendered him somewhat ineffective in his last years, and McCarran was able to gradually take over the Democratic Party in Nevada, becoming the dominant force within the Nevada Democrats by 1938.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|69-70, 74}}\n\nDespite being a Democrat, beginning in the late 1930s McCarran came into increasing opposition with Roosevelt, believing that Roosevelt's \"second\" New Deal policies following his 1936 reelection were too liberal.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}} Further complicating the picture was that by 1939, Roosevelt was convinced that the Danzig crisis would probably lead to a war in Europe, and that it was in the best interests of the United States to ensure that Britain and France defeated Germany, which would require relaxing the various Neutrality Acts passed by Congress earlier in the 1930s. As Pittman was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, his co-operation was essential. Thus for foreign policy reasons, Roosevelt had to back Pittman despite the way he was losing control of the Nevada Democrats to McCarran.  From 1939 to 1941, the isolationist McCarran opposed Roosevelt's foreign policy of aiding the Allies, accusing the president of trying to involve America in a war that not its business.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}} In particular, the Catholic conservative McCarran was outraged by the decision of the Roosevelt administration to offer military and economic aid to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, arguing that it was immoral to assist the \"godless communists\".<ref name=\"auto3\">Ybarra, Michael J. ''Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt'', Hanover: Steerforth Press, 2004 page 271</ref> In a speech on the Senate floor, McCarran declared that \"I despise Mr. Hitler and all that he stands for, and equally I despise Mr. Stalin and all that he stands for\", before going on to argue that through he did not like Nazi Germany that he regarded the Third Reich as the lesser evil compared to the Soviet Union, and felt it was profoundly wrong for the United States to offer aid to the nation he felt was the greater evil.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> McCarran was greatly influenced by a statement from the Catholic Church in the spring of 1937 declaring that \"Communism is intrinsically wrong, and no one who would save Christian civilization may collaborate with it in any undertaking\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/> McCarran supported the war effort after the United States entered the conflict following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nMcCarran's positions on several key committees, most notably Appropriations and Judiciary, gave him significant influence that he used to obtain federal funding for Nevada, a fact which contributed substantially to his home state popularity.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|122-123}} In 1944, McCarran was challenged by [[Vail M. Pittman]] in the Democratic primary, leading to an especially hard-fought campaign that was finally won by McCarran.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|119}} At the time, Pittman explained his loss as due to McCarran's ability to bring federal money to fund infrastructure projects in Nevada, at the time a relatively backward state, saying: <blockquote>\"McCarran had a pet project in nearly every town in the state. Housing projects, sewage systems, airfields, power projects, school houses and heaven knows what...People remember the little personal favors and the things that help financially, but they forgot all the things done that are more remote, but more vital\".<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|119}}</blockquote> McCarran's biographer, Jerome Edwards, endorsed this theory, arguing that the narrow margin of McCarran's victory over Pittman in the Democratic primary suggests that a substantial number of registered Democrats in Nevada were dissatisfied with him, but his ability to have the federal government built infrastructure projects that Nevada could not afford on its own explains his enduring appeal in his state.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|119}} Outside of Nevada, McCarran had the reputation of a narrow-minded and parochial  senator who put the interests of Nevada ahead of the wider national interests; the same reasons that made him unpopular outside of Nevada made him popular there as he had the reputation of a dogged, relentless fighter for Nevada's interests.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}} McCarran's repeatedly attempted via filibusters to force the federal government to stockpile silver, a measure that would have benefited Nevada where silver mining was a major industry, but was widely denounced outside of Nevada as a plan for wasteful spending designed only to benefit his state.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}} After Pearl Harbor, McCarran in his speeches to the Senate made much of the fact that most of American industry was concentrated in the Northeast and the Midwest, and argued that the federal government had the duty to ensure that war production was shifted to less industrialized states like Nevada.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94-95}}\n\nMcCarran also was well known for his efforts to help constituents with any problems that they might have with the federal government, often going to extraordinary lengths.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|122-124}} For instance, when a teenager from Nevada stolen 150 volumes from the [[Library of Congress]] and mutilated hundreds of more books, his parents asked McCarran to intervene to ensure that their son was not prosecuted.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|123}} McCarran duly called up the Washington D.C. District Attorney  [[Edward Curran]] and the FBI director, [[J. Edgar Hoover]], saying he not want the teenager prosecuted as that would cost him the votes of the parents of the bibliophobic vandal-thief, and owing to the senator's advocacy, the teenager was not prosecuted despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt and his theft and destruction of books costing thousands of dollars.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|1234}} in 1942, when a Reno couple learned that their son had been captured by the Japanese at Wake Island, they appealed to McCarran for help.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|123}} McCarran brought considerable pressure to bear on the State Department to set up a prisoner exchange, saying that it essential for him to keep the two votes of the parents of the POW, through the State Department insisted that the United States was not in the business of prisoner exchanges, which would involve making deals with the Axis powers that the American people would find unsavory.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|124-125}}\n\nIn the 1940s-50s, 40% of Senate bills had to first be approved by the Senate Judiciary committee, giving McCarran immense power as he could easily \"kill\" these bills in his committee<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}}<ref name=\"auto1\">Oshinksy, David ''A Conspiracy So Immense'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 207.</ref> Other committee chairmen had the same powers over bills related to their fields, but the number of bills that had to passed by the Judiciary Committee made McCarran far more influential than the other senate committee chairmen.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Over time, McCarran used his position as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to engage in much deal-making that allowed him to collect a significant number of political \"debts\", making him of the most powerful Senators.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|69-70}} McCarran's conservative politics, which pitted him against first Roosevelt and then Truman, frequently led to the question being asked why he continue to sit as a Democrat instead of defecting over to the Republicans. In 1950, when McCarran asked that question by a reporter, he responded: \"I can do more good by staying in the Democratic Party and watching the lunatic fringe-the Roosevelt crowd\".<ref name=\"auto\">Oshinksy, David ''A Conspiracy So Immense'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 208.</ref> McCarran was against the plans of the Roosevelt-Truman administrations for federal health insurance and increased education spending; favored restricting the power of unions; was opposed to increased immigration, saying he did not want \"undesirables from abroad\" coming to America; and was against the United Nations, which he called \"a haven for spies and Communists\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he appointed his friend, Senator [[James Eastland]], a well known white supremacist and segregationist, as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Civil Rights.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Such was McCarran's power that in July 1952, the liberal ''Washington Post'' newspaper (which was not friendly to the conservative McCarran) declared in an article: \"It sums the character of this congress to state an unquestionable fact: that its most important member was Patrick A.

It also stiffened the existing law relating to the admission, exclusion and deportation of dangerous aliens (as defined by the McCarran Internal Security Act).

McCarran was born in [[Reno, Nevada]], attended [[University of Nevada, Reno|Nevada State University]], and was a farmer and rancher.  In 1902 he won election to the [[Nevada Assembly]], but in 1904 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Nevada State Senate]].  He completed private law studies and was admitted to the bar in 1905; in 1906 he won election as [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]]'s [[district attorney]]. He served a two-year term, after which he relocated to Reno.\n\nFrom 1913 to 1917, McCarran was an associate justice of the [[Supreme Court of Nevada]], and he served as chief justice from 1917 to 1919.  In 1932 McCarran defeated Republican incumbent [[Tasker Oddie]] for [[List of United States Senators from Nevada|Nevada's Class 3 Senate seat]] to become the state's first U.S. Senator born in Nevada; he was reelected three times, and served from 1933 until his death. In his Senate career, McCarran served as chairman of the District of Columbia, Judiciary, and Joint Foreign Economic Cooperation Committees. He died in [[Hawthorne, Nevada]] and was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Reno. [[McCarran International Airport]] in [[Las Vegas]] was later named in his honor.\n\nMcCarran is remembered as one of the few Democrats to reject the [[New Deal]]. In addition, he was a proponent of the aviation industry; he was a sponsor of the [[Civil Aeronautics Act]] of 1938, and was a proponent of establishing the [[United States Air Force]] as a separate entity from the [[United States Army|Army]].

As Pittman was the senior senator, and McCarran only a freshman senator, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] tended to side with Pittman in the struggle for the control of patronage, thus earning McCarran's enmity.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|69-70}} Much of McCarran's opposition to the New Deal stemmed from his anger and spite that Pittman was able to make more patronage appointments relating to New Deal projects in Nevada than he was.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|69-70}} Pittman's increasing serious drinking problems rendered him somewhat ineffective in his last years, and McCarran was able to gradually take over the Democratic Party in Nevada, becoming the dominant force within the Nevada Democrats by 1938.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|69-70, 74}}\n\nDespite being a Democrat, beginning in the late 1930s McCarran came into increasing opposition with Roosevelt, believing that Roosevelt's \"second\" New Deal policies following his 1936 reelection were too liberal.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}} Further complicating the picture was that by 1939, Roosevelt was convinced that the Danzig crisis would probably lead to a war in Europe, and that it was in the best interests of the United States to ensure that Britain and France defeated Germany, which would require relaxing the various Neutrality Acts passed by Congress earlier in the 1930s. As Pittman was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, his co-operation was essential. Thus for foreign policy reasons, Roosevelt had to back Pittman despite the way he was losing control of the Nevada Democrats to McCarran.  From 1939 to 1941, the isolationist McCarran opposed Roosevelt's foreign policy of aiding the Allies, accusing the president of trying to involve America in a war that not its business.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}} In particular, the Catholic conservative McCarran was outraged by the decision of the Roosevelt administration to offer military and economic aid to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, arguing that it was immoral to assist the \"godless communists\".<ref name=\"auto3\">Ybarra, Michael J. ''Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt'', Hanover: Steerforth Press, 2004 page 271</ref> In a speech on the Senate floor, McCarran declared that \"I despise Mr. Hitler and all that he stands for, and equally I despise Mr. Stalin and all that he stands for\", before going on to argue that through he did not like Nazi Germany that he regarded the Third Reich as the lesser evil compared to the Soviet Union, and felt it was profoundly wrong for the United States to offer aid to the nation he felt was the greater evil.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> McCarran was greatly influenced by a statement from the Catholic Church in the summer of 1941 declaring that \"Communism is intrinsically wrong, and no one who would save Christian civilization may collaborate with it in any undertaking\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/> McCarran supported the war effort after the United States entered the conflict following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nMcCarran's positions on several key committees, most notably Appropriations and Judiciary, gave him significant influence that he used to obtain federal funding for Nevada, a fact which contributed substantially to his home state popularity.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|122-123}} In 1944, McCarran was challenged by [[Vail M. Pittman]] in the Democratic primary, leading to an especially hard-fought campaign that was finally won by McCarran.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|119}} At the time, Pittman explained his loss as due to McCarran's ability to bring federal money to fund infrastructure projects in Nevada, at the time a relatively backward state, saying: <blockquote>\"McCarran had a pet project in nearly every town in the state. Housing projects, sewage systems, airfields, power projects, school houses and heaven knows what...People remember the little personal favors and the things that help financially, but they forgot all the things done that are more remote, but more vital\".<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|119}}</blockquote> McCarran's biographer, Jerome Edwards, endorsed this theory, arguing that the narrow margin of McCarran's victory over Pittman in the Democratic primary suggests that a substantial number of registered Democrats in Nevada were dissatisfied with him, but his ability to have the federal government built infrastructure projects that Nevada could not afford on its own explains his enduring appeal in his state.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|119}} Outside of Nevada, McCarran had the reputation of a narrow-minded and parochial  senator who put the interests of Nevada ahead of the wider national interests; the same reasons that made him unpopular outside of Nevada made him popular there as he had the reputation of a dogged, relentless fighter for Nevada's interests.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}} McCarran's repeatedly attempted via filibusters to force the federal government to stockpile silver, a measure that would have benefited Nevada where silver mining was a major industry, but was widely denounced outside of Nevada as a plan for wasteful spending designed only to benefit his state.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}} After Pearl Harbor, McCarran in his speeches to the Senate made much of the fact that most of American industry was concentrated in the Northeast and the Midwest, and argued that the federal government had the duty to ensure that war production was shifted to less industrialized states like Nevada.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94-95}}\n\nMcCarran also was well known for his efforts to help constituents with any problems that they might have with the federal government, often going to extraordinary lengths.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|122-124}} For instance, when a teenager from Nevada stolen 150 volumes from the [[Library of Congress]] and mutilated hundreds of more books, his parents asked McCarran to intervene to ensure that their son was not prosecuted.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|123}} McCarran duly called up the Washington D.C. District Attorney  [[Edward Curran]] and the FBI director, [[J. Edgar Hoover]], saying he not want the teenager prosecuted as that would cost him the votes of the parents of the bibliophobic vandal-thief, and owing to the senator's advocacy, the teenager was not prosecuted despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt and his theft and destruction of books costing thousands of dollars.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|1234}} in 1942, when a Reno couple learned that their son had been captured by the Japanese at Wake Island, they appealed to McCarran for help.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|123}} McCarran brought considerable pressure to bear on the State Department to set up a prisoner exchange, saying that it essential for him to keep the two votes of the parents of the POW, through the State Department insisted that the United States was not in the business of prisoner exchanges, which would involve making deals with the Axis powers that the American people would find unsavory.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|124-125}}\n\nIn the 1940s-50s, 40% of Senate bills had to first be approved by the Senate Judiciary committee, giving McCarran immense power as he could easily \"kill\" these bills in his committee<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|94}}<ref name=\"auto1\">Oshinksy, David ''A Conspiracy So Immense'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 207.</ref> Other committee chairmen had the same powers over bills related to their fields, but the number of bills that had to passed by the Judiciary Committee made McCarran far more influential than the other senate committee chairmen.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Over time, McCarran used his position as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to engage in much deal-making that allowed him to collect a significant number of political \"debts\", making him of the most powerful Senators.<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|69-70}} McCarran's conservative politics, which pitted him against first Roosevelt and then Truman, frequently led to the question being asked why he continue to sit as a Democrat instead of defecting over to the Republicans. In 1950, when McCarran asked that question by a reporter, he responded: \"I can do more good by staying in the Democratic Party and watching the lunatic fringe-the Roosevelt crowd\".<ref name=\"auto\">Oshinksy, David ''A Conspiracy So Immense'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 208.</ref> McCarran was against the plans of the Roosevelt-Truman administrations for federal health insurance and increased education spending; favored restricting the power of unions; was opposed to increased immigration, saying he did not want \"undesirables from abroad\" coming to America; and was against the United Nations, which he called \"a haven for spies and Communists\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he appointed his friend, Senator [[James Eastland]], a well known white supremacist and segregationist, as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Civil Rights.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Such was McCarran's power that in July 1952, the liberal ''Washington Post'' newspaper (which was not friendly to the conservative McCarran) declared in an article: \"It sums the character of this congress to state an unquestionable fact: that its most important member was Patrick A. McCarran\".<ref name=\"polbossofNevada\"/>{{rp|122-147}}\n\n===Aviation advocate===\nMcCarran sponsored numerous laws concerning the early commercial aviation industry, including the [[Civil Aeronautics Act]] of 1938 and the Federal Airport Act of 1945.<ref name=\"Late_a_Senator\"/> He was an early advocate of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] as a military component separate from the Army, and began sponsoring the necessary legislation in 1933.<ref name=\"shaped\">[http://www.1st100.com/part2/mccarran.html The First 100 Persons Who Shaped Southern Nevada], 1st100.com; accessed December 12, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Other initiatives===\nIn 1945, McCarran co-sponsored the [[McCarran-Ferguson Act]], which exempted the insurance industry from most federal regulations, including [[Antitrust law|antitrust]] rules.

During the hearings, it became quickly apparent that McCarran and Lattimore deeply disliked each other with the two men frequently engaging in shouting matches and interrupting one another.<ref name=\"auto12\">Oshinksy, David ''A Conspiracy So Immense'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 209.</ref> When it was established that Lattimore had met President Truman in 1945 to discuss America's China policy, McCarran sarcastically commented: \"He visited the President once and forgot it\".<ref name=\"auto11\"/> McCarran demanded that Lattimore prove a negative, asking him \"can you say that the IPR and you had no influence on upon the Far Eastern experts in the State Department?\"<ref name=\"auto11\"/> McCarran worked to establish that Lattimore was the man responsible for the \"loss of China\", claiming General [[George Marshall]]'s policy during his 1945 to 1947 diplomatic mission to China during that country's civil war between nationalists and communists as being \"substantially the same\" as that recommended by Lattimore.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> At the end of the hearings, McCarran gave Lattimore what was described as a \"tongue lashing\", stating he was \"so flagrantly defiant\" and \"so persistent in his efforts to confuse and obscure the facts that the committee feels constrained to take due notice of his conduct...That he has uttered untruths stands clear in the record\".<ref name=\"auto11\"/> The report of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee written by McCarran concluded that China was indeed \"lost\" because of the policy followed by the State Department, declaring: \"Owen Lattimore and John Carter Vincent were influential in bringing about a change in United States policy...favorable to the Chinese Communists\".<ref name=\"auto12\"/> Through McCarran was careful not to call Lattimore a Soviet spy in his report, which would have allowed him to sue for libel, he came very close with the statement: \"Owen Lattimore was, from some time beginning in the 1930s, a conscious, articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy\".<ref name=\"auto12\"/>\n\nMcCarran subsequently pushed successfully for Lattimore to be [[indictment|indicted]] for [[perjury]]. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he held up the nomination of Truman's nominee for Attorney General, [[James McGranery]], until McGanery promised to indict Lattimore.<ref>Fried, Richard ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 page 149.</ref> Lattimore's lawyer [[Abe Fortas]] defended him by claiming McCarran had deliberately asked questions about arcane and obscure matters that took place in the 1930s in the hope that Lattimore would not be able to recall them properly, thereby giving grounds for perjury indictments. Federal Judge [[Luther Youngdahl]] later dismissed all seven charges against Lattimore on the grounds that the matters in question were insubstantial, of little concern to McCarran's inquiry, or the result of questions phrased in such a way that they could not be fairly answered.<ref>Haynes & Klehr ''Early Cold War Spies''; p. 47; US Senate, 82nd Congress, 2nd Session, Committee on the Judiciary, Institute of Pacific Relations, Report No. 2050, p. 224</ref>\n\nOn 27 July 1953, the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice of Panmunjom]] was signed ending the Korean War. McCarran attracted national attention when he criticized President Dwight Eisenhower on the Senate floor for signing the armistice, which he called \"a perpetuation of a fraud on this country and the United Nations\".<ref name=\"auto7\">Ybarra, Michael J. ''Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt'', Hanover: Steerforth Press, 2004 page 714</ref> McCarran believed that the United States and the rest of its allies fighting under the united Nations banner in Korea should have fought on until all of Korea was unified under the leadership of President [[Syngman Rhee]], which led him to see the armistice as a sort of American defeat.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n===Changes to immigration law===\nIn June 1952, McCarran joined [[Francis Walter]] in sponsorship of the [[McCarran&ndash;Walter Act]], a law that abolished racial restrictions found in United States immigration and naturalization statutes going back to the Naturalization Act of 1790 and also imposed more rigid restrictions on quotas for immigrants entering the United States. It also stiffened the existing law relating to the admission, exclusion and deportation of dangerous aliens (as defined by the McCarran Internal Security Act). In response to the act he made a well known statement:\n\n{{quote|I believe that this nation is the last hope of Western civilization and if this oasis of the world shall be overrun, perverted, contaminated or destroyed, then the last flickering light of humanity will be extinguished. I take no issue with those who would praise the contributions which have been made to our society by people of many races, of varied creeds and colors. America is indeed a joining together of many streams which go to form a mighty river which we call the American way. However, we have in the United States today hard-core, indigestible blocs which have not become integrated into the American way of life, but which, on the contrary are its deadly enemies. Today, as never before, untold millions are storming our gates for admission and those gates are cracking under the strain. The solution of the problems of Europe and Asia will not come through a transplanting of those problems en masse to the United States.... I do not intend to become prophetic, but if the enemies of this legislation succeed in riddling it to pieces, or in amending it beyond recognition, they will have contributed more to promote this nation's downfall than any other group since we achieved our independence as a nation.<ref>Senator Pat McCarran, Congressional Record, March 2, 1953, p. 1518</ref>}}\n\nSome of the immigration provisions of the act were later superseded by the [[1965 Immigration Act]], but the power of the government to deny visas for ideological reasons remained on the books another 25 years after that.<ref>{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Steven A. |date=February 2, 1990 |title=Legislation Eases Limits on Aliens |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/02/us/legislation-eases-limits-on-aliens.html |work=New York Times |location=New York, NY}}</ref>\n\n==Death and burial==\nMcCarran died in [[Hawthorne, Nevada]] on September 28, 1954, shortly after leaving the stage following a speech he gave at a political rally.<ref name=\"Late_a_Senator\"/><ref name=Dies>{{cite news |last=Sun Staff |date=September 29, 1954 |title=McCarran Dies: Senator Collapses After Speaking to Hawthorne Demo |url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/1954/sep/29/mccarran-dies/ |work=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |location=Las Vegas, NV}}</ref>  According to news accounts published after his death, McCarran suffered a fatal heart attack, after having recovered from attacks in 1951 and 1953.<ref name=\"Dies\"/> McCarran was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Reno.<ref>{{cite book |last=U.S. Congress |author-link= |date=August 6, 1959 |title=Report: Acceptance of Statue of Patrick A.

According to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the right to education includes the right to free, compulsory primary education for all, an obligation to develop secondary education accessible to all in particular by the progressive introduction of free secondary education, as well as an obligation to develop equitable access to higher education in particular by the progressive introduction of free higher education. The right to education also includes a responsibility to provide basic education for individuals who have not completed primary education. In addition to these access to education provisions, the right to education encompasses also the obligation to eliminate discrimination at all levels of the educational system, to set minimum standards, and to improve quality.

Generally, international instruments use the term in this sense and the right to education, as protected by [[international human rights instruments]], refers primarily to education in a narrow sense. The 1960 [[UNESCO]] Convention against Discrimination in Education defines education in Article 1(2) as: \"all types and levels of education, (including such) access to education, the standard and quality of education, and the conditions under which it is given.\"<ref name=\"pg19\">{{cite book|last=Beiter|first=Klaus Dieter|title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law|year=2005|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|location=The Hague|isbn=90-04-14704-7|page=19}}</ref>\n\nIn a wider sense [[education]] may describe \"all activities by which a human group transmits to its descendants a body of knowledge and skills and a moral code which enable the group to subsist\".<ref name=\"pg19\"/> In this sense education refers to the transmission to a subsequent generation of those skills needed to perform tasks of daily living, and further passing on the social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical values of the particular community. The wider meaning of education has been recognised in Article 1(a) of [[UNESCO]]'s 1974 ''Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=226\u2013227 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&dq=%22right+to+education%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"the entire process of social life by means of which individuals and social groups learn to develop consciously within, and for the benefit of, the national and international communities, the whole of their personal capabilities, attitudes, aptitudes and knowledge.\"<ref name=\"pg19\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[European Court of Human Rights]] has defined education in a narrow sense as \"teaching or instructions... in particular to the transmission of knowledge and to intellectual development\" and in a wider sense as \"the whole process whereby, in any society, adults endeavour to transmit their beliefs, culture and other values to the young.\"<ref name=\"pg19\"/>\n\nThe Abidjan principles were passed in early 2019 and provide comprehensive guiding principles on the intersection between private education and the right to education\n\n== Assessment of fulfilment ==\nThe fulfilment of the right to education can be assessed using the 4 As framework, which asserts that for education to be a meaningful right it must be available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable. The 4 As framework was developed by the former UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, [[Katarina Tomasevski]], but is not necessarily the standard used in every [[international human rights instrument]] and hence not a generic guide to how the right to education is treated under national law.<ref name=\"4as\">{{cite web |url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/226 |title=Right to education \u2013 What is it?

There should be no forms of segregation or denial of access to any students. This includes ensuring that proper laws are in place against any [[child labour]] or [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to prevent children from obtaining primary or secondary education. Schools must be within a reasonable distance for children within the community, otherwise transportation should be provided to students, particularly those that might live in rural areas, to ensure ways to school are safe and convenient.

With the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]], education was established also as a public function. It was thought that the state, by assuming a more active role in the sphere of education, could help to make education available and accessible to all. Education had thus far been primarily available to the upper social classes and public education was perceived as a means of realising the [[egalitarian]] ideals underlining both revolutions.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=21\u201322 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&dq=%22right+to+education%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>\n\nHowever, neither the [[American Declaration of Independence]] (1776) nor the [[French Declaration of the Rights of Man]] (1789) protected the right to education, as the liberal concepts of [[human rights]] in the nineteenth century envisaged that parents retained the primary duty for providing education to their children. It was the states obligation to ensure that parents complied with this duty, and many states enacted legislation making school attendance compulsory. Furthermore, [[child labour]] laws were enacted to limit the number of hours per day children could be employed, to ensure children would attend school. States also became involved in the legal regulation of [[curricula]] and established minimum educational standards.<ref name=\"Beiter 2005 22\">{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&dq=%22right+to+education%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[On Liberty]]'' [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote that an \"education established and controlled by the State should only exist, if it exists at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose of example and stimulus to keep the others up to a certain standard of excellence.\" Liberal thinkers of the nineteenth century pointed to the dangers to too much state involvement in the sphere of education, but relied on state intervention to reduce the dominance of the church, and to protect the right to education of children against their own parents. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, educational rights were included in domestic bills of rights.<ref name=\"Beiter 2005 22\"/> The 1849 ''[[Paulskirchenverfassung]]'', the constitution of the [[German Empire]], strongly influenced subsequent European constitutions and devoted Article 152 to 158 of its bill of rights to education. The constitution recognised education as a function of the state, independent of the church. Remarkable at the time, the constitution proclaimed the right to free education for the poor, but the constitution did not explicitly require the state to set up educational institutions. Instead the constitution protected the rights of citizens to found and operate schools and to provide [[home education]]. The constitution also provided for freedom of [[science]] and [[teaching]], and it guaranteed the right of everybody to choose a vocation and train for it.<ref name=\"Beiter 2005 23\">{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&dq=%22right+to+education%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>\n\nThe nineteenth century also saw the development of [[socialist]] theory, which held that the primary task of the state was to ensure the economic and social well-being of the community through government intervention and regulation. Socialist theory recognised that individuals had claims to basic welfare services against the state and education was viewed as one of these welfare entitlements. This was in contrast to [[Liberalism|liberal]] theory at the time, which regarded non-state actors as the prime providers of education. Socialist ideals were enshrined in the 1936 [[Soviet Constitution]], which was the first constitution to recognise the right to education with a corresponding obligation of the state to provide such education. The constitution guaranteed free and compulsory education at all levels, a system of state scholarships and vocational training in state enterprises. Subsequently, the right to education featured strongly in the constitutions of socialist states.<ref name=\"Beiter 2005 23\"/> As a political goal, right to education was declared in F. D. Roosevelt's 1944 speech on the [[Second Bill of Rights]].\n\n== The role of education for individuals, the society and the state ==\nEducation in all its forms ([[Informal learning|informal]], [[Nonformal learning|non-formal]], and [[Formal learning|formal]]) is crucial to ensure human dignity of all individuals.

According to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the right to education includes the right to free, compulsory primary education for all, an obligation to develop secondary education accessible to all in particular by the progressive introduction of free secondary education, as well as an obligation to develop equitable access to higher education in particular by the progressive introduction of free higher education. The right to education also includes a responsibility to provide basic education for individuals who have not completed primary education. In addition to these access to education provisions, the right to education encompasses also the obligation to eliminate discrimination at all levels of the educational system, to set minimum standards, and to improve quality.

Generally, international instruments use the term in this sense and the right to education, as protected by [[international human rights instruments]], refers primarily to education in a narrow sense. The 1960 [[UNESCO]] Convention against Discrimination in Education defines education in Article 1(2) as: \"all types and levels of education, (including such) access to education, the standard and quality of education, and the conditions under which it is given.\"<ref name=\"pg19\">{{cite book|last=Beiter|first=Klaus Dieter|title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law|year=2005|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|location=The Hague|isbn=90-04-14704-7|page=19}}</ref>\n\nIn a wider sense [[education]] may describe \"all activities by which a human group transmits to its descendants a body of knowledge and skills and a moral code which enable the group to subsist\".<ref name=\"pg19\"/> In this sense education refers to the transmission to a subsequent generation of those skills needed to perform tasks of daily living, and further passing on the social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical values of the particular community. The wider meaning of education has been recognised in Article 1(a) of [[UNESCO]]'s 1974 ''Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=226\u2013227 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&dq=%22right+to+education%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"the entire process of social life by means of which individuals and social groups learn to develop consciously within, and for the benefit of, the national and international communities, the whole of their personal capabilities, attitudes, aptitudes and knowledge.\"<ref name=\"pg19\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[European Court of Human Rights]] has defined education in a narrow sense as \"teaching or instructions... in particular to the transmission of knowledge and to intellectual development\" and in a wider sense as \"the whole process whereby, in any society, adults endeavour to transmit their beliefs, culture and other values to the young.\"<ref name=\"pg19\"/>\n\nThe Abidjan principles were passed in early 2019 and provide comprehensive guiding principles on the intersection between private education and the right to education\n\n== Assessment of fulfilment ==\nThe fulfilment of the right to education can be assessed using the 4 As framework, which asserts that for education to be a meaningful right it must be available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable.

With the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]], education was established also as a public function. It was thought that the state, by assuming a more active role in the sphere of education, could help to make education available and accessible to all. Education had thus far been primarily available to the upper social classes and public education was perceived as a means of realising the [[egalitarian]] ideals underlining both revolutions.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=21\u201322 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&dq=%22right+to+education%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>\n\nHowever, neither the [[American Declaration of Independence]] (1776) nor the [[French Declaration of the Rights of Man]] (1789) protected the right to education, as the liberal concepts of [[human rights]] in the nineteenth century envisaged that parents retained the primary duty for providing education to their children. It was the states obligation to ensure that parents complied with this duty, and many states enacted legislation making school attendance compulsory. Furthermore, [[child labour]] laws were enacted to limit the number of hours per day children could be employed, to ensure children would attend school. States also became involved in the legal regulation of [[curricula]] and established minimum educational standards.<ref name=\"Beiter 2005 22\">{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&dq=%22right+to+education%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[On Liberty]]'' [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote that an \"education established and controlled by the State should only exist, if it exists at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose of example and stimulus to keep the others up to a certain standard of excellence.\" Liberal thinkers of the nineteenth century pointed to the dangers to too much state involvement in the sphere of education, but relied on state intervention to reduce the dominance of the church, and to protect the right to education of children against their own parents. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, educational rights were included in domestic bills of rights.<ref name=\"Beiter 2005 22\"/> The 1849 ''[[Paulskirchenverfassung]]'', the constitution of the [[German Empire]], strongly influenced subsequent European constitutions and devoted Article 152 to 158 of its bill of rights to education. The constitution recognised education as a function of the state, independent of the church. Remarkable at the time, the constitution proclaimed the right to free education for the poor, but the constitution did not explicitly require the state to set up educational institutions. Instead the constitution protected the rights of citizens to found and operate schools and to provide [[home education]]. The constitution also provided for freedom of [[science]] and [[teaching]], and it guaranteed the right of everybody to choose a vocation and train for it.<ref name=\"Beiter 2005 23\">{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&dq=%22right+to+education%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>\n\nThe nineteenth century also saw the development of [[socialist]] theory, which held that the primary task of the state was to ensure the economic and social well-being of the community through government intervention and regulation. Socialist theory recognised that individuals had claims to basic welfare services against the state and education was viewed as one of these welfare entitlements. This was in contrast to [[Liberalism|liberal]] theory at the time, which regarded non-state actors as the prime providers of education. Socialist ideals were enshrined in the 1936 [[Soviet Constitution]], which was the first constitution to recognise the right to education with a corresponding obligation of the state to provide such education. The constitution guaranteed free and compulsory education at all levels, a system of state scholarships and vocational training in state enterprises. Subsequently, the right to education featured strongly in the constitutions of socialist states.<ref name=\"Beiter 2005 23\"/> As a political goal, right to education was declared in F. D. Roosevelt's 1944 speech on the [[Second Bill of Rights]].\n\n== The role of education for individuals, the society and the state ==\nEducation in all its forms ([[Informal learning|informal]], [[Nonformal learning|non-formal]], and [[Formal learning|formal]]) is crucial to ensure human dignity of all individuals.

The declaration states that human rights begin at birth and that [[childhood]] is a period demanding special care and assistance [art. 25 (2)]. The 1959 [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]] affirmed that: \u2018mankind owes to the child the best it has to give\u2019, including education. This was amplified by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 which states that: \u2018education shall be directed to the full development of the [[Personality|human personality]] and the sense of its dignity, and shall strengthen the respect for [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms.

This initiatives, although tempered by cyclical migration and epidemics, permitted the concentration of settlers in the northern community.\n\nDuring the 14th century, wars with Castile result in the destruction of the frontier settlements and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castellian]] troops take the city of Bragan\u00e7a. In 1381, the region is once again devastated militarily, resulting in famine, epidemics, infant mortality rates, the abandonment of lands, resulting in an 83% drop in the population.<ref name=CMFronteiras/> In 1387, the [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Duke of Lancaster]] and [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance]] sign the Treaty of Babe, that recognized [[John I of Portugal|John I]]'s title and rights to Portugal and the Algarve (then already acclaimed in the Portuguese ''Cortes'' and married to [[Philippa of Lancaster]]).<ref name=CMFronteiras/> But in 1396, John returned to Bragan\u00e7a to curb Castilian aggression, taking the titles from Afonso Pimental (who was an ally of Castile) and delivering into his illegitimate son's hands [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|Afonso]] (donated in 1401 by [[Peter of Coimbra|Regent Peter]]),<ref name=CMHistoria/> who he charged with reinforcing the border and elaborating the defenses of the castle.<ref name=CMFronteiras/> John then bound the frontier region to the Crown with a marriage of his son to [[Beatriz Pereira de Alvim|Beatriz]], daughter of [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] in order to strengthen the ties of the fledgling crown to the land.<ref name=CMFronteiras/>\n\n===Monarchy===\nBy the middle of the 13th century,  Bragan\u00e7a was divided into four parishes: Santa Maria (then the main town), S\u00e3o Tiago, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (outside the castle walls) and S\u00e3o Vicente.\n\nIn 1442, King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] established the hereditary dukedom of the [[Duchy of Braganza]], for his uncle [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso, Count of Barcelos]], becoming one of the oldest [[fief]]doms in Portugal. The second Duke of Braganza, [[Fernando I, 2nd Duke of Braganza|Fernando]], reinforced his [[John I of Portugal|grandfather]]'s frontier strategy and expanded his territory by integrating the lands of his deceased brother [[Afonso, Marquis of Valen\u00e7a]]. Ferdinand supported King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], and during his North African campaigns, became the Governor of [[Ceuta]]. Ferdinand was responsible for ensuring the elevation of Braganza to the status of city (on 20 February 1464), and was Regent when Afonso V returned to North Africa. But his conspiracies and court intrigues during the reign of King [[John II of Portugal|John II]] would have him condemned to death, the banning of the [[House of Braganza]] and the incorporation of their hereditary lands and titles into the Crown. The lands remained in the hands of the Crown until the reign of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand of Portugal]], when they were offered as a [[dowry]] to Jo\u00e3o Afonso Pimentel on his marriage to Joana Teles de Menezes, half-sister of Queen [[Leonor Teles]].<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nKing [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] reinstated the Braganzas on 18 June 1496, but forced their heirs to expel the [[Jews]] from Bragan\u00e7a, resulting in the departure of hundreds of the inhabitants that had supported and promoted town.<ref name=CMFronteiras/> Those that did not convert to Christianity left Portugal (with their money, contacts, knowledge, merchant experience), including [[Orobio de Castro]] (who became a leader in the [[Amsterdam]] synagogue) and [[Jacob de Castro Sarmento]] who was an important figure in England and Scotland, professor at the University of Aberdeen.<ref name=CMFronteiras/>\n\nIn the 14th and 15th century, growth outside the city of Bragan\u00e7a developed, and in the proceeding centuries there were major renovations and remodelling to the churches, convents and noble estates within the municipality.<ref name=CMHistoria/> Many of street names from Bragan\u00e7a also show a rapid industrialization and commercialization in the community, with the appearances of street names such as ''Rua dos Prateiros'' (silver-smiths), ''Rua dos Sineiros'' (bell-makers), ''Rua dos Oleiros'' (potters), ''Rua da Alf\u00e2ndega'' (customs house), ''Ponte das Tenarias'' (tanners), ''Ponte das Ferrarias'' (blacksmiths), that directed their exports to the regional market.<ref name=CMHistoria/> This dynamic environment was facilitated by Jews who escaped the [[Inquisition]] in Castile during the 15th century, and who stimulated the commercial, artisanal and cereal markets in the region.<ref name=CMHistoria/><ref>Karen Primack (1998), p.75-76</ref>\n\nAfter 60 years the Portuguese were able to end the [[Iberian Union]] with Spain. On 1 December 1640 the independence of Portugal was restored, allowing the ascension of the 8th Duke of Braganza (then military governor of Portugal) as King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]].<ref name=CMFronteiras/> From 1640 to 1910 the  [[House of Braganza]] was responsible for providing Portugal its [[Kings of Portugal|kings]] and the  [[Emperors of Brazil|two emperors]] of Brazil.

It is very similar to the continental climate of the Spanish Meseta, which means cooler winters and shorter hot summers. It is one of the Portuguese cities where it snows the most, however this may vary a lot between winters, with less than 5 snow days (2007/2008) to more than 20 (2008/2009). The average high in January is around {{convert|8.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} while the July high is around {{convert|29.2|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The January low hovers around the freezing point.

There are many vestiges of these ancient communities, including ceramics, agricultural implements, weights, arrowheads and modest jewelry, all carved from rock.<ref name=CMHistoria/> Many of these artefacts were found in funerary mounds, such as the [[tumulus]] of Donai (mostly destroyed). There are many signs of megalithic constructions dotted throughout the region.<ref name=CMHistoria/> It is believed that the larger prehistoric communities developed in Terra Fria, probably in the final part of the [[Bronze Age]] (1000-700 BC). During this period, the Celtic or [[Castro culture]] of fortified urban structures resulted in walled settlements, situated in elevated areas, with a panoramic view for defense. These communities essentially survived on subsistence agriculture.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nRoman colonization, which occurred late in the Roman era, resulted in the establishment of private property and movement away from the forests, in addition to organizational changes resulting administrative, material and cultural evolution. Remnants of the Luso-Roman castro societies are evident in Castro of Sac\u00f3ias and the Castro of Avel\u00e3s.<ref name=CMHistoria/> In these excavations, modern archaeologists have discovered funerary remains, coins and implements. The Castro of Avel\u00e3s (about three kilometres from Bragan\u00e7a) was an important centre on the military road to [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]], although there are many examples (in Alfai\u00e3o, Aveleda, Carrazedo, Castro de Avel\u00e3s, Donai, Fran\u00e7a, Gostei, Meixedo, Pinela, Quintela Lampa\u00e7as, etc.) of the Roman presence.<ref name=\"CMFronteiras\">{{cite web|title=Bragan\u00e7a: Muito Para Alem Fronteiras|editor=C\u00e2mara Municipal|publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal de Bragan\u00e7a|location=Bragan\u00e7a, Portugal|language=Portuguese|author=Aramando Fernandes|year=2011}}</ref> The area was dominated by two ethnic communities: the ''Zoelae'', with their seat in Castro de Avel\u00e3s, and a [[Lusitania]]n [[civitas]] under the stewardship of the ''Baniense'' in the southern part of the district.<ref name=CMHistoria/><ref name=\"Viterbo 1716 p.188\">Joaquim de Santa Rosa de Viterbo (1716), p.188</ref> A Latin map, ''Atlas de Gotha'' by Justus Perthes, mentioned three settlements within this region: [[Aquae Flaviae]] ([[Chaves Municipality, Portugal|Chaves]]), Veniatia ([[Vinhais Municipality|Vinhais]]) and [[Zoelae]] (its seat in Zoelas, today Castro de Avel\u00e3s)<ref name=\"Viterbo 1716 p.188\"/><ref>The best reference to the existence of the Zoelae come from a stone discovered near the main altar of the Church of Castro de Avel\u00e3, with the inscription ''\"Zolae Populi Hispaniae Terraconensis in ora Asturum, quorum Urbs Zoela\"'', which may have been moved to the church, rather than inscribed after its placement (Viterbo, 1716, p.188).</ref> without mentioning any reference to a name similar to Bragan\u00e7a.<ref name=CMHistoria/> During Roman colonization, it was part of [[Gallaecia]] and dependent administratively on [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]], on the Atlantic axis of a Roman highway from Meseta, that controlled the gold, iron and silver trade.<ref name=CMFronteiras/> The references to a settlement with the name similar to ''Bragan\u00e7a'' occurred in the acts of Council Lugo (569 AD) regarding the ''Vergancia''. A similar reference by [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] (666 AD) referred to ''Bregancia'', and where, supposedly two Christian martyrs (John and Paul) were born.<ref>Joaquim de Santa Rosa de Viterbo (1716), p.189</ref>\n\nRecords of the proto-Germanic [[Suebi]]c and Visigothic kingdoms are few, probably an indication of advancement in rural agrarian and pastoral communities during their occupation and settlement. Toponymic references such as Gimonde, Guadramil and Samil are some of the remains from this period.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\n===Medieval period===\nAlthough some placenames remained (such as Alfai\u00e3o, Babe, Ba\u00e7al, Bagueixe, Mogadouro), the influence of the Islamic civilization to the northern regions and Douro (as well as mountainous areas) was very small. There is but one passing reference to a ''Pelagius Count of Bragan\u00e7a'' during the Council of Oviedo (in 970).<ref name=CMHistoria/><ref name=CMFronteiras/> Owing to the [[Reconquista]], this region was quickly integrated into the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] (later [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] after the 10th century), and the economy, ecclesiastical organization, architecture, culture and language was heavily influenced by the Asturo-Leonese.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nDuring the 11th and 12th century, in the books of genealogy, the Bragan\u00e7\u00e3os family of [[Castro d'Avel\u00e3s]] (at the time the seat of the Benedictine monastery) dominated Bragan\u00e7a, its [[abbot]] Mendo Al\u00e3m, who later married Princess Ardzrouri of [[Armenia]] (who passed through the region on a pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]], originated the hereditary line.<ref name=CMHistoria/><ref name=CMFronteiras/> Legend holds that Fern\u00e3o Mendes (a Bragan\u00e7\u00e3o) presumably kidnapped, then married, Sancha, daughter of [[Afonso Henriques]] and Teresa, obtaining with his dead the important defense of the region. Fern\u00e3o Mendes and Sancha would find the ruins of the ancient village and rebuilt from the ground in the ''Realenga das Terras da Bragan\u00e7a''.<ref name=\"Viterbo 1716 p.188\"/> Historically, Fern\u00e3o Mendes was later referred to as the ''Brave'' for his gallantry during the [[Battle of Ourique]].<ref name=CMFronteiras/> Yet, later, the region of Bragan\u00e7a would become a property of the Crown as no heir would develop from their union.<ref name=CMHistoria/> The Bragan\u00e7\u00e3os contributed to the foundation of the settlement, and its importance would remain integral to the defense of the country, owing to the geopolitical position in the northwest frontier with the Spanish Kingdoms of Le\u00f3n and Castile.<ref name=CMHistoria/> By the seventh generation, around 1258, the Bragan\u00e7\u00e3os lost their hereditary title, and Afonso III transferred the title to Nuno Martins, a descendant of the line.<ref name=CMFronteiras/>\n\nThe origin of the city of Bragan\u00e7a dates from the 10th or 11th century, and likely developed from a Romanized castro, although archaeological evidence is still under-discovered.<ref name=CMHistoria/> The strategic importance of Bragan\u00e7a, to military control of access, resulted from its localization and was reinforced by administrative institutions established by the King.<ref name=CMHistoria/> [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]] signed a [[foral]] in June 1187, which was renovated by King [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], in May 1253, and later by [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] on 11 November 1514.<ref name=CMHistoria/> The foral demonstrated specifically the importance of the city, which was the first in the Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes to receive the title of ''town''.<ref name=CMHistoria/> In his proclamation, Afonso III specified that the municipality of Bragan\u00e7a pertained to the ''Church'' of Braganza, and not the crown, and that its represents should motivate the settlement of all unpopulated lands.<ref name=\"Viterbo 1716 p.187\">Joaquim de Santa Rosa de Viterbo (1716), p.187</ref> This conflicted with the Military Orders and administration of the Monastery of Castro de Avel\u00e3s, who believed that they had the right to settle all villages and use the land as they willed.<ref name=\"Viterbo 1716 p.187\"/> The privileges that were conceded to the nascent Portuguese population by various monarchs outlines the geographic importance of attracting settlement to the northern frontier: [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] created an annual fair in 1272 and [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Fernando]] establishes a free-trade fair in 1383, which was renovated or reformulated by successive monarchs ([[John I of Portugal|John I]] in 1392 and 1413, the [[Peter of Coimbra|Regent Peter]] in 1439 and [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] in 1455). This initiatives, although tempered by cyclical migration and epidemics, permitted the concentration of settlers in the northern community.\n\nDuring the 14th century, wars with Castile result in the destruction of the frontier settlements and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castellian]] troops take the city of Bragan\u00e7a. In 1381, the region is once again devastated militarily, resulting in famine, epidemics, infant mortality rates, the abandonment of lands, resulting in an 83% drop in the population.<ref name=CMFronteiras/> In 1387, the [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Duke of Lancaster]] and [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance]] sign the Treaty of Babe, that recognized [[John I of Portugal|John I]]'s title and rights to Portugal and the Algarve (then already acclaimed in the Portuguese ''Cortes'' and married to [[Philippa of Lancaster]]).<ref name=CMFronteiras/> But in 1396, John returned to Bragan\u00e7a to curb Castilian aggression, taking the titles from Afonso Pimental (who was an ally of Castile) and delivering into his illegitimate son's hands [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|Afonso]] (donated in 1401 by [[Peter of Coimbra|Regent Peter]]),<ref name=CMHistoria/> who he charged with reinforcing the border and elaborating the defenses of the castle.<ref name=CMFronteiras/> John then bound the frontier region to the Crown with a marriage of his son to [[Beatriz Pereira de Alvim|Beatriz]], daughter of [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] in order to strengthen the ties of the fledgling crown to the land.<ref name=CMFronteiras/>\n\n===Monarchy===\nBy the middle of the 13th century,  Bragan\u00e7a was divided into four parishes: Santa Maria (then the main town), S\u00e3o Tiago, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (outside the castle walls) and S\u00e3o Vicente.\n\nIn 1442, King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] established the hereditary dukedom of the [[Duchy of Braganza]], for his uncle [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso, Count of Barcelos]], becoming one of the oldest [[fief]]doms in Portugal. The second Duke of Braganza, [[Fernando I, 2nd Duke of Braganza|Fernando]], reinforced his [[John I of Portugal|grandfather]]'s frontier strategy and expanded his territory by integrating the lands of his deceased brother [[Afonso, Marquis of Valen\u00e7a]]. Ferdinand supported King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], and during his North African campaigns, became the Governor of [[Ceuta]]. Ferdinand was responsible for ensuring the elevation of Braganza to the status of city (on 20 February 1464), and was Regent when Afonso V returned to North Africa. But his conspiracies and court intrigues during the reign of King [[John II of Portugal|John II]] would have him condemned to death, the banning of the [[House of Braganza]] and the incorporation of their hereditary lands and titles into the Crown. The lands remained in the hands of the Crown until the reign of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand of Portugal]], when they were offered as a [[dowry]] to Jo\u00e3o Afonso Pimentel on his marriage to Joana Teles de Menezes, half-sister of Queen [[Leonor Teles]].<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nKing [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] reinstated the Braganzas on 18 June 1496, but forced their heirs to expel the [[Jews]] from Bragan\u00e7a, resulting in the departure of hundreds of the inhabitants that had supported and promoted town.<ref name=CMFronteiras/> Those that did not convert to Christianity left Portugal (with their money, contacts, knowledge, merchant experience), including [[Orobio de Castro]] (who became a leader in the [[Amsterdam]] synagogue) and [[Jacob de Castro Sarmento]] who was an important figure in England and Scotland, professor at the University of Aberdeen.<ref name=CMFronteiras/>\n\nIn the 14th and 15th century, growth outside the city of Bragan\u00e7a developed, and in the proceeding centuries there were major renovations and remodelling to the churches, convents and noble estates within the municipality.<ref name=CMHistoria/> Many of street names from Bragan\u00e7a also show a rapid industrialization and commercialization in the community, with the appearances of street names such as ''Rua dos Prateiros'' (silver-smiths), ''Rua dos Sineiros'' (bell-makers), ''Rua dos Oleiros'' (potters), ''Rua da Alf\u00e2ndega'' (customs house), ''Ponte das Tenarias'' (tanners), ''Ponte das Ferrarias'' (blacksmiths), that directed their exports to the regional market.<ref name=CMHistoria/> This dynamic environment was facilitated by Jews who escaped the [[Inquisition]] in Castile during the 15th century, and who stimulated the commercial, artisanal and cereal markets in the region.<ref name=CMHistoria/><ref>Karen Primack (1998), p.75-76</ref>\n\nAfter 60 years the Portuguese were able to end the [[Iberian Union]] with Spain. On 1 December 1640 the independence of Portugal was restored, allowing the ascension of the 8th Duke of Braganza (then military governor of Portugal) as King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]].<ref name=CMFronteiras/> From 1640 to 1910 the  [[House of Braganza]] was responsible for providing Portugal its [[Kings of Portugal|kings]] and the  [[Emperors of Brazil|two emperors]] of Brazil. The latter ruled from 1822 to 1889.

During the [[Iron Age]], the [[Castro culture]] extended into the northwest, characterized by [[Bracari]] peoples who occupied the high ground in strategically located fortified settlements ([[Castro (village)|castrum]]).\n\nThe region became the domain of the ''Callaici Bracarii'', or ''Bracarenses'', a [[Celts|Celtic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YFR2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA45&dq=origem+celta+braga+bracara&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV_5aanOHXAhUHLlAKHSg2BH8Q6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&q=origem+celta+braga+bracara&f=false|title=Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Hist\u00f3ria da L\u00edngua e Cultura Portuguesas|first=Jos\u00e9 Barbosa|last=Machado|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Edi\u00e7\u00f5es Vercial|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> tribe who occupied what is now northern Portugal, Galicia and Asturias in the northwest of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began their conquest of the region around 136 BC, and finished it, by pacifying the northern regions, during the reign of [[Emperor Augustus]]. The civitas of '''Bracara Augusta''' was founded in 20 BC; in the context of the administrative reorganization of these Roman acquisitions, Bracara was rededicated to the Emperor taking on the name ''Bracara Augusta''. The city of Bracara Augusta developed greatly during the 1st century and reached its maximum extension around the 2nd century.\n\nTowards the end of the 3rd century, the [[Diocletianus|Emperor Diocletian]] promoted the city to the status of capital of the administrative area [[Conventus bracarensis]], the southwestern area of the newly founded Roman province of [[Gallaecia]].\n\n===Braga in Late Antiquity and Middle Ages===\n[[File:Iberia 500.svg|left|355x355px|frameless]]\nDuring the [[Migration Period|Germanic Invasions of the Iberian Peninsula]], the area was conquered by the [[Suebi]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people from Central Europe. In 410, the Suebi established a [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Kingdom]] in northwest Iberia covering what is present-day's Northern half of Portugal,<ref name=\"Thompson154\">Thompson, 153&ndash;154.</ref> Galicia and Asturias, which they maintained as ''Gallaecia'', and had Bracara as their capital. This kingdom was founded by [[Hermeric]] and lasted for over 150 years.By about 584, the [[Visigoths]] took over control of Gallaecia from the Suebi, and Braga was made a provincial capital.\n\n[[File:Braga-sec-xvii.png|235px|thumb|A 17th-century engraving of Braga, showing the walls of the city, which were progressively demolished to make way for new constructions]]\n[[File:Rua J\u00falio Lima.JPG|235px|thumb|A view of ''Rua J\u00falio Lima'' at the beginning of the 20th century]]\n\nBraga had an important role in the ''Christianization'' of the Iberian Peninsula. The first known bishop of Braga, ''Paternus'', lived at the end of the 4th century, although [[Saint Ovidius]] (d. 135 AD) is sometimes considered one of the first bishops of this city. In the early 5th century, [[Paulus Orosius]] (a friend of [[Augustine of Hippo]]) wrote several theological works that expounded the Christian faith. Thanks to the work of [[Martin of Braga|Saint Martin of Braga]] the Suebi in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] renounced the [[Arianism|Arian]] and [[Priscillianist]] heresies during two synods held here in the 6th century. At the time, Martin also founded an important [[Monastery of Dumio|monastery]] in [[Dumio]] (''Dume''), and it was in Braga that the [[Archbishopric of Braga]] held their councils. As a consequence, the archbishops of Braga later claimed the title of Primate of [[County of Portugal|Portugal]], then a county, and for a long period, claimed supremacy over the entire Hispanic church. Yet, their authority was never accepted throughout [[Hispania]].\n\nThe transition from [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] reigns to the [[Muslim conquest of Iberia]] was very obscure, representing a period of decline for the city. The Moors briefly captured Braga early in the 8th century, but were repelled by Christian forces under [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] in 868 with intermittent attacks until 1040 when they were definitely ousted by [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile]]. As a consequence, the bishopric was restored in 1070: the first new bishop, ''Pedro'' (Peter), started rebuilding the [[Braga Cathedral|Cathedral]] (which was modified many times during the following centuries).\n\nBetween 1093 and 1147, Braga became the residential seat of the Portuguese court. In the early 12th century, [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry of Portugal]] and bishop [[Gerald of Braga|Geraldo de Moissac]] reclaimed the archbishopric seat for Braga, with power over a large area in Iberia. The medieval city developed around the cathedral, with the maximum authority in the city retained by the archbishop.\n\n===Braga in the Kingdom of Portugal===\nBraga as the main center of Christianity in Iberia, during the Reconquista (until the emergence of [[Santiago de Compostela]] and, later, the conquest of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] from the Muslims, in 1085), held a prominent stage in medieval politics, being a major contributor to the Independence of Portugal with the intervenience of the [[Paio Mendes|Archbishop D. Paio Mendes]] in the Vatican, with [[Pope Alexander III]], which lead to the promulgation of the [[Manifestis Probatum|Bula Manifestis Probatum]], in 1179, recognizing Portugal as an independent Kingdom under [[Afonso I of Portugal|D. Afonso I Henriques]].\n\nThe following centuries marked a slow decline in its prestige and influence marked by the infamous theft of Holy Relics (including those of [[Martin of Braga|Saint Martin of Dume]]) by the then [[Diego Gelm\u00edrez|Archbishop of Santiago of Compostela Gelmirez]]. The relics only returned to Braga in the 1960s.\n\nIn the 16th century, due to its distance from the coast and provincial status, Braga did not profit from the adventures associated with the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Portuguese Discoveries]] (which favoured cities like [[Lisbon]], [[\u00c9vora]] and [[Coimbra]], new seats for the Portuguese court). Yet, Archbishop Diogo de Sousa, who sponsored several urban improvements in the city, including the enlargement of streets, the creation of public squares and the foundation of hospitals and new churches managed to modernize the community. He expanded and remodelled the cathedral by adding a new chapel in the [[Manueline]] style, and generally turning the mediaeval town into a Renaissance city.\n\nA similar period of rejuvenation occurred during the 18th century, when the archbishops of the [[House of Braganza]] contracted architects like [[Andr\u00e9 Soares (architect)|Andr\u00e9 Soares]] and Carlos Amarante, to modernize and rejuvenate the city; they began a series of architectural transformations to churches and civic institutions in the Baroque style, including the municipal hall, public library, the [[Bom Jesus do Monte|Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte]] and many urban palaces.\n\nWith the invasion of French troops, during the [[Peninsular Wars]] the city was relegated, once again, to a provincial status. But, by the second half of that century, with influence from Portuguese immigrants living in Brazil, new money and tastes resulted in improvements to architecture and infrastructures.\n\n===Republic===\nIn the 20th century Braga faced similar periods of growth and decline; demographic and urban pressures, from urban-to-rural migration meant that the city's infrastructures had to be improved in order to satisfy greater demands.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Bom Jesus (Braga).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Snow in Braga. Picture: [[Bom Jesus do Monte|Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte]]]]\nSituated in the heart of [[Minho (province)|Minho]], Braga is located in a transitional region between the east and west: between mountains, forests, grand valleys, plains and fields, constructing natural spaces, moulded by human intervention. Geographically, with an area of {{convert|184|km2|mi2}} it is bordered in the north by the municipalities of [[Vila Verde Municipality|Vila Verde]] and [[Amares Municipality|Amares]], northeast and east by [[P\u00f3voa de Lanhoso Municipality|P\u00f3voa de Lanhoso]], south and southeast with [[Guimar\u00e3es Municipality|Guimar\u00e3es]] and [[Vila Nova de Famalic\u00e3o Municipality|Vila Nova de Famalic\u00e3o]] and west by the municipality of [[Barcelos Municipality, Portugal|Barcelos]].<ref name=\"Diagnostic\">{{citation |url=http://www.saudepublica.web.pt/TrabPedro/ACES-Brg_DS-2009-2.pdf |contribution=Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do Concelho de Braga |title=Diagn\u00f3stico do Concelho de Braga |first=P.

In the north it is limited by the [[C\u00e1vado River]], in the south by terrain of the Serra dos Picos to a height of {{convert|566|m|ft}} and towards the east by the Serra dos Carvalhos to a height of {{convert|479|m|ft}}, opening to the municipalities of Vila Nova de Famalic\u00e3o and Barcelos. The territory extends from the northeast to southwest, accompanying the valleys of the two rivers, fed by many of its tributaries, forming small platforms between {{convert|20|m|ft}} and {{convert|570|m|ft}}.\n\nThe municipality lies between {{convert|20|m|ft}} and {{convert|572|m|ft}}, with the urbanized centre located at approximately {{convert|215|m|ft}}. In the north, where the municipality is marked by the Cavado, the terrain is semi-planar, the east is mountainous owing to the Serra do Carvalho {{convert|479|m|ft}}, Serra dos Picos {{convert|566|m|ft}}, Monte do Sameiro {{convert|572|m|ft}} and Monte de Santa Marta {{convert|562|m|ft}}. Between the Serra do Carvalho and Serra dos Picos is the River Este, forming the valley of Vale d\u2019Este. Similarly, between the Serra dos Picos and Monte do Sameiro exists the plateau of Sobreposta-Pedralva. To the south and west, the terrain is a mix of mountains, plateaus and medium-size valleys, permitting the passage of the River Este, and giving birth to other confluences including the River Veiga, River Labriosca and various ravines.\n\n===Climate===\nBraga has a [[Mediterranean climate]] similar to other cities in the northwest Iberian Peninsula' except for having significantly hotter summer temperatures due to being some distance from the ocean: the absolute maximum is as much as {{convert|5|C-change|0}} higher than neighbouring [[A Coru\u00f1a]] or [[Santiago de Compostela]]. The lowest recorded is {{convert|-6.3|\u00b0C|1}}. The climate of Braga is hot in summer with temperatures that can approach 45&nbsp;\u00b0C (113&nbsp;\u00b0F).\nThe climate is affected by the Atlantic Ocean which influences westerly winds that are channeled through the region's valleys, transporting large humid air masses. Consequently, the climate tends to be pleasant with clearly defined seasons.

During the [[Iron Age]], the [[Castro culture]] extended into the northwest, characterized by [[Bracari]] peoples who occupied the high ground in strategically located fortified settlements ([[Castro (village)|castrum]]).\n\nThe region became the domain of the ''Callaici Bracarii'', or ''Bracarenses'', a [[Celts|Celtic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YFR2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA45&dq=origem+celta+braga+bracara&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV_5aanOHXAhUHLlAKHSg2BH8Q6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&q=origem+celta+braga+bracara&f=false|title=Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Hist\u00f3ria da L\u00edngua e Cultura Portuguesas|first=Jos\u00e9 Barbosa|last=Machado|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Edi\u00e7\u00f5es Vercial|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> tribe who occupied what is now northern Portugal, Galicia and Asturias in the northwest of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began their conquest of the region around 136 BC, and finished it, by pacifying the northern regions, during the reign of [[Emperor Augustus]]. The civitas of '''Bracara Augusta''' was founded in 20 BC; in the context of the administrative reorganization of these Roman acquisitions, Bracara was rededicated to the Emperor taking on the name ''Bracara Augusta''. The city of Bracara Augusta developed greatly during the 1st century and reached its maximum extension around the 2nd century.\n\nTowards the end of the 3rd century, the [[Diocletianus|Emperor Diocletian]] promoted the city to the status of capital of the administrative area [[Conventus bracarensis]], the southwestern area of the newly founded Roman province of [[Gallaecia]].\n\n===Braga in Late Antiquity and Middle Ages===\n[[File:Iberia 500.svg|left|355x355px|frameless]]\nDuring the [[Migration Period|Germanic Invasions of the Iberian Peninsula]], the area was conquered by the [[Suebi]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people from Central Europe. In 410, the Suebi established a [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Kingdom]] in northwest Iberia covering what is present-day's Northern half of Portugal,<ref name=\"Thompson154\">Thompson, 153&ndash;154.</ref> Galicia and Asturias, which they maintained as ''Gallaecia'', and had Bracara as their capital. This kingdom was founded by [[Hermeric]] and lasted for over 150 years.By about 584, the [[Visigoths]] took over control of Gallaecia from the Suebi, and Braga was made a provincial capital. \n\n[[File:Braga-sec-xvii.png|235px|thumb|A 17th-century engraving of Braga, showing the walls of the city, which were progressively demolished to make way for new constructions]]\n[[File:Rua J\u00falio Lima.JPG|235px|thumb|A view of ''Rua J\u00falio Lima'' at the beginning of the 20th century]]\n\nBraga had an important role in the ''Christianization'' of the Iberian Peninsula. The first known bishop of Braga, ''Paternus'', lived at the end of the 4th century, although [[Saint Ovidius]] (d. 135 AD) is sometimes considered one of the first bishops of this city. In the early 5th century, [[Paulus Orosius]] (a friend of [[Augustine of Hippo]]) wrote several theological works that expounded the Christian faith. Thanks to the work of [[Martin of Braga|Saint Martin of Braga]] the Suebi in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] renounced the [[Arianism|Arian]] and [[Priscillianist]] heresies during two synods held here in the 6th century. At the time, Martin also founded an important [[Monastery of Dumio|monastery]] in [[Dumio]] (''Dume''), and it was in Braga that the [[Archbishopric of Braga]] held their councils. As a consequence, the archbishops of Braga later claimed the title of Primate of [[County of Portugal|Portugal]], then a county, and for a long period, claimed supremacy over the entire Hispanic church. Yet, their authority was never accepted throughout [[Hispania]]. \n\nThe transition from [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] reigns to the [[Muslim conquest of Iberia]] was very obscure, representing a period of decline for the city. The Moors briefly captured Braga early in the 8th century, but were repelled by Christian forces under [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] in 868 with intermittent attacks until 1040 when they were definitely ousted by [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile]]. As a consequence, the bishopric was restored in 1070: the first new bishop, ''Pedro'' (Peter), started rebuilding the [[Braga Cathedral|Cathedral]] (which was modified many times during the following centuries).\n\nBetween 1093 and 1147, Braga became the residential seat of the Portuguese court. In the early 12th century, [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry of Portugal]] and bishop [[Gerald of Braga|Geraldo de Moissac]] reclaimed the archbishopric seat for Braga, with power over a large area in Iberia. The medieval city developed around the cathedral, with the maximum authority in the city retained by the archbishop.\n\n===Braga in the Kingdom of Portugal===\nBraga as the main center of Christianity in Iberia, during the Reconquista (until the emergence of [[Santiago de Compostela]] and, later, the conquest of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] from the Muslims, in 1085), held a prominent stage in medieval politics, being a major contributor to the Independence of Portugal with the intervenience of the [[Paio Mendes|Archbishop D. Paio Mendes]] in the Vatican, with [[Pope Alexander III]], which lead to the promulgation of the [[Manifestis Probatum|Bula Manifestis Probatum]], in 1179, recognizing Portugal as an independent Kingdom under [[Afonso I of Portugal|D. Afonso I Henriques]].\n\nThe following centuries marked a slow decline in its prestige and influence marked by the infamous theft of Holy Relics (including those of [[Martin of Braga|Saint Martin of Dume]]) by the then [[Diego Gelm\u00edrez|Archbishop of Santiago of Compostela Gelmirez]]. The relics only returned to Braga in the 1960s.\n\nIn the 16th century, due to its distance from the coast and provincial status, Braga did not profit from the adventures associated with the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Portuguese Discoveries]] (which favoured cities like [[Lisbon]], [[\u00c9vora]] and [[Coimbra]], new seats for the Portuguese court). Yet, Archbishop Diogo de Sousa, who sponsored several urban improvements in the city, including the enlargement of streets, the creation of public squares and the foundation of hospitals and new churches managed to modernize the community. He expanded and remodelled the cathedral by adding a new chapel in the [[Manueline]] style, and generally turning the mediaeval town into a Renaissance city.\n\nA similar period of rejuvenation occurred during the 18th century, when the archbishops of the [[House of Braganza]] contracted architects like [[Andr\u00e9 Soares (architect)|Andr\u00e9 Soares]] and Carlos Amarante, to modernize and rejuvenate the city; they began a series of architectural transformations to churches and civic institutions in the Baroque style, including the municipal hall, public library, the [[Bom Jesus do Monte|Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte]] and many urban palaces.\n\nWith the invasion of French troops, during the [[Peninsular Wars]] the city was relegated, once again, to a provincial status. But, by the second half of that century, with influence from Portuguese immigrants living in Brazil, new money and tastes resulted in improvements to architecture and infrastructures.\n\n===Republic===\nIn the 20th century Braga faced similar periods of growth and decline; demographic and urban pressures, from urban-to-rural migration meant that the city's infrastructures had to be improved in order to satisfy greater demands.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Bom Jesus (Braga).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Snow in Braga. Picture: [[Bom Jesus do Monte|Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte]]]]\nSituated in the heart of [[Minho (province)|Minho]], Braga is located in a transitional region between the east and west: between mountains, forests, grand valleys, plains and fields, constructing natural spaces, moulded by human intervention. Geographically, with an area of {{convert|184|km2|mi2}} it is bordered in the north by the municipalities of [[Vila Verde Municipality|Vila Verde]] and [[Amares Municipality|Amares]], northeast and east by [[P\u00f3voa de Lanhoso Municipality|P\u00f3voa de Lanhoso]], south and southeast with [[Guimar\u00e3es Municipality|Guimar\u00e3es]] and [[Vila Nova de Famalic\u00e3o Municipality|Vila Nova de Famalic\u00e3o]] and west by the municipality of [[Barcelos Municipality, Portugal|Barcelos]].<ref name=\"Diagnostic\">{{citation |url=http://www.saudepublica.web.pt/TrabPedro/ACES-Brg_DS-2009-2.pdf |contribution=Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do Concelho de Braga |title=Diagn\u00f3stico do Concelho de Braga |first=P.

In the north it is limited by the [[C\u00e1vado River]], in the south by terrain of the Serra dos Picos to a height of {{convert|566|m|ft}} and towards the east by the Serra dos Carvalhos to a height of {{convert|479|m|ft}}, opening to the municipalities of Vila Nova de Famalic\u00e3o and Barcelos. The territory extends from the northeast to southwest, accompanying the valleys of the two rivers, fed by many of its tributaries, forming small platforms between {{convert|20|m|ft}} and {{convert|570|m|ft}}.\n\nThe municipality lies between {{convert|20|m|ft}} and {{convert|572|m|ft}}, with the urbanized centre located at approximately {{convert|215|m|ft}}. In the north, where the municipality is marked by the Cavado, the terrain is semi-planar, the east is mountainous owing to the Serra do Carvalho {{convert|479|m|ft}}, Serra dos Picos {{convert|566|m|ft}}, Monte do Sameiro {{convert|572|m|ft}} and Monte de Santa Marta {{convert|562|m|ft}}. Between the Serra do Carvalho and Serra dos Picos is the River Este, forming the valley of Vale d\u2019Este. Similarly, between the Serra dos Picos and Monte do Sameiro exists the plateau of Sobreposta-Pedralva. To the south and west, the terrain is a mix of mountains, plateaus and medium-size valleys, permitting the passage of the River Este, and giving birth to other confluences including the River Veiga, River Labriosca and various ravines.\n\n===Climate===\nBraga has a [[Mediterranean climate]] similar to other cities in the northwest Iberian Peninsula' except for having significantly hotter summer temperatures due to being some distance from the ocean: the absolute maximum is as much as {{convert|5|C-change|0}} higher than neighbouring [[A Coru\u00f1a]] or [[Santiago de Compostela]]. The lowest recorded is {{convert|-6.3|\u00b0C|1}}. The climate of Braga is hot in summer with temperatures that can approach 45&nbsp;\u00b0C (113&nbsp;\u00b0F).\nThe climate is affected by the Atlantic Ocean which influences westerly winds that are channeled through the region's valleys, transporting large humid air masses. Consequently, the climate tends to be pleasant with clearly defined seasons. The air masses have the effect of maintaining the relative humidity around 80%: annual mean temperatures hover between {{convert|12.5|C|F}} and {{convert|17.5|C|F}}. Owing to nocturnal cooling, frost usually forms frequently between three and four months of the year (about 30 days of frost annually), and annually the region receives {{convert|1659|mm|in}} of precipitation, with the major intensity occurring between fall/winter and spring.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Braga (1981\u20132010 normals;
