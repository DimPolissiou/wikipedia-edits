A family from [[Tennessee]] donated the land for the town and named it after Crockett, whom they had previously known. The town was incorporated in 1837, and a post office was granted the following year. Crockett was connected to [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] by stage service. In 1839 raids by the Alabama-Coushatta and Cherokee Indians forced the town's residents to take shelter in the fortified log courthouse. Crockett was a training center for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] conscripts during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nThe railroad came through in 1872, enabling Crockett to exploit the county's timber resources. By 1885 the town was thriving with a population of 1,200, and the following year a school was opened for black girls. It evolved into [[Mary Allen Seminary|Mary Allen Junior College]], which operated into the 1970s. In 1904 [[lignite]] mining started, peaking about 1910. The stands of timber were seriously depleted by the 1920s. The population was over 3,000 in the mid-1920s, and by 1936 it was nearly 4,500. The population of Crockett increased while most of [[East Texas]] declined after [[World War II]]. It had reached 5,000 by the 1960 census.<ref>[http://www.texasescapes.com/EastTexasTowns/CrockettTexas.htm Crockett Texas and Crockett Texas Hotels Motels<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDuring this time, one of the first loop roads in the nation ([[Texas State Highway Loop 304|Loop 304]]) was built around the city. This traffic reliever was procured through the works of heavyweight politicians who called Crockett home. [[Blues]] singer [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] was once arrested in Crockett. In recent years, the economy of Crockett has expanded with the construction of new retail space on Loop 304. Several historic buildings in downtown have been renovated to accommodate new office and service space. Renewed interest in reserves of [[natural gas]] in the surrounding area has led to construction of energy infrastructure and receipt of royalty revenues for land.\n\nIn 1854, A.T. Monroe, a grandnephew of [[U.S. President]] [[James Monroe]], came to Crockett from [[Virginia]]. He established what is now the Monroe-Crook House, built with brick placed between the inner and outer walls. George W. Crook purchased the residence in 1911. The house, open for public tours, is located in front of the John H. Wooters Public Library in the same block as the Crockett [[Presbyterian]] Church.<ref>Texas Historical Commission, historical marker, Monroe-Crook House, Crockett, Texas</ref> The Presbyterian Church was established in 1854.

A family from [[Tennessee]] donated the land for the town and named it after Crockett, whom they had previously known. The town was incorporated in 1837, and a post office was granted the following year. Crockett was connected to [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] by stage service. In 1839 raids by the Alabama-Coushatta and Cherokee Indians forced the town's residents to take shelter in the fortified log courthouse. Crockett was a training center for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] conscripts during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nThe railroad came through in 1872, enabling Crockett to exploit the county's timber resources. By 1885 the town was thriving with a population of 1,200, and the following year a school was opened for black girls. It evolved into [[Mary Allen Seminary|Mary Allen Junior College]], which operated into the 1970s. In 1904 [[lignite]] mining started, peaking about 1910. The stands of timber were seriously depleted by the 1920s. The population was over 3,000 in the mid-1920s, and by 1936 it was nearly 4,500. The population of Crockett increased while most of [[East Texas]] declined after [[World War II]]. It had reached 5,000 by the 1960 census.<ref>[http://www.texasescapes.com/EastTexasTowns/CrockettTexas.htm Crockett Texas and Crockett Texas Hotels Motels<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDuring this time, one of the first loop roads in the nation ([[Texas State Highway Loop 304|Loop 304]]) was built around the city. This traffic reliever was procured through the works of heavyweight politicians who called Crockett home. [[Blues]] singer [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] was once arrested in Crockett. In recent years, the economy of Crockett has expanded with the construction of new retail space on Loop 304. Several historic buildings in downtown have been renovated to accommodate new office and service space. Renewed interest in reserves of [[natural gas]] in the surrounding area has led to construction of energy infrastructure and receipt of royalty revenues for land.\n\nIn 1854, A.T. Monroe, a grandnephew of [[U.S. President]] [[James Monroe]], came to Crockett from [[Virginia]]. He established what is now the Monroe-Crook House, built with brick placed between the inner and outer walls. George W. Crook purchased the residence in 1911. The house, open for public tours, is located in front of the John H. Wooters Public Library in the same block as the Crockett [[Presbyterian]] Church.<ref>Texas Historical Commission, historical marker, Monroe-Crook House, Crockett, Texas</ref> The Presbyterian Church was established in 1854.

A wealthy settler from [[Virginia]] named [[Richard Pearis]] arrived in South Carolina around 1754 and established relations with the Cherokee. Pearis had a child with a Cherokee woman and received about {{Convert|100,000|acres}} from the Cherokee around 1770. Pearis established a plantation on the [[Reedy River]] called the Great Plains in present-day downtown Greenville. The [[American Revolution]] divided the South Carolina country between the [[Loyalist]]s and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]]s. Pearis supported the Loyalists and together with their allies, the Cherokee. After the Cherokee attacked the Patriots, the Patriots retaliated by burning down Pearis' plantation and jailing him in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Pearis never returned to his plantation but [[Paris Mountain State Park|Paris Mountain]] is named after him.<ref>Whitemire, 76; Archie Vernon Huff, Jr., ''Greenville: The History of the City and County in the South Carolina Piedmont'' (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1995), 13.</ref> The [[Treaty of Dewitt's Corner]] in 1777 ceded almost all Cherokee land, including present-day Greenville, to [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty of Dewitt's Corner between the Cherokee Nation and South Carolina, 1777|url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/treatyofdewittscorner.htm|website=teachingushistory.org|publisher=Teaching American History in South Carolina Project|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville County]] was created in 1786 and was named for its physical appearance.

In 1797 Alston used his land holdings to establish a village called Pleasantburg where he also built a stately mansion. In 1816, Alston's land was purchased by [[Vardry McBee]], who then leased the Alston mansion for a summer resort, before making the mansion his home from 1835 until his death in 1864. Considered to be the father of Greenville, McBee donated land for many structures such as churches, academies, and a cotton mill. [[Furman University]] was funded by McBee who helped bring the university to Pleasantburg from [[Winnsboro, South Carolina]] in 1851. In 1853 McBee and other Greenville County leaders funded a new railroad called the [[Greenville and Columbia Railroad]].

Construction boomed in the 1870s such as the establishment of a bridge over the [[Reedy River]], new mills on the river and new railroads. [[The Greenville News]] was established in 1874 as Greenville's first daily newspaper. [[Southern Bell]] installed the first telephone lines in the city. The most important infrastructure that came to the city were cotton mills. Prominent cotton mill businesses operated near Greenville making it a cotton mill town.

Furman University and the Greenville Women's College also struggled in the crippling economy forcing them to merge in 1933. The [[Textile workers strike (1934)|Textile Workers Strike of 1934]] caused such an uproar in the city and surrounding mill towns that the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] had to subdue the chaos.

The [[Greenville\u2013Spartanburg International Airport]] was established in nearby [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]] in 1962.

A wealthy settler from [[Virginia]] named [[Richard Pearis]] arrived in South Carolina around 1754 and established relations with the Cherokee. Pearis had a child with a Cherokee woman and received about {{Convert|100,000|acres}} from the Cherokee around 1770. Pearis established a plantation on the [[Reedy River]] called the Great Plains in present-day downtown Greenville. The [[American Revolution]] divided the South Carolina country between the [[Loyalist]]s and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]]s. Pearis supported the Loyalists and together with their allies, the Cherokee. After the Cherokee attacked the Patriots, the Patriots retaliated by burning down Pearis' plantation and jailing him in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Pearis never returned to his plantation but [[Paris Mountain State Park|Paris Mountain]] is named after him.<ref>Whitemire, 76; Archie Vernon Huff, Jr., ''Greenville: The History of the City and County in the South Carolina Piedmont'' (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1995), 13.</ref> The [[Treaty of Dewitt's Corner]] in 1777 ceded almost all Cherokee land, including present-day Greenville, to [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty of Dewitt's Corner between the Cherokee Nation and South Carolina, 1777|url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/treatyofdewittscorner.htm|website=teachingushistory.org|publisher=Teaching American History in South Carolina Project|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville County]] was created in 1786 and was named for its physical appearance.

Alston]] came to Greenville County in 1788 and bought {{Convert|400|acre}} and a portion of Pearis' former plantation. In 1797 Alston used his land holdings to establish a village called Pleasantburg where he also built a stately mansion. In 1816, Alston's land was purchased by [[Vardry McBee]], who then leased the Alston mansion for a summer resort, before making the mansion his home from 1835 until his death in 1864. Considered to be the father of Greenville, McBee donated land for many structures such as churches, academies, and a cotton mill. [[Furman University]] was funded by McBee who helped bring the university to Pleasantburg from [[Winnsboro, South Carolina]] in 1851. In 1853 McBee and other Greenville County leaders funded a new railroad called the [[Greenville and Columbia Railroad]]. Pleasantburg boomed to around 1,000 in the 1850s due to the growth of McBee's donations and the attraction of the town as a summer resort for visitors.<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\">{{cite web| title=The History of Greenville| url=http://greenvillesc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1317| website=greenvillesc.gov| accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=American History Greenville County, South Carolina| url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/america/counties/greenville.htm| website=electricscotland.com| publisher=Electric Scotland| accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref> In 1831 Pleasantburg was incorporated as Greenville.<ref>{{cite web|title=Government|url=http://greenvillesc.gov/27/Government|website=greenvillesc.gov|publisher=City of Greenville|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Greenville===\n[[File:SwampRabbitGRNV1890s.jpg|thumb|The [[Greenville and Northern Railway]] in the 1890s which was converted into the [[Swamp Rabbit Trail]] in 2010.]]\n\nIn December 1860 Greenville supported a convention to debate the issue of secession for [[South Carolina]]. The Greenville District sent James Furman, William K. Easley, Perry E. Duncan, William H. Campbell, and James P. Harrison as delegates for the convention. On December 20, 1860, the South Carolina state convention, along with the Greenville delegation, voted to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Greenville County provided over 2,000 soldiers to the [[Confederate States Army]]. The town supplied food, clothing, and firearms to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Greenville saw no action from the war until 1865 when [[Union Army|Union troops]] came through the town looking for [[Jefferson Davis|President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy]] who had fled south from [[Richmond, Virginia]].

C. General Assembly establishing Greenville, the town, as a city. Construction boomed in the 1870s such as the establishment of a bridge over the [[Reedy River]], new mills on the river and new railroads. [[The Greenville News]] was established in 1874 as Greenville's first daily newspaper. [[Southern Bell]] installed the first telephone lines in the city. The most important infrastructure that came to the city were cotton mills. Prominent cotton mill businesses operated near Greenville making it a cotton mill town. By 1915 Greenville became known as the \"Textile Center of the South.\"<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\"/> From 1915 to 2004, the city hosted an important textile manufacturing trade fair, the [[Southern Textile Exposition]].\n\n[[File:GreenvilleSC1910.jpg|left|thumb|Main Street around 1910]]\nDuring World War I, Greenville served as a training camp center for Army recruits. After World War I commercial activity expanded with new movie theaters and department stores. The Mansion House was demolished and replaced with the [[Poinsett Hotel]] in 1925.<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\"/> The [[Great Depression]] hurt the economy of Greenville forcing mills to lay off workers. Furman University and the Greenville Women's College also struggled in the crippling economy forcing them to merge in 1933. The [[Textile workers strike (1934)|Textile Workers Strike of 1934]] caused such an uproar in the city and surrounding mill towns that the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] had to subdue the chaos. The [[New Deal]] established [[Sirrine Stadium]] and a new [[Greenville Technical Charter High School|Greenville High School]]. The [[Donaldson Air Force Base|Greenville Army Air Base]] was established in 1942 during World War II contributing to the further growth of Greenville.<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\"/>\n\nOn February 16, 1947, [[The lynching of Willie Earle|Willie Earle]], a Black man accused of stabbing a cab driver, was taken from his jail cell by a mob of mostly taxi drivers and [[Lynching|murdered]].

Furman University doubled its student population and moved to a new location. Higher education facilities such as [[Bob Jones University]] in 1947 and [[Greenville Technical College]] in 1962 were established in Greenville. The [[Greenville\u2013Spartanburg International Airport]] was established in nearby [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]] in 1962. The economy of Greenville finally waned in the 1970s leaving a void in downtown Greenville due to the flight of many retailers.
