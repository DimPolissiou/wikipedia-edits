However, Peterson's show has since moved back to its original slot on a Wednesday night, but at a later time, from 0200 to 0400. \"The Cosmic Jam\" was a two-hour show broadcast on Sunday nights on Mi-Soul.  As of 2019, Forge has a monthly show on NTS radio which is of a similar format to \"The Cosmic Jam\".\n\nThe two DJs play similar styles of music, have played at numerous clubs and also music weekenders.

The station's on air branding is \"103.3 The Edge\" and broadcasts on 103.3&nbsp;MHz FM.  WEDG has an [[alternative rock]] format and is best known for its morning radio hosts, \"[[Shredd and Ragan]].\"  The station's transmitter is located east of Delaware Park in Buffalo, and studios are located on the city's east side.\n\n==History==\n103.3 FM signed on in 1947. By the 1960s, it was known as [[WWWS|WYSL]]-FM. The station switched calls to '''WPHD''' in 1979, when a [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive rock format]] was added to the overnight programming. This format made WPHD famous, as well as its morning duo, Robert W. Taylor and Harv Moore, which ran from 1978 to 1989.\n\nOn September 23, 1989, the station changed call signs from WPHD to '''WUFX''', \"103.3 The Fox.\" Taylor and Moore were fired in favor of Shredd and Ragan, with Shredd coming from AM 1400 [[WWWS|WXBX]]. The format lasted about six years. (Both Taylor and Moore would eventually end up on [[WHTT-FM|WHTT]], which is now WEDG's sister station, on different shifts. Taylor is now retired and Moore went on to stints at [[WECK]], [[WHLD]], and then back to WECK; Taylor now also serves as WECK's imaging voice.)\n\nOn June 23, 1995, the station adopted an alternative rock format and its current call sign and branding.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-06-30.pdf</ref> At the time, Toronto radio station [[CFNY]] was making inroads in Western New York, and also rebranded itself \"The Edge\" shortly after the sign-on of WEDG; a move made outside the limits of Jacobs Media's trademark on \"The Edge\" radio brand for US stations. Originally an [[alternative rock]] station, it began leaning towards a harder edged [[active rock]] direction in [[2005 in radio|2005]] after then-rival [[WBUF]] flipped from [[active rock]] to [[hot talk]]. Through the late 2000s, WEDG rotated in more \"classic\" hard rock/heavy metal artists alongside their current playlist (the station was limited in how much classic material it could play, to avoid cannibalizing listenership from [[classic rock]] sister station, [[WGRF]]). Beginning in late 2014, WEDG began shifting from their active rock-leaning \"Acternative\" position, back to their heritage alternative rock roots, while still maintaining a few Active Rock songs in rotation. By the beginning of 2016, WEDG dropped the \"Rock Radio\" prefix and re-imaged the station as \"Buffalo. Rock.

The first game ranches in Africa were established in the 1960s, and the concept quickly grew in proliferation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Cloete|first=P. C.|last2=Taljaard|first2=P.

Jeff Flocken of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, states that \"despite the wild claims that trophy hunting brings millions of dollars in revenue to local people in otherwise poor communities, there is no proof of this.

The male cougar is extremely territorial and will often seek out females in the territory to both mate and kill any cubs to ensure room for their own offspring. Oftentimes these are young \"teenage\" males who are hormonal and unpredictable.\n\nThese \"teenage\" lions are mostly responsible for killed livestock and unwanted human interaction. In addition, they often drive females with cubs into hiding or new territory, forcing the females to hunt new prey they did not before.\n\n\"Basically the bottom line was this heavy hunting of cougars was actually causing all the problems we were seeing\", Wielgus said of his work in Washington.<ref name=\"Cruise\">{{Cite web|title = Is Trophy Hunting Helping Save African Elephants?|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151715-conservation-trophy-hunting-elephants-tusks-poaching-zimbabwe-namibia/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-11-23|first = Adam|last = Cruise|date = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n== Economic influence ==\n{{unbalanced section|September=2015|date=September 2015}}\n\n=== Perceived economic benefits of trophy hunting ===\nAccording to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]], trophy hunting \"provides an economic incentive\" for ranchers to continue to breed those species, and that hunting \"reduces the threat of the species' extinction\".<ref>http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2005/05-17432.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-hunting-endangered-animals-save-the-species/ | title=Can hunting endangered animals save the species?}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alces alces elan trophee chateau Tanlay.jpg|thumbnail|[[Moose]] head and deer [[antler]]s mounted as hunting trophies]]\nAccording to Dr G.C.

The removal the most significant animals (because of the size of their horns or mane for example) can severely affect the health of a species population. As Dr Rob Knell states 'Because these high-quality males with large secondary sexual traits tend to father a high proportion of the offspring, their 'good genes' can spread rapidly, so populations of strongly sexually selected animals can adapt quickly to new environments. Removing these males reverses this effect and could have serious and unintended consequences. If the population is having to adapt to a new environment and you remove even a small proportion of these high quality males, you could drive it to extinction.'<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42152393|title=Trophy hunting removes 'good genes'|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=2017-11-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nCited from [https://web.archive.org/web/20151123080850/http://www.league.org.uk/search?searchTerm=ecotourism%20can%20earn%20local%20communities The League Against Cruel Sports] \"A November 2004 study by the University of Port Elizabeth estimated that eco-tourism on private game reserves generated more than 15 times the income of livestock or game rearing or overseas hunting.

The trophy is the animal or part of the animal kept, and usually displayed, to represent the success of the hunt. The game sought is typically a large or impressively ornamented male, such as one having large horns or antlers. Generally, only parts of the animal are kept as a trophies (usually the head, skin, horns or antlers) and the carcass itself is used for food.\n\nTrophies are often displayed in the hunter's home or office, and often in specially designed \"trophy rooms\", sometimes called \"game rooms\" or \"gun rooms\", in which the hunter's weaponry is displayed as well.<ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/news/article.asp?docKey=600-200910110625KRTRIB__BUSNEWS_62982-2SO76MJGKK56MUPV67QJKEVUF2&params=timestamp%7C%7C10/11/2009%206:25%20AM%20ET%7C%7Cheadline%7C%7COn%20the%20hunt%20for%20a%20gun%20room%3F%3A%20Business%20celebrates%20a%20love%20of%20firearms%2C%20hunting%20big%20animals%20%5BThe%20Hutchinson%20News%2C%20Kan.%5D%7C%7CdocSource%7C%7CKnight%20Ridder/Tribune%7C%7Cprovider%7C%7CACQUIREMEDIA&ric=MHP Business Week] On the hunt for a gun room?: Business celebrates a love of firearms, hunting big animals, Knight Ridder, 10/11/2009 (retrieved 10/11/2009)</ref>\n\nTrophy hunting has both firm supporters and strong opponents.

The male cougar is extremely territorial and will often seek out females in the territory to both mate and kill any cubs to ensure room for their own offspring. Oftentimes these are young \"teenage\" males who are hormonal and unpredictable.\n\nThese \"teenage\" lions are mostly responsible for killed livestock and unwanted human interaction. In addition, they often drive females with cubs into hiding or new territory, forcing the females to hunt new prey they did not before.\n\n\"Basically the bottom line was this heavy hunting of cougars was actually causing all the problems we were seeing\", Wielgus said of his work in Washington.<ref name=\"Cruise\">{{Cite web|title = Is Trophy Hunting Helping Save African Elephants?|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151715-conservation-trophy-hunting-elephants-tusks-poaching-zimbabwe-namibia/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-11-23|first = Adam|last = Cruise|date = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n== Economic influence ==\n{{unbalanced section|September=2015|date=September 2015}}\n\n=== Perceived economic benefits of trophy hunting ===\nAccording to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]], trophy hunting \"provides an economic incentive\" for ranchers to continue to breed those species, and that hunting \"reduces the threat of the species' extinction\".<ref>http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2005/05-17432.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-hunting-endangered-animals-save-the-species/ | title=Can hunting endangered animals save the species?}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alces alces elan trophee chateau Tanlay.jpg|thumbnail|[[Moose]] head and deer [[antler]]s mounted as hunting trophies]]\nAccording to Dr G.C.

In his paper \"COMMERCIAL WILDLIFE RANCHING\u2019S CONTRIBUTION TO THE GREEN ECONOMY\", he states that \"commercial wildlife ranching is about\nappropriate land-use and rural development; it is less about animals per se, not a white affluent issue, not a conservation at-all-cost\nissue, but about economic sustainability\".<ref>http://www.sawma.co.za/images/Dry_Gert_Full_paper.pdf</ref> Dr Dry's paper concludes that \"It is a land-use option that is\necologically appropriate, economically sustainable, politically sensitive, and finally, socially just\", however no references or sources are provided for the data used.\n\nThe [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] reports in \"The baby and the bathwater:\ntrophy hunting, conservation and rural livelihoods\", that trophy hunting, when well-managed, can be sustainable and generate significant economic incentives for the conservation of target species, but that there are valid concerns about the legality, sustainability and ethics of some hunting practices.

The removal the most significant animals (because of the size of their horns or mane for example) can severely affect the health of a species population. As Dr Rob Knell states 'Because these high-quality males with large secondary sexual traits tend to father a high proportion of the offspring, their 'good genes' can spread rapidly, so populations of strongly sexually selected animals can adapt quickly to new environments. Removing these males reverses this effect and could have serious and unintended consequences. If the population is having to adapt to a new environment and you remove even a small proportion of these high quality males, you could drive it to extinction.'<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42152393|title=Trophy hunting removes 'good genes'|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=2017-11-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nCited from [https://web.archive.org/web/20151123080850/http://www.league.org.uk/search?searchTerm=ecotourism%20can%20earn%20local%20communities The League Against Cruel Sports] \"A November 2004 study by the University of Port Elizabeth estimated that eco-tourism on private game reserves generated more than 15 times the income of livestock or game rearing or overseas hunting.

By 1946, when Mabel died, their collection had grown to c.{{nbsp}}1,800 volumes.\n\nThere is another justification for the cut-off date. In the Introduction to Volume One of the Catalogue published in 1975, Osborne wrote: \"As time passed and our Collection grew, we came to understand that the term \u201cchildren\u2019s classic\u201d could not be so defined to suit the range of our interests.

Osborne had been a delegate for the Library Association of Great Britain at a meeting of American Library Association and travelled on to Canada with Mabel afterwards. They were impressed by what they saw in the [[Toronto Public Library]], and especially by the work of Lillian H. Smith, the head of the children's library services.\n\nWhen no British library was interested, Osborne immediately thought of Toronto.

The library accepted and the mechanics of arranging the move of the collection began.<ref name=Token2 />  Osborne continued to search for additional items throughout his life,<ref name=PoetDia>{{ cite journal |last=Hooky |first=Theresa |title=A Poet's Diary: A little warmer: Monday |journal=Long Eaton Advertiser |issue=Friday 15 March 1963 |pages=2 |date=1963-03-15 }}</ref>  and donate items to the collection.<ref name=Token2 /> The collection had grown to nearly 12,000 items by his death in 1978,<ref name=Token2 /> and the collection now contains over 80,000 items.<ref name=CBHS />\n\nVolume One of the catalogue<ref name=OCVol1>{{ cite book |last=St John |first=Judith |title=The Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books: 1566{{ndash}}1910: A Catalogue |volume=1 |date=1975}}</ref> of the collection was first published in 1958, and was reprinted in 1975 when Volume Two<ref name=OCVol2>{{ cite book |last=St John |first=Judith |last2=Tenny |first2=Dana |last3=MacTaggart |first3=Hazel I. |title=The Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books: 1476{{ndash}}1910: A Catalogue |volume=2 |date=1975 }}</ref> was published. Grenby and Reynolds note the while ''the availability of online catalogues has tranformed research'', printed catalogues can still be useful.

When Osborne donated his collection, the oldest item was from 1566, about 400 years old. Now the oldest item in the collection is a cuneiform tablet that is c.{{nbsp}}4000 years old.\n\nThe original Osborne Collection (with items up to the cut-off date of 1910) still forms the largest portion of the whole collection. It ranges from literary classics to popular culture, including children's novelties like moveables and miniatures. It also includes an extensive collection of works by [[G. A. Henty]],<ref name=FriOsb>{{ cite web |title=Osborne |website=Friends of the Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books |url=http://osbornecollection.ca/collections/osborne/ |accessdate=2020-02-17 }}</ref>  with nearly 1,800 items in the collection written by him.<ref name=HentySch>{{ cite web |title=Search Results for G.

Smith was the first professionally trained Children's librarian in the then British Empire and had set up the library services for children which had so impressed Osborne on his 1934 visit.<ref name=Token2 />  This collection  ''comprises creative books of literary and artistic merit, published in English since 1911'',<ref name=FriSmi>{{ cite web |title=Lillian H.
