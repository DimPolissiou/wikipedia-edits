A number of very substantial claims were made under those policies which cost the names a great deal of money.  Their losses were exacerbated because of a lack of reinsurance cover for those risks.  In earlier proceedings the names had brought a claim against the syndicate manager (Outhwaite) alleging negligence in this regard.  Outhwaite paid \u00a3116 million to settle those claims.\n\nThe names had also had \"stop loss\" insurance of their own with the respondents, the stop loss insurers.  The respondents had paid out under the stop loss policies.  The stop loss insurers now claimed to be [[subrogation|subrogated]] to the settlement money paid by Outhwaite.  It was not disputed that the stop loss insurers had a right of subrogation, but the dispute related to the amount to which they were subrogated.\n\nIn the lead judgment, [[Sydney Templeman, Baron Templeman|Lord Templeman]] used a hypothetical set of figures.  He assumed in each case that each of the names had suffered a net underwriting loss for the year of \u00a3160,000.  He also assumed that they had stop loss insurance for a total of \u00a3100,000 subject to an excess of \u00a325,000 (so the name would have to pay out \u00a325,000 of their own money before the stop loss insurance kicked in).  So the first \u00a325,000 was met by the name.  The \"next\" \u00a3100,000 was met by the stop loss insurers.  And the \"last\" \u00a335,000 was met by the name again (as the insurance cover was exhausted).  Lord Templeman also assumed that the hypothetical amount which each name recovered from Outhwaite was \u00a3130,000.  So the question was: how much of that \u00a3130,000 would the stop loss insurers be subrogated to?\n\n==Judgments==\n\n===First instance===\n\nAt first instance [[Mark Saville, Baron Saville of Newdigate|Saville J]] had held (using Lord Templeman's hypothetical figures) because each name had suffered a personal loss of \u00a360,000 then they could retain that amount of their share of the settlement payment, and the balance (\u00a370,000) would be paid over to the stop loss insurers by way of subrogation.<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 729H</ref>  However, as Lord Templeman pointed out, the difficulty with that is that it ignored the fact that the name agreed to bear the first excess layer of \u00a325,000, and so were effectively co-insurers for the loss to that extent.\n\nThat appeal was reversed in part by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], and from there the parties appealed and cross-appealed to the House of Lords.\n\n===House of Lords=== \n\nLord Templeman gave the lead judgment.  \n\n====Quantum====\n\nHe held that the \"first\" \u00a325,000 should be ignored as the names had contractually agreed to bear that loss.  He thought the best way to analyse the loss was to imagine three different policies of insurance covering the total amount of the loss: the first for up to \u00a325,000; the second for anything above \u00a325,000 up to \u00a3125,000; and third for anything above \u00a3125,000 up to \u00a3160,000.  Analysed that way the money received from Outhwaite would be applied to the third pool first (so the names go the first \u00a335,000 of the settlement amount), and then applied to the second pool (so the names received the next \u00a395,000, which exhausted the amounts received from Outhwaite).<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 730D.</ref>  He distinguished the case which Saville J had relied upon: ''Castellain v Preston'' (1883) 11 QBD 380.\n\n====Equitable lien====\n\nMuch more of his judgment was dedicated to the issue of whether an equitable lien arose.  There was considerable concern about whether the stop loss insurers could recover if the court did not impose an equitable lien.  Many of the names resided abroad, and it was expected that many of them might be declared bankrupt because of their inability to meet their primary obligations.<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 737D</ref>  After carefully reviewing a number of cases where equity intervened, either to hold that the assured held the sums as trustee, or to grant injunctions to restrain any misapplication of the proceeds, he summarised:\n<blockquote>\nIn order to protect the rights of the insurer under the doctrine of subrogation equity considers that the damages payable by the wrongdoer to the insured person are subject to an equitable lien or charge in favour of the insurer.<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 738D</ref>\n</blockquote>\nLord Templeman expressly declined to state whether an equitable lien would also extend to a cause of action itself (as opposed to the proceeds of such a claim).<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 740B</ref>\n\nLord Goff gave the first concurring judgment.  He noted that the law of subrogation had actually developed separately across different branches of law rather than cohesively.

A number of very substantial claims were made under those policies which cost the names a great deal of money.  Their losses were exacerbated because of a lack of reinsurance cover for those risks.  In earlier proceedings the names had brought a claim against the syndicate manager (Outhwaite) alleging negligence in this regard.  Outhwaite paid \u00a3116 million to settle those claims.\n\nThe names had also had \"stop loss\" insurance of their own with the respondents, the stop loss insurers.  The respondents had paid out under the stop loss policies.  The stop loss insurers now claimed to be [[subrogation|subrogated]] to the settlement money paid by Outhwaite.  It was not disputed that the stop loss insurers had a right of subrogation, but the dispute related to the amount to which they were subrogated.\n\nIn the lead judgment, [[Sydney Templeman, Baron Templeman|Lord Templeman]] used a hypothetical set of figures.  He assumed in each case that each of the names had suffered a net underwriting loss for the year of \u00a3160,000.  He also assumed that they had stop loss insurance for a total of \u00a3100,000 subject to an excess of \u00a325,000 (so the name would have to pay out \u00a325,000 of their own money before the stop loss insurance kicked in).  So the first \u00a325,000 was met by the name.  The \"next\" \u00a3100,000 was met by the stop loss insurers.  And the \"last\" \u00a335,000 was met by the name again (as the insurance cover was exhausted).  Lord Templeman also assumed that the hypothetical amount which each name recovered from Outhwaite was \u00a3130,000.  So the question was: how much of that \u00a3130,000 would the stop loss insurers be subrogated to?\n\n==Judgments==\n\n===First instance===\n\nAt first instance [[Mark Saville, Baron Saville of Newdigate|Saville J]] had held (using Lord Templeman's hypothetical figures) because each name had suffered a personal loss of \u00a360,000 then they could retain that amount of their share of the settlement payment, and the balance (\u00a370,000) would be paid over to the stop loss insurers by way of subrogation.<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 729H</ref>  However, as Lord Templeman pointed out, the difficulty with that is that it ignored the fact that the name agreed to bear the first excess layer of \u00a325,000, and so were effectively co-insurers for the loss to that extent.\n\nThat appeal was reversed in part by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], and from there the parties appealed and cross-appealed to the House of Lords.\n\n===House of Lords=== \n\nLord Templeman gave the lead judgment.  \n\n====Quantum====\n\nHe held that the \"first\" \u00a325,000 should be ignored as the names had contractually agreed to bear that loss.  He thought the best way to analyse the loss was to imagine three different policies of insurance covering the total amount of the loss: the first for up to \u00a325,000; the second for anything above \u00a325,000 up to \u00a3125,000; and third for anything above \u00a3125,000 up to \u00a3160,000.  Analysed that way the money received from Outhwaite would be applied to the third pool first (so the names go the first \u00a335,000 of the settlement amount), and then applied to the second pool (so the names received the next \u00a395,000, which exhausted the amounts received from Outhwaite).<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 730D.</ref>  He distinguished the case which Saville J had relied upon: ''Castellain v Preston'' (1883) 11 QBD 380.\n\n====Equitable lien====\n\nMuch more of his judgment was dedicated to the issue of whether an equitable lien arose.  There was considerable concern about whether the stop loss insurers could recover if the court did not impose an equitable lien.  Many of the names resided abroad, and it was expected that many of them might be declared bankrupt because of their inability to meet their primary obligations.<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 737D</ref>  After carefully reviewing a number of cases where equity intervened, either to hold that the assured held the sums as trustee, or to grant injunctions to restrain any misapplication of the proceeds, he summarised:\n<blockquote>\nIn order to protect the rights of the insurer under the doctrine of subrogation equity considers that the damages payable by the wrongdoer to the insured person are subject to an equitable lien or charge in favour of the insurer.<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 738D</ref>\n</blockquote>\nLord Templeman expressly declined to state whether an equitable lien would also extend to a cause of action itself (as opposed to the proceeds of such a claim).<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 740B</ref>\n\nLord Goff gave the first concurring judgment.  He noted that the law of subrogation had actually developed separately across different branches of law rather than cohesively.  He noted that the cases was \"spadmodic but consistent\"<ref>[1993] AC 713 at 741H</ref> in holding that equity would protect the insurer's claim.  He felt the most important case on this was ''White v Dobinson'' (1844) 14 Sim 273; 116 LTOS 233.  Lord Goff respectfully doubted the expression of opinion made by [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Diplock J]] in ''Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd v Nisbett Shipping Co Ltd'' [1962] 2 QB 330 at 339  and repeated as Lord Diplock in ''Hobbs v Marlowe'' [1978] AC 16 at 30 to the effect that subrogation was a common law right based upon implied terms which was only supported by equity.\n\nLord Browne-Wilkinson gave a short supporting judgments, largely focussed upon whether the right of subrogation was legal or equitable, expressing the firm view that it was equitable.\n\nLord Jauncey gave a short concurring judgment, and Lord Slynn merely expressed agreement.\n\n==Commentary==\n\n''Lord Napier v Hunter'' has generally been accepted without criticism, and is now treated as one of the leading authorities in relation to the English law of unjust enrichment, and in particular with respect to proprietary remedies in relation thereto.<ref name=GoffJones>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Charles |last2=Mitchell |first2=Paul |last3=Watterson |first3=Stephen |title=Goff & Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment |publisher=[[Sweet & Maxwell]] |year=2016 |edition=9th |isbn=978-0-414-05523-0 |at=para 21-93|quote=The leading case on this topic is ''Lord Napier and Ettrick v Hunter''.}}</ref>  However, the editors of ''Goff & Jones'' comment: \"There are good reasons for thinking that the House of Lords went too far in ''Napier'' when it gave the Stop Loss insurers a proprietary claim.

Dickson wrote that the references to Japanese culture in Kirschner's content have garnered her some criticism, as she has been \"accused of racism and [[cultural appropriation]] in her cosplay, as well as capitalizing on the eroticization of young girls.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/> Conversely, Japanese adult performer [[Marica Hase]] opined \"I see her manga characters as more of an homage and not racist.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/>\n\nOn why Kirschner attracts much controversy, Dickson wrote that:\n\n<blockquote>Delphine markets herself as a 'gamer girl', which engages with a very specific stereotype about women in gaming. In the gaming community, there's a longstanding perception of female gamers as desperate attention-seekers who sexualize themselves to get more views and capitalize on horny dudes' desire for nerdy female counterparts.<ref name=Dickson2019/></blockquote>\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web|last=Griggs|first=Mary Beth|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691727/dna-bath-water-belle-delphine-gamer-girl|title=If you bought influencer bathwater, could you test it for DNA?|work=[[The Verge]]|date=12 July 2019|accessdate=21 July 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delphine, Belle}}\n[[Category:1999 births]]\n[[Category:Beauty and makeup YouTubers]]\n[[Category:Cosplayers]]\n[[Category:English people of South African descent]]\n[[Category:Female YouTubers]]\n[[Category:Glamour models]]\n[[Category:Instagram accounts]]\n[[Category:Internet-related controversies]]\n[[Category:Internet memes introduced in 2018]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Cape Town]]\n[[Category:Social media influencers]]\n[[Category:South African emigrants to the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:South African female models]]\n[[Category:South African YouTubers]]\n[[Category:Women and video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox model\n| honorific_prefix =  \n| name             = Belle Delphine\n| honorific_suffix = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| native_name      = \n| native_name_lang = \n| birth_name       = Mary-Belle Kirschner\n| birth_date       = {{birth date and age|1999|10|23|df=yes}} \n| birth_place      = [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]\n| residence        = Brighton, East Sussex \n| nationality      = British<ref name=Leskin2019-a/>\n| other_names      = Bunny Delphine\n| citizenship      = \n| alma_mater       = \n| occupation       = Model, Internet personality\n| years_active     = 2015\u2013present\n| hair_color       = Brown\n| eye_color        = Hazel\n| height           = 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m)\n| website          = \n| signature        =\n| module            = {{Infobox YouTube personality|embed=yes\n| channel_direct_url = channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w\n| channel_display_name = belle delphine\n| years_active      = 2016, 2018\u2013present\n| genre             = {{flatlist|\n* [[Beauty YouTuber|Beauty and makeup]]\n* [[vlog]]\n}}\n| subscribers       = 790K+<!--please update date in stats_update field when you update this--> <!--do not add the date here as that is already at the bottom of the infobox-->\n| views             = 20 million<!--please update date in stats_update field when you update this--> <!--do not add the date here as that is already at the bottom of the infobox-->\n| network           = \n| associated_acts   = \n| silver_button     = yes\n| silver_year       = 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w/monthly|title=UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w (belle delphine) Monthly YouTube statistics|publisher=[[Social Blade]]|accessdate=29 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729081246/https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w/monthly|archive-date=29 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| gold_button       = \n| gold_year         = \n| diamond_button    = \n| diamond_year      = \n| ruby_button       = \n| ruby_year         = \n| stats_update      = 7 March 2020\n}}\n}}\n'''Mary-Belle Kirschner''' (born 23 October 1999), better known by her online alias '''Belle Delphine''', is an English [[Internet personality]], model, and [[YouTuber]]. She is most notable for her [[glamour photography|glamour]] and [[cosplay]] [[Instagram model|modeling]] on [[Instagram]]. Her posts on the platform featured a risqu\u00e9 and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends. As a result of her online activity, she became an Internet meme in her own right.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Kirschner registered a joke [[Pornhub]] account and began selling her \"GamerGirl Bath Water\" product through her online store, garnering her a great amount of media coverage online. Shortly after, her Instagram account was deleted due to community guideline violations. Media outlets have described Kirschner as a cross between an [[Internet troll]] and a performance artist, as well as an [[e-girls and e-boys|e-girl]]. Kirschner has also been cited as an influence on the e-girl aesthetic commonly adopted by [[TikTok]] users.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years and developing an aesthetic===\nKirschner was born on 23 October 1999 in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and eventually moved to the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=Sloan2019>{{cite web|last=Sloan|first=Elizabeth|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/07/belle-delphine/|title=Belle Delphine: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|work=[[Heavy.com|Heavy]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720020343/https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/07/belle-delphine/|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=PopBuzz2019>{{cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/belle-delphine/real-name/|title=Belle Delphine: 12 Facts You (Probably) Didn't Know About The Online Star|work=[[Global (company)#Digital-only stations|PopBuzz]]|publisher=[[Global (company)|Global]]|date=2019|accessdate=31 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831210349/https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/belle-delphine/real-name/|archive-date=31 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Aggeler2019>{{cite web|last=Aggeler|first=Madeleine|url=https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/belle-delphine-bath-water.html|title=Who Is Belle Delphine, the Gamer Girl Selling Her Bathwater?|work=[[The Cut (blog)|The Cut]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713005639/https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/belle-delphine-bath-water.html|archive-date=13 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Kirschner has had an Instagram account since 2015,<ref name=Leskin2019-a>{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7|title=Meet Belle Delphine, the Instagram star who sold her bathwater to 'thirsty gamer boys' and had her account shut down over a rules violation|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=10 September 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008235928/https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7/|archive-date=8 October 2019|url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720150013/https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7|title=Meet Belle Delphine, the Instagram star who sold her bathwater to 'thirsty gamer boys' and had her account shut down over a rules violation [19 July 2019 archive]|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019|archive-date=19 July 2019}}</ref> and in July 2016, she registered a [[YouTube]] account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w/about|title=belle delphine \u2013 YouTube about page|work=belle delphine|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=28 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729035941/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w/about|archive-date=29 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In August 2016, Kirschner uploaded a [[Beauty YouTuber|makeup tutorial video]], demonstrating how to do a [[eye shadow|cat-eye]].<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r0Xe7ESrBE|title=My everyday makeup! {{pipe}} Belle|work=belle delphine|publisher=YouTube|date=14 August 2016|accessdate=28 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710011428/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r0Xe7ESrBE|archive-date=10 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Dickson2019>{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=EJ|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/belle-delphine-bathwater-gamer-girl-troll-857192/|title=Is Belle Delphine, a.k.a.
