His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes<ref>His anecdotes are 'casual' only in appearance; Montaigne writes: 'Neither my anecdotes nor my quotations are always employed simply as examples, for authority, or for ornament...They often carry, off the subject under discussion, the seed of a richer and more daring matter, and they resonate obliquely with a more delicate tone,' Michel de Montaigne, ''Essais'', Pl\u00e9iade, Paris (ed.

The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that, \"I am myself the matter of my book\", was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne came to be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt that began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his [[Skepticism|skeptical]] remark, \"''Que s\u00e7ay-je''?\" (\"What do I know?\", in [[Middle French]]; now rendered as ''Que sais-je?'' in modern French).\n\n==Life==\n[[File:St Michel de Montaigne Ch\u00e2teau01.jpg|thumb|200px|''Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne'', a house built on the land once owned by Montaigne's family; his original family home no longer exists, although the [[Montaigne's tower|tower]] in which he wrote still stands]]\n[[File:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Portrait of Michel de Montaigne by [[Daniel Dumonstier|Dumonstier]] around 1578]]\n[[Image:St Michel de Montaigne Tour03.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Tour de Montaigne'' ([[Montaigne's tower]]), where Montaigne's library was located, remains mostly unchanged since the sixteenth century]]\n\nMontaigne was born in the [[Aquitaine]] region of France, on the family estate [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne]], in a town now called [[Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne]], close to [[Bordeaux]].

Montaigne's relationship with his father, however, is frequently reflected upon and discussed in his essays.\n\nMontaigne's education began in early childhood and followed a [[pedagogy|pedagogical plan]] that his father had developed, refined by the advice of the latter's [[humanism|humanist]] friends. Soon after his birth, Montaigne was brought to a small cottage, where he lived the first three years of life in the sole company of a peasant family, in order to, according to the elder Montaigne, \"draw the boy close to the people, and to the life conditions of the people, who need our help\".<ref>Montaigne. ''Essays'', III, 13</ref> After these first spartan years, Montaigne was brought back to the ch\u00e2teau. Another objective was for [[Latin language|Latin]] to become his first language.\n\nThe intellectual education of Montaigne was assigned to a German tutor (a doctor named Horstanus, who could not speak French). His father hired only servants who could speak Latin, and they also were given strict orders always to speak to the boy in Latin. The same rule applied to his mother, father, and servants, who were obliged to use only Latin words he employed, and thus they acquired a knowledge of the very language his tutor taught him. Montaigne's Latin education was accompanied by constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation. He was familiarized with Greek by a pedagogical method that employed games, conversation, and exercises of solitary meditation, rather than the more traditional books.\n\nThe atmosphere of the boy's upbringing, although designed by highly refined rules taken under advisement by his father, created in the boy's life the spirit of \"liberty and delight\" that he later would describe as making him \"relish... duty by an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion...without any severity or constraint\"; yet he would have everything to take advantage of his freedom. And so a musician woke him every morning, playing one instrument or another,<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first= Robert Maynard|editor1-last=Hutchins |editor2-first=W.

He then began his study of law at the [[University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail|University of Toulouse]] in 1546 and entered a career in the local legal system. He was a counselor of the Court des Aides of [[P\u00e9rigueux]] and, in 1557, he was appointed counselor of the [[Parlement]] in Bordeaux, a high court. From 1561 to 1563 he was [[courtier]] at the court of [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] and he was present with the king at the [[siege of Rouen (1562)]]. He was awarded the highest honour of the French nobility, the [[Collar (Order of Knighthood)|collar]] of the Order of St. Michael, something to which he aspired from his youth.\n\nWhile serving at the Bordeaux Parlement, he became a very close friend of the humanist poet [[\u00c9tienne de la Bo\u00e9tie]], whose death in 1563 deeply affected Montaigne. It has been suggested by Donald M. Frame, in his introduction to ''The Complete Essays of Montaigne'' that because of Montaigne's \"imperious need to communicate\", after losing \u00c9tienne he began the ''[[Essais]]'' as a new \"means of communication\" and that \"the reader takes the place of the dead friend\".<ref>Frame, Donald (translator).

After this, he inherited the family's estate, the Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne, to which he moved back in 1570, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. Another literary accomplishment was Montaigne's posthumous edition of the works of his friend, Bo\u00e9tie.\n\nIn 1571, he retired from public life to the [[Montaigne's tower|Tower of the ch\u00e2teau]], his so-called \"citadel\", in the [[Dordogne]], where he almost totally isolated himself from every social and family affair. Locked up in his library, which contained a collection of some 1,500 works, he began work on his ''Essais'' (\"Essays\"), first published in 1580. On the day of his 38th birthday, as he entered this almost ten-year period of self-imposed reclusion, he had the following inscription placed on the crown of the bookshelves of his working chamber:\n\n<blockquote>In the year of Christ 1571, at the age of thirty-eight, on the last day of February, his birthday, Michael de Montaigne, long weary of the servitude of the court and of public employments, while still entire, retired to the bosom of the learned virgins, where in calm and freedom from all cares he will spend what little remains of his life, now more than half run out. If the fates permit, he will complete this abode, this sweet ancestral retreat; and he has consecrated it to his freedom, tranquility, and leisure.<ref>As cited by Richard L.

Montaigne believed that a knowledge of devastating effects of vice is calculated to excite an aversion to vicious habits.\n\nIn 1578, Montaigne, whose health had always been excellent, started suffering from painful [[kidney stone disease|kidney stone]]s, a tendency he inherited from his father's family. Throughout this illness, he would have nothing to do with doctors or drugs.<ref name=cne/> From 1580 to 1581, Montaigne traveled in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, partly in search of a cure, establishing himself at [[Bagni di Lucca]], where he took the waters.

After Fabri examined Montaigne's ''Essais'' the text was returned to him on 20 March 1581. Montaigne had apologized for references to the pagan notion of \"fortuna\" as well as for writing favorably of [[Julian the Apostate]] and of heretical poets, and was released to follow his own conscience in making emendations to the text.<ref>''Treccani.it, L'encicolpedia Italiana, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sisto-fabri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Dizionario Biografico''].

He returned and served as mayor. He was re-elected in 1583 and served until 1585, again moderating between Catholics and Protestants. The [[Black Death|plague]] broke out in Bordeaux toward the end of his second term in office, in 1585. In 1586, the plague and the [[French Wars of Religion]] prompted him to leave his ch\u00e2teau for two years.<ref name=cne/>\n\nMontaigne continued to extend, revise, and oversee the publication of the ''Essais''.

He describes his own poor memory, his ability to solve problems and mediate conflicts without truly getting emotionally involved, his disdain for the human pursuit of lasting fame, and his attempts to detach himself from worldly things to prepare for his timely death.

Therefore, students could not truly learn. Montaigne believed that, to learn truly, a student had to take the information and make it their own.\n\nAt the foundation Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for the student to become well educated.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|66}} Education by a tutor was to be conducted at the pace of the student.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|67}}He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with the student, letting the student speak first. The tutor also should allow for discussions and debates to be had. Such a dialogue was intended to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.\n\nIndividualized learning was integral to his theory of child education. He argued that the student combines information already known with what is learned and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information.<ref name=\"Worley\">Worley, Virginia.

'' ''Educational Theory'', June 2012, Vol. 62 Issue 3, p. 343\u201370.</ref>{{rp|356}} Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage the natural curiosity of students and allow them to question things.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|68}}He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child's curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that the child is curious about.\n\nExperience also was a key element to learning for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of information often practised in book learning.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|62}}{{rp|67}}He argued that students would become passive adults, blindly obeying and lacking the ability to think on their own.<ref name=\"Worley\"/>{{rp|354}} Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|62}} He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books.<ref name=\"Ediger\"/> For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.\n\nMontaigne's views on child education continue to have an influence in the present. Variations of Montaigne's ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day, encouraging individualized learning. He believed in the importance of experience, over book learning and memorization. Ultimately, Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practising an active and socially interactive lifestyle.<ref name=\"Worley\"/>{{rp|355}}\n\n==Related writers and influence==\n[[File:Montaigne Scholarship student taking notes Shimer College 2011.jpg|thumb|Student taking notes on Montaigne's ''Essays'' at [[Shimer College]]]]\n\nThinkers exploring ideas similar to Montaigne include [[Erasmus]], [[Thomas More]], and [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]], who all worked about fifty years before Montaigne.<ref name=\"friedrich\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0lPH4P9kIMC&pg=PA391|title=Montaigne|first1=Hugo|last1=Friedrich|last2=Desan|first2=Philippe|year=1991|isbn=9780520072534|page=|ref=harv}}</ref> Many of Montaigne's Latin quotations are from Erasmus' ''[[Adagia]]'', and most critically, all of his quotations from [[Socrates]].

His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes<ref>His anecdotes are 'casual' only in appearance; Montaigne writes: 'Neither my anecdotes nor my quotations are always employed simply as examples, for authority, or for ornament...They often carry, off the subject under discussion, the seed of a richer and more daring matter, and they resonate obliquely with a more delicate tone,' Michel de Montaigne, ''Essais'', Pl\u00e9iade, Paris (ed.

The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that, \"I am myself the matter of my book\", was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne came to be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt that began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his [[Skepticism|skeptical]] remark, \"''Que s\u00e7ay-je''?\" (\"What do I know?\", in [[Middle French]]; now rendered as ''Que sais-je?'' in modern French).\n\n==Life==\n[[File:St Michel de Montaigne Ch\u00e2teau01.jpg|thumb|200px|''Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne'', a house built on the land once owned by Montaigne's family; his original family home no longer exists, although the [[Montaigne's tower|tower]] in which he wrote still stands]]\n[[File:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Portrait of Michel de Montaigne by [[Daniel Dumonstier|Dumonstier]] around 1578]]\n[[Image:St Michel de Montaigne Tour03.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Tour de Montaigne'' ([[Montaigne's tower]]), where Montaigne's library was located, remains mostly unchanged since the sixteenth century]]\n\nMontaigne was born in the [[Aquitaine]] region of France, on the family estate [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne]], in a town now called [[Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne]], close to [[Bordeaux]].

Montaigne's relationship with his father, however, is frequently reflected upon and discussed in his essays.\n\nMontaigne's education began in early childhood and followed a [[pedagogy|pedagogical plan]] that his father had developed, refined by the advice of the latter's [[humanism|humanist]] friends. Soon after his birth, Montaigne was brought to a small cottage, where he lived the first three years of life in the sole company of a peasant family, in order to, according to the elder Montaigne, \"draw the boy close to the people, and to the life conditions of the people, who need our help\".<ref>Montaigne. ''Essays'', III, 13</ref> After these first spartan years, Montaigne was brought back to the ch\u00e2teau. Another objective was for [[Latin language|Latin]] to become his first language.\n\nThe intellectual education of Montaigne was assigned to a German tutor (a doctor named Horstanus, who could not speak French). His father hired only servants who could speak Latin, and they also were given strict orders always to speak to the boy in Latin. The same rule applied to his mother, father, and servants, who were obliged to use only Latin words he employed, and thus they acquired a knowledge of the very language his tutor taught him. Montaigne's Latin education was accompanied by constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation. He was familiarized with Greek by a pedagogical method that employed games, conversation, and exercises of solitary meditation, rather than the more traditional books.\n\nThe atmosphere of the boy's upbringing, although designed by highly refined rules taken under advisement by his father, created in the boy's life the spirit of \"liberty and delight\" that he later would describe as making him \"relish... duty by an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion...without any severity or constraint\"; yet he would have everything to take advantage of his freedom. And so a musician woke him every morning, playing one instrument or another,<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first= Robert Maynard|editor1-last=Hutchins |editor2-first=W.

He then began his study of law at the [[University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail|University of Toulouse]] in 1546 and entered a career in the local legal system. He was a counselor of the Court des Aides of [[P\u00e9rigueux]] and, in 1557, he was appointed counselor of the [[Parlement]] in Bordeaux, a high court. From 1561 to 1563 he was [[courtier]] at the court of [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] and he was present with the king at the [[siege of Rouen (1562)]]. He was awarded the highest honour of the French nobility, the [[Collar (Order of Knighthood)|collar]] of the Order of St. Michael, something to which he aspired from his youth.\n\nWhile serving at the Bordeaux Parlement, he became a very close friend of the humanist poet [[\u00c9tienne de la Bo\u00e9tie]], whose death in 1563 deeply affected Montaigne. It has been suggested by Donald M. Frame, in his introduction to ''The Complete Essays of Montaigne'' that because of Montaigne's \"imperious need to communicate\", after losing \u00c9tienne he began the ''[[Essais]]'' as a new \"means of communication\" and that \"the reader takes the place of the dead friend\".<ref>Frame, Donald (translator).

After this, he inherited the family's estate, the Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne, to which he moved back in 1570, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. Another literary accomplishment was Montaigne's posthumous edition of the works of his friend, Bo\u00e9tie.\n\nIn 1571, he retired from public life to the [[Montaigne's tower|Tower of the ch\u00e2teau]], his so-called \"citadel\", in the [[Dordogne]], where he almost totally isolated himself from every social and family affair. Locked up in his library, which contained a collection of some 1,500 works, he began work on his ''Essais'' (\"Essays\"), first published in 1580. On the day of his 38th birthday, as he entered this almost ten-year period of self-imposed reclusion, he had the following inscription placed on the crown of the bookshelves of his working chamber:\n\n<blockquote>In the year of Christ 1571, at the age of thirty-eight, on the last day of February, his birthday, Michael de Montaigne, long weary of the servitude of the court and of public employments, while still entire, retired to the bosom of the learned virgins, where in calm and freedom from all cares he will spend what little remains of his life, now more than half run out.

Montaigne believed that a knowledge of devastating effects of vice is calculated to excite an aversion to vicious habits.\n\nIn 1578, Montaigne, whose health had always been excellent, started suffering from painful [[kidney stone disease|kidney stone]]s, a tendency he inherited from his father's family.

After Fabri examined Montaigne's ''Essais'' the text was returned to him on 20 March 1581.

He returned and served as mayor. He was re-elected in 1583 and served until 1585, again moderating between Catholics and Protestants. The [[Black Death|plague]] broke out in Bordeaux toward the end of his second term in office, in 1585. In 1586, the plague and the [[French Wars of Religion]] prompted him to leave his ch\u00e2teau for two years.<ref name=cne/>\n\nMontaigne continued to extend, revise, and oversee the publication of the ''Essais''. In 1588 he wrote its third book and also met [[Marie de Gournay]], an author who admired his work and later edited and published it.

Montaigne's writings are studied as literature and philosophy around the world.\n\n[[File:Michel de Montaigne.jpg|thumb|Michel de Montaigne]]\nInspired by his consideration of the lives and ideals of the leading figures of his age, he finds the great variety and volatility of human nature to be its most basic features. He describes his own poor memory, his ability to solve problems and mediate conflicts without truly getting emotionally involved, his disdain for the human pursuit of lasting fame, and his attempts to detach himself from worldly things to prepare for his timely death. He writes about his disgust with the religious conflicts of his time. He believed that humans are not able to attain true certainty.

In education, he favored concrete examples and experience over the teaching of abstract knowledge intended to be accepted uncritically.

He believed it was necessary to educate children in a variety of ways. He also disagreed with the way information was being presented to students. It was being presented in a way that encouraged students to take the information that was taught to them as absolute truth. Students were denied the chance to question the information. Therefore, students could not truly learn. Montaigne believed that, to learn truly, a student had to take the information and make it their own.\n\nAt the foundation Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for the student to become well educated.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|66}} Education by a tutor was to be conducted at the pace of the student.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|67}}He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with the student, letting the student speak first. The tutor also should allow for discussions and debates to be had. Such a dialogue was intended to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.\n\nIndividualized learning was integral to his theory of child education. He argued that the student combines information already known with what is learned and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information.<ref name=\"Worley\">Worley, Virginia. ''Painting With Impasto: Metaphors, Mirrors, and Reflective Regression in Montagne's 'Of the Education of Children.' '' ''Educational Theory'', June 2012, Vol. 62 Issue 3, p. 343\u201370.</ref>{{rp|356}} Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage the natural curiosity of students and allow them to question things.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|68}}He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child's curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that the child is curious about.\n\nExperience also was a key element to learning for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of information often practised in book learning.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|62}}{{rp|67}}He argued that students would become passive adults, blindly obeying and lacking the ability to think on their own.<ref name=\"Worley\"/>{{rp|354}} Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned.<ref name=\"Hall1997\"/>{{rp|62}} He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books.<ref name=\"Ediger\"/> For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.\n\nMontaigne's views on child education continue to have an influence in the present. Variations of Montaigne's ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day, encouraging individualized learning. He believed in the importance of experience, over book learning and memorization. Ultimately, Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practising an active and socially interactive lifestyle.<ref name=\"Worley\"/>{{rp|355}}\n\n==Related writers and influence==\n[[File:Montaigne Scholarship student taking notes Shimer College 2011.jpg|thumb|Student taking notes on Montaigne's ''Essays'' at [[Shimer College]]]]\n\nThinkers exploring ideas similar to Montaigne include [[Erasmus]], [[Thomas More]], and [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]], who all worked about fifty years before Montaigne.<ref name=\"friedrich\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0lPH4P9kIMC&pg=PA391|title=Montaigne|first1=Hugo|last1=Friedrich|last2=Desan|first2=Philippe|year=1991|isbn=9780520072534|page=|ref=harv}}</ref> Many of Montaigne's Latin quotations are from Erasmus' ''[[Adagia]]'', and most critically, all of his quotations from [[Socrates]].

{"title_page": "String theory", "text_new": "{{short description|Theoretical framework in physics}}\n{{About|physics|string algorithms|String (computer science)||String (disambiguation)}}\n{{seeintro|Introduction to M-theory}}\n{{String theory}}\n\nIn [[physics]], '''string theory''' is a [[Mathematical theory|theoretical framework]] in which the [[Point particle|point-like particles]] of [[particle physics]] are replaced by [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|one-dimensional]] objects called [[String (physics)|strings]]. It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its [[mass]], [[charge (physics)|charge]], and other properties determined by the [[vibration]]al state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the [[graviton]], a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] particle that carries [[gravity|gravitational force]]. Thus string theory is a theory of [[quantum gravity]].\n\nString theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of [[fundamental physics]]. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in [[black hole]] physics, early universe [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[condensed matter physics]], and it has stimulated a number of major developments in [[pure mathematics]]. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a [[theory of everything]], a self-contained [[mathematical model]] that describes all [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental force]]s and forms of [[matter]]. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details. \n\nString theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the [[strong nuclear force]], before being abandoned in favor of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The earliest version of string theory, [[bosonic string theory]], incorporated only the class of [[particle]]s known as [[boson]]s. It later developed into [[superstring theory]], which posits a connection called [[supersymmetry]] between bosons and the class of particles called [[fermion]]s. Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in 11 dimensions known as [[M-theory]]. In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a [[quantum field theory]].\n\nOne of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. Another issue is that the theory is thought to describe an enormous [[string landscape|landscape]] of possible universes, and this has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory. These issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics and question the value of continued research on string theory unification.\n\n== Fundamentals==\n[[Image:Open and closed strings.svg|right|thumb|alt=A wavy open segment and closed loop of string.|The fundamental objects of string theory are open and closed [[string (physics)|strings]].]]\n\nIn the 20th century, two theoretical frameworks emerged for formulating the laws of physics. The first is [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], a theory that explains the force of [[gravity]] and the structure of [[spacetime]] at the macro-level. The other is [[quantum mechanics]] which is a completely different formulation to describe physical phenomena using the known [[probability]] principles at the micro-level. By the late 1970s, these two frameworks had proven to be sufficient to explain most of the observed features of the [[universe]], from [[elementary particle]]s to [[atom]]s to the evolution of stars and the universe as a whole.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, p. 1\">Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 1</ref>\n\nIn spite of these successes, there are still many problems that remain to be solved. One of the deepest problems in modern physics is the problem of [[quantum gravity]].<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, p. 1\"/> The general theory of relativity is formulated within the framework of [[classical physics]], whereas the other [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] are described within the framework of quantum mechanics. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 6</ref> In addition to the problem of developing a consistent theory of quantum gravity, there are many other fundamental problems in the physics of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], [[black hole]]s, and the early universe.{{efn|For example, physicists are still working to understand the phenomenon of [[quark confinement]], the paradoxes of [[black holes]], and the origin of [[dark energy]].}}\n\nString theory is a [[mathematical theory|theoretical framework]] that attempts to address these questions and many others. The starting point for string theory is the idea that the [[point particle|point-like particles]] of [[particle physics]] can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called [[string (physics)|strings]]. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, there is only one kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its [[mass]], [[charge (physics)|charge]], and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as [[vibrating strings]]. In string theory, one of the vibrational states of the string gives rise to the [[graviton]], a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, pp. 2\">Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 2\u20133</ref>\n\nOne of the main developments of the past several decades in string theory was the discovery of certain 'dualities', mathematical transformations that identify one physical theory with another. Physicists studying string theory have discovered a number of these dualities between different versions of string theory, and this has led to the conjecture that all consistent versions of string theory are subsumed in a single framework known as [[M-theory]].<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 9\u201312</ref>\n\nStudies of string theory have also yielded a number of results on the nature of black holes and the gravitational interaction. There are certain paradoxes that arise when one attempts to understand the quantum aspects of black holes, and work on string theory has attempted to clarify these issues. In late 1997 this line of work culminated in the discovery of the [[anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence]] or AdS/CFT.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 14\u201315</ref> This is a theoretical result which relates string theory to other physical theories which are better understood theoretically. The AdS/CFT correspondence has implications for the study of black holes and quantum gravity, and it has been applied to other subjects, including [[nuclear physics|nuclear]]<ref name=\"Klebanov and Maldacena 2009\">Klebanov and Maldacena 2009</ref> and [[condensed matter physics]].<ref name=\"Merali 2011\">Merali 2011</ref><ref>Sachdev 2013</ref>\n\nSince string theory incorporates all of the fundamental interactions, including gravity, many physicists hope that it will eventually be developed to the point where it fully describes our universe, making it a [[theory of everything]]. One of the goals of current research in string theory is to find a solution of the theory that reproduces the observed spectrum of elementary particles, with a small [[cosmological constant]], containing [[dark matter]] and a plausible mechanism for [[cosmic inflation]]. While there has been progress toward these goals, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of details.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 3, 15\u201316</ref>\n\nOne of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. The scattering of strings is most straightforwardly defined using the techniques of [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], but it is not known in general how to define string theory [[Non-perturbative|nonperturbatively]].<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 8</ref> It is also not clear whether there is any principle by which string theory selects its [[vacuum state]], the physical state that determines the properties of our universe.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 13\u201314</ref> These problems have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to the unification of physics and question the value of continued research on these problems.<ref name=\"Woit 2006\">Woit 2006</ref>\n\n===Strings===\n{{main|String (physics)}}\n\n[[Image:World lines and world sheet.svg|left|thumb|250px|Interaction in the quantum world: [[worldline]]s of point-like [[particles]] or a [[worldsheet]] swept up by closed [[string (physics)|strings]] in string theory.]]\n\nThe application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the [[electromagnetic field]], which are extended in space and time, is known as [[quantum field theory]]. In particle physics, quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields.<ref name=\"Zee 2010\">Zee 2010</ref>\n\nIn quantum field theory, one typically computes the probabilities of various physical events using the techniques of [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. Developed by [[Richard Feynman]] and others in the first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called [[Feynman diagram]]s to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions.<ref name=\"Zee 2010\"/>\n\nThe starting point for string theory is the idea that the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 2</ref> The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional (2D) surface representing the motion of a string.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, p. 6\">Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 6</ref> Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 12</ref>\n\nIn theories of particle physics based on string theory, the characteristic length scale of strings is assumed to be on the order of the [[Planck length]], or {{math|10<sup>\u221235</sup>}} meters, the scale at which the effects of quantum gravity are believed to become significant.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, p. 6\"/> On much larger length scales, such as the scales visible in physics laboratories, such objects would be indistinguishable from zero-dimensional point particles, and the vibrational state of the string would determine the type of particle. One of the vibrational states of a string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, pp. 2\"/>\n\nThe original version of string theory was [[bosonic string theory]], but this version described only [[bosons]], a class of particles which transmit forces between the matter particles, or [[fermions]]. Bosonic string theory was eventually superseded by theories called [[superstring theory|superstring theories]]. These theories describe both bosons and fermions, and they incorporate a theoretical idea called [[supersymmetry]]. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between the bosons and fermions. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 4</ref>\n\nThere are several versions of superstring theory: [[type I string|type I]], [[type IIA string|type IIA]], [[type IIB string|type IIB]], and two flavors of [[heterotic string]] theory ([[special orthogonal group|{{math|''SO''(32)}}]] and [[E8 (mathematics)|{{math|''E''<sub>8</sub>\u00d7''E''<sub>8</sub>}}]]). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. For example, the type I theory includes both open strings (which are segments with endpoints) and closed strings (which form closed loops), while types IIA, IIB and heterotic include only closed strings.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 324</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Number of dimensions}}Extra dimensions===\n\n[[File:Compactification example.svg|right|thumb|alt=A tubular surface and corresponding one-dimensional curve.|An example of [[compactification (physics)|compactification]]: At large distances, a two dimensional surface with one circular dimension looks one-dimensional.]]\n\nIn everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions (3D) of space: height, width and length. Einstein's general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional (4D)  [[spacetime]]. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of the geometry of spacetime.<ref>Wald 1984, p. 4</ref>\n\nIn spite of the fact that the Universe is well described by 4D spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily.{{efn|For example, in the context of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], theorists often formulate and study theories of gravity in unphysical numbers of spacetime dimensions.}} There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics.<ref>Zee 2010, Parts V and VI</ref> Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than 4D of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 9</ref>\n\nOne notable feature of string theories is that these theories require [[extra dimensions]] of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In bosonic string theory, spacetime is 26-dimensional, while in superstring theory it is 10-dimensional, and in [[M-theory]] it is 11-dimensional. In order to describe real physical phenomena using string theory, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 8</ref>\n\n[[Image:Calabi yau.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Visualization of a complex mathematical surface with many convolutions and self intersections.|A cross section of a quintic [[Calabi\u2013Yau manifold]] ]]\n\n[[Compactification (physics)|Compactification]] is one way of modifying the number of dimensions in a physical theory. In compactification, some of the extra dimensions are assumed to \"close up\" on themselves to form circles.<ref name=\"Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6\">Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6</ref> In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions.<ref>Greene 2000, p. 186</ref>\n\nCompactification can be used to construct models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a [[Calabi\u2013Yau manifold]].<ref name=\"Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6\"/> A Calabi\u2013Yau manifold is a special [[topological space|space]] which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians [[Eugenio Calabi]] and [[Shing-Tung Yau]].<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. ix</ref>\n\nAnother approach to reducing the number of dimensions is the so-called [[brane cosmology|brane-world]] scenario. In this approach, physicists assume that the observable universe is a four-dimensional subspace of a higher dimensional space. In such models, the force-carrying bosons of particle physics arise from open strings with endpoints attached to the four-dimensional subspace, while gravity arises from closed strings propagating through the larger ambient space. This idea plays an important role in attempts to develop models of real world physics based on string theory, and it provides a natural explanation for the weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces.<ref>Randall and Sundrum 1999</ref>\n\n===Dualities===\n\n[[File:StringTheoryDualities.svg|right|thumb|alt=A diagram indicating the relationships between M-theory and the five superstring theories.|250px|A diagram of string theory dualities. Yellow arrows indicate [[S-duality]]. Blue arrows indicate [[T-duality]].]]\n\n{{main|S-duality|T-duality}}\n\nOne notable fact about string theory is that the different versions of the theory all turn out to be related in highly nontrivial ways. One of the relationships that can exist between different string theories is called [[S-duality]]. This is a relationship which says that a collection of strongly interacting particles in one theory can, in some cases, be viewed as a collection of weakly interacting particles in a completely different theory. Roughly speaking, a collection of particles is said to be strongly interacting if they combine and decay often and weakly interacting if they do so infrequently. Type I string theory turns out to be equivalent by S-duality to the {{math|''SO''(32)}} heterotic string theory. Similarly, type IIB string theory is related to itself in a nontrivial way by S-duality.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007\">Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007</ref>\n\nAnother relationship between different string theories is [[T-duality]]. Here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension. T-duality states that a string propagating around a circle of radius {{math|''R''}} is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius {{math|1/''R''}} in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has [[momentum]] as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the [[winding number]]. If a string has momentum {{math|''p''}} and winding number {{math|''n''}} in one description, it will have momentum {{math|''n''}} and winding number {{math|''p''}} in the dual description. For example, type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality, and the two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by T-duality.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007\"/>\n\nIn general, the term ''duality'' refers to a situation where two seemingly different [[physical system]]s turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. Two theories related by a duality need not be string theories. For example, [[Montonen\u2013Olive duality]] is example of an S-duality relationship between quantum field theories. The AdS/CFT correspondence is example of a duality which relates string theory to a quantum field theory. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be ''dual'' to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 376</ref>\n\n=== Branes ===\n{{main|Brane}}\n[[File:D3-brane et D2-brane.PNG|thumb|right|alt=A pair of surfaces joined by wavy line segments.|Open strings attached to a pair of [[D-brane]]s.]]\n\nIn string theory and other related theories, a [[brane]] is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions. For instance, a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero, while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one. It is also possible to consider higher-dimensional branes. In dimension ''p'', these are called ''p''-branes. The word brane comes from the word \"membrane\" which refers to a two-dimensional brane.<ref name=\"Moore 2005, p. 214\">Moore 2005, p. 214</ref>\n\nBranes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics. They have mass and can have other attributes such as charge. A ''p''-brane sweeps out a (''p''+1)-dimensional volume in spacetime called its ''worldvolume''. Physicists often study [[field (physics)|fields]] analogous to the electromagnetic field which live on the worldvolume of a brane.<ref name=\"Moore 2005, p. 214\"/>\n\nIn string theory, [[D-brane]]s are an important class of branes that arise when one considers open strings. As an open string propagates through spacetime, its endpoints are required to lie on a D-brane. The letter \"D\" in D-brane refers to a certain mathematical condition on the system known as the [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]. The study of D-branes in string theory has led to important results such as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which has shed light on many problems in quantum field theory.<ref>Moore 2005, p. 215</ref>\n\nBranes are frequently studied from a purely mathematical point of view, and they are described as objects of certain [[category (mathematics)|categories]], such as the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] on a [[complex algebraic variety]], or the [[Fukaya category]] of a [[symplectic manifold]].<ref name=\"Aspinwall et al. 2009\">Aspinwall et al. 2009</ref> The connection between the physical notion of a brane and the mathematical notion of a category has led to important mathematical insights in the fields of [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] and [[symplectic geometry]] <ref name=\"Kontsevich 1995\">Kontsevich 1995</ref> and [[representation theory]].<ref>Kapustin and Witten 2007</ref>\n\n==M-theory==\n\n{{main|M-theory}}\n\nPrior to 1995, theorists believed that there were five consistent versions of superstring theory (type I, type IIA, type IIB, and two versions of heterotic string theory). This understanding changed in 1995 when [[Edward Witten]] suggested that the five theories were just special limiting cases of an eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory. Witten's conjecture was based on the work of a number of other physicists, including [[Ashoke Sen]], [[Chris Hull]], [[Paul Townsend]], and [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]]. His announcement led to a flurry of research activity now known as the [[second superstring revolution]].<ref name=\"Duff 1998\">Duff 1998</ref>\n\n===Unification of superstring theories===\n\n[[File:Limits of M-theory.svg|right|350px|thumb|alt=A star-shaped diagram with the various limits of M-theory labeled at its six vertices.|A schematic illustration of the relationship between [[M-theory]], the five [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], and eleven-dimensional [[supergravity]]. The shaded region represents a family of different physical scenarios that are possible in M-theory. In certain limiting cases corresponding to the cusps, it is natural to describe the physics using one of the six theories labeled there.]]\n\nIn the 1970s, many physicists became interested in [[supergravity]] theories, which combine general relativity with supersymmetry. Whereas general relativity makes sense in any number of dimensions, supergravity places an upper limit on the number of dimensions.<ref>Duff 1998, p. 64</ref> In 1978, work by [[Werner Nahm]] showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven.<ref>Nahm 1978</ref> In the same year, [[Eugene Cremmer]], [[Bernard Julia]], and [[Joel Scherk]] of the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.<ref>Cremmer, Julia, and Scherk 1978</ref><ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\">Duff 1998, p. 65</ref>\n\nInitially, many physicists hoped that by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, it might be possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as [[chirality (physics)|chirality]]. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.<ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\"/>\n\nIn the [[first superstring revolution]] in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory as a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects.<ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\"/> Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.<ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\"/>\n\nAlthough there were only a handful of consistent superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation.<ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\"/> However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways. They found that a system of strongly interacting strings can, in some cases, be viewed as a system of weakly interacting strings. This phenomenon is known as S-duality. It was studied by Ashoke Sen in the context of heterotic strings in four dimensions<ref>Sen 1994a</ref><ref>Sen 1994b</ref> and by Chris Hull and Paul Townsend in the context of the type IIB theory.<ref>Hull and Townsend 1995</ref> Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.<ref>Duff 1998, p. 67</ref>\n\nAt around the same time, as many physicists were studying the properties of strings, a small group of physicists were examining the possible applications of higher dimensional objects. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes.<ref>Bergshoeff, Sezgin, and Townsend 1987</ref> Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]], Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity with one of the dimensions curled up into a circle.<ref>Duff et al. 1987</ref> In this setting, one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.<ref>Duff 1998, p. 66</ref>\n\nSpeaking at a string theory conference in 1995, Edward Witten made the surprising suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality and the appearance of higher dimensional branes in string theory.<ref>Witten 1995</ref> In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming different parts of his proposal.<ref>Duff 1998, pp. 67\u201368</ref> Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 296</ref>\n\nInitially, some physicists suggested that the new theory was a fundamental theory of membranes, but Witten was skeptical of the role of membranes in the theory. In a paper from 1996, Ho\u0159ava and Witten wrote \"As it has been proposed that the eleven-dimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation, we will non-committally call it the M-theory, leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes.\"<ref>Ho\u0159ava and Witten 1996</ref> In the absence of an understanding of the true meaning and structure of M-theory, Witten has suggested that the ''M'' should stand for \"magic\", \"mystery\", or \"membrane\" according to taste, and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known.<ref>Duff 1996, sec. 1</ref>\n\n===Matrix theory===\n\n{{main|Matrix theory (physics)}}\n\nIn mathematics, a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a rectangular array of numbers or other data. In physics, a [[matrix theory (physics)|matrix model]] is a particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves the notion of a matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"Banks et al. 1997\">Banks et al. 1997</ref>\n\nOne important example of a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by [[Tom Banks (physicist)|Tom Banks]], [[Willy Fischler]], [[Stephen Shenker]], and [[Leonard Susskind]] in 1997. This theory describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.<ref name=\"Banks et al. 1997\"/>\n\nThe development of the matrix model formulation of M-theory has led physicists to consider various connections between string theory and a branch of mathematics called [[noncommutative geometry]]. This subject is a generalization of ordinary geometry in which mathematicians define new geometric notions using tools from [[noncommutative algebra]].<ref>Connes 1994</ref> In a paper from 1998, [[Alain Connes]], [[Michael R. Douglas]], and [[Albert Schwarz]] showed that some aspects of matrix models and M-theory are described by a [[noncommutative quantum field theory]], a special kind of physical theory in which spacetime is described mathematically using noncommutative geometry.<ref>Connes, Douglas, and Schwarz 1998</ref> This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.<ref>Nekrasov and Schwarz 1998</ref><ref>Seiberg and Witten 1999</ref>\n\n==Black holes==\n\nIn general relativity, a black hole is defined as a region of spacetime in which the gravitational field is so strong that no particle or radiation can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, black holes are thought to arise when massive stars undergo [[gravitational collapse]], and many [[galaxies]] are thought to contain [[supermassive black hole]]s at their centers. Black holes are also important for theoretical reasons, as they present profound challenges for theorists attempting to understand the quantum aspects of gravity. String theory has proved to be an important tool for investigating the theoretical properties of black holes because it provides a framework in which theorists can study their [[black hole thermodynamics|thermodynamics]].<ref name=\"de Haro et al. 2013, p.2\"/>\n\n===Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula===\n\nIn the branch of physics called [[statistical mechanics]], [[entropy]] is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a physical system. This concept was studied in the 1870s by the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], who showed that the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of a [[gas]] could be derived from the combined properties of its many constituent [[molecule]]s. Boltzmann argued that by averaging the behaviors of all the different molecules in a gas, one can understand macroscopic properties such as volume, temperature, and pressure. In addition, this perspective led him to give a precise definition of entropy as the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of different states of the molecules (also called ''microstates'') that give rise to the same macroscopic features.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 187\u2013188</ref>\n\nIn the twentieth century, physicists began to apply the same concepts to black holes. In most systems such as gases, the entropy scales with the volume. In the 1970s, the physicist [[Jacob Bekenstein]] suggested that the entropy of a black hole is instead proportional to the ''surface area'' of its [[event horizon]], the boundary beyond which matter and radiation is lost to its gravitational attraction.<ref>Bekenstein 1973</ref> When combined with ideas of the physicist [[Stephen Hawking]],<ref name=\"Hawking 1975\">Hawking 1975</ref> Bekenstein's work yielded a precise formula for the entropy of a black hole. The [[Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula]] expresses the entropy {{math|''S''}} as\n\n:<math>S= \\frac{c^3kA}{4\\hbar G}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], {{math|''k''}} is [[Boltzmann's constant]], {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''G''}} is [[Newton's constant]], and {{math|''A''}} is the surface area of the event horizon.<ref>Wald 1984, p. 417</ref>\n\nLike any physical system, a black hole has an entropy defined in terms of the number of different microstates that lead to the same macroscopic features. The Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy formula gives the expected value of the entropy of a black hole, but by the 1990s, physicists still lacked a derivation of this formula by counting microstates in a theory of quantum gravity. Finding such a derivation of this formula was considered an important test of the viability of any theory of quantum gravity such as string theory.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 189</ref>\n\n===Derivation within string theory===\n\nIn a paper from 1996, [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] showed how to derive the Beckenstein\u2013Hawking formula for certain black holes in string theory.<ref name=\"Strominger and Vafa 1996\">Strominger and Vafa 1996</ref> Their calculation was based on the observation that D-branes\u2014which look like fluctuating membranes when they are weakly interacting\u2014become dense, massive objects with event horizons when the interactions are strong. In other words, a system of strongly interacting D-branes in string theory is indistinguishable from a black hole. Strominger and Vafa analyzed such D-brane systems and calculated the number of different ways of placing D-branes in spacetime so that their combined mass and charge is equal to a given mass and charge for the resulting black hole. Their calculation reproduced the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula exactly, including the factor of {{math|1/4}}.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 190\u2013192</ref> Subsequent work by Strominger, Vafa, and others refined the original calculations and gave the precise values of the \"quantum corrections\" needed to describe very small black holes.<ref>Maldacena, Strominger, and Witten 1997</ref><ref>Ooguri, Strominger, and Vafa 2004</ref>\n\nThe black holes that Strominger and Vafa considered in their original work were quite different from real astrophysical black holes. One difference was that Strominger and Vafa considered only [[extremal black hole]]s in order to make the calculation tractable. These are defined as black holes with the lowest possible mass compatible with a given charge.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 192\u2013193</ref> Strominger and Vafa also restricted attention to black holes in five-dimensional spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 194\u2013195</ref>\n\nAlthough it was originally developed in this very particular and physically unrealistic context in string theory, the entropy calculation of Strominger and Vafa has led to a qualitative understanding of how black hole entropy can be accounted for in any theory of quantum gravity. Indeed, in 1998, Strominger argued that the original result could be generalized to an arbitrary consistent theory of quantum gravity without relying on strings or supersymmetry.<ref>Strominger 1998</ref> In collaboration with several other authors in 2010, he showed that some results on black hole entropy could be extended to non-extremal astrophysical black holes.<ref>Guica et al. 2009</ref><ref>Castro, Maloney, and Strominger 2010</ref>\n\n==AdS/CFT correspondence==\n\n{{main|AdS/CFT correspondence}}\n\nOne approach to formulating string theory and studying its properties is provided by the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. This is a theoretical result which implies that string theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory. In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.<ref name=\"Klebanov and Maldacena 2009\"/> The AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by [[Juan Maldacena]] in late 1997.<ref name=\"Maldacena 1998\">Maldacena 1998</ref> Important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by [[Steven Gubser]], [[Igor Klebanov]], and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gubser, Klebanov, and Polyakov 1998</ref> and by Edward Witten.<ref name=\"Witten 1998\">Witten 1998</ref> By 2010, Maldacena's article had over 7000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of [[high energy physics]].{{efn|{{cite web |url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/topcites/2010/eprints/to_hep-th_annual.shtml |title=Top Cited Articles during 2010 in hep-th |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |accessdate=25 July 2013}}}}\n\n===Overview of the correspondence===\n\n[[Image:Uniform tiling 433-t0 (formatted).svg|thumb|left|alt=A disk tiled by triangles and quadrilaterals which become smaller and smaller near the boundary circle.|A [[tessellation]] of the [[hyperbolic plane]] [[tritetragonal tiling|by triangles and squares]]]]\n\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain [[vacuum solution]] of [[Einstein's equation]] called [[anti-de Sitter space]].<ref>Klebanov and Maldacena 2009, p. 28</ref> In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the [[metric tensor|metric]]) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]]. It is closely related to [[hyperbolic space]], which can be viewed as a [[Poincar\u00e9 disk model|disk]] as illustrated on the left.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 60\">Maldacena 2005, p. 60</ref> This image shows a [[tessellation]] of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 61\">Maldacena 2005, p. 61</ref>\n\nOne can imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the state of the universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 60\"/> It looks like a solid [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] in which any [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is [[curvature|curved]] in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 61\"/>\n\n[[File:AdS3.svg|thumb|right|alt=A cylinder formed by stacking copies of the disk illustrated in the previous figure.|350px|Three-dimensional [[anti-de Sitter space]] is like a stack of [[Poincar\u00e9 disk model|hyperbolic disks]], each one representing the state of the universe at a given time. The resulting [[spacetime]] looks like a solid [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].]]\n\nThis construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space dimensions and one time dimension, but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions. Indeed, hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can \"stack up\" copies of hyperbolic space to get higher-dimensional models of anti-de Sitter space.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 60\"/>\n\nAn important feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder in the case of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, within a small region on the surface around any given point, it looks just like [[Minkowski space]], the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 552</ref> One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which \"spacetime\" is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation is the starting point for AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the \"spacetime\" for a quantum field theory. The claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to a gravitational theory, such as string theory, in the bulk anti-de Sitter space in the sense that there is a \"dictionary\" for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.<ref>Maldacena 2005, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\n===Applications to quantum gravity===\n\nThe discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence was a major advance in physicists' understanding of string theory and quantum gravity. One reason for this is that the correspondence provides a formulation of string theory in terms of quantum field theory, which is well understood by comparison. Another reason is that it provides a general framework in which physicists can study and attempt to resolve the paradoxes of black holes.<ref name=\"de Haro et al. 2013, p.2\">de Haro et al. 2013, p. 2</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Stephen Hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the [[event horizon]].<ref name=\"Hawking 1975\"/> At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict with one of the basic [[postulates of quantum mechanics]], which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. This property is usually referred to as [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]] of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as the [[black hole information paradox]].<ref>Susskind 2008</ref>\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence resolves the black hole information paradox, at least to some extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 554</ref> These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so the black hole must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics.<ref>Maldacena 2005, p. 63</ref> In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.<ref>Hawking 2005</ref>\n\n===Applications to nuclear physics===\n\n{{main|AdS/QCD correspondence}}\n\n[[File:Meissner effect p1390048.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A magnet levitating over a superconducting material.|A [[magnet]] [[Meissner effect|levitating]] above a [[high-temperature superconductor]]. Today some physicists are working to understand high-temperature superconductivity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.<ref name=\"Merali 2011\"/>]]\n\nIn addition to its applications to theoretical problems in quantum gravity, the AdS/CFT correspondence has been applied to a variety of problems in quantum field theory. One physical system that has been studied using the AdS/CFT correspondence is the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], an exotic [[state of matter]] produced in [[particle accelerator]]s. This state of matter arises for brief instants when heavy [[ions]] such as [[gold]] or [[lead]] nuclei are collided at high energies. Such collisions cause the [[quarks]] that make up atomic nuclei to [[deconfinement|deconfine]] at temperatures of approximately two [[1,000,000,000,000|trillion]] [[kelvin]]s, conditions similar to those present at around {{math|10<sup>\u221211</sup>}} seconds after the [[Big Bang]].<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 559</ref>\n\nThe physics of the quark\u2013gluon plasma is governed by a theory called [[quantum chromodynamics]], but this theory is mathematically intractable in problems involving the quark\u2013gluon plasma.{{efn|More precisely, one cannot apply the methods of perturbative quantum field theory.}} In an article appearing in 2005, [[\u0110\u00e0m Thanh S\u01a1n]] and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence could be used to understand some aspects of the quark\u2013gluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory.<ref name=\"Kovtun, Son, and Starinets 2001\">Kovtun, Son, and Starinets 2001</ref> By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, S\u01a1n and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quark\u2013gluon plasma, the [[shear viscosity]] and volume density of entropy, should be approximately equal to a certain universal [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]. In 2008, the predicted value of this ratio for the quark\u2013gluon plasma was confirmed at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Merali 2011, p. 303\">Merali 2011, p. 303</ref><ref>Luzum and Romatschke 2008</ref>\n\n===Applications to condensed matter physics===\n\n{{main|AdS/CMT correspondence}}\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence has also been used to study aspects of condensed matter physics. Over the decades, [[experimental physics|experimental]] condensed matter physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter, including [[superconductors]] and [[superfluids]]. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including [[Subir Sachdev]] hope that the AdS/CFT correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.<ref name=\"Merali 2011, p. 303\"/>\n\nSo far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]. A superfluid is a system of [[electrically neutral]] [[atoms]] that flows without any [[friction]]. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using [[liquid helium]], but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing [[lasers]]. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the [[temperature]] and on [[Planck's constant]], the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other [[phase (matter)|phases]]. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.<ref name=\"Sachdev 2013, p.51\">Sachdev 2013, p. 51</ref>\n\n==Phenomenology==\n\n{{main|String phenomenology}}\n\nIn addition to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, string theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity and particle physics. [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|Phenomenology]] is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. [[String phenomenology]] is the part of string theory that attempts to construct realistic or semi-realistic models based on string theory.\n\nPartly because of theoretical and mathematical difficulties and partly because of the extremely high energies needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.<ref name=\"Woit 2006\"/>\n\n===Particle physics===\n\nThe currently accepted theory describing elementary particles and their interactions is known as the [[standard model of particle physics]]. This theory provides a unified description of three of the fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Despite its remarkable success in explaining a wide range of physical phenomena, the standard model cannot be a complete description of reality. This is because the standard model fails to incorporate the force of gravity and because of problems such as the [[hierarchy problem]] and the inability to explain the structure of fermion masses or dark matter.\n\nString theory has been used to construct a variety of models of particle physics going beyond the standard model. Typically, such models are based on the idea of compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, physicists postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles.<ref>Candelas et al. 1985</ref> One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold. Such compactifications offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct realistic or semi-realistic models of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 147\u2013150</ref>\n\n===Cosmology===\n\n{{main|String cosmology}}\n\n[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|right|300px|A map of the [[cosmic microwave background]] produced by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]]]]\n\nThe Big Bang theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. Despite its success in explaining many observed features of the universe including galactic [[redshift]]s, the relative abundance of light elements such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], and the existence of a [[cosmic microwave background]], there are several questions that remain unanswered. For example, the standard Big Bang model does not explain why the universe appears to be same in all directions, why it appears flat on very large distance scales, or why certain hypothesized particles such as [[magnetic monopoles]] are not observed in experiments.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 530\u2013531</ref>\n\nCurrently, the leading candidate for a theory going beyond the Big Bang is the theory of cosmic inflation. Developed by [[Alan Guth]] and others in the 1980s, inflation postulates a period of extremely rapid accelerated expansion of the universe prior to the expansion described by the standard Big Bang theory. The theory of cosmic inflation preserves the successes of the Big Bang while providing a natural explanation for some of the mysterious features of the universe.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 531</ref> The theory has also received striking support from observations of the cosmic microwave background, the radiation that has filled the sky since around 380,000 years after the Big Bang.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 538</ref>\n\nIn the theory of inflation, the rapid initial expansion of the universe is caused by a hypothetical particle called the [[inflaton]]. The exact properties of this particle are not fixed by the theory but should ultimately be derived from a more fundamental theory such as string theory.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 533</ref> Indeed, there have been a number of attempts to identify an inflaton within the spectrum of particles described by string theory, and to study inflation using string theory. While these approaches might eventually find support in observational data such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the application of string theory to cosmology is still in its early stages.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 539\u2013543</ref>\n\n==Connections to mathematics==\n\nIn addition to influencing research in [[theoretical physics]], string theory has stimulated a number of major developments in [[pure mathematics]]. Like many developing ideas in theoretical physics, string theory does not at present have a [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] formulation in which all of its concepts can be defined precisely. As a result, physicists who study string theory are often guided by physical intuition to conjecture relationships between the seemingly different mathematical structures that are used to formalize different parts of the theory. These conjectures are later proved by mathematicians, and in this way, string theory serves as a source of new ideas in pure mathematics.<ref>Deligne et al. 1999, p. 1</ref>\n\n===Mirror symmetry===\n\n{{main|Mirror symmetry (string theory)}}\n\n[[File:Clebsch Cubic.png|thumb|right|alt=A complex mathematical surface in three dimensions.|The [[Clebsch cubic]] is an example of a kind of geometric object called an [[algebraic variety]]. A classical result of [[enumerative geometry]] states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on this surface.]]\n\nAfter Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds had entered physics as a way to compactify extra dimensions in string theory, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, several physicists noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi\u2013Yau manifold.<ref>Hori et al. 2003, p. xvii</ref> Instead, two different versions of string theory, type IIA and type IIB, can be compactified on completely different Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].<ref>Aspinwall et al. 2009, p. 13</ref>\n\nRegardless of whether Calabi\u2013Yau compactifications of string theory provide a correct description of nature, the existence of the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in pure mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in [[enumerative geometry]], a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions.<ref name=\"Aspinwall et al. 2009\"/><ref>Hori et al. 2003</ref>\n\nEnumerative geometry studies a class of geometric objects called [[algebraic varieties]] which are defined by the vanishing of [[polynomial]]s. For example, the [[Clebsch cubic]] illustrated on the right is an algebraic variety defined using a certain polynomial of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[George Salmon]] states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 167</ref>\n\nGeneralizing this problem, one can ask how many lines can be drawn on a quintic Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, such as the one illustrated above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician [[Hermann Schubert]], who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 166</ref>\n\nBy the year 1991, most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish.<ref name=\"Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169\">Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169</ref> The field was reinvigorated in May 1991 when physicists [[Philip Candelas]], [[Xenia de la Ossa]], Paul Green, and Linda Parks showed that mirror symmetry could be used to translate difficult mathematical questions about one Calabi\u2013Yau manifold into easier questions about its mirror.<ref>Candelas et al. 1991</ref> In particular, they used mirror symmetry to show that a six-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold can contain exactly 317,206,375 curves of degree three.<ref name=\"Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169\"/> In addition to counting degree-three curves, Candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 171</ref>\n\nOriginally, these results of Candelas were justified on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally prefer rigorous proofs that do not require an appeal to physical intuition. Inspired by physicists' work on mirror symmetry, mathematicians have therefore constructed their own arguments proving the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry.{{efn|Two independent mathematical proofs of mirror symmetry were given by Givental 1996, 1998 and Lian, Liu, Yau 1997, 1999, 2000.}} Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.<ref>Hori et al. 2003, p. xix</ref> Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the [[homological mirror symmetry]] program of [[Maxim Kontsevich]]<ref name=\"Kontsevich 1995\"/> and the [[SYZ conjecture]] of Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and [[Eric Zaslow]].<ref>Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow 1996</ref>\n\n===Monstrous moonshine===\n\n{{main|Monstrous moonshine}}\n\n[[File:Labeled Triangle Reflections.svg|left|thumb|200px|alt=An equilateral triangle with a line joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side|An equilateral triangle can be rotated through 120\u00b0, 240\u00b0, or 360\u00b0, or reflected in any of the three lines pictured without changing its shape.]]\n\n[[Group theory]] is the branch of mathematics that studies the concept of [[symmetry]]. For example, one can consider a geometric shape such as an equilateral triangle. There are various operations that one can perform on this triangle without changing its shape. One can rotate it through 120\u00b0, 240\u00b0, or 360\u00b0, or one can reflect in any of the lines labeled {{math|''S''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub>}}, or {{math|''S''<sub>2</sub>}} in the picture. Each of these operations is called a ''symmetry'', and the collection of these symmetries satisfies certain technical properties making it into what mathematicians call a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. In this particular example, the group is known as the [[dihedral group]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] 6 because it has six elements. A general group may describe finitely many or infinitely many symmetries; if there are only finitely many symmetries, it is called a [[finite group]].<ref>Dummit and Foote 2004</ref>\n\nMathematicians often strive for a [[classification theorems|classification]] (or list) of all mathematical objects of a given type. It is generally believed that finite groups are too diverse to admit a useful classification. A more modest but still challenging problem is to classify all finite ''simple'' groups. These are finite groups which may be used as building blocks for constructing arbitrary finite groups in the same way that [[prime number]]s can be used to construct arbitrary [[Integer|whole number]]s by taking products.{{efn|More precisely, a nontrivial group is called ''[[simple group|simple]]'' if its only [[normal subgroup]]s are the [[trivial group]] and the group itself. The [[Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder theorem]] exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.}} One of the major achievements of contemporary group theory is the [[classification of finite simple groups]], a mathematical theorem which provides a list of all possible finite simple groups.<ref>Dummit and Foote 2004, pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThis classification theorem identifies several infinite families of groups as well as 26 additional groups which do not fit into any family. The latter groups are called the \"sporadic\" groups, and each one owes its existence to a remarkable combination of circumstances. The largest sporadic group, the so-called [[monster group]], has over {{math|10<sup>53</sup>}} elements, more than a thousand times the number of atoms in the Earth.<ref name=\"Klarreich 2015\">Klarreich 2015</ref>\n\n[[Image:KleinInvariantJ.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A graph of the [[j-invariant|{{math|''j''}}-function]] in the complex plane]]\n\nA seemingly unrelated construction is the [[j-invariant|{{math|''j''}}-function]] of [[number theory]].

In the late 1970s, mathematicians [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]] and [[John G. Thompson|John Thompson]] noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its [[irreducible representation]]s) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the {{math|''j''}}-function (namely, the coefficients of its [[Fourier series]]).<ref>Gannon 2006, p. 4</ref> This relationship was further developed by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Simon P.

The first person to add a [[Five-dimensional space|fifth dimension]] to a theory of gravity was [[Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m]] in 1914, who noted that gravity in five dimensions describes both gravity and electromagnetism in four. Nordstr\u00f6m attempted to unify electromagnetism with [[Nordstr\u00f6m's theory of gravitation|his theory of gravitation]], which was however superseded by Einstein's general relativity in 1919. Thereafter, German mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] combined the fifth dimension with [[general relativity]], and only Kaluza is usually credited with the idea. In 1926, the Swedish physicist [[Oskar Klein]] gave [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory|a physical interpretation]] of the unobservable extra dimension\u2014it is wrapped into a small circle. Einstein introduced a [[Antisymmetric tensor|non-symmetric]] [[metric tensor]], while much later Brans and Dicke added a scalar component to gravity. These ideas would be revived within string theory, where they are demanded by consistency conditions.\n\n[[File:LeonardSusskindStanford2009 cropped.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Leonard Susskind]]]]\n\nString theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a never completely successful theory of [[hadron]]s, the [[subatomic particle]]s like the [[proton]] and [[neutron]] that feel the [[strong interaction]]. In the 1960s, [[Geoffrey Chew]] and [[Steven Frautschi]] discovered that the [[meson]]s make families called [[Regge trajectories]] with masses related to spins in a way that was later understood by [[Yoichiro Nambu]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] to be the relationship expected from rotating strings. Chew advocated making a theory for the interactions of these trajectories that did not presume that they were composed of any fundamental particles, but would construct their interactions from [[bootstrap model|self-consistency conditions]] on the [[S-matrix]]. The [[S-matrix theory|S-matrix approach]] was started by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in the 1940s as a way of constructing a theory that did not rely on the local notions of space and time, which Heisenberg believed break down at the nuclear scale. While the scale was off by many orders of magnitude, the approach he advocated was ideally suited for a theory of quantum gravity.\n\nWorking with experimental data, R. Dolen, D. Horn and C. Schmid developed some sum rules for hadron exchange. When a particle and [[antiparticle]] scatter, virtual particles can be exchanged in two qualitatively different ways. In the s-channel, the two particles annihilate to make temporary intermediate states that fall apart into the final state particles. In the t-channel, the particles exchange intermediate states by emission and absorption. In field theory, the two contributions add together, one giving a continuous background contribution, the other giving peaks at certain energies. In the data, it was clear that the peaks were stealing from the background\u2014the authors interpreted this as saying that the t-channel contribution was dual to the s-channel one, meaning both described the whole amplitude and included the other.\n\n[[File:GabrieleVeneziano.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Gabriele Veneziano]]]]\n\nThe result was widely advertised by [[Murray Gell-Mann]], leading [[Gabriele Veneziano]] to construct a [[Veneziano scattering amplitude|scattering amplitude]] that had the property of Dolen\u2013Horn\u2013Schmid duality, later renamed world-sheet duality. The amplitude needed poles where the particles appear, on straight line trajectories, and there is a special mathematical function whose poles are evenly spaced on half the real line\u2014the [[gamma function]]\u2014 which was widely used in Regge theory. By manipulating combinations of gamma functions, Veneziano was able to find a consistent scattering amplitude with poles on straight lines, with mostly positive residues, which obeyed duality and had the appropriate Regge scaling at high energy. The amplitude could fit near-beam scattering data as well as other Regge type fits, and had a suggestive integral representation that could be used for generalization.\n\nOver the next years, hundreds of physicists worked to complete the [[Bootstrap model|bootstrap program]] for this model, with many surprises. Veneziano himself discovered that for the scattering amplitude to describe the scattering of a particle that appears in the theory, an obvious self-consistency condition, the lightest particle must be a [[tachyon]]. [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Virasoro (physicist)|Miguel Virasoro]] and Joel Shapiro found a different amplitude now understood to be that of closed strings, while [[Ziro Koba]] and [[Holger Bech Nielsen|Holger Nielsen]] generalized Veneziano's integral representation to multiparticle scattering. Veneziano and [[Sergio Fubini]] introduced an operator formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes that was a forerunner of [[world-sheet conformal theory]], while Virasoro understood how to remove the poles with wrong-sign residues using a constraint on the states. [[Claud Lovelace]] calculated a loop amplitude, and noted that there is an inconsistency unless the dimension of the theory is 26. [[Charles Thorn]], [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]] and [[Richard Brower]] went on to prove that there are no wrong-sign propagating states in dimensions less than or equal to 26.\n\nIn 1969\u201370, [[Yoichiro Nambu]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]], and [[Leonard Susskind]] recognized that the theory could be given a description in space and time in terms of strings. The scattering amplitudes were derived systematically from the action principle by [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]], [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], [[Claudio Rebbi]], and [[Charles Thorn]], giving a space-time picture to the vertex operators introduced by Veneziano and Fubini and a geometrical interpretation to the [[Virasoro algebra|Virasoro conditions]].\n\nIn 1971, [[Pierre Ramond]] added fermions to the model, which led him to formulate a two-dimensional supersymmetry to cancel the wrong-sign states. [[John Henry Schwarz|John Schwarz]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Neveu]] added another sector to the fermi theory a short time later. In the fermion theories, the critical dimension was 10. [[Stanley Mandelstam]] formulated a world sheet conformal theory for both the bose and fermi case, giving a two-dimensional field theoretic path-integral to generate the operator formalism. [[Michio Kaku]] and [[Keiji Kikkawa]] gave a different formulation of the bosonic string, as a [[string field theory]], with infinitely many particle types and with fields taking values not on points, but on loops and curves.\n\nIn 1974, [[Tamiaki Yoneya]] discovered that all the known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct [[Ward identities]] to be a graviton. John Schwarz and [[Joel Scherk]] came to the same conclusion and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory]] as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions. At the same time, [[quantum chromodynamics]] was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the [[dustbin of history]].\n\nString theory eventually made it out of the dustbin, but for the following decade all work on the theory was completely ignored. Still, the theory continued to develop at a steady pace thanks to the work of a handful of devotees. [[Ferdinando Gliozzi]], Joel Scherk, and [[David Olive]] realized in 1977 that the original Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-strings were separately inconsistent and needed to be combined. The resulting theory did not have a tachyon, and was proven to have space-time supersymmetry by John Schwarz and [[Michael Green (physicist)|Michael Green]] in 1984. The same year, [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]] gave the theory a modern path integral formulation, and went on to develop conformal field theory extensively. In 1979, [[Daniel Friedan]] showed that the equations of motions of string theory, which are generalizations of the [[Einstein equations]] of [[general relativity]], emerge from the [[renormalization group]] equations for the two-dimensional field theory. Schwarz and Green discovered T-duality, and constructed two superstring theories\u2014IIA and IIB related by T-duality, and type I theories with open strings. The consistency conditions had been so strong, that the entire theory was nearly uniquely determined, with only a few discrete choices.\n\n===First superstring revolution===\n\n[[File:Edward Witten.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Edward Witten]]]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Edward Witten]] discovered that most theories of quantum gravity could not accommodate [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] fermions like the neutrino. This led him, in collaboration with [[Luis \u00c1lvarez-Gaum\u00e9]], to study violations of the conservation laws in gravity theories with [[Gravitational anomaly|anomalies]], concluding that type I string theories were inconsistent. Green and Schwarz discovered a contribution to the anomaly that Witten and Alvarez-Gaum\u00e9 had missed, which restricted the gauge group of the type I string theory to be SO(32). In coming to understand this calculation, Edward Witten became convinced that string theory was truly a consistent theory of gravity, and he became a high-profile advocate. Following Witten's lead, between 1984 and 1986, hundreds of physicists started to work in this field, and this is sometimes called the [[first superstring revolution]].\n\nDuring this period, [[David Gross]], [[Jeffrey A. Harvey|Jeffrey Harvey]], [[Emil Martinec]], and [[Ryan Rohm]] discovered [[heterotic strings]]. The gauge group of these closed strings was two copies of [[E8 (mathematics)|E8]], and either copy could easily and naturally include the standard model. [[Philip Candelas]], [[Gary Horowitz]], [[Andrew Strominger]] and Edward Witten found that the Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds are the compactifications that preserve a realistic amount of supersymmetry, while [[Lance Dixon]] and others worked out the physical properties of [[orbifolds]], distinctive geometrical singularities allowed in string theory. [[Cumrun Vafa]] generalized T-duality from circles to arbitrary manifolds, creating the mathematical field of [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]]. [[Daniel Friedan]], [[Emil Martinec]] and [[Stephen Shenker]] further developed the covariant quantization of the superstring using conformal field theory techniques. [[David Gross]] and [[Vipul Periwal]] discovered that string perturbation theory was divergent. [[Stephen Shenker]] showed it diverged much faster than in field theory suggesting that new non-perturbative objects were missing.\n\n[[File:Joseph Polchinski.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Polchinski]]]]\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Joseph Polchinski]] discovered that the theory requires higher-dimensional objects, called [[D-brane]]s and identified these with the black-hole solutions of supergravity. These were understood to be the new objects suggested by the perturbative divergences, and they opened up a new field with rich mathematical structure. It quickly became clear that D-branes and other p-branes, not just strings, formed the matter content of the string theories, and the physical interpretation of the strings and branes was revealed\u2014they are a type of black hole. [[Leonard Susskind]] had incorporated the [[holographic principle]] of [[Gerardus 't Hooft]] into string theory, identifying the long highly excited string states with ordinary thermal black hole states. As suggested by 't Hooft, the fluctuations of the black hole horizon, the world-sheet or world-volume theory, describes not only the degrees of freedom of the black hole, but all nearby objects too.\n\n===Second superstring revolution===\n\nIn 1995, at the annual conference of string theorists at the University of Southern California (USC), [[Edward Witten]] gave a speech on string theory that in essence united the five string theories that existed at the time, and giving birth to a new 11-dimensional theory called [[M-theory]]. M-theory was also foreshadowed in the work of [[Paul Townsend]] at approximately the same time. The flurry of activity that began at this time is sometimes called the [[second superstring revolution]].<ref name=\"Duff 1998\"/>\n\n[[Image:JuanMaldacena.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Juan Maldacena]]]]\n\nDuring this period, [[Tom Banks (physicist)|Tom Banks]], [[Willy Fischler]], [[Stephen Shenker]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] formulated matrix theory, a full holographic description of M-theory using IIA D0 branes.<ref name=\"Banks et al. 1997\"/> This was the first definition of string theory that was fully non-perturbative and a concrete mathematical realization of the [[holographic principle]]. It is an example of a gauge-gravity duality and is now understood to be a special case of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] calculated the entropy of certain configurations of D-branes and found agreement with the semi-classical answer for extreme charged black holes.<ref name=\"Strominger and Vafa 1996\"/> [[Petr Ho\u0159ava (theorist)|Petr Ho\u0159ava]] and Witten found the eleven-dimensional formulation of the heterotic string theories, showing that orbifolds solve the chirality problem. Witten noted that the effective description of the physics of D-branes at low energies is by a supersymmetric gauge theory, and found geometrical interpretations of mathematical structures in gauge theory that he and [[Nathan Seiberg]] had earlier discovered in terms of the location of the branes.\n\nIn 1997, [[Juan Maldacena]] noted that the low energy excitations of a theory near a black hole consist of objects close to the horizon, which for extreme charged black holes looks like an [[anti-de Sitter space]].<ref name=\"Maldacena 1998\"/> He noted that in this limit the gauge theory describes the string excitations near the branes. So he hypothesized that string theory on a near-horizon extreme-charged black-hole geometry, an anti-de Sitter space times a sphere with flux, is equally well described by the low-energy limiting [[gauge theory]], the [[N = 4 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory]]. This hypothesis, which is called the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], was further developed by [[Steven Gubser]], [[Igor Klebanov]] and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and by [[Edward Witten]],<ref name=\"Witten 1998\"/> and it is now well-accepted. It is a concrete realization of the [[holographic principle]], which has far-reaching implications for [[black hole]]s, [[Principle of locality|locality]] and [[information]] in physics, as well as the nature of the gravitational interaction.<ref name=\"de Haro et al. 2013, p.2\"/> Through this relationship, string theory has been shown to be related to gauge theories like [[quantum chromodynamics]] and this has led to more quantitative understanding of the behavior of [[hadron]]s, bringing string theory back to its roots.{{Citation needed|reason=see talk on source 84|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Falsifiability===\n\n[[Sylvester James Gates]] strongly opposes the idea that string theory would not be falsifiable: \"So, the next time someone tells you that string theory is not testable, remind them of the [[AdS/CFT]] connection...\"<ref>S.

The idea is that [[AdS/CFT]] permits the calculation of the coupling of the \"constants\" of the four forces (gravitation, electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces). Namely, if the electroweak unification happens before the electroweakstrong unification, the supersymmetry model will be falsified.

Each of these different shapes corresponds to a different possible universe, or \"vacuum state\", with a different collection of particles and forces. String theory as it is currently understood has an enormous number of vacuum states, typically estimated to be around {{math|10<sup>500</sup>}}, and these might be sufficiently diverse to accommodate almost any phenomenon that might be observed at low energies.<ref>Woit 2006, pp. 240\u2013242</ref>\n\nMany critics of string theory have expressed concerns about the large number of possible universes described by string theory. In his book ''Not Even Wrong'', [[Peter Woit]], a lecturer in the mathematics department at [[Columbia University]], has argued that the large number of different physical scenarios renders string theory vacuous as a framework for constructing models of particle physics. According to Woit,\n\n{{quote|The possible existence of, say, {{math|10<sup>500</sup>}} consistent different vacuum states for superstring theory probably destroys the hope of using the theory to predict anything. If one picks among this large set just those states whose properties agree with present experimental observations, it is likely there still will be such a large number of these that one can get just about whatever value one wants for the results of any new observation.<ref name=\"Woit 2006, p. 242\">Woit 2006, p. 242</ref>}}\n\nSome physicists believe this large number of solutions is actually a virtue because it may allow a natural anthropic explanation of the observed values of [[physical constant]]s, in particular the small value of the cosmological constant.<ref name=\"Woit 2006, p. 242\"/> The [[anthropic principle]] is the idea that some of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics are not fixed by any fundamental principle but must be compatible with the evolution of intelligent life.

Indeed, as Smolin belatedly notes, [AdS/CFT] provides a solution to this problem, one that is unexpected and powerful.<ref name=\"Polchinski 2007\">Polchinski 2007</ref>}}\n\nPolchinski notes that an important open problem in quantum gravity is to develop holographic descriptions of gravity which do not require the gravitational field \nto be asymptotically anti-de Sitter.<ref name=\"Polchinski 2007\"/> Smolin has responded by saying that the AdS/CFT correspondence, as it is currently understood, may not be strong enough to resolve all concerns about background independence.{{efn|{{cite web|url=http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/joep/links/on-some-criticisms-of-string-theory/lee-smolins-response |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105234427/http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/joep/links/on-some-criticisms-of-string-theory/lee-smolins-response |archivedate=November 5, 2015 }} Response to review of The Trouble with Physics by Joe Polchinski}}\n\n===Sociology of science===\n\nSince the superstring revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s, string theory has become the dominant paradigm of high energy theoretical physics.<ref>Penrose 2004, p. 1017</ref> Some string theorists have expressed the view that there does not exist an equally successful alternative theory addressing the deep questions of fundamental physics. In an interview from 1987, [[Nobel laureate]] [[David Gross]] made the following controversial comments about the reasons for the popularity of string theory:\n\n{{quote|The most important [reason] is that there are no other good ideas around. That's what gets most people into it. When people started to get interested in string theory they didn't know anything about it. In fact, the first reaction of most people is that the theory is extremely ugly and unpleasant, at least that was the case a few years ago when the understanding of string theory was much less developed. It was difficult for people to learn about it and to be turned on. So I think the real reason why people have got attracted by it is because there is no other game in town. All other approaches of constructing grand unified theories, which were more conservative to begin with, and only gradually became more and more radical, have failed, and this game hasn't failed yet.<ref>Woit 2006, pp. 224\u2013225</ref>}}\n\nSeveral other high-profile theorists and commentators have expressed similar views, suggesting that there are no viable alternatives to string theory.<ref>Woit 2006, Ch. 16</ref>\n\nMany critics of string theory have commented on this state of affairs. In his book criticizing string theory, Peter Woit views the status of string theory research as unhealthy and detrimental to the future of fundamental physics. He argues that the extreme popularity of string theory among theoretical physicists is partly a consequence of the financial structure of academia and the fierce competition for scarce resources.<ref>Woit 2006, p. 239</ref> In his book ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] expresses similar views, stating \"The often frantic competitiveness that this ease of communication engenders leads to [[bandwagon effect]]s, where researchers fear to be left behind if they do not join in.\"<ref>Penrose 2004, p. 1018</ref> Penrose also claims that the technical difficulty of modern physics forces young scientists to rely on the preferences of established researchers, rather than forging new paths of their own.<ref>Penrose 2004, pp. 1019\u20131020</ref> Lee Smolin expresses a slightly different position in his critique, claiming that string theory grew out of a tradition of particle physics which discourages speculation about the foundations of physics, while his preferred approach, [[loop quantum gravity]], encourages more radical thinking. According to Smolin,\n\n{{quote|String theory is a powerful, well-motivated idea and deserves much of the work that has been devoted to it. If it has so far failed, the principal reason is that its intrinsic flaws are closely tied to its strengths\u2014and, of course, the story is unfinished, since string theory may well turn out to be part of the truth. The real question is not why we have expended so much energy on string theory but why we haven't expended nearly enough on alternative approaches.<ref>Smolin 2006, p. 349</ref>}}\n\nSmolin goes on to offer a number of prescriptions for how scientists might encourage a greater diversity of approaches to quantum gravity research.<ref>Smolin 2006, Ch. 20</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last=Aspinwall |editor2-first=Tom |editor2-last=Bridgeland |editor3-first=Alastair |editor3-last=Craw |editor4-first=Michael |editor4-last=Douglas |editor5-first=Mark |editor5-last=Gross |editor6-first=Anton |editor6-last=Kapustin |editor7-first=Gregory |editor7-last=Moore |editor8-first=Graeme |editor8-last=Segal |editor9-first=Bal\u00e1zs |editor9-last=Szendr\u00f6i |editor10-first=P.M.H. |editor10-last=Wilson |title=Dirichlet Branes and Mirror Symmetry |year=2009 |publisher=American Mathematical Society | series = [[Clay Mathematics Monographs]] | volume = 4 | isbn=978-0-8218-3848-8}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Tom |last2=Fischler |first2=Willy |last3=Schenker |first3=Stephen |last4=Susskind |first4=Leonard |date=1997 |title=M theory as a matrix model: A conjecture |journal=Physical Review D |volume=55 |issue=8 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.55.5112 |pages=5112\u20135128|bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.5112B |arxiv = hep-th/9610043 }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Katrin |last2=Becker |first2=Melanie |last3=Schwarz |first3=John |title=String theory and M-theory: A modern introduction |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86069-7}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Bekenstein |first1=Jacob |year=1973 |title=Black holes and entropy |journal=Physical Review D |volume=7 |issue=8 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333 |pages=2333\u20132346 |bibcode = 1973PhRvD...7.2333B }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Bergshoeff |first1=Eric |last2=Sezgin |first2=Ergin |last3=Townsend |first3=Paul |date=1987 |title=Supermembranes and eleven-dimensional supergravity |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=189 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201378 |bibcode = 1987PhLB..189...75B |doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(87)91272-X |url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/14453122/1987PhysLettBBergshoeff4.pdf }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Borcherds |first1=Richard |title=Monstrous moonshine and Lie superalgebras |year=1992 |journal=Inventiones Mathematicae |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=405\u2013444|bibcode = 1992InMat.109..405B |doi = 10.1007/BF01232032 |url=http://math.berkeley.edu/%7Ereb/papers/monster/monster.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.165.2714 }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Candelas |first=Philip |last2=de la Ossa |first2=Xenia |last3=Green |first3=Paul |last4=Parks |first4=Linda |year=1991 |title=A pair of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds as an exactly soluble superconformal field theory |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=359 |issue=1 |pages=21\u201374 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(91)90292-6 |bibcode = 1991NuPhB.359...21C }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Candelas |first1=Philip |last2=Horowitz |first2=Gary |last3=Strominger |first3= Andrew |last4=Witten |first4=Edward |date=1985 |title=Vacuum configurations for superstrings |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=258 |issue= |pages=46\u201374|bibcode = 1985NuPhB.258...46C |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(85)90602-9 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Castro |first1=Alejandra |last2=Maloney |first2=Alexander |last3=Strominger |first3=Andrew |year=2010 |title=Hidden conformal symmetry of the Kerr black hole |journal=Physical Review D |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=024008 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.82.024008 |arxiv = 1004.0996 |bibcode = 2010PhRvD..82b4008C }}\n* {{Cite journal|last1=Cheng |first1=Miranda|author1-link= Miranda Cheng |last2=Duncan |first2=John |last3=Harvey |first3=Jeffrey |date=2014|title=Umbral Moonshine |journal=Communications in Number Theory and Physics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=101\u2013242|arxiv=1204.2779 |bibcode=2012arXiv1204.2779C|doi=10.4310/CNTP.2014.v8.n2.a1}}\n* {{cite book |last=Connes |first=Alain |date=1994 |title=Noncommutative Geometry |url=https://archive.org/details/noncommutativege0000conn |url-access=registration |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-185860-5}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Connes |first1=Alain |last2=Douglas |first2=Michael |last3=Schwarz |first3=Albert |date=1998 |title=Noncommutative geometry and matrix theory |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=19981 |issue=2 |page=003 | doi = 10.1088/1126-6708/1998/02/003 |bibcode=1998JHEP...02..003C |arxiv = hep-th/9711162 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Conway |first1=John |last2=Norton |first2=Simon |title=Monstrous moonshine |year=1979 |journal=Bull.

It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its [[mass]], [[charge (physics)|charge]], and other properties determined by the [[vibration]]al state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the [[graviton]], a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] particle that carries [[gravity|gravitational force]]. Thus string theory is a theory of [[quantum gravity]].\n\nString theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of [[fundamental physics]]. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in [[black hole]] physics, early universe [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[condensed matter physics]], and it has stimulated a number of major developments in [[pure mathematics]]. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a [[theory of everything]], a self-contained [[mathematical model]] that describes all [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental force]]s and forms of [[matter]]. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details. \n\nString theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the [[strong nuclear force]], before being abandoned in favor of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The earliest version of string theory, [[bosonic string theory]], incorporated only the class of [[particle]]s known as [[boson]]s. It later developed into [[superstring theory]], which posits a connection called [[supersymmetry]] between bosons and the class of particles called [[fermion]]s. Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in 11 dimensions known as [[M-theory]]. In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a [[quantum field theory]].\n\nOne of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. Another issue is that the theory is thought to describe an enormous [[string landscape|landscape]] of possible universes, and this has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory. These issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics and question the value of continued research on string theory unification.\n\n== Fundamentals==\n[[Image:Open and closed strings.svg|right|thumb|alt=A wavy open segment and closed loop of string.|The fundamental objects of string theory are open and closed [[string (physics)|strings]].]]\n\nIn the 20th century, two theoretical frameworks emerged for formulating the laws of physics. The first is [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], a theory that explains the force of [[gravity]] and the structure of [[spacetime]] at the macro-level. The other is [[quantum mechanics]] which is a completely different formulation to describe physical phenomena using the known [[probability]] principles at the micro-level. By the late 1970s, these two frameworks had proven to be sufficient to explain most of the observed features of the [[universe]], from [[elementary particle]]s to [[atom]]s to the evolution of stars and the universe as a whole.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, p. 1\">Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 1</ref>\n\nIn spite of these successes, there are still many problems that remain to be solved. One of the deepest problems in modern physics is the problem of [[quantum gravity]].<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, p. 1\"/> The general theory of relativity is formulated within the framework of [[classical physics]], whereas the other [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] are described within the framework of quantum mechanics. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 6</ref> In addition to the problem of developing a consistent theory of quantum gravity, there are many other fundamental problems in the physics of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], [[black hole]]s, and the early universe.{{efn|For example, physicists are still working to understand the phenomenon of [[quark confinement]], the paradoxes of [[black holes]], and the origin of [[dark energy]].}}\n\nString theory is a [[mathematical theory|theoretical framework]] that attempts to address these questions and many others. The starting point for string theory is the idea that the [[point particle|point-like particles]] of [[particle physics]] can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called [[string (physics)|strings]]. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, there is only one kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its [[mass]], [[charge (physics)|charge]], and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as [[vibrating strings]]. In string theory, one of the vibrational states of the string gives rise to the [[graviton]], a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, pp. 2\">Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 2\u20133</ref>\n\nOne of the main developments of the past several decades in string theory was the discovery of certain 'dualities', mathematical transformations that identify one physical theory with another. Physicists studying string theory have discovered a number of these dualities between different versions of string theory, and this has led to the conjecture that all consistent versions of string theory are subsumed in a single framework known as [[M-theory]].<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 9\u201312</ref>\n\nStudies of string theory have also yielded a number of results on the nature of black holes and the gravitational interaction. There are certain paradoxes that arise when one attempts to understand the quantum aspects of black holes, and work on string theory has attempted to clarify these issues. In late 1997 this line of work culminated in the discovery of the [[anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence]] or AdS/CFT.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 14\u201315</ref> This is a theoretical result which relates string theory to other physical theories which are better understood theoretically. The AdS/CFT correspondence has implications for the study of black holes and quantum gravity, and it has been applied to other subjects, including [[nuclear physics|nuclear]]<ref name=\"Klebanov and Maldacena 2009\">Klebanov and Maldacena 2009</ref> and [[condensed matter physics]].<ref name=\"Merali 2011\">Merali 2011</ref><ref>Sachdev 2013</ref>\n\nSince string theory incorporates all of the fundamental interactions, including gravity, many physicists hope that it will eventually be developed to the point where it fully describes our universe, making it a [[theory of everything]]. One of the goals of current research in string theory is to find a solution of the theory that reproduces the observed spectrum of elementary particles, with a small [[cosmological constant]], containing [[dark matter]] and a plausible mechanism for [[cosmic inflation]]. While there has been progress toward these goals, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of details.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 3, 15\u201316</ref>\n\nOne of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. The scattering of strings is most straightforwardly defined using the techniques of [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], but it is not known in general how to define string theory [[Non-perturbative|nonperturbatively]].<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 8</ref> It is also not clear whether there is any principle by which string theory selects its [[vacuum state]], the physical state that determines the properties of our universe.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 13\u201314</ref> These problems have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to the unification of physics and question the value of continued research on these problems.<ref name=\"Woit 2006\">Woit 2006</ref>\n\n===Strings===\n{{main|String (physics)}}\n\n[[Image:World lines and world sheet.svg|left|thumb|250px|Interaction in the quantum world: [[worldline]]s of point-like [[particles]] or a [[worldsheet]] swept up by closed [[string (physics)|strings]] in string theory.]]\n\nThe application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the [[electromagnetic field]], which are extended in space and time, is known as [[quantum field theory]]. In particle physics, quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields.<ref name=\"Zee 2010\">Zee 2010</ref>\n\nIn quantum field theory, one typically computes the probabilities of various physical events using the techniques of [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. Developed by [[Richard Feynman]] and others in the first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called [[Feynman diagram]]s to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions.<ref name=\"Zee 2010\"/>\n\nThe starting point for string theory is the idea that the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 2</ref> The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional (2D) surface representing the motion of a string.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, p. 6\">Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 6</ref> Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 12</ref>\n\nIn theories of particle physics based on string theory, the characteristic length scale of strings is assumed to be on the order of the [[Planck length]], or {{math|10<sup>\u221235</sup>}} meters, the scale at which the effects of quantum gravity are believed to become significant.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, p. 6\"/> On much larger length scales, such as the scales visible in physics laboratories, such objects would be indistinguishable from zero-dimensional point particles, and the vibrational state of the string would determine the type of particle. One of the vibrational states of a string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker 2007, pp. 2\"/>\n\nThe original version of string theory was [[bosonic string theory]], but this version described only [[bosons]], a class of particles which transmit forces between the matter particles, or [[fermions]]. Bosonic string theory was eventually superseded by theories called [[superstring theory|superstring theories]]. These theories describe both bosons and fermions, and they incorporate a theoretical idea called [[supersymmetry]]. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between the bosons and fermions. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 4</ref>\n\nThere are several versions of superstring theory: [[type I string|type I]], [[type IIA string|type IIA]], [[type IIB string|type IIB]], and two flavors of [[heterotic string]] theory ([[special orthogonal group|{{math|''SO''(32)}}]] and [[E8 (mathematics)|{{math|''E''<sub>8</sub>\u00d7''E''<sub>8</sub>}}]]). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. For example, the type I theory includes both open strings (which are segments with endpoints) and closed strings (which form closed loops), while types IIA, IIB and heterotic include only closed strings.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 324</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Number of dimensions}}Extra dimensions===\n\n[[File:Compactification example.svg|right|thumb|alt=A tubular surface and corresponding one-dimensional curve.|An example of [[compactification (physics)|compactification]]: At large distances, a two dimensional surface with one circular dimension looks one-dimensional.]]\n\nIn everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions (3D) of space: height, width and length. Einstein's general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional (4D)  [[spacetime]]. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of the geometry of spacetime.<ref>Wald 1984, p. 4</ref>\n\nIn spite of the fact that the Universe is well described by 4D spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily.{{efn|For example, in the context of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], theorists often formulate and study theories of gravity in unphysical numbers of spacetime dimensions.}} There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics.<ref>Zee 2010, Parts V and VI</ref> Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than 4D of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 9</ref>\n\nOne notable feature of string theories is that these theories require [[extra dimensions]] of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In bosonic string theory, spacetime is 26-dimensional, while in superstring theory it is 10-dimensional, and in [[M-theory]] it is 11-dimensional. In order to describe real physical phenomena using string theory, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 8</ref>\n\n[[Image:Calabi yau.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Visualization of a complex mathematical surface with many convolutions and self intersections.|A cross section of a quintic [[Calabi\u2013Yau manifold]] ]]\n\n[[Compactification (physics)|Compactification]] is one way of modifying the number of dimensions in a physical theory. In compactification, some of the extra dimensions are assumed to \"close up\" on themselves to form circles.<ref name=\"Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6\">Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6</ref> In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions.<ref>Greene 2000, p. 186</ref>\n\nCompactification can be used to construct models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a [[Calabi\u2013Yau manifold]].<ref name=\"Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6\"/> A Calabi\u2013Yau manifold is a special [[topological space|space]] which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians [[Eugenio Calabi]] and [[Shing-Tung Yau]].<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. ix</ref>\n\nAnother approach to reducing the number of dimensions is the so-called [[brane cosmology|brane-world]] scenario. In this approach, physicists assume that the observable universe is a four-dimensional subspace of a higher dimensional space. In such models, the force-carrying bosons of particle physics arise from open strings with endpoints attached to the four-dimensional subspace, while gravity arises from closed strings propagating through the larger ambient space. This idea plays an important role in attempts to develop models of real world physics based on string theory, and it provides a natural explanation for the weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces.<ref>Randall and Sundrum 1999</ref>\n\n===Dualities===\n\n[[File:StringTheoryDualities.svg|right|thumb|alt=A diagram indicating the relationships between M-theory and the five superstring theories.|250px|A diagram of string theory dualities. Yellow arrows indicate [[S-duality]]. Blue arrows indicate [[T-duality]].]]\n\n{{main|S-duality|T-duality}}\n\nOne notable fact about string theory is that the different versions of the theory all turn out to be related in highly nontrivial ways. One of the relationships that can exist between different string theories is called [[S-duality]]. This is a relationship which says that a collection of strongly interacting particles in one theory can, in some cases, be viewed as a collection of weakly interacting particles in a completely different theory. Roughly speaking, a collection of particles is said to be strongly interacting if they combine and decay often and weakly interacting if they do so infrequently. Type I string theory turns out to be equivalent by S-duality to the {{math|''SO''(32)}} heterotic string theory. Similarly, type IIB string theory is related to itself in a nontrivial way by S-duality.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007\">Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007</ref>\n\nAnother relationship between different string theories is [[T-duality]]. Here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension. T-duality states that a string propagating around a circle of radius {{math|''R''}} is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius {{math|1/''R''}} in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has [[momentum]] as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the [[winding number]]. If a string has momentum {{math|''p''}} and winding number {{math|''n''}} in one description, it will have momentum {{math|''n''}} and winding number {{math|''p''}} in the dual description. For example, type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality, and the two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by T-duality.<ref name=\"Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007\"/>\n\nIn general, the term ''duality'' refers to a situation where two seemingly different [[physical system]]s turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. Two theories related by a duality need not be string theories. For example, [[Montonen\u2013Olive duality]] is example of an S-duality relationship between quantum field theories. The AdS/CFT correspondence is example of a duality which relates string theory to a quantum field theory. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be ''dual'' to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 376</ref>\n\n=== Branes ===\n{{main|Brane}}\n[[File:D3-brane et D2-brane.PNG|thumb|right|alt=A pair of surfaces joined by wavy line segments.|Open strings attached to a pair of [[D-brane]]s.]]\n\nIn string theory and other related theories, a [[brane]] is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions. For instance, a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero, while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one. It is also possible to consider higher-dimensional branes. In dimension ''p'', these are called ''p''-branes. The word brane comes from the word \"membrane\" which refers to a two-dimensional brane.<ref name=\"Moore 2005, p. 214\">Moore 2005, p. 214</ref>\n\nBranes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics. They have mass and can have other attributes such as charge. A ''p''-brane sweeps out a (''p''+1)-dimensional volume in spacetime called its ''worldvolume''. Physicists often study [[field (physics)|fields]] analogous to the electromagnetic field which live on the worldvolume of a brane.<ref name=\"Moore 2005, p. 214\"/>\n\nIn string theory, [[D-brane]]s are an important class of branes that arise when one considers open strings. As an open string propagates through spacetime, its endpoints are required to lie on a D-brane. The letter \"D\" in D-brane refers to a certain mathematical condition on the system known as the [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]. The study of D-branes in string theory has led to important results such as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which has shed light on many problems in quantum field theory.<ref>Moore 2005, p. 215</ref>\n\nBranes are frequently studied from a purely mathematical point of view, and they are described as objects of certain [[category (mathematics)|categories]], such as the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] on a [[complex algebraic variety]], or the [[Fukaya category]] of a [[symplectic manifold]].<ref name=\"Aspinwall et al. 2009\">Aspinwall et al. 2009</ref> The connection between the physical notion of a brane and the mathematical notion of a category has led to important mathematical insights in the fields of [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] and [[symplectic geometry]] <ref name=\"Kontsevich 1995\">Kontsevich 1995</ref> and [[representation theory]].<ref>Kapustin and Witten 2007</ref>\n\n==M-theory==\n\n{{main|M-theory}}\n\nPrior to 1995, theorists believed that there were five consistent versions of superstring theory (type I, type IIA, type IIB, and two versions of heterotic string theory). This understanding changed in 1995 when [[Edward Witten]] suggested that the five theories were just special limiting cases of an eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory. Witten's conjecture was based on the work of a number of other physicists, including [[Ashoke Sen]], [[Chris Hull]], [[Paul Townsend]], and [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]]. His announcement led to a flurry of research activity now known as the [[second superstring revolution]].<ref name=\"Duff 1998\">Duff 1998</ref>\n\n===Unification of superstring theories===\n\n[[File:Limits of M-theory.svg|right|350px|thumb|alt=A star-shaped diagram with the various limits of M-theory labeled at its six vertices.|A schematic illustration of the relationship between [[M-theory]], the five [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], and eleven-dimensional [[supergravity]]. The shaded region represents a family of different physical scenarios that are possible in M-theory. In certain limiting cases corresponding to the cusps, it is natural to describe the physics using one of the six theories labeled there.]]\n\nIn the 1970s, many physicists became interested in [[supergravity]] theories, which combine general relativity with supersymmetry. Whereas general relativity makes sense in any number of dimensions, supergravity places an upper limit on the number of dimensions.<ref>Duff 1998, p. 64</ref> In 1978, work by [[Werner Nahm]] showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven.<ref>Nahm 1978</ref> In the same year, [[Eugene Cremmer]], [[Bernard Julia]], and [[Joel Scherk]] of the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.<ref>Cremmer, Julia, and Scherk 1978</ref><ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\">Duff 1998, p. 65</ref>\n\nInitially, many physicists hoped that by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, it might be possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as [[chirality (physics)|chirality]]. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.<ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\"/>\n\nIn the [[first superstring revolution]] in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory as a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects.<ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\"/> Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.<ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\"/>\n\nAlthough there were only a handful of consistent superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation.<ref name=\"Duff 1998, p. 65\"/> However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways. They found that a system of strongly interacting strings can, in some cases, be viewed as a system of weakly interacting strings. This phenomenon is known as S-duality. It was studied by Ashoke Sen in the context of heterotic strings in four dimensions<ref>Sen 1994a</ref><ref>Sen 1994b</ref> and by Chris Hull and Paul Townsend in the context of the type IIB theory.<ref>Hull and Townsend 1995</ref> Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.<ref>Duff 1998, p. 67</ref>\n\nAt around the same time, as many physicists were studying the properties of strings, a small group of physicists were examining the possible applications of higher dimensional objects. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes.<ref>Bergshoeff, Sezgin, and Townsend 1987</ref> Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]], Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity with one of the dimensions curled up into a circle.<ref>Duff et al. 1987</ref> In this setting, one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.<ref>Duff 1998, p. 66</ref>\n\nSpeaking at a string theory conference in 1995, Edward Witten made the surprising suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality and the appearance of higher dimensional branes in string theory.<ref>Witten 1995</ref> In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming different parts of his proposal.<ref>Duff 1998, pp. 67\u201368</ref> Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 296</ref>\n\nInitially, some physicists suggested that the new theory was a fundamental theory of membranes, but Witten was skeptical of the role of membranes in the theory. In a paper from 1996, Ho\u0159ava and Witten wrote \"As it has been proposed that the eleven-dimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation, we will non-committally call it the M-theory, leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes.\"<ref>Ho\u0159ava and Witten 1996</ref> In the absence of an understanding of the true meaning and structure of M-theory, Witten has suggested that the ''M'' should stand for \"magic\", \"mystery\", or \"membrane\" according to taste, and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known.<ref>Duff 1996, sec. 1</ref>\n\n===Matrix theory===\n\n{{main|Matrix theory (physics)}}\n\nIn mathematics, a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a rectangular array of numbers or other data. In physics, a [[matrix theory (physics)|matrix model]] is a particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves the notion of a matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"Banks et al. 1997\">Banks et al. 1997</ref>\n\nOne important example of a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by [[Tom Banks (physicist)|Tom Banks]], [[Willy Fischler]], [[Stephen Shenker]], and [[Leonard Susskind]] in 1997. This theory describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.<ref name=\"Banks et al. 1997\"/>\n\nThe development of the matrix model formulation of M-theory has led physicists to consider various connections between string theory and a branch of mathematics called [[noncommutative geometry]]. This subject is a generalization of ordinary geometry in which mathematicians define new geometric notions using tools from [[noncommutative algebra]].<ref>Connes 1994</ref> In a paper from 1998, [[Alain Connes]], [[Michael R. Douglas]], and [[Albert Schwarz]] showed that some aspects of matrix models and M-theory are described by a [[noncommutative quantum field theory]], a special kind of physical theory in which spacetime is described mathematically using noncommutative geometry.<ref>Connes, Douglas, and Schwarz 1998</ref> This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.<ref>Nekrasov and Schwarz 1998</ref><ref>Seiberg and Witten 1999</ref>\n\n==Black holes==\n\nIn general relativity, a black hole is defined as a region of spacetime in which the gravitational field is so strong that no particle or radiation can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, black holes are thought to arise when massive stars undergo [[gravitational collapse]], and many [[galaxies]] are thought to contain [[supermassive black hole]]s at their centers. Black holes are also important for theoretical reasons, as they present profound challenges for theorists attempting to understand the quantum aspects of gravity. String theory has proved to be an important tool for investigating the theoretical properties of black holes because it provides a framework in which theorists can study their [[black hole thermodynamics|thermodynamics]].<ref name=\"de Haro et al. 2013, p.2\"/>\n\n===Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula===\n\nIn the branch of physics called [[statistical mechanics]], [[entropy]] is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a physical system. This concept was studied in the 1870s by the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], who showed that the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of a [[gas]] could be derived from the combined properties of its many constituent [[molecule]]s. Boltzmann argued that by averaging the behaviors of all the different molecules in a gas, one can understand macroscopic properties such as volume, temperature, and pressure. In addition, this perspective led him to give a precise definition of entropy as the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of different states of the molecules (also called ''microstates'') that give rise to the same macroscopic features.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 187\u2013188</ref>\n\nIn the twentieth century, physicists began to apply the same concepts to black holes. In most systems such as gases, the entropy scales with the volume. In the 1970s, the physicist [[Jacob Bekenstein]] suggested that the entropy of a black hole is instead proportional to the ''surface area'' of its [[event horizon]], the boundary beyond which matter and radiation is lost to its gravitational attraction.<ref>Bekenstein 1973</ref> When combined with ideas of the physicist [[Stephen Hawking]],<ref name=\"Hawking 1975\">Hawking 1975</ref> Bekenstein's work yielded a precise formula for the entropy of a black hole. The [[Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula]] expresses the entropy {{math|''S''}} as\n\n:<math>S= \\frac{c^3kA}{4\\hbar G}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], {{math|''k''}} is [[Boltzmann's constant]], {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''G''}} is [[Newton's constant]], and {{math|''A''}} is the surface area of the event horizon.<ref>Wald 1984, p. 417</ref>\n\nLike any physical system, a black hole has an entropy defined in terms of the number of different microstates that lead to the same macroscopic features. The Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy formula gives the expected value of the entropy of a black hole, but by the 1990s, physicists still lacked a derivation of this formula by counting microstates in a theory of quantum gravity. Finding such a derivation of this formula was considered an important test of the viability of any theory of quantum gravity such as string theory.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 189</ref>\n\n===Derivation within string theory===\n\nIn a paper from 1996, [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] showed how to derive the Beckenstein\u2013Hawking formula for certain black holes in string theory.<ref name=\"Strominger and Vafa 1996\">Strominger and Vafa 1996</ref> Their calculation was based on the observation that D-branes\u2014which look like fluctuating membranes when they are weakly interacting\u2014become dense, massive objects with event horizons when the interactions are strong. In other words, a system of strongly interacting D-branes in string theory is indistinguishable from a black hole. Strominger and Vafa analyzed such D-brane systems and calculated the number of different ways of placing D-branes in spacetime so that their combined mass and charge is equal to a given mass and charge for the resulting black hole. Their calculation reproduced the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking formula exactly, including the factor of {{math|1/4}}.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 190\u2013192</ref> Subsequent work by Strominger, Vafa, and others refined the original calculations and gave the precise values of the \"quantum corrections\" needed to describe very small black holes.<ref>Maldacena, Strominger, and Witten 1997</ref><ref>Ooguri, Strominger, and Vafa 2004</ref>\n\nThe black holes that Strominger and Vafa considered in their original work were quite different from real astrophysical black holes. One difference was that Strominger and Vafa considered only [[extremal black hole]]s in order to make the calculation tractable. These are defined as black holes with the lowest possible mass compatible with a given charge.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 192\u2013193</ref> Strominger and Vafa also restricted attention to black holes in five-dimensional spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 194\u2013195</ref>\n\nAlthough it was originally developed in this very particular and physically unrealistic context in string theory, the entropy calculation of Strominger and Vafa has led to a qualitative understanding of how black hole entropy can be accounted for in any theory of quantum gravity. Indeed, in 1998, Strominger argued that the original result could be generalized to an arbitrary consistent theory of quantum gravity without relying on strings or supersymmetry.<ref>Strominger 1998</ref> In collaboration with several other authors in 2010, he showed that some results on black hole entropy could be extended to non-extremal astrophysical black holes.<ref>Guica et al. 2009</ref><ref>Castro, Maloney, and Strominger 2010</ref>\n\n==AdS/CFT correspondence==\n\n{{main|AdS/CFT correspondence}}\n\nOne approach to formulating string theory and studying its properties is provided by the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. This is a theoretical result which implies that string theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory. In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.<ref name=\"Klebanov and Maldacena 2009\"/> The AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by [[Juan Maldacena]] in late 1997.<ref name=\"Maldacena 1998\">Maldacena 1998</ref> Important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by [[Steven Gubser]], [[Igor Klebanov]], and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gubser, Klebanov, and Polyakov 1998</ref> and by Edward Witten.<ref name=\"Witten 1998\">Witten 1998</ref> By 2010, Maldacena's article had over 7000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of [[high energy physics]].{{efn|{{cite web |url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/topcites/2010/eprints/to_hep-th_annual.shtml |title=Top Cited Articles during 2010 in hep-th |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |accessdate=25 July 2013}}}}\n\n===Overview of the correspondence===\n\n[[Image:Uniform tiling 433-t0 (formatted).svg|thumb|left|alt=A disk tiled by triangles and quadrilaterals which become smaller and smaller near the boundary circle.|A [[tessellation]] of the [[hyperbolic plane]] [[tritetragonal tiling|by triangles and squares]]]]\n\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain [[vacuum solution]] of [[Einstein's equation]] called [[anti-de Sitter space]].<ref>Klebanov and Maldacena 2009, p. 28</ref> In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the [[metric tensor|metric]]) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]]. It is closely related to [[hyperbolic space]], which can be viewed as a [[Poincar\u00e9 disk model|disk]] as illustrated on the left.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 60\">Maldacena 2005, p. 60</ref> This image shows a [[tessellation]] of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 61\">Maldacena 2005, p. 61</ref>\n\nOne can imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the state of the universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 60\"/> It looks like a solid [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] in which any [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is [[curvature|curved]] in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 61\"/>\n\n[[File:AdS3.svg|thumb|right|alt=A cylinder formed by stacking copies of the disk illustrated in the previous figure.|350px|Three-dimensional [[anti-de Sitter space]] is like a stack of [[Poincar\u00e9 disk model|hyperbolic disks]], each one representing the state of the universe at a given time. The resulting [[spacetime]] looks like a solid [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].]]\n\nThis construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space dimensions and one time dimension, but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions. Indeed, hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can \"stack up\" copies of hyperbolic space to get higher-dimensional models of anti-de Sitter space.<ref name=\"Maldacena 2005, p. 60\"/>\n\nAn important feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder in the case of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, within a small region on the surface around any given point, it looks just like [[Minkowski space]], the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 552</ref> One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which \"spacetime\" is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation is the starting point for AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the \"spacetime\" for a quantum field theory. The claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to a gravitational theory, such as string theory, in the bulk anti-de Sitter space in the sense that there is a \"dictionary\" for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.<ref>Maldacena 2005, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\n===Applications to quantum gravity===\n\nThe discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence was a major advance in physicists' understanding of string theory and quantum gravity. One reason for this is that the correspondence provides a formulation of string theory in terms of quantum field theory, which is well understood by comparison. Another reason is that it provides a general framework in which physicists can study and attempt to resolve the paradoxes of black holes.<ref name=\"de Haro et al. 2013, p.2\">de Haro et al. 2013, p. 2</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Stephen Hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the [[event horizon]].<ref name=\"Hawking 1975\"/> At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict with one of the basic [[postulates of quantum mechanics]], which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. This property is usually referred to as [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]] of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as the [[black hole information paradox]].<ref>Susskind 2008</ref>\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence resolves the black hole information paradox, at least to some extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space.<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 554</ref> These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so the black hole must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics.<ref>Maldacena 2005, p. 63</ref> In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.<ref>Hawking 2005</ref>\n\n===Applications to nuclear physics===\n\n{{main|AdS/QCD correspondence}}\n\n[[File:Meissner effect p1390048.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A magnet levitating over a superconducting material.|A [[magnet]] [[Meissner effect|levitating]] above a [[high-temperature superconductor]]. Today some physicists are working to understand high-temperature superconductivity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.<ref name=\"Merali 2011\"/>]]\n\nIn addition to its applications to theoretical problems in quantum gravity, the AdS/CFT correspondence has been applied to a variety of problems in quantum field theory. One physical system that has been studied using the AdS/CFT correspondence is the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], an exotic [[state of matter]] produced in [[particle accelerator]]s. This state of matter arises for brief instants when heavy [[ions]] such as [[gold]] or [[lead]] nuclei are collided at high energies. Such collisions cause the [[quarks]] that make up atomic nuclei to [[deconfinement|deconfine]] at temperatures of approximately two [[1,000,000,000,000|trillion]] [[kelvin]]s, conditions similar to those present at around {{math|10<sup>\u221211</sup>}} seconds after the [[Big Bang]].<ref>Zwiebach 2009, p. 559</ref>\n\nThe physics of the quark\u2013gluon plasma is governed by a theory called [[quantum chromodynamics]], but this theory is mathematically intractable in problems involving the quark\u2013gluon plasma.{{efn|More precisely, one cannot apply the methods of perturbative quantum field theory.}} In an article appearing in 2005, [[\u0110\u00e0m Thanh S\u01a1n]] and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence could be used to understand some aspects of the quark\u2013gluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory.<ref name=\"Kovtun, Son, and Starinets 2001\">Kovtun, Son, and Starinets 2001</ref> By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, S\u01a1n and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quark\u2013gluon plasma, the [[shear viscosity]] and volume density of entropy, should be approximately equal to a certain universal [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]. In 2008, the predicted value of this ratio for the quark\u2013gluon plasma was confirmed at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Merali 2011, p. 303\">Merali 2011, p. 303</ref><ref>Luzum and Romatschke 2008</ref>\n\n===Applications to condensed matter physics===\n\n{{main|AdS/CMT correspondence}}\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence has also been used to study aspects of condensed matter physics. Over the decades, [[experimental physics|experimental]] condensed matter physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter, including [[superconductors]] and [[superfluids]]. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including [[Subir Sachdev]] hope that the AdS/CFT correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.<ref name=\"Merali 2011, p. 303\"/>\n\nSo far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]. A superfluid is a system of [[electrically neutral]] [[atoms]] that flows without any [[friction]]. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using [[liquid helium]], but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing [[lasers]]. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the [[temperature]] and on [[Planck's constant]], the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other [[phase (matter)|phases]]. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.<ref name=\"Sachdev 2013, p.51\">Sachdev 2013, p. 51</ref>\n\n==Phenomenology==\n\n{{main|String phenomenology}}\n\nIn addition to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, string theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity and particle physics. [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|Phenomenology]] is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. [[String phenomenology]] is the part of string theory that attempts to construct realistic or semi-realistic models based on string theory.\n\nPartly because of theoretical and mathematical difficulties and partly because of the extremely high energies needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.<ref name=\"Woit 2006\"/>\n\n===Particle physics===\n\nThe currently accepted theory describing elementary particles and their interactions is known as the [[standard model of particle physics]]. This theory provides a unified description of three of the fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Despite its remarkable success in explaining a wide range of physical phenomena, the standard model cannot be a complete description of reality. This is because the standard model fails to incorporate the force of gravity and because of problems such as the [[hierarchy problem]] and the inability to explain the structure of fermion masses or dark matter.\n\nString theory has been used to construct a variety of models of particle physics going beyond the standard model. Typically, such models are based on the idea of compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, physicists postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles.<ref>Candelas et al. 1985</ref> One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold. Such compactifications offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct realistic or semi-realistic models of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 147\u2013150</ref>\n\n===Cosmology===\n\n{{main|String cosmology}}\n\n[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|right|300px|A map of the [[cosmic microwave background]] produced by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]]]]\n\nThe Big Bang theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. Despite its success in explaining many observed features of the universe including galactic [[redshift]]s, the relative abundance of light elements such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], and the existence of a [[cosmic microwave background]], there are several questions that remain unanswered. For example, the standard Big Bang model does not explain why the universe appears to be same in all directions, why it appears flat on very large distance scales, or why certain hypothesized particles such as [[magnetic monopoles]] are not observed in experiments.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 530\u2013531</ref>\n\nCurrently, the leading candidate for a theory going beyond the Big Bang is the theory of cosmic inflation. Developed by [[Alan Guth]] and others in the 1980s, inflation postulates a period of extremely rapid accelerated expansion of the universe prior to the expansion described by the standard Big Bang theory. The theory of cosmic inflation preserves the successes of the Big Bang while providing a natural explanation for some of the mysterious features of the universe.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 531</ref> The theory has also received striking support from observations of the cosmic microwave background, the radiation that has filled the sky since around 380,000 years after the Big Bang.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 538</ref>\n\nIn the theory of inflation, the rapid initial expansion of the universe is caused by a hypothetical particle called the [[inflaton]]. The exact properties of this particle are not fixed by the theory but should ultimately be derived from a more fundamental theory such as string theory.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 533</ref> Indeed, there have been a number of attempts to identify an inflaton within the spectrum of particles described by string theory, and to study inflation using string theory. While these approaches might eventually find support in observational data such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the application of string theory to cosmology is still in its early stages.<ref>Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 539\u2013543</ref>\n\n==Connections to mathematics==\n\nIn addition to influencing research in [[theoretical physics]], string theory has stimulated a number of major developments in [[pure mathematics]]. Like many developing ideas in theoretical physics, string theory does not at present have a [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] formulation in which all of its concepts can be defined precisely. As a result, physicists who study string theory are often guided by physical intuition to conjecture relationships between the seemingly different mathematical structures that are used to formalize different parts of the theory. These conjectures are later proved by mathematicians, and in this way, string theory serves as a source of new ideas in pure mathematics.<ref>Deligne et al. 1999, p. 1</ref>\n\n===Mirror symmetry===\n\n{{main|Mirror symmetry (string theory)}}\n\n[[File:Clebsch Cubic.png|thumb|right|alt=A complex mathematical surface in three dimensions.|The [[Clebsch cubic]] is an example of a kind of geometric object called an [[algebraic variety]]. A classical result of [[enumerative geometry]] states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on this surface.]]\n\nAfter Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds had entered physics as a way to compactify extra dimensions in string theory, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, several physicists noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi\u2013Yau manifold.<ref>Hori et al. 2003, p. xvii</ref> Instead, two different versions of string theory, type IIA and type IIB, can be compactified on completely different Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].<ref>Aspinwall et al. 2009, p. 13</ref>\n\nRegardless of whether Calabi\u2013Yau compactifications of string theory provide a correct description of nature, the existence of the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in pure mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in [[enumerative geometry]], a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions.<ref name=\"Aspinwall et al. 2009\"/><ref>Hori et al. 2003</ref>\n\nEnumerative geometry studies a class of geometric objects called [[algebraic varieties]] which are defined by the vanishing of [[polynomial]]s. For example, the [[Clebsch cubic]] illustrated on the right is an algebraic variety defined using a certain polynomial of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[George Salmon]] states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 167</ref>\n\nGeneralizing this problem, one can ask how many lines can be drawn on a quintic Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, such as the one illustrated above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician [[Hermann Schubert]], who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 166</ref>\n\nBy the year 1991, most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish.<ref name=\"Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169\">Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169</ref> The field was reinvigorated in May 1991 when physicists [[Philip Candelas]], [[Xenia de la Ossa]], Paul Green, and Linda Parks showed that mirror symmetry could be used to translate difficult mathematical questions about one Calabi\u2013Yau manifold into easier questions about its mirror.<ref>Candelas et al. 1991</ref> In particular, they used mirror symmetry to show that a six-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold can contain exactly 317,206,375 curves of degree three.<ref name=\"Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169\"/> In addition to counting degree-three curves, Candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 171</ref>\n\nOriginally, these results of Candelas were justified on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally prefer rigorous proofs that do not require an appeal to physical intuition. Inspired by physicists' work on mirror symmetry, mathematicians have therefore constructed their own arguments proving the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry.{{efn|Two independent mathematical proofs of mirror symmetry were given by Givental 1996, 1998 and Lian, Liu, Yau 1997, 1999, 2000.}} Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.<ref>Hori et al. 2003, p. xix</ref> Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the [[homological mirror symmetry]] program of [[Maxim Kontsevich]]<ref name=\"Kontsevich 1995\"/> and the [[SYZ conjecture]] of Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and [[Eric Zaslow]].<ref>Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow 1996</ref>\n\n===Monstrous moonshine===\n\n{{main|Monstrous moonshine}}\n\n[[File:Labeled Triangle Reflections.svg|left|thumb|200px|alt=An equilateral triangle with a line joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side|An equilateral triangle can be rotated through 120\u00b0, 240\u00b0, or 360\u00b0, or reflected in any of the three lines pictured without changing its shape.]]\n\n[[Group theory]] is the branch of mathematics that studies the concept of [[symmetry]]. For example, one can consider a geometric shape such as an equilateral triangle. There are various operations that one can perform on this triangle without changing its shape. One can rotate it through 120\u00b0, 240\u00b0, or 360\u00b0, or one can reflect in any of the lines labeled {{math|''S''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub>}}, or {{math|''S''<sub>2</sub>}} in the picture. Each of these operations is called a ''symmetry'', and the collection of these symmetries satisfies certain technical properties making it into what mathematicians call a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. In this particular example, the group is known as the [[dihedral group]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] 6 because it has six elements. A general group may describe finitely many or infinitely many symmetries; if there are only finitely many symmetries, it is called a [[finite group]].<ref>Dummit and Foote 2004</ref>\n\nMathematicians often strive for a [[classification theorems|classification]] (or list) of all mathematical objects of a given type. It is generally believed that finite groups are too diverse to admit a useful classification. A more modest but still challenging problem is to classify all finite ''simple'' groups. These are finite groups which may be used as building blocks for constructing arbitrary finite groups in the same way that [[prime number]]s can be used to construct arbitrary [[Integer|whole number]]s by taking products.{{efn|More precisely, a nontrivial group is called ''[[simple group|simple]]'' if its only [[normal subgroup]]s are the [[trivial group]] and the group itself. The [[Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder theorem]] exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.}} One of the major achievements of contemporary group theory is the [[classification of finite simple groups]], a mathematical theorem which provides a list of all possible finite simple groups.<ref>Dummit and Foote 2004, pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThis classification theorem identifies several infinite families of groups as well as 26 additional groups which do not fit into any family. The latter groups are called the \"sporadic\" groups, and each one owes its existence to a remarkable combination of circumstances. The largest sporadic group, the so-called [[monster group]], has over {{math|10<sup>53</sup>}} elements, more than a thousand times the number of atoms in the Earth.<ref name=\"Klarreich 2015\">Klarreich 2015</ref>\n\n[[Image:KleinInvariantJ.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A graph of the [[j-invariant|{{math|''j''}}-function]] in the complex plane]]\n\nA seemingly unrelated construction is the [[j-invariant|{{math|''j''}}-function]] of [[number theory]]. This object belongs to a special class of functions called [[modular function]]s, whose graphs form a certain kind of repeating pattern.<ref>Gannon 2006, p. 2</ref> Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics which seems very different from the theory of finite groups, the two subjects turn out to be intimately related. In the late 1970s, mathematicians [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]] and [[John G. Thompson|John Thompson]] noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its [[irreducible representation]]s) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the {{math|''j''}}-function (namely, the coefficients of its [[Fourier series]]).<ref>Gannon 2006, p. 4</ref> This relationship was further developed by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Simon P. Norton|Simon Norton]]<ref>Conway and Norton 1979</ref> who called it [[monstrous moonshine]] because it seemed so far fetched.<ref>Gannon 2006, p. 5</ref>\n\nIn 1992, [[Richard Borcherds]] constructed a bridge between the theory of modular functions and finite groups and, in the process, explained the observations of McKay and Thompson.<ref>Gannon 2006, p. 8</ref><ref>Borcherds 1992</ref> Borcherds' work used ideas from string theory in an essential way, extending earlier results of [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]], who had realized the monster group as the symmetries of a particular{{which|date=February 2016}} version of string theory.<ref>Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman 1988</ref> In 1998, Borcherds was awarded the [[Fields medal]] for his work.<ref>Gannon 2006, p. 11</ref>\n\nSince the 1990s, the connection between string theory and moonshine has led to further results in mathematics and physics.<ref name=\"Klarreich 2015\"/> In 2010, physicists Tohru Eguchi, [[Hirosi Ooguri]], and [[Yuji Tachikawa]] discovered connections between a different sporadic group, the [[Mathieu group M24|Mathieu group {{math|''M''<sub>24</sub>}}]], and a certain version{{which|date=November 2016}} of string theory.<ref>Eguchi, Ooguri, and Tachikawa 2010</ref> [[Miranda Cheng]], John Duncan, and [[Jeffrey A.

The first person to add a [[Five-dimensional space|fifth dimension]] to a theory of gravity was [[Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m]] in 1914, who noted that gravity in five dimensions describes both gravity and electromagnetism in four. Nordstr\u00f6m attempted to unify electromagnetism with [[Nordstr\u00f6m's theory of gravitation|his theory of gravitation]], which was however superseded by Einstein's general relativity in 1919. Thereafter, German mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] combined the fifth dimension with [[general relativity]], and only Kaluza is usually credited with the idea. In 1926, the Swedish physicist [[Oskar Klein]] gave [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory|a physical interpretation]] of the unobservable extra dimension\u2014it is wrapped into a small circle. Einstein introduced a [[Antisymmetric tensor|non-symmetric]] [[metric tensor]], while much later Brans and Dicke added a scalar component to gravity. These ideas would be revived within string theory, where they are demanded by consistency conditions.\n\n[[File:LeonardSusskindStanford2009 cropped.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Leonard Susskind]]]]\n\nString theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a never completely successful theory of [[hadron]]s, the [[subatomic particle]]s like the [[proton]] and [[neutron]] that feel the [[strong interaction]]. In the 1960s, [[Geoffrey Chew]] and [[Steven Frautschi]] discovered that the [[meson]]s make families called [[Regge trajectories]] with masses related to spins in a way that was later understood by [[Yoichiro Nambu]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] to be the relationship expected from rotating strings. Chew advocated making a theory for the interactions of these trajectories that did not presume that they were composed of any fundamental particles, but would construct their interactions from [[bootstrap model|self-consistency conditions]] on the [[S-matrix]]. The [[S-matrix theory|S-matrix approach]] was started by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in the 1940s as a way of constructing a theory that did not rely on the local notions of space and time, which Heisenberg believed break down at the nuclear scale. While the scale was off by many orders of magnitude, the approach he advocated was ideally suited for a theory of quantum gravity.\n\nWorking with experimental data, R. Dolen, D. Horn and C. Schmid developed some sum rules for hadron exchange. When a particle and [[antiparticle]] scatter, virtual particles can be exchanged in two qualitatively different ways. In the s-channel, the two particles annihilate to make temporary intermediate states that fall apart into the final state particles. In the t-channel, the particles exchange intermediate states by emission and absorption. In field theory, the two contributions add together, one giving a continuous background contribution, the other giving peaks at certain energies. In the data, it was clear that the peaks were stealing from the background\u2014the authors interpreted this as saying that the t-channel contribution was dual to the s-channel one, meaning both described the whole amplitude and included the other.\n\n[[File:GabrieleVeneziano.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Gabriele Veneziano]]]]\n\nThe result was widely advertised by [[Murray Gell-Mann]], leading [[Gabriele Veneziano]] to construct a [[Veneziano scattering amplitude|scattering amplitude]] that had the property of Dolen\u2013Horn\u2013Schmid duality, later renamed world-sheet duality. The amplitude needed poles where the particles appear, on straight line trajectories, and there is a special mathematical function whose poles are evenly spaced on half the real line\u2014the [[gamma function]]\u2014 which was widely used in Regge theory. By manipulating combinations of gamma functions, Veneziano was able to find a consistent scattering amplitude with poles on straight lines, with mostly positive residues, which obeyed duality and had the appropriate Regge scaling at high energy. The amplitude could fit near-beam scattering data as well as other Regge type fits, and had a suggestive integral representation that could be used for generalization.\n\nOver the next years, hundreds of physicists worked to complete the [[Bootstrap model|bootstrap program]] for this model, with many surprises. Veneziano himself discovered that for the scattering amplitude to describe the scattering of a particle that appears in the theory, an obvious self-consistency condition, the lightest particle must be a [[tachyon]]. [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Virasoro (physicist)|Miguel Virasoro]] and Joel Shapiro found a different amplitude now understood to be that of closed strings, while [[Ziro Koba]] and [[Holger Bech Nielsen|Holger Nielsen]] generalized Veneziano's integral representation to multiparticle scattering. Veneziano and [[Sergio Fubini]] introduced an operator formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes that was a forerunner of [[world-sheet conformal theory]], while Virasoro understood how to remove the poles with wrong-sign residues using a constraint on the states. [[Claud Lovelace]] calculated a loop amplitude, and noted that there is an inconsistency unless the dimension of the theory is 26. [[Charles Thorn]], [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]] and [[Richard Brower]] went on to prove that there are no wrong-sign propagating states in dimensions less than or equal to 26.\n\nIn 1969\u201370, [[Yoichiro Nambu]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]], and [[Leonard Susskind]] recognized that the theory could be given a description in space and time in terms of strings. The scattering amplitudes were derived systematically from the action principle by [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]], [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], [[Claudio Rebbi]], and [[Charles Thorn]], giving a space-time picture to the vertex operators introduced by Veneziano and Fubini and a geometrical interpretation to the [[Virasoro algebra|Virasoro conditions]].\n\nIn 1971, [[Pierre Ramond]] added fermions to the model, which led him to formulate a two-dimensional supersymmetry to cancel the wrong-sign states. [[John Henry Schwarz|John Schwarz]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Neveu]] added another sector to the fermi theory a short time later. In the fermion theories, the critical dimension was 10. [[Stanley Mandelstam]] formulated a world sheet conformal theory for both the bose and fermi case, giving a two-dimensional field theoretic path-integral to generate the operator formalism. [[Michio Kaku]] and [[Keiji Kikkawa]] gave a different formulation of the bosonic string, as a [[string field theory]], with infinitely many particle types and with fields taking values not on points, but on loops and curves.\n\nIn 1974, [[Tamiaki Yoneya]] discovered that all the known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct [[Ward identities]] to be a graviton. John Schwarz and [[Joel Scherk]] came to the same conclusion and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory]] as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions. At the same time, [[quantum chromodynamics]] was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the [[dustbin of history]].\n\nString theory eventually made it out of the dustbin, but for the following decade all work on the theory was completely ignored. Still, the theory continued to develop at a steady pace thanks to the work of a handful of devotees. [[Ferdinando Gliozzi]], Joel Scherk, and [[David Olive]] realized in 1977 that the original Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-strings were separately inconsistent and needed to be combined. The resulting theory did not have a tachyon, and was proven to have space-time supersymmetry by John Schwarz and [[Michael Green (physicist)|Michael Green]] in 1984. The same year, [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]] gave the theory a modern path integral formulation, and went on to develop conformal field theory extensively. In 1979, [[Daniel Friedan]] showed that the equations of motions of string theory, which are generalizations of the [[Einstein equations]] of [[general relativity]], emerge from the [[renormalization group]] equations for the two-dimensional field theory. Schwarz and Green discovered T-duality, and constructed two superstring theories\u2014IIA and IIB related by T-duality, and type I theories with open strings. The consistency conditions had been so strong, that the entire theory was nearly uniquely determined, with only a few discrete choices.\n\n===First superstring revolution===\n\n[[File:Edward Witten.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Edward Witten]]]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Edward Witten]] discovered that most theories of quantum gravity could not accommodate [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] fermions like the neutrino. This led him, in collaboration with [[Luis \u00c1lvarez-Gaum\u00e9]], to study violations of the conservation laws in gravity theories with [[Gravitational anomaly|anomalies]], concluding that type I string theories were inconsistent. Green and Schwarz discovered a contribution to the anomaly that Witten and Alvarez-Gaum\u00e9 had missed, which restricted the gauge group of the type I string theory to be SO(32). In coming to understand this calculation, Edward Witten became convinced that string theory was truly a consistent theory of gravity, and he became a high-profile advocate. Following Witten's lead, between 1984 and 1986, hundreds of physicists started to work in this field, and this is sometimes called the [[first superstring revolution]].\n\nDuring this period, [[David Gross]], [[Jeffrey A. Harvey|Jeffrey Harvey]], [[Emil Martinec]], and [[Ryan Rohm]] discovered [[heterotic strings]]. The gauge group of these closed strings was two copies of [[E8 (mathematics)|E8]], and either copy could easily and naturally include the standard model. [[Philip Candelas]], [[Gary Horowitz]], [[Andrew Strominger]] and Edward Witten found that the Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds are the compactifications that preserve a realistic amount of supersymmetry, while [[Lance Dixon]] and others worked out the physical properties of [[orbifolds]], distinctive geometrical singularities allowed in string theory. [[Cumrun Vafa]] generalized T-duality from circles to arbitrary manifolds, creating the mathematical field of [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]]. [[Daniel Friedan]], [[Emil Martinec]] and [[Stephen Shenker]] further developed the covariant quantization of the superstring using conformal field theory techniques. [[David Gross]] and [[Vipul Periwal]] discovered that string perturbation theory was divergent. [[Stephen Shenker]] showed it diverged much faster than in field theory suggesting that new non-perturbative objects were missing.\n\n[[File:Joseph Polchinski.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Polchinski]]]]\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Joseph Polchinski]] discovered that the theory requires higher-dimensional objects, called [[D-brane]]s and identified these with the black-hole solutions of supergravity. These were understood to be the new objects suggested by the perturbative divergences, and they opened up a new field with rich mathematical structure. It quickly became clear that D-branes and other p-branes, not just strings, formed the matter content of the string theories, and the physical interpretation of the strings and branes was revealed\u2014they are a type of black hole. [[Leonard Susskind]] had incorporated the [[holographic principle]] of [[Gerardus 't Hooft]] into string theory, identifying the long highly excited string states with ordinary thermal black hole states. As suggested by 't Hooft, the fluctuations of the black hole horizon, the world-sheet or world-volume theory, describes not only the degrees of freedom of the black hole, but all nearby objects too.\n\n===Second superstring revolution===\n\nIn 1995, at the annual conference of string theorists at the University of Southern California (USC), [[Edward Witten]] gave a speech on string theory that in essence united the five string theories that existed at the time, and giving birth to a new 11-dimensional theory called [[M-theory]]. M-theory was also foreshadowed in the work of [[Paul Townsend]] at approximately the same time. The flurry of activity that began at this time is sometimes called the [[second superstring revolution]].<ref name=\"Duff 1998\"/>\n\n[[Image:JuanMaldacena.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Juan Maldacena]]]]\n\nDuring this period, [[Tom Banks (physicist)|Tom Banks]], [[Willy Fischler]], [[Stephen Shenker]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] formulated matrix theory, a full holographic description of M-theory using IIA D0 branes.<ref name=\"Banks et al. 1997\"/> This was the first definition of string theory that was fully non-perturbative and a concrete mathematical realization of the [[holographic principle]]. It is an example of a gauge-gravity duality and is now understood to be a special case of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] calculated the entropy of certain configurations of D-branes and found agreement with the semi-classical answer for extreme charged black holes.<ref name=\"Strominger and Vafa 1996\"/> [[Petr Ho\u0159ava (theorist)|Petr Ho\u0159ava]] and Witten found the eleven-dimensional formulation of the heterotic string theories, showing that orbifolds solve the chirality problem. Witten noted that the effective description of the physics of D-branes at low energies is by a supersymmetric gauge theory, and found geometrical interpretations of mathematical structures in gauge theory that he and [[Nathan Seiberg]] had earlier discovered in terms of the location of the branes.\n\nIn 1997, [[Juan Maldacena]] noted that the low energy excitations of a theory near a black hole consist of objects close to the horizon, which for extreme charged black holes looks like an [[anti-de Sitter space]].<ref name=\"Maldacena 1998\"/> He noted that in this limit the gauge theory describes the string excitations near the branes. So he hypothesized that string theory on a near-horizon extreme-charged black-hole geometry, an anti-de Sitter space times a sphere with flux, is equally well described by the low-energy limiting [[gauge theory]], the [[N = 4 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory]]. This hypothesis, which is called the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], was further developed by [[Steven Gubser]], [[Igor Klebanov]] and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and by [[Edward Witten]],<ref name=\"Witten 1998\"/> and it is now well-accepted. It is a concrete realization of the [[holographic principle]], which has far-reaching implications for [[black hole]]s, [[Principle of locality|locality]] and [[information]] in physics, as well as the nature of the gravitational interaction.<ref name=\"de Haro et al. 2013, p.2\"/> Through this relationship, string theory has been shown to be related to gauge theories like [[quantum chromodynamics]] and this has led to more quantitative understanding of the behavior of [[hadron]]s, bringing string theory back to its roots.{{Citation needed|reason=see talk on source 84|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Falsifiability===\n\nS. James Gates, Jr., Ph.D. strongly opposes the idea that string theory would not be falsifiable: \"So, the next time someone tells you that string theory is not testable, remind them of the [[AdS/CFT]] connection...\"<ref>S. James Gates, Jr., Ph.D., Superstring Theory: The DNA of Reality \"Lecture 21 - Can 4D Forces (without Gravity) Love Strings?\", 0:26:06-0:26:21, cf. 0:24:05-0:26-24.</ref>. The idea is that [[AdS/CFT]] permits the calculation of the coupling of the \"constants\" of the four forces (gravitation, electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces). Namely, if the electroweak unification happens before the electroweakstrong unification, the supersymmetry model will be falsified. But, if all three \"constants\" meet each other at the same energy in a \"point\" wherein all three forces unite in a electroweakstrong unification (without passing first through a electroweak unification), supersymmetry will have resisted falsification<ref>Idem, \"Lecture 19 - Do-See-Do and Swing your Superpartner Part II\" 0:16:05-0:24:29.</ref>. Professor Gates suggests that the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] will be used for testing [[AdS/CFT]], namely to check if the electroweakstrong unification does happen as predicted, and if it does happen at the energy computed according to [[AdS/CFT]]<ref>Idem, Lecture 21, 0:20:10-0:21:20.</ref>.\n\n===Number of solutions===\n{{main|String theory landscape}}\n\nTo construct models of particle physics based on string theory, physicists typically begin by specifying a shape for the extra dimensions of spacetime. Each of these different shapes corresponds to a different possible universe, or \"vacuum state\", with a different collection of particles and forces. String theory as it is currently understood has an enormous number of vacuum states, typically estimated to be around {{math|10<sup>500</sup>}}, and these might be sufficiently diverse to accommodate almost any phenomenon that might be observed at low energies.<ref>Woit 2006, pp. 240\u2013242</ref>\n\nMany critics of string theory have expressed concerns about the large number of possible universes described by string theory. In his book ''Not Even Wrong'', [[Peter Woit]], a lecturer in the mathematics department at [[Columbia University]], has argued that the large number of different physical scenarios renders string theory vacuous as a framework for constructing models of particle physics. According to Woit,\n\n{{quote|The possible existence of, say, {{math|10<sup>500</sup>}} consistent different vacuum states for superstring theory probably destroys the hope of using the theory to predict anything. If one picks among this large set just those states whose properties agree with present experimental observations, it is likely there still will be such a large number of these that one can get just about whatever value one wants for the results of any new observation.<ref name=\"Woit 2006, p. 242\">Woit 2006, p. 242</ref>}}\n\nSome physicists believe this large number of solutions is actually a virtue because it may allow a natural anthropic explanation of the observed values of [[physical constant]]s, in particular the small value of the cosmological constant.<ref name=\"Woit 2006, p. 242\"/> The [[anthropic principle]] is the idea that some of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics are not fixed by any fundamental principle but must be compatible with the evolution of intelligent life. In 1987, [[Steven Weinberg]] published an article in which he argued that the cosmological constant could not have been too large, or else [[galaxy|galaxies]] and intelligent life would not have been able to develop.<ref>Weinberg 1987</ref> Weinberg suggested that there might be a huge number of possible consistent universes, each with a different value of the cosmological constant, and observations indicate a small value of the cosmological constant only because humans happen to live in a universe that has allowed intelligent life, and hence observers, to exist.<ref>Woit 2006, p. 243</ref>\n\nString theorist Leonard Susskind has argued that string theory provides a natural anthropic explanation of the small value of the cosmological constant.<ref>Susskind 2005</ref> According to Susskind, the different vacuum states of string theory might be realized as different universes within a larger [[multiverse]]. The fact that the observed universe has a small cosmological constant is just a tautological consequence of the fact that a small value is required for life to exist.<ref>Woit 2006, pp. 242\u2013243</ref> Many prominent theorists and critics have disagreed with Susskind's conclusions.<ref>Woit 2006, p. 240</ref> According to Woit, \"in this case [anthropic reasoning] is nothing more than an excuse for failure. Speculative scientific ideas fail not just when they make incorrect predictions, but also when they turn out to be vacuous and incapable of predicting anything.\"<ref>Woit 2006, p. 249</ref>\n\n===Compatibility with dark energy===\nNo vacuum in the string theory landscape is known to support a metastable, positive [[cosmological constant]], except possibly one unconfirmed model described by Kachru ''[[et al]].'' in 2003.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kachru |first1=Shamit |last2=Kallosh |first2=Renata |last3=Linde |first3=Andrei |last4=Trivedi |first4=Sandip P. |title=de Sitter Vacua in String Theory |journal=[[Phys.

This is contrary to some popular models of [[dark energy]] such as [[Lambda-CDM model|\u039b-CDM]], which requires a positive vacuum energy. However, string theory is likely compatible with certain types of [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], where dark energy is caused by a new field with exotic properties.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wolchover |first1=Natalie |title=Dark Energy May Be Incompatible With String Theory |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/dark-energy-may-be-incompatible-with-string-theory-20180809/ |website=[[Quanta Magazine]] |publisher=Simons Foundation |accessdate=2 April 2020 |date=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Background independence===\n\n{{main|Background independence}}\n\nOne of the fundamental properties of Einstein's general theory of relativity is that it is [[background independence|background independent]], meaning that the formulation of the theory does not in any way privilege a particular spacetime geometry.<ref>Smolin 2006, p. 81</ref>\n\nOne of the main criticisms of string theory from early on is that it is not manifestly background independent. In string theory, one must typically specify a fixed reference geometry for spacetime, and all other possible geometries are described as perturbations of this fixed one. In his book ''[[The Trouble With Physics]]'', physicist [[Lee Smolin]] of the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]] claims that this is the principal weakness of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity, saying that string theory has failed to incorporate this important insight from general relativity.<ref>Smolin 2006, p. 184</ref>\n\nOthers have disagreed with Smolin's characterization of string theory. In a review of Smolin's book, string theorist Joseph Polchinski writes\n\n{{quote|[Smolin] is mistaking an aspect of the mathematical language being used for one of the physics being described. New physical theories are often discovered using a mathematical language that is not the most suitable for them\u2026 In string theory it has always been clear that the physics is background-independent even if the language being used is not, and the search for more suitable language continues. Indeed, as Smolin belatedly notes, [AdS/CFT] provides a solution to this problem, one that is unexpected and powerful.<ref name=\"Polchinski 2007\">Polchinski 2007</ref>}}\n\nPolchinski notes that an important open problem in quantum gravity is to develop holographic descriptions of gravity which do not require the gravitational field \nto be asymptotically anti-de Sitter.<ref name=\"Polchinski 2007\"/> Smolin has responded by saying that the AdS/CFT correspondence, as it is currently understood, may not be strong enough to resolve all concerns about background independence.{{efn|{{cite web|url=http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/joep/links/on-some-criticisms-of-string-theory/lee-smolins-response |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105234427/http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/joep/links/on-some-criticisms-of-string-theory/lee-smolins-response |archivedate=November 5, 2015 }} Response to review of The Trouble with Physics by Joe Polchinski}}\n\n===Sociology of science===\n\nSince the superstring revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s, string theory has become the dominant paradigm of high energy theoretical physics.<ref>Penrose 2004, p. 1017</ref> Some string theorists have expressed the view that there does not exist an equally successful alternative theory addressing the deep questions of fundamental physics. In an interview from 1987, [[Nobel laureate]] [[David Gross]] made the following controversial comments about the reasons for the popularity of string theory:\n\n{{quote|The most important [reason] is that there are no other good ideas around. That's what gets most people into it. When people started to get interested in string theory they didn't know anything about it. In fact, the first reaction of most people is that the theory is extremely ugly and unpleasant, at least that was the case a few years ago when the understanding of string theory was much less developed. It was difficult for people to learn about it and to be turned on. So I think the real reason why people have got attracted by it is because there is no other game in town. All other approaches of constructing grand unified theories, which were more conservative to begin with, and only gradually became more and more radical, have failed, and this game hasn't failed yet.<ref>Woit 2006, pp. 224\u2013225</ref>}}\n\nSeveral other high-profile theorists and commentators have expressed similar views, suggesting that there are no viable alternatives to string theory.<ref>Woit 2006, Ch. 16</ref>\n\nMany critics of string theory have commented on this state of affairs. In his book criticizing string theory, Peter Woit views the status of string theory research as unhealthy and detrimental to the future of fundamental physics. He argues that the extreme popularity of string theory among theoretical physicists is partly a consequence of the financial structure of academia and the fierce competition for scarce resources.<ref>Woit 2006, p. 239</ref> In his book ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] expresses similar views, stating \"The often frantic competitiveness that this ease of communication engenders leads to [[bandwagon effect]]s, where researchers fear to be left behind if they do not join in.\"<ref>Penrose 2004, p. 1018</ref> Penrose also claims that the technical difficulty of modern physics forces young scientists to rely on the preferences of established researchers, rather than forging new paths of their own.<ref>Penrose 2004, pp. 1019\u20131020</ref> Lee Smolin expresses a slightly different position in his critique, claiming that string theory grew out of a tradition of particle physics which discourages speculation about the foundations of physics, while his preferred approach, [[loop quantum gravity]], encourages more radical thinking. According to Smolin,\n\n{{quote|String theory is a powerful, well-motivated idea and deserves much of the work that has been devoted to it.

{"title_page": "Discontinuity (linguistics)", "text_new": "In [[linguistics]], a '''discontinuity''' occurs when a given word or [[phrase]] is separated from another word or phrase that it modifies in such a manner that a direct connection cannot be established between the two without incurring crossing lines in the tree structure. The terminology that is employed to denote discontinuities varies depending on the theory of syntax at hand. The terms ''discontinuous constituent'', ''displacement'', ''long distance dependency'', ''unbounded dependency'', and ''projectivity violation'' are largely synonymous with the term ''discontinuity''.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} There are various types of discontinuities, the most prominent and widely studied of these being [[topicalization]], [[wh-fronting]], [[scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]],<ref>Concerning scrambling, see Grewendorf and Stechow (1990).</ref> and [[extraposition]].\n\nDiscontinuities should be distinguished from ''[[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]]'' and ''[[shifting (syntax)|shifting]]'',<ref>See Gro\u00df and Osborne (2009:64-71).</ref> two mechanisms that result in non-canonical word order but that do not necessarily incur discontinuities depending on the theory of sentence structure one assumes (e.g. [[dependency grammar|dependency]]- or [[phrase structure grammar|constituency]]-based). Natural languages vary with respect to the types of discontinuities that they permit. The fixed word order of English allows for relatively few discontinuities compared to, for instance, the Slavic languages, which are much more permissive. Even compared to a closely related language such as German, English is rigid, allowing few discontinuities.\n\n==Projectivity==\n''Projectivity'' is a principle of ''[[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]'' structures by which discontinuities are identified and defined. A tree structure is said to be ''projective'' if there are no crossing dependency edges and/or projection lines.<ref>See Gro\u00df (1999: 174-187).</ref> If there are crossing edges/lines however, then the structure is ''non-projective'' and contains one or more ''projectivity violations''. The concept and terminology of projectivity is associated most with the structures of ''[[dependency grammar]]'', although the concept is just as applicable to the structures of ''[[phrase structure grammar]]s'' (= ''constituency grammars''). The discussion here considers projectivity first in terms of dependency-based structures and then in terms of constituency-based structures.   \n\nThe flatter the tree structures are, the fewer projectivity violations they will contain. As structures become more layered, the number of projectivity violations can increase.\n\n===Dependency-based projectivity===\nThe following trees illustrate projective and non-projective structures in a dependency-based analysis of sentence structure:<ref>The dependency grammar understanding of projectivity given here follows Osborne (2019: 203-206) closely.</ref>\n\n::[[File:Discontinuity.jpg|Projectivity in DG]]\n\nThe trees show all six possible three-level structures conceivable for the three element hierarchy circle-square-triangle. Four of these six trees are projective because they contain no crossing lines. Trees (c) and (e), however, are not projective due to the crossing lines; each of (c) and (e) contains a projectivity violation because a solid dependency edge crosses a dotted projection line. In other words, each of (c) and (e) contains a discontinuity. The trees illustrate when discontinuities occur: if a given constituent (= complete subtree) is separated from its [[head (linguistics)|head]] by an element that dominates its head, a discontinuity obtains. \n\nDependency grammars have explored the projectivity principle in great detail and have formalized it rigorously.<ref>See for instance Hays (1964), Gaifman (1965), Robinson (1970), Mel'\u010duk (1988: 35ff.)</ref> The concept is, however, a simple one. If crossing lines obtain in the tree, projectivity has been violated, meaning a discontinuity is present.\n\n===Constituency-based projectivity===\nThe terminology that constituency grammars (= phrase structure grammars) employ to identify and define discontinuities is different. The projectivity principle certainly exists, although it is acknowledged in terms of discontinuous constituents,<ref>Concerning the term \"discontinuous constituent, see Wells (1947) and McCawley (1982).</ref> long distance dependencies, and/or unbounded dependencies. The constituency-based versions of the six hierarchies from the previous section are rendered as follows. The solid shapes represent [[syntactic category|phrasal categories]], and the empty shapes [[syntactic category|lexical categories]]:\n\n::[[File:Discontinuity-3.jpg|Projectivity in constituency-based syntax]]\n\nThe crossing lines again identify projectivity violations. Hence trees (c) and (e) here contain discontinuities, just as they do further above. The solid square constituents in tree (c) and tree (e) are discontinuous in a manner similar to that of the empty square constituents in the dependency-based trees (c) and (e) above.\n\n==Types==\nDiscontinuities occur in most if not all natural languages. But the types of discontinuities that a given language allows may differ from the discontinuities of another language, even if the languages are closely related. Worth noting is that a large majority of sentences in most languages are projective, i.e. they do not contain discontinuities. Only about 15\u201325% of actual sentences contain a discontinuity, and the percentage of discontinuous dependencies is even much less, approximately 1\u20132%.<ref>Concerning these numbers, see Nivre and Nilsson (2005: 99).</ref> \n\nThe following discussion briefly considers four widely acknowledged types of discontinuities: 1) topicalization, 2) wh-fronting, 3) scrambling, and 4) extraposition. English allows three of the four; it does not allow scrambling. Examples from German are therefore used to illustrate scrambling discontinuities.\n\n===Topicalization===\nTopicalization occurs when a constituent is fronted in order to establish it as the [[topic-comment|topic]]. The topicalization of [[verb argument|argument]] NPs is rare in English, but adjunct prepositional phrases (PPs) that establish situational context are frequently topicalized. Topicalization is illustrated here (and further below) using both a constituency- and a dependency-based tree, the constituency-based tree on the left and the dependency-based tree on the right. The convention is employed throughout whereby the words themselves are used to label the nodes in the trees: \n\n::[[File:That idea.jpg|Topicalization discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines are clearly visible in these trees. Further examples of topicalization discontinuities (but without the trees):\n\n::''Due to the weather'', we are sure that they left.\n::''After school'', Connor has been practicing piano.\n::''To his wife'', Jim gave a fantastic present.\n\nThe material in italics has been topicalized, which results in a discontinuity each time.\n\n===''Wh''-fronting===\n'''[[Wh-fronting|''Wh''-fronting]]''' (= ''wh''-movement) occurs when a ''wh''-expression appears at the front of the clause in order to focus it. ''Wh''-fronting occurs in direct and indirect questions with interrogative words (e.g. ''how'', ''what'', ''when'', ''where'', ''which'', ''who'', ''why'', etc.) and in relative clauses with relative pro-forms (''that'', ''what'', ''where'', which, ''when'', ''who'', ''whose'', etc.). The constituency-based tree appears again on the left, and the dependency-based tree on the right:\n\n::[[File:Who has Sarah.jpg|Wh-fronting discontinuities]]\n\nThese trees are (merely) representative of the type of analyses that one encounters in various grammars. Especially the constituency-based tree here may be disputed. Nevertheless, the crossing lines are again clearly visible. Further examples of ''wh''-fronting discontinuities in matrix and embedded clauses:\n\n::''Which house'' does Jim plan to buy?\n::''Why'' has that been annoying you?\n::Nobody knows ''what'' they have been saying.\n\n::the person ''who'' we have been seeking\n::dangers ''which'' you have been ignoring\n::a politician ''whose flip-flops'' nobody is willing to forget\n\nThe material in italics has been ''wh''-fronted. The first three examples show ''wh''-fronting in direct or indirect interrogative clauses, and the second three illustrate ''wh''-fronting in relative clauses.\n\n===Scrambling===\n'''[[Scrambling (linguistics)|Scrambling]]''' can result in a discontinuity (although it need not; sometimes scrambling is accomplished by shifting alone). Scrambling discontinuities often occur in order to accommodate the informational content of constituents, old information preferring to precede new information. Scrambling is frequently visible in the leftward striving of definite pronouns. Scrambling discontinuities are absent from English, but they are very common in languages with freer word order such as German. The following trees illustrate a scrambling discontinuity in a subordinate clause of German:\n\n::[[File:Dass sich die Leute.jpg|Scrambling discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines identifying the discontinuity are again completely visible. The reflexive pronoun ''sich'' strives leftward, which results in the discontinuity. Discontinuities of this sort occur frequently in German. The italicized expressions in the following examples are separated from their heads in such a manner that scrambling discontinuities obtain:\n\n::Nat\u00fcrlich kann ''uns'' nichts \u00fcberraschen. (naturally can us nothing surprise; 'Naturally nothing can surprise us.')\n::Sie haben ''den''  versucht zu lesen. (they have it tried to read; 'They tried to read it.')\n::dass ''ihn'' viele Leute bewundert haben (that him many people admired have; 'That many people have admired him.')\n::Essen werde ich ''das'' nicht. (eat shall I that not; 'I shall not eat that.')\n\nIn each of these examples, the italicized constituent is displaced, resulting in a discontinuity. An important aspect of scrambling is that it can operate in both directions. The displaced unit can both precede its head as in the first three examples and follow it as in the fourth example.\n\n===Extraposition===\n'''[[Extraposition]]''' occurs when an expression appears further to the right of where it would appear under other (but similar) circumstances. It is motivated by the desire to focus or emphasize the extraposed expression, or it serves to reduce center embedding and in doing so, it increases right-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]], right-branching structures being easier to process in English than left-branching structures:\n\n::[[File:Something happened.jpg|Extraposition discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines identifying the discontinuity are again easily visible. In canonical cases, extraposition is optional, e.g.\n\n::Something ''that was unexpected'' then occurred.\n::Something then occurred ''that was unexpected''.\n\n::Did anyone ''who you expected to help'' actually help?\n::Did anyone actually help ''who you expected to help''?\n\n::They called someone ''to pick up the kids'' before school.\n::They called someone before school ''to pick up the kids''.\n\nOne can also distinguish between two types of extraposition. The examples above are canonical cases where extraposition is optional. In cases of ''it''-extraposition, the optionality disappears; extraposition is obligatory:\n\n:: *It ''that it rained'' surprised us.\n:: It surprised us ''that it rained''.\n\n:: *Did it ''that they had to study'' disturb them?\n:: Did it disturb them ''that they had to study''?\n\nThe star * indicates that the sentence is nonidiomatic. Apparently when ''it'' appears in subject or object position, it forces the modifying expression to be extraposed.\n\n==Theoretical accounts==\nThe challenge  posed by discontinuities has fascinated and vexed theories of syntax since the 1950s. Early [[transformational grammar]], which is based on phrase structure, addressed discontinuities in terms of [[deep structure and surface structure]] and transformations that mapped constituents out of one position in Deep Structure into another position in Surface Structure. Modern theories of transformational grammar (e.g. [[Government and Binding Theory]]<ref>See Chomsky (1981).</ref> and the [[Minimalist Program]]<ref>See Chomsky (1995).</ref>) assume a [[Syntactic movement|movement]] or copying procedure that moves or copies constituents out of one position into another in the course of the derivation. Representational phrase structure grammars (e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]]<ref>See Pollard and Sag (1994).</ref> and [[Lexical Functional Grammar]]<ref>See Bresnan (2001).</ref>), in contrast, reject movement and in its stead, they assume some sort of feature passing mechanism that passes information about the displaced constituent up and down the tree.  \n\nTraditional dependency grammars (e.g. [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]'s Structural Syntax<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> and [[Igor Mel'\u010duk]]'s [[Meaning-Text Theory]]<ref>See Mel'\u010duk (1988).</ref>) approach discontinuities much differently. They tend to (posit one or more levels of syntactic structure that) abstract away from linear order and acknowledge hierarchical order alone. If linear order is taken to be (in a sense) secondary in this manner, discontinuities present less of a challenge and are therefore of secondary importance to the theory. Other dependency grammars, in contrast, take linear and hierarchical order to be of equal importance. These theories are likely to (also) pursue some sort of feature passing mechanism that passes information about the displaced unit up and down the tree.\n\nThe following trees illustrate the movement/copying type of approach to discontinuities:\n\n::[[File:That idea2.jpg|Movement analysis]]\n\nThe constituent ''that idea'' is seen as being first generated in its canonical position to the right of the verb ''likes''. It is then moved out of that position to the front of the sentence, or it is copied at the front of the sentence followed by the deletion of the lower occurrence. Due to the movement (or copying) this sort of approach to discontinuities can be called the ''movement approach'' (= derivational approach).\n\nThe alternative to the movement approach is information passing up and down the tree, e.g. \n\n::[[File:That idea3.jpg|Feature passing analysis]]\n\nThe displaced unit is taken to appear first in its surface position (it is not moved to that position), and information (= features) about it is seen as being passed down the tree to the position where it would appear under more normal circumstances. The path of information passing is shown in red. Due to the passing of information, this sort of approach can be called the ''feature passing approach'' (= representational approach). The movement and feature passing approaches have something important in common. They both assume that there are no actual discontinuities in surface syntax (for there are no crossing lines in the trees). What appears to be a discontinuity at first blush is actually rather an indication that movement or feature passing has occurred.\n\nFinally, one point is worth repeating. All theories must have a means of addressing discontinuities, but the nature of this means can vary significantly based upon the amount of structure that the theory at hand posits. Relatively flat structures incur significantly fewer discontinuities than more layered structures. Thus the component that addresses discontinuities plays a larger role in theories that restrict all [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] to binary branching. In theories that allow n-ary branching, the role that inversion and shifting play can be greater, which reduces the role of the component of the theory that is needed to address discontinuities.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Bresnan, J. 2001.

The terms ''discontinuous constituent'', ''displacement'', ''long distance dependency'', ''unbounded dependency'', and ''projectivity violation'' are largely synonymous with the term ''discontinuity''.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} There are various types of discontinuities, the most prominent and widely studied of these being [[topicalization]], [[wh-fronting]], [[scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]],<ref>Concerning scrambling, see Grewendorf and Stechow (1990).</ref> and [[extraposition]].\n\nDiscontinuities should be distinguished from ''[[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]]'' and ''[[shifting (syntax)|shifting]]'',<ref>See Gro\u00df and Osborne (2009:64-71).</ref> two mechanisms that result in non-canonical word order but that do not necessarily incur discontinuities depending on the theory of sentence structure one assumes (e.g. [[dependency grammar|dependency]]- or [[phrase structure grammar|constituency]]-based). Natural languages vary with respect to the types of discontinuities that they permit. The fixed word order of English allows for relatively few discontinuities compared to, for instance, the Slavic languages, which are much more permissive. Even compared to a closely related language such as German, English is rigid, allowing few discontinuities.\n\n==Projectivity==\n''Projectivity'' is a principle of ''[[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]'' structures by which discontinuities are identified and defined.

This was to fulfill the fast growing energy requirements in the country to support rapid industrialization taking place through 5-year Plans of the Government. In the same year, Singareni Colliery Company, which was operating in Andhra Pradesh since 1920, was also brought under government control when the Central Government and Andhra Pradesh Government acquired its 45% and 55% shares respectively.\n\nIn 1971, the Government of India [[Nationalization|nationalized]] all the 214 coking-coal mines and 12 coke-ovens running in the private sector, excluding those held by [[Tata Steel|TISCO]] and [[IISCO]] for their captive use. On 1 January 1972, a new Government company Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) was formed to take control of these nationalized mines and coke-ovens. Next year on 30 January 1973, all the remaining 711 non-coking coalmines of the country in private sector were also nationalized. 184 of these mines were handed over to BCCL, and remaining 527 were handed over to a newly opened department Coal Mines Authority. 4 months later on 14 June 1973, this department was converted into a separate Government company CMAL. NCDC, earlier formed in 1957, was merged with CMAL, and 45% share-holding of Central Government in Singareni Collieries Company Ltd was also handed over to CMAL. CMAL started functioning with its 4 divisions, viz, Eastern Coalfields, Central Coalfields, Western Coalfields, and Central Mine Planning and Design Institute.\n\nBy 1973, all coking coalmines were under BCCL, which was functioning as a subsidiary of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) under Department of Steel of the Ministry of Steel and Mines; and all non-coking coalmines were under CMAL, which was under Department of Mines of the Ministry of Steel and Mines. For better control, both BCCL and CMAL were brought on 11 October 1974 under the Department of Coal (now an independent Ministry) of the newly formed Ministry of Energy.\n\nOn 1 November 1975, a new public-sector company Coal India Limited (CIL) was formed to enable better organizational and operational efficiency in coal sector. All the 4 Divisions of CMAL were given the company status, and were brought under CIL along with BCCL. 45% share-holding of the CMAL in Singareni Collieries Company was also transferred to CIL, and CMAL was closed.\n\nThus, CIL started functioning in 1975 with 5 subsidiary companies under it. These were Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), and Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL). In due course of time, 3 more companies were formed under CIL by carving out certain areas of CCL and WCL. These were Northern Coalfields Limited (NCL), South-eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), and Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL).\n\nPursuant to the Fuel Policy of 1974, CIL also started the construction of India's First [[History of manufactured gas#Retort bench|Low Temperature Carbonisation]] Plant at Dankuni in the late 1970s. It was renamed as Dankuni Coal Complex, and is one of the only operational Coal Gas plant of this kind in the World.<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.coalindia.in/Company.aspx?tab=2 |title=History and Formation of Coal India Limited |publisher=Coal India Limited |accessdate=17 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017130208/http://www.coalindia.in/Company.aspx?tab=2 |archive-date=17 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dankuni Coal Complex has been incurring heavy loss due to the Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Company (Previously known as Oriental Gas Co.) giving non-remunerative price and fixing them unilaterally.

This was to fulfill the fast growing energy requirements in the country to support rapid industrialization taking place through 5-year Plans of the Government. In the same year, Singareni Colliery Company, which was operating in Andhra Pradesh since 1920, was also brought under government control when the Central Government and Andhra Pradesh Government acquired its 45% and 55% shares respectively.\n\nIn 1971, the Government of India [[Nationalization|nationalized]] all the 214 coking-coal mines and 12 coke-ovens running in the private sector, excluding those held by [[Tata Steel|TISCO]] and [[IISCO]] for their captive use. On 1 January 1972, a new Government company Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) was formed to take control of these nationalized mines and coke-ovens. Next year on 30 January 1973, all the remaining 711 non-coking coalmines of the country in private sector were also nationalized. 184 of these mines were handed over to BCCL, and remaining 527 were handed over to a newly opened department Coal Mines Authority. 4 months later on 14 June 1973, this department was converted into a separate Government company CMAL. NCDC, earlier formed in 1957, was merged with CMAL, and 45% share-holding of Central Government in Singareni Collieries Company Ltd was also handed over to CMAL. CMAL started functioning with its 4 divisions, viz, Eastern Coalfields, Central Coalfields, Western Coalfields, and Central Mine Planning and Design Institute.\n\nBy 1973, all coking coalmines were under BCCL, which was functioning as a subsidiary of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) under Department of Steel of the Ministry of Steel and Mines; and all non-coking coalmines were under CMAL, which was under Department of Mines of the Ministry of Steel and Mines. For better control, both BCCL and CMAL were brought on 11 October 1974 under the Department of Coal (now an independent Ministry) of the newly formed Ministry of Energy.\n\nOn 1 November 1975, a new public-sector company Coal India Limited (CIL) was formed to enable better organizational and operational efficiency in coal sector. All the 4 Divisions of CMAL were given the company status, and were brought under CIL along with BCCL. 45% share-holding of the CMAL in Singareni Collieries Company was also transferred to CIL, and CMAL was closed.\n\nThus, CIL started functioning in 1975 with 5 subsidiary companies under it. These were Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), and Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL). In due course of time, 3 more companies were formed under CIL by carving out certain areas of CCL and WCL. These were Northern Coalfields Limited (NCL), South-eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), and Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL).\n\nPursuant to the Fuel Policy of 1974, CIL also started the construction of India's First [[History of manufactured gas#Retort bench|Low Temperature Carbonisation]] Plant at Dankuni in the late 1970s. It was renamed as Dankuni Coal Complex, and is one of the only operational Coal Gas plant of this kind in the World.<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.coalindia.in/Company.aspx?tab=2 |title=History and Formation of Coal India Limited |publisher=Coal India Limited |accessdate=17 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017130208/http://www.coalindia.in/Company.aspx?tab=2 |archive-date=17 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dankuni Coal Complex has been incurring heavy loss due to the Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Company (Previously known as Oriental Gas Co.) giving non-remunerative price and fixing them unilaterally.
