He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the [[computational complexity]] of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the [[Big O notation|asymptotic notation]]. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of [[theoretical computer science]], Knuth is the creator of the [[TeX]] computer typesetting system, the related [[METAFONT]] font definition language and rendering system, and the [[Computer Modern]] family of typefaces.\n\nAs a writer and scholar, Knuth created the [[WEB]] and [[CWEB]] computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate [[literate programming]], and designed the [[MIX]]/[[MMIX]] [[instruction set|instruction set architectures]].

He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the [[computational complexity]] of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the [[Big O notation|asymptotic notation]]. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of [[theoretical computer science]], Knuth is the creator of the [[TeX]] computer typesetting system, the related [[METAFONT]] font definition language and rendering system, and the [[Computer Modern]] family of typefaces.\n\nAs a writer and scholar, Knuth created the [[WEB]] and [[CWEB]] computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate [[literate programming]], and designed the [[MIX]]/[[MMIX]] [[instruction set|instruction set architectures]]. Knuth strongly opposes granting [[software patent]]s, having expressed his opinion to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and [[European Patent Organisation]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nKnuth was born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], to German-Americans Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning.

According to an article in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s ''Technology Review'', these [[Knuth reward check]]s are \"among computerdom's most prized trophies\". Knuth had to stop sending real checks in 2008 due to bank fraud, and instead now gives each error finder a \"certificate of deposit\" from a publicly listed balance in his fictitious \"Bank of [[San Serriffe]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/400456 |title=Rewriting the Bible in 0s and 1s |journal=[[Technology Review]] }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHe once warned a correspondent, \"Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.\"<ref name=\"faq\"/>\n\nKnuth published his first \"scientific\" article in a school magazine in 1957 under the title \"The [[Potrzebie]] System of Weights and Measures\".

It is used by the FBI to represent the organization and to authenticate certain documents that it issues. The term is used both for the physical seal itself, and more generally for the design impressed upon it.\n\nThe current version of the seal has been in use since 1941. Designed in 1940 by FBI Special Agent Leo Gauthier, it derives its design from the FBI's flag and symbolizes the values, standards and history of the Bureau through the various elements incorporated in the design. It should not be confused with the FBI badge, which is older and has a different design.\n\nThe seal's usage is regulated by [[Law of the United States|U.S. federal law]], under which it is a criminal offense to make unauthorized commercial or otherwise inappropriate use of the seal and name of the FBI.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/709|title=18 U.S. Code \u00a7 709 - False advertising or misuse of names to indicate Federal agency|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>  The FBI actively polices the use of its seal and has taken action against commercial vendors using it without authorization. The FBI has, however, also given approval to third party publishers to convey messages endorsed by the Bureau, such as campaigns against drug abuse and copyright infringement.\n\n== Design ==\nThe colors and symbol of the seal of the FBI represent the values and standards of the FBI and the United States and allude to the history of both the organization and the country. The center of the seal depicts a shield bracketed by two laurel branches, with an inscribed scroll below, set against a blue field. A gold-outlined strip occupies the circumference of the field, bearing the words \"DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\" above, and \"FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\" below. A circle of thirteen golden stars surrounds the shield and laurels, representing unity of purpose and the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen founding states]] of the United States. The laurel branches represent  academic honors, distinction and fame. The two branches depict a total of 46 leaves, standing for the number of U.S. states when the FBI was founded in 1908.<ref name=\"Heraldry\">{{cite web|title=Heraldry of the FBI Seal|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/fbiseal/fbiseal.htm|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>\n\nThe blue field behind the central shield represents justice, as do the stripes set on a golden field at the shield's top. Five parallel vertical red and white stripes make up the rest of the shield, echoing the colors of the [[Flag of the United States]]. As with the flag, there is one more red stripe than white. The stripes symbolize the values of the FBI; the red stripes stand for courage, valor, and strength, while the white ones represent light, cleanliness, and truth.<ref name=\"Heraldry\"/>\n\nBelow the wreath and shield is a scroll bearing the words \"Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity\". This slogan, which was devised in 1935 by FBI Inspector W.H. Drane Lester,<ref name=\"FBI History\">''The FBI: A Centennial History, 1908-2008'', p. 121</ref> describes the high moral standards and high level of motivation the FBI expects from its staff. It also reflects the Bureau's own initials as a \"[[backronym]]\" of sorts.<ref name=\"Heraldry\"/> However, a ''Newsweek'' article from 2008 credits [[Edward Allen Tamm]], once a top aide to [[J. Edgar Hoover]] who regularly briefed President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] on domestic intelligence matters with the invention of the motto: \"He's credited in some bureau histories with inventing (in 1935) not only the bureau's name, but its official motto: Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Isikoff |first=Michael |title=The Fed Who Blew the Whistle: Is he a hero or a criminal? |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601/page/2 |accessdate=16 June 2013 |magazine=Newsweek |date=December 13, 2008 |publication-date=December 22, 2008 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217004344/http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601/page/2 |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe outer edge of the seal consists of a series of beveled golden peaks. This represents the severe challenges that the FBI faces every day and alludes to the ruggedness of the organization. The gold color represents the richness and history of the Bureau's mission.<ref name=\"Heraldry\"/>\n\n[[File:FBI Badge & gun.jpg|thumb|The FBI badge, which is distinct from the FBI seal and does not use the same design]]\nThe FBI seal should not be confused with the FBI badge, which dates from 1935 and has a very different design that does not incorporate the seal. The badge consists of a miniature shield crested by an eagle. The face of the shield depicts [[Justitia]] holding her scales and a sword, alongside the names of the FBI and the Department of Justice.<ref>{{cite book|title=The FBI: A Centennial History, 1908-2008|page=120|author1=Mueller, Robert S.|author2=Miller, John J.|author3=Kortan, Michael P.|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=2008|isbn= 9780160809545}}</ref>\n\nA modified version of the FBI seal is used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation Police]], the uniformed division of the FBI tasked with the protection of the Bureau's facilities, properties and personnel. The FBI Police symbol is a golden shield with the seal set at the center flanked by twin laurel branches. At top and bottom are scrolls bearing the words \"FBI\" and \"POLICE\" respectively.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Badge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.png|thumb|left|The badge of an FBI special agent.]]\nWhen the FBI was founded in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation (later the Division of Investigation) it was a subordinate organization of the [[United States Department of Justice]].<ref name=\"historicdates\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/historicdates.htm|title=Timeline of FBI History|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref> It had no logo of its own but used the existing seal of the Department of Justice. In 1935 it became an independent service within the Department of Justice and changed its name to the present-day Federal Bureau of Investigation. To reflect its new identity it adopted a version of the Department of Justice seal with the words \"Federal Bureau of Investigation\" and \"Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity\" added to the outer band.<ref name=\"FBI History\" />\n\nVarious proposals were floated over the next few years for a new FBI seal that would retain the connection with the Department of Justice while expressing the FBI's own values and distinct identity. The current version of the seal dates from 1940 and was designed by Special Agent Leo Gauthier, who was a draftsman, artist and illustrator. He had previously designed a flag for the Bureau and used elements of that design to create a new seal. It was accepted immediately.\n\n== Usage ==\nSince 1954, Federal law has protected the FBI seal against unauthorized commercial use.<ref name=\"Powers\">{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Richard Grid|title=G-men, Hoover's FBI in American popular culture|page=[https://archive.org/details/gmenhooversfbiin00powe/page/242 242]|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0-8093-1096-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gmenhooversfbiin00powe/page/242}}</ref> The unauthorized use of the seal is subject to prosecution under federal criminal law, including Sections 701 and 709 of [[Title 18 of the United States Code]].<ref name=\"Heraldry\" /> The latter Section prohibits the use of the words \"Federal Bureau of Investigation\" or the [[initialism]] \"F.B.I.\",\n\n<blockquote>in connection with any advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet or other publication, play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet or other publication, play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Title 18 Part I Chapter 33 \u00a7 709.

For instance, a New York toy manufacturer used the FBI seal on a toy [[water pistol]]. The manufacturer was warned by the Bureau to remove the seal or face prosecution.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Langbart, David A.|author2=Haines, Gerald K.|title=Unlocking the files of the FBI: a guide to its records and classification system|page=40|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8420-2338-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial works ===\nThe seal has, however, been used with permission in many commercial works of popular culture. An authorized history of the Bureau, ''The F.B.I. Story'', was published in 1956 with the seal displayed on the book's dust jacket with the permission of FBI chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]].<ref name=\"Whitfield\">{{cite book|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen J.|title=The culture of the Cold War|publisher=JHU Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8018-5195-7}}</ref> Hoover also permitted the long-running [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[The F.B.I.

J. Edgar Hoover's grave at [[Congressional Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is surrounded by a wrought-iron fence bearing a cast metal replica of the FBI seal. The \"J.

The goal was to include all required characters from most of the world's languages, as well as symbols from technical domains such as science, mathematics, and music. The original idea was to replace the typical 256-character encodings, which required 1 byte per character, with an encoding using 65,536 (2<sup>16</sup>) values, which would require 2 bytes per character.\n\nTwo groups worked on this in parallel, [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]] and the [[Unicode Consortium]], the latter representing mostly manufacturers of computing equipment.  The two groups attempted to synchronize their character assignments so that the developing encodings would be mutually compatible.  The early 2-byte encoding was originally called \"Unicode\", but is now called \"UCS-2\". UCS-2 differs from UTF-16 by being a constant length encoding<ref name=\"mysql\">{{cite web|url=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-unicode-ucs2.html|title=MySQL :: MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual :: 10.1.9.4 The ucs2 Character Set (UCS-2 Unicode Encoding)|website=dev.mysql.com}}</ref> and only capable of encoding characters of the Basic Multilingual Plane ([[Plane (Unicode)#Basic Multilingual Plane|BMP]]).\n\nEarly in this process, when it became increasingly clear that 2<sup>16</sup> characters would not suffice,<ref name=\"unicode.org/faq\" /> and [[IEEE]] introduced a larger 31-bit space and an encoding (UCS-4) that would require 4 bytes per character.  This was resisted by the [[Unicode Consortium]], both because 4 bytes per character wasted a lot of disk space and memory, and because some manufacturers were already heavily invested in 2-byte-per-character technology.  The UTF-16 encoding scheme was developed as a compromise to resolve this impasse in version 2.0 of the Unicode standard in July 1996<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/faq//utf_bom.html|title=Questions about encoding forms |access-date=2010-11-12}}</ref> and is fully specified in RFC 2781 published in 2000 by the [[IETF]].<ref>ISO/IEC 10646:2014 \"Information technology \u2013 Universal Coded Character Set (UCS)\" sections 9 and 10.</ref><ref>''The Unicode Standard'' version 7.0 (2014) [https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch02.pdf#G11153 section 2.5.]</ref>\n\nIn the UTF-16 encoding, code points greater than or equal to 2<sup>16</sup> are encoded using ''two'' 16-bit code units. The standards organizations chose the largest block available of un-allocated 16-bit code points to use as these code units. Unlike with the [[UTF-8]] encoding, they did not provide a means to encode these code points.\n\nUTF-16 is specified in the latest versions of both the international standard [[ISO/IEC 10646]] and the Unicode Standard. \"UCS-2 should now be considered obsolete. It no longer refers to an encoding form in either 10646 or the Unicode Standard.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/appC.pdf |title=The Unicode\u00ae Standard Version 10.0 \u2013 Core Specification.

As of Unicode 9.0, some modern non-Latin Asian, Middle-Eastern, and African scripts fall outside this range, as do most [[emoji]] characters.\n\n=== Code points from U+010000 to U+10FFFF ===\nCode points from the other planes (called [[Plane (Unicode)#Supplementary Multilingual Plane|Supplementary Planes]]) are encoded as two 16-bit ''code units'' called a ''surrogate pair'', by the following scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-family:monospace\" align=\"right\"\n |+ UTF-16 decoder\n !{{diagonal split header|<span style{{=}}\"color:#920000;\">High</span> | <span style{{=}}\"color:#000092;\">Low</span>}}\n !<span style=\"color:#000092;\">DC00</span>\n !<span style=\"color:#000092;\">DC01</span>\n !<span style=\"color:#000092;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n !<span style=\"color:#000092;\">DFFF</span>\n |-\n !<span style=\"color:#920000;\">D800</span>\n |010000||010001||\u2026||0103FF\n |-\n !<span style=\"color:#920000;\">D801</span>\n |010400||010401||\u2026||0107FF\n |-align=\"center\"\n !<span style=\"color:#920000;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\u22ee</span>\n |\u22ee||\u22ee||\u22f1||\u22ee\n |-\n !<span style=\"color:#920000;\">DBFF</span>\n |10FC00||10FC01||\u2026||10FFFF\n |}\n\n* 0x10000 is subtracted from the code point ''(U)'', leaving a 20-bit number ''(U')'' in the hex number range 0x00000\u20130xFFFFF. Note for these purposes, ''U'' is defined to be no greater than 0x10FFFF.\n* The high ten bits (in the range 0x000\u20130x3FF) are added to 0xD800 to give the first 16-bit ''code unit'' or ''high surrogate'' ''(W1)'', which will be in the range {{color|#920000|0xD800\u20130xDBFF}}.\n* The low ten bits (also in the range 0x000\u20130x3FF) are added to 0xDC00 to give the second 16-bit ''code unit'' or ''low surrogate'' ''(W2)'', which will be in the range {{color|#000092|0xDC00\u20130xDFFF}}.\n\nIllustrated visually, the distribution of ''U''' between ''W1'' and ''W2'' looks like<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2781.html|title=UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646|last=Yergeau|first=Francois|last2=Hoffman|first2=Paul|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>:<syntaxhighlight>\nU' = yyyyyyyyyyxxxxxxxxxx  // U - 0x10000\nW1 = 110110yyyyyyyyyy      // 0xD800 + yyyyyyyyyy\nW2 = 110111xxxxxxxxxx      // 0xDC00 + xxxxxxxxxx\n</syntaxhighlight>The ''high surrogate'' and ''low surrogate'' are also known as \"leading\" and \"trailing\" surrogates, respectively, analogous to the leading and trailing bytes of UTF-8.<ref name=\"Unicode7Ch3s8\">{{cite book |title=The Unicode Standard, Version 7.0\u2014Core Specification |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Julie D. |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Deborah |editor3-last=Becker |editor3-first=Joe |editor3-link=Joe Becker (Unicode) |editor4-last=Cook |editor4-first=Richard |publisher=[[Unicode Consortium|The Unicode Consortium]] |date=2014 |place=Mountain View |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ |section=3.8 Surrogates |page=118 |chapterurl=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch03.pdf |accessdate=3 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\nSince the ranges for the ''high surrogates'' ({{color|#920000|0xD800\u20130xDBFF}}), ''low surrogates'' ({{color|#000092|0xDC00\u20130xDFFF}}), and valid BMP characters (0x0000\u20130xD7FF, 0xE000\u20130xFFFF) are [[Disjoint_sets|disjoint]], it is not possible for a surrogate to match a BMP character, or for two adjacent ''code units'' to look like a legal ''surrogate pair''. This simplifies searches a great deal. It also means that UTF-16 is ''self-synchronizing'' on 16-bit words: whether a code unit starts a character can be determined without examining earlier code units (i.e. the type of ''code unit'' can be determined by the ranges of values in which it falls). UTF-8 shares these advantages, but many earlier multi-byte encoding schemes (such as [[Shift JIS]] and other Asian multi-byte encodings) did not allow unambiguous searching and could only be synchronized by re-parsing from the start of the string (UTF-16 is not self-synchronizing if one byte is lost or if traversal starts at a random byte).\n\nBecause the most commonly used characters are all in the BMP, handling of surrogate pairs is often not thoroughly tested.  This leads to persistent bugs and potential security holes, even in popular and well-reviewed application software (e.g. {{CVE|2008-2938|2012-2135}}).\n\nThe [[Plane (Unicode)|Supplementary Planes]] contain [[emoji]], historic scripts, less used symbols, less used Chinese ideographs, etc. Since the encoding of Supplementary Planes contains 20 significant bits (10 of 16 bits in each of the ''high'' and ''low surrogates''), 2<sup>20</sup> code points can be encoded, divided into 16 planes of 2<sup>16</sup> code points each. Including the separately-handled Basic Multilingual Plane, there are a total of 17 planes.\n\n=== U+D800 to U+DFFF ===\nThe Unicode standard permanently reserves these code point values for UTF-16 encoding of the high and low surrogates, and they will never be assigned a character, so there should be no reason to encode them. The official Unicode standard says that no UTF forms, including UTF-16, can encode these code points.\n\nHowever, UCS-2, UTF-8, and [[UTF-32]] can encode these code points in trivial and obvious ways, and large amounts of software does so even though the standard states that such arrangements should be treated as encoding errors.\n\nIt is possible to unambiguously encode an ''unpaired surrogate'' (a high surrogate code point not followed by a low one, or a low one not preceded by a high one) in UTF-16 by using a code unit equal to the code point. The majority of UTF-16 encoder and decoder implementations do this then when translating between encodings.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}<!-- Python 2.6 decode of UTF16 does this on Linux, and it correctly handles surrogate pairs. All \"CESU\" decoders do it too, though they also mis-translate correct surrogate pairs into 2 characters. --> Windows allows unpaired surrogates in filenames and other places, which generally means they have to be supported by software in spite of their exclusion from the Unicode standard.\n\n=== Examples ===\nTo encode U+10437 (\ud801\udc37) to UTF-16:\n\n* Subtract 0x10000 from the code point, leaving 0x0437.\n* For the high surrogate, shift right by 10 (divide by 0x400), then add 0xD800, resulting in 0x0001 + 0xD800 = 0xD801.\n* For the low surrogate, take the low 10 bits (remainder of dividing by 0x400), then add 0xDC00, resulting in 0x0037 + 0xDC00 = 0xDC37.\n\nTo decode U+10437 (\ud801\udc37) from UTF-16:\n\n* Take the high surrogate (0xD801) and subtract 0xD800, then multiply by 0x400, resulting in 0x0001 \u00d7 0x400 = 0x0400.\n* Take the low surrogate (0xDC37) and subtract 0xDC00, resulting in 0x37.\n* Add these two results together (0x0437), and finally add 0x10000 to get the final decoded UTF-32 code point, 0x10437.\n\nThe following table summarizes this conversion, as well as others. The colors indicate how bits from the code point are distributed among the UTF-16 bytes.

Since most communication and storage protocols are defined for bytes, and each unit thus takes two 8-bit bytes, the order of the bytes may depend on the [[endianness]] (byte order) of the computer architecture.\n\nTo assist in recognizing the byte order of code units, '''UTF-16''' allows a [[Byte Order Mark]] (BOM), a code point with the value U+FEFF, to precede the first actual coded value.<ref group=\"nb\">UTF-8 encoding produces byte values strictly less than 0xFE, so either byte in the BOM sequence also identifies the encoding as UTF-16 (assuming that UTF-32 is not expected).</ref> (U+FEFF is the invisible [[zero-width non-breaking space]]/ZWNBSP character.)<ref group=\"nb\">Use of U+FEFF as the character ZWNBSP instead of as a BOM has been deprecated in favor of U+2060 (WORD JOINER); see [https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM Byte Order Mark (BOM) FAQ] at unicode.org.  But if an application interprets an initial BOM as a character, the ZWNBSP character is invisible, so the impact is minimal.</ref> If the endian architecture of the decoder matches that of the encoder, the decoder detects the 0xFEFF value, but an opposite-endian decoder interprets the BOM as the non-character value U+FFFE reserved for this purpose. This incorrect result provides a hint to perform byte-swapping for the remaining values.\n\nIf the BOM is missing, RFC 2781 recommends<ref group=\"nb\">{{IETF RFC|2781}} section 4.3 says that if there is no BOM, \"the text SHOULD be interpreted as being big-endian.\" According to section 1.2, the meaning of the term \"SHOULD\" is governed by {{IETF RFC|2119}}. In that document, section 3 says \"... there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course\".</ref> that big-endian encoding be assumed. In practice, due to Windows using little-endian order by default, many applications assume little-endian encoding. It is also reliable to detect endianness by looking for null bytes, on the assumption that characters less than U+0100 are very common. If more even bytes (starting at 0) are null, then it is big-endian.\n\nThe standard also allows the byte order to be stated explicitly by specifying '''UTF-16BE''' or '''UTF-16LE''' as the encoding type.  When the byte order is specified explicitly this way, a BOM is specifically ''not'' supposed to be prepended to the text, and a U+FEFF at the beginning should be handled as a ZWNBSP character. Most applications ignore a BOM in all cases despite this rule.\n\nFor [[Internet]] protocols, [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has approved \"UTF-16\", \"UTF-16BE\", and \"UTF-16LE\" as the names for these encodings (the names are case insensitive). The aliases '''UTF_16''' or '''UTF16''' may be meaningful in some programming languages or software applications, but they are not standard names in Internet protocols.\n\nSimilar designations, '''UCS-2BE''' and '''UCS-2LE''', are used to show versions of '''UCS-2'''.\n\n== Usage ==\nUTF-16 is used for text in the OS&nbsp;API of all currently supported versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] (and including at least all since [[Windows CE]]/[[Windows 2000|2000]]/[[Windows XP|XP]]/[[Windows 2003|2003]]/[[Windows Vista|Vista]]/[[Windows 7|7]]<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374081.aspx ''Unicode (Windows)''].

The goal was to include all required characters from most of the world's languages, as well as symbols from technical domains such as science, mathematics, and music. The original idea was to replace the typical 256-character encodings, which required 1 byte per character, with an encoding using 65,536 (2<sup>16</sup>) values, which would require 2 bytes per character.\n\nTwo groups worked on this in parallel, [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]] and the [[Unicode Consortium]], the latter representing mostly manufacturers of computing equipment.  The two groups attempted to synchronize their character assignments so that the developing encodings would be mutually compatible.  The early 2-byte encoding was originally called \"Unicode\", but is now called \"UCS-2\". UCS-2 differs from UTF-16 by being a constant length encoding<ref name=\"mysql\">{{cite web|url=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-unicode-ucs2.html|title=MySQL :: MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual :: 10.1.9.4 The ucs2 Character Set (UCS-2 Unicode Encoding)|website=dev.mysql.com}}</ref> and only capable of encoding characters of the Basic Multilingual Plane ([[Plane (Unicode)#Basic Multilingual Plane|BMP]]).\n\nEarly in this process, when it became increasingly clear that 2<sup>16</sup> characters would not suffice,<ref name=\"unicode.org/faq\" /> and [[IEEE]] introduced a larger 31-bit space and an encoding (UCS-4) that would require 4 bytes per character.  This was resisted by the [[Unicode Consortium]], both because 4 bytes per character wasted a lot of disk space and memory, and because some manufacturers were already heavily invested in 2-byte-per-character technology.  The UTF-16 encoding scheme was developed as a compromise to resolve this impasse in version 2.0 of the Unicode standard in July 1996<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/faq//utf_bom.html|title=Questions about encoding forms |access-date=2010-11-12}}</ref> and is fully specified in RFC 2781 published in 2000 by the [[IETF]].<ref>ISO/IEC 10646:2014 \"Information technology \u2013 Universal Coded Character Set (UCS)\" sections 9 and 10.</ref><ref>''The Unicode Standard'' version 7.0 (2014) [https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch02.pdf#G11153 section 2.5.]</ref>\n\nIn the UTF-16 encoding, code points greater than or equal to 2<sup>16</sup> are encoded using ''two'' 16-bit code units.

Unlike with the [[UTF-8]] encoding, they did not provide a means to encode these code points.\n\nUTF-16 is specified in the latest versions of both the international standard [[ISO/IEC 10646]] and the Unicode Standard. \"UCS-2 should now be considered obsolete.

Note for these purposes, ''U'' is defined to be no greater than 0x10FFFF.\n* The high ten bits (in the range 0x000\u20130x3FF) are added to 0xD800 to give the first 16-bit ''code unit'' or ''high surrogate'' ''(W1)'', which will be in the range {{color|#920000|0xD800\u20130xDBFF}}.\n* The low ten bits (also in the range 0x000\u20130x3FF) are added to 0xDC00 to give the second 16-bit ''code unit'' or ''low surrogate'' ''(W2)'', which will be in the range {{color|#000092|0xDC00\u20130xDFFF}}.\n\nIllustrated visually, the distribution of ''U''' between ''W1'' and ''W2'' looks like<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2781.html|title=UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646|last=Yergeau|first=Francois|last2=Hoffman|first2=Paul|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>:<syntaxhighlight>\nU' = yyyyyyyyyyxxxxxxxxxx  // U - 0x10000\nW1 = 110110yyyyyyyyyy      // 0xD800 + yyyyyyyyyy\nW2 = 110111xxxxxxxxxx      // 0xDC00 + xxxxxxxxxx\n</syntaxhighlight>The ''high surrogate'' and ''low surrogate'' are also known as \"leading\" and \"trailing\" surrogates, respectively, analogous to the leading and trailing bytes of UTF-8.<ref name=\"Unicode7Ch3s8\">{{cite book |title=The Unicode Standard, Version 7.0\u2014Core Specification |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Julie D. |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Deborah |editor3-last=Becker |editor3-first=Joe |editor3-link=Joe Becker (Unicode) |editor4-last=Cook |editor4-first=Richard |publisher=[[Unicode Consortium|The Unicode Consortium]] |date=2014 |place=Mountain View |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ |section=3.8 Surrogates |page=118 |chapterurl=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch03.pdf |accessdate=3 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\nSince the ranges for the ''high surrogates'' ({{color|#920000|0xD800\u20130xDBFF}}), ''low surrogates'' ({{color|#000092|0xDC00\u20130xDFFF}}), and valid BMP characters (0x0000\u20130xD7FF, 0xE000\u20130xFFFF) are [[Disjoint_sets|disjoint]], it is not possible for a surrogate to match a BMP character, or for two adjacent ''code units'' to look like a legal ''surrogate pair''. This simplifies searches a great deal. It also means that UTF-16 is ''self-synchronizing'' on 16-bit words: whether a code unit starts a character can be determined without examining earlier code units (i.e. the type of ''code unit'' can be determined by the ranges of values in which it falls). UTF-8 shares these advantages, but many earlier multi-byte encoding schemes (such as [[Shift JIS]] and other Asian multi-byte encodings) did not allow unambiguous searching and could only be synchronized by re-parsing from the start of the string (UTF-16 is not self-synchronizing if one byte is lost or if traversal starts at a random byte).\n\nBecause the most commonly used characters are all in the BMP, handling of surrogate pairs is often not thoroughly tested.  This leads to persistent bugs and potential security holes, even in popular and well-reviewed application software (e.g. {{CVE|2008-2938|2012-2135}}).\n\nThe [[Plane (Unicode)|Supplementary Planes]] contain [[emoji]], historic scripts, less used symbols, less used Chinese ideographs, etc. Since the encoding of Supplementary Planes contains 20 significant bits (10 of 16 bits in each of the ''high'' and ''low surrogates''), 2<sup>20</sup> code points can be encoded, divided into 16 planes of 2<sup>16</sup> code points each. Including the separately-handled Basic Multilingual Plane, there are a total of 17 planes.\n\n=== U+D800 to U+DFFF ===\nThe Unicode standard permanently reserves these code point values for UTF-16 encoding of the high and low surrogates, and they will never be assigned a character, so there should be no reason to encode them. The official Unicode standard says that no UTF forms, including UTF-16, can encode these code points.\n\nHowever, UCS-2, UTF-8, and [[UTF-32]] can encode these code points in trivial and obvious ways, and large amounts of software does so even though the standard states that such arrangements should be treated as encoding errors.\n\nIt is possible to unambiguously encode an ''unpaired surrogate'' (a high surrogate code point not followed by a low one, or a low one not preceded by a high one) in UTF-16 by using a code unit equal to the code point. The majority of UTF-16 encoder and decoder implementations do this then when translating between encodings.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}<!-- Python 2.6 decode of UTF16 does this on Linux, and it correctly handles surrogate pairs. All \"CESU\" decoders do it too, though they also mis-translate correct surrogate pairs into 2 characters. --> Windows allows unpaired surrogates in filenames and other places, which generally means they have to be supported by software in spite of their exclusion from the Unicode standard.\n\n=== Examples ===\nTo encode U+10437 (\ud801\udc37) to UTF-16:\n\n* Subtract 0x10000 from the code point, leaving 0x0437.\n* For the high surrogate, shift right by 10 (divide by 0x400), then add 0xD800, resulting in 0x0001 + 0xD800 = 0xD801.\n* For the low surrogate, take the low 10 bits (remainder of dividing by 0x400), then add 0xDC00, resulting in 0x0037 + 0xDC00 = 0xDC37.\n\nTo decode U+10437 (\ud801\udc37) from UTF-16:\n\n* Take the high surrogate (0xD801) and subtract 0xD800, then multiply by 0x400, resulting in 0x0001 \u00d7 0x400 = 0x0400.\n* Take the low surrogate (0xDC37) and subtract 0xDC00, resulting in 0x37.\n* Add these two results together (0x0437), and finally add 0x10000 to get the final decoded UTF-32 code point, 0x10437.\n\nThe following table summarizes this conversion, as well as others. The colors indicate how bits from the code point are distributed among the UTF-16 bytes.

Since most communication and storage protocols are defined for bytes, and each unit thus takes two 8-bit bytes, the order of the bytes may depend on the [[endianness]] (byte order) of the computer architecture.\n\nTo assist in recognizing the byte order of code units, '''UTF-16''' allows a [[Byte Order Mark]] (BOM), a code point with the value U+FEFF, to precede the first actual coded value.<ref group=\"nb\">UTF-8 encoding produces byte values strictly less than 0xFE, so either byte in the BOM sequence also identifies the encoding as UTF-16 (assuming that UTF-32 is not expected).</ref> (U+FEFF is the invisible [[zero-width non-breaking space]]/ZWNBSP character.)<ref group=\"nb\">Use of U+FEFF as the character ZWNBSP instead of as a BOM has been deprecated in favor of U+2060 (WORD JOINER); see [https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM Byte Order Mark (BOM) FAQ] at unicode.org.  But if an application interprets an initial BOM as a character, the ZWNBSP character is invisible, so the impact is minimal.</ref> If the endian architecture of the decoder matches that of the encoder, the decoder detects the 0xFEFF value, but an opposite-endian decoder interprets the BOM as the non-character value U+FFFE reserved for this purpose. This incorrect result provides a hint to perform byte-swapping for the remaining values.\n\nIf the BOM is missing, RFC 2781 recommends<ref group=\"nb\">{{IETF RFC|2781}} section 4.3 says that if there is no BOM, \"the text SHOULD be interpreted as being big-endian.\" According to section 1.2, the meaning of the term \"SHOULD\" is governed by {{IETF RFC|2119}}. In that document, section 3 says \"... there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course\".</ref> that big-endian encoding be assumed. In practice, due to Windows using little-endian order by default, many applications assume little-endian encoding. It is also reliable to detect endianness by looking for null bytes, on the assumption that characters less than U+0100 are very common. If more even bytes (starting at 0) are null, then it is big-endian.\n\nThe standard also allows the byte order to be stated explicitly by specifying '''UTF-16BE''' or '''UTF-16LE''' as the encoding type.  When the byte order is specified explicitly this way, a BOM is specifically ''not'' supposed to be prepended to the text, and a U+FEFF at the beginning should be handled as a ZWNBSP character. Most applications ignore a BOM in all cases despite this rule.\n\nFor [[Internet]] protocols, [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has approved \"UTF-16\", \"UTF-16BE\", and \"UTF-16LE\" as the names for these encodings (the names are case insensitive). The aliases '''UTF_16''' or '''UTF16''' may be meaningful in some programming languages or software applications, but they are not standard names in Internet protocols.\n\nSimilar designations, '''UCS-2BE''' and '''UCS-2LE''', are used to show versions of '''UCS-2'''.\n\n== Usage ==\nUTF-16 is used for text in the OS&nbsp;API of all currently supported versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] (and including at least all since [[Windows CE]]/[[Windows 2000|2000]]/[[Windows XP|XP]]/[[Windows 2003|2003]]/[[Windows Vista|Vista]]/[[Windows 7|7]]<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374081.aspx ''Unicode (Windows)''].

In 1983, Norman left the company to emigrate to [[Australia]], but would return to the country (but not to Shergold) within a few years. In 1991, Jack began making new Shergold guitars - the Limited Edition Masquerader - due to a rising interest at that time in British guitars from the 1970s.

{"title_page": "Vasilissa ergo gaude", "text_new": "'''''Vasilissa ergo gaude''''' (\"''Therefore rejoice, [[basilissa|princess]]''\") is an [[isorhythm]]ic [[motet]] by the [[Renaissance]] composer [[Guillaume Dufay]]. In terms of its subject matter, it is sometimes grouped together with ''[[Lamentatio sanctae matris ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae]]'', ''[[Apostolus gloriosus]]'' and ''[[Balsamus et munda cera]]'' which are generically called Dufay's ''Byzantine motets''.<ref>Margaret Vardell Sandresky, \"The Golden Section in Three Byzantine Motets of Dufay\", ''Journal of Music Theory'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 291&ndash;306</ref> Its composition was occasioned by the marriage on 21 January 1421 of [[Cleofa Malatesta]], daughter of Malatesta di Pandolfo, to [[Theodore II Palaiologos]], son of the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel II]] and [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] of the [[Despotate of Morea|Morea]].<ref>J. Michael Allsen, \"Intertextuality and Compositional Process in Two Cantilena Motets by Hugo de Lantins\", ''The Journal of Musicology'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (Spring, 1993), p. 176, footnote 6</ref> It has been surmised that the actual motet was composed in 1420 and is perhaps the earliest example of this choral form if not the earliest work attributed to Dufay.<ref>Howard Mayer Brown, \"Guillaume Dufay and the Early Renaissance\", ''Early Music'', Vol. 2, No. 4 (Oct., 1974), p. 221</ref> In earlier scholarship it was assumed that the motet's first performance had taken place on May 19, 1419, during the festivities prior to the marriage <ref>Johannes Wolf, \"Der niederlandische Einfluss in der mehrstimmigen gemessenen Musik bis zum Jahre 1480.

Problems in the Texts of His Motets\", ''Early Music History'', Vol. 16, (1997), pp. 102&ndash;103</ref></poem>\n|}\n\nThe tenor line is taken from [[Psalm]] 45:11 (44:11 in the traditional Catholic numbering), whose theme is royal marriage. The verse chosen for the motet occurs in Catholic liturgy in the [[Gradual]] of various feasts of [[the Virgin Mary]].<ref>[http://gregorien.info/php/all-about-a-title.php?keyTitle=337&lang=en&template=gregorien-info Acad\u00e9mie de Chant gr\u00e9gorien]</ref> The motet is preserved in the contemporary music manuscript Codex Bologna, [[International museum and library of music]], MS Q15.\n\nIn terms of structure the composition has been compared with the mature work of [[Johannes Ciconia]], a Franco-Flemish composer also active in Italy. Of the four voices used, the two upper voices bearing the melody often imitate each other and move faster than the two lower voices. The [[Isorhythm|talea]] is repeated only once. An additional device independent from the motet's purely isorhythmic design is the canonic introit (a short [[Canon (music)|canon]] used as a prelude) appearing at the beginning of the composition.<ref>Howard Mayer Brown, \"Guillaume Dufay and the Early Renaissance\", ''Early Music'', Vol. 2, No. 4 (Oct., 1974), p. 222&ndash;3</ref> \n\nEven though numerological mysticism which is often encountered in the [[Ars Antiqua]] seems to have been of minor importance in musical composition from the 14th century onwards,<ref>[http://www.acc.umu.se/~akadkor/early/IID.html Ume\u00e5 Akademiska K\u00f6r] Early Vocal Music Map</ref> there have been attempts to interpret the motet's texture and design from a symbolic-mystical viewpoint. Dufay is known to have utilised similar devices such as [[gematria]] (a system of number symbolism drawn from the Pythagorean corpus) in other nuptial compositions.<ref>Allan W. Atlas , \"Gematria, Marriage Numbers, and Golden Sections in Dufay's 'Resvellies vous'\",'' Acta Musicologica'', Vol. 59, Fasc. 2 (May &ndash; August, 1987), pp. 111</ref> The tenor line singing the [[Cantus firmus]] in ''Vasilissa ergo gaude'' consists of a total of 2x49 notes plus the two closing notes, which add to a total of 100 notes. It has been suggested that this number implies the medieval symbolism for repentance which leads to absolute unity. It has further been proposed that the number 100 should be related to the total of 700 or else 7x100 notes of the remaining three voices, alluding to the sacred number 7. The sum total of notes in the motet is 800 and this has been interpreted as an allusion to the number 8. In medieval numerology, 8 signified eternity, understood in the context of Dufay's motet as eternal stability. \n\nAll these numerical symbolisms must have had a particular significance in view of the politically motivated marriage between Cleofa Malatesta and Theodore Palaiologos.

The verse chosen for the motet occurs in Catholic liturgy in the [[Gradual]] of various feasts of [[the Virgin Mary]].<ref>[http://gregorien.info/php/all-about-a-title.php?keyTitle=337&lang=en&template=gregorien-info Acad\u00e9mie de Chant gr\u00e9gorien]</ref> The motet is preserved in the contemporary music manuscript Codex Bologna, [[International museum and library of music]], MS Q15.\nIn terms of structure the composition has been compared with the mature work of [[Johannes Ciconia]], a Franco-Flemish composer also active in Italy. Of the four voices used, the two upper voices bearing the melody often imitate each other and move faster than the two lower voices. The [[Isorhythm|talea]] is repeated only once. An additional device independent from the motet's purely isorhythmic design is the canonic introit (a short [[Canon (music)|canon]] used as a prelude) appearing at the beginning of the composition.<ref>Howard Mayer Brown, \"Guillaume Dufay and the Early Renaissance\", ''Early Music'', Vol. 2, No. 4 (Oct., 1974), p. 222&ndash;3</ref> \n\nEven though numerological mysticism which is often encountered in the [[Ars Antiqua]] seems to have been of minor importance in musical composition from the 14th century onwards,<ref>[http://www.acc.umu.se/~akadkor/early/IID.html Ume\u00e5 Akademiska K\u00f6r] Early Vocal Music Map</ref> there have been attempts to interpret the motet's texture and design from a symbolic-mystical viewpoint. Dufay is known to have utilised similar devices such as [[gematria]] (a system of number symbolism drawn from the Pythagorean corpus) in other nuptial compositions.<ref>Allan W. Atlas , \"Gematria, Marriage Numbers, and Golden Sections in Dufay's 'Resvellies vous'\",'' Acta Musicologica'', Vol. 59, Fasc. 2 (May &ndash; August, 1987), pp. 111</ref> The tenor line singing the [[Cantus firmus]] in ''Vasilissa ergo gaude'' consists of a total of 2x49 notes plus the two closing notes which add to a total of 100 notes. It has been suggested that this number implies the medieval symbolism for repentance which leads to absolute unity. It has further been proposed that the number 100 should be related to the total of 700 or else 7x100 notes of the remaining three voices, alluding thus to the sacred number 7. The sum total of notes in the motet is 800 and this has been interpreted as an allusion to the number 8. In medieval numerology, 8 signified eternity, understood in the context of Dufay's motet as eternal stability. \n\nAll these numerical symbolisms must have had a particular significance in view of the politically motivated marriage between Cleofa Malatesta and Theodore Palaiologos. The marriage was arranged as part of a series of diplomatic gestures between Cleofa's uncle [[Pope Martin V]]  and the Byzantine emperor. It was hoped that it would facilitate reunification between the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Church (cf. [[Council of Florence]]).<ref>Review by Jaap van Benthem, Reviewed work: ''Dufay by David Fallows'', in ''Tijdschrift van de Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis'', D. 33ste, Afl. 1ste/2de (1983), p. 111</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.imeem.com/groups/Lhif7Oyz/music/xh2TWmrb/dufay_vasilissa_ergo_gaude/ Online performance] included in the ''Album Integrale des Motets Isorythmiques''\n\n{{Guillaume Dufay}}\n{{italic title}}\n[[Category:Motets]]\n[[Category:Renaissance music]]\n[[Category:1420s works]]\n", "name_user": "Tdslk", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copyedit (minor)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasilissa_ergo_gaude"}

It is located on a [[peninsula]], 1.6 square miles (4.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in area, connected to [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] by a narrow [[isthmus]] and to [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]] by a bridge over the harbor [[inlet]] to the [[Belle Isle Marsh Reservation]]. Settled in 1630, Winthrop is one of the oldest communities in the United States. It is also one of the smallest and most densely populated municipalities in Massachusetts. It is one of the four municipalities in Suffolk County (the others are [[Boston]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]]). It is the southernmost part of the [[North Shore (Massachusetts)|North Shore]], with a {{convert|7|miles|km|adj=on}} [[shore]]line that provides views of the Atlantic Ocean to the east and of the Boston skyline to the west.\n\nIn 2005, the Town of Winthrop voted to change its governance from a [[representative town meeting]] adopted in 1920 to a [[council-manager]] form of government. Under Massachusetts law, as of 2006 when the new Town Charter took effect, Winthrop became a city.

On April 8, 1630, Winthrop departed from the [[Isle of Wight]], England on the ship ''[[Arbella]]'', arriving in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in June where he was met by [[John Endecott]], the first governor of the colony.  John Winthrop served as governor for twelve of the colony's first twenty years of existence. It was he who decided to base the colony at the [[Shawmut Peninsula]], where he and other colonists founded what is now the City of Boston.\n\nOriginally part of an area called Winnisimmet by the native [[Massachusett]] tribe,<ref>[http://www.dickshovel.com/massa.html Massachuset].

In 1637, it was divided into fifteen parcels of land that were given by Governor Winthrop to prominent men in Boston with the stipulation that each must erect a building on his land within two years. Few, if any, of these men ever lived on these parcels of land, but their farms prospered. One of these early houses, the [[Deane Winthrop House]], was the home of Governor Winthrop's youngest son, [[Deane Winthrop]], who lived there until his death in 1704. This house is still standing and is also the oldest continually occupied home in the United States. Although occupied, it is also open to the public at select times. The house is maintained by the Winthrop Improvement and Historical Association.<ref>[http://www.wihaonline.org/ Winthrop Improvement and Historical Association]</ref>\n\nIn 1739, what is now Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop, withdrew from Boston due to governmental control disputes and became the Town of Chelsea. In 1775, residents of the Town of Chelsea played a key role in the [[Battle of Chelsea Creek]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=\"Discover Winthrop\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.discoverwinthrop.com/history.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929203423/http://www.discoverwinthrop.com/history.asp |archive-date=2009-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Again, the desire for more local control resulted in Revere and Winthrop seceding from Chelsea in 1846 to become North Chelsea. Shortly thereafter, in 1852, Winthrop was incorporated as a town in its own right with a [[Board of Selectmen]] and [[Open Town Meeting]] form of government. In 1920, Winthrop was the second town in the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] to apply for and receive a Charter for a [[Representative Town Meeting]], which continued to 2006.\n\nAs noted above, Winthrop adopted a home rule charter in 2005 with a [[council-manager]] form of government<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_Bylaws/towncharter |title=Town of Winthrop \u2013 Town Charter |access-date=2006-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031124643/http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_Bylaws/towncharter |archive-date=2014-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_Bcomm/WinthropGovernment.pdf |title=Town of Winthrop \u2013 Winthrop's form of government |access-date=2009-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192924/http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_Bcomm/WinthropGovernment.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and is no longer governed by a representative town meeting.

However, according to the Town Government, Winthrop has a land area of just {{convert|1.6|sqmi|km2}}.\n\nWinthrop is connected by land skirting the [[Belle Isle Marsh Reservation]], which is shared across the Belle Isle Inlet with [[East Boston]]. The town was originally separated from [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]]. Although still an island by name, Deer Island has been connected to Winthrop since the former Shirley Gut channel, which once separated the island from the town, was filled in by the [[New England Hurricane of 1938]]. The town is considered the northern dividing line between [[Boston Harbor]] to its west and [[Massachusetts Bay]] to its east.\n\nThe town is divided into several neighborhoods with a central downtown area, including Court Park and Cottage Park along the Boston Harbor side of town, and Point Shirley, Cottage Hill, [[Winthrop Beach]], Ocean Spray, and Winthrop Highlands on the Massachusetts Bay side. The town is bordered by [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] to the north, and Boston on the northwest, west, and southeast.  The water rights of the town extend to the edge of the county, and border those of [[Nahant, Massachusetts|Nahant]] in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]].  As a result of the expansion of [[Logan International Airport]], part of four of the runways (4L/22R, 4R/22L, 15R/33L, and most of 15L/33R) lies within what was once the water rights of the town.  By land, Winthrop is {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} from [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], the measuring point for all road signs in Massachusetts.\n\n[[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], though within the city limits of Boston, is located in Winthrop Bay. It ceased to be an island in the 1930s when [[Shirley Gut]], which separated it from Winthrop, was filled in. The island has a sordid past as an [[internment camp]] for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] during [[King Philip's War]], a [[quarantine]] station where many immigrants died, and the site of a [[county jail]]. Today, the island is home to the mammoth [[Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant]], which provides sewage treatment for the Boston area.<ref name=\"bhidifs\">{{cite web| title = Deer Island Factsheet | url = http://www.bostonislands.org/factsheet_template.asp?rsIslands__MMColParam=deer | publisher = Boston Harbor Islands Partnership | accessdate = August 21, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060629061118/http://www.bostonislands.org/factsheet_template.asp?rsIslands__MMColParam=deer <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 29, 2006}}</ref> In spite of the presence of the water treatment plant, Deer Island has been part of the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]] since 1996 and the remainder of the island consists of park land and offers walking, jogging, sightseeing, picnicking, and fishing. Part of the park land consists of a man-made earthen [[berm]] that partly conceals the treatment plant from view from Winthrop. The island is now popular with many Winthrop residents, due to the park landscaping and views of Boston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[Massachusetts Route 145]] passes through the town as its only state route and the only connection to the mainland (via Main Street and Winthrop Parkway at opposite ends of town).  It enters from the [[Orient Heights]] neighborhood of [[East Boston]] then passes in a loop around the main body of the town (bypassing Cottage Hill and Point Shirley) before leaving the town to the north, turning into the Winthrop Parkway in Revere.  Two bus routes are provided by Paul Revere Transportation, which run from Point Shirley through the highlands and center of the town and terminate at [[Orient Heights]].  Paul Revere Transportation has operated the bus service in town since 1991.  The service, which is subsidized by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]], operates as Route 712 Point Shirley or Winthrop Beach to [[Orient Heights (MBTA station)|Orient Heights Station]] via Winthrop Highlands and Route 713 Point Shirley or Winthrop Beach to Orient Heights via Winthrop Center.<ref>[http://mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/private_bus/?loc=Winthrop > Schedules & Maps > Private Bus].

Settled in 1630, Winthrop is one of the oldest communities in the United States. It is also one of the smallest and most densely populated municipalities in Massachusetts.

On April 8, 1630, Winthrop departed from the [[Isle of Wight]], England on the ship ''[[Arbella]]'', arriving in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in June where he was met by [[John Endecott]], the first governor of the colony.  John Winthrop served as governor for twelve of the colony's first twenty years of existence. It was he who decided to base the colony at the [[Shawmut Peninsula]], where he and other colonists founded what is now the City of Boston.\n\nOriginally part of an area called Winnisimmet by the native [[Massachusett]] tribe,<ref>[http://www.dickshovel.com/massa.html Massachuset].

In 1637, it was divided into fifteen parcels of land that were given by Governor Winthrop to prominent men in Boston with the stipulation that each must erect a building on his land within two years. Few, if any, of these men ever lived on these parcels of land, but their farms prospered. One of these early houses, the [[Deane Winthrop House]], was the home of Governor Winthrop's youngest son, [[Deane Winthrop]], who lived there until his death in 1704. This house is still standing and is also the oldest continually occupied home in the United States. Although occupied, it is also open to the public at select times. The house is maintained by the Winthrop Improvement and Historical Association.<ref>[http://www.wihaonline.org/ Winthrop Improvement and Historical Association]</ref>\n\nIn 1739, what is now Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop, withdrew from Boston due to governmental control disputes and became the Town of Chelsea.

The Board of Selectmen and Town Meeting were abolished, and legislative powers were vested in an elected [[Town Council]]. Executive power, largely ceremonial, resides in the Council President, who is popularly elected. An appointed [[Town Manager]] serves as the head of administrative services.\n\n==Geography and transportation==\n[[File:Boston skyline 2.jpg|thumb|View of Boston from Winthrop's Point Shirley in 2003]]\n[[File:1903 Boston Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad Winthrop Loop map.jpg|thumb|1903 map showing the stations of the former Winthrop Loop of the [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]]]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 8.3&nbsp;square miles (21.5&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which 2.0&nbsp;square miles (5.2&nbsp;km\u00b2) is land and 6.3&nbsp;square miles (16.3&nbsp;km\u00b2) (76.02%) is water.  However, according to the Town Government, Winthrop has a land area of just {{convert|1.6|sqmi|km2}}.\n\nWinthrop is connected by land skirting the [[Belle Isle Marsh Reservation]], which is shared across the Belle Isle Inlet with [[East Boston]]. The town was originally separated from [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]]. Although still an island by name, Deer Island has been connected to Winthrop since the former Shirley Gut channel, which once separated the island from the town, was filled in by the [[New England Hurricane of 1938]]. The town is considered the northern dividing line between [[Boston Harbor]] to its west and [[Massachusetts Bay]] to its east.\n\nThe town is divided into several neighborhoods with a central downtown area, including Court Park and Cottage Park along the Boston Harbor side of town, and Point Shirley, Cottage Hill, [[Winthrop Beach]], Ocean Spray, and Winthrop Highlands on the Massachusetts Bay side. The town is bordered by [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] to the north, and Boston on the northwest, west, and southeast.  The water rights of the town extend to the edge of the county, and border those of [[Nahant, Massachusetts|Nahant]] in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]].  As a result of the expansion of [[Logan International Airport]], part of four of the runways (4L/22R, 4R/22L, 15R/33L, and most of 15L/33R) lies within what was once the water rights of the town.  By land, Winthrop is {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} from [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], the measuring point for all road signs in Massachusetts.\n\n[[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], though within the city limits of Boston, is located in Winthrop Bay. It ceased to be an island in the 1930s when [[Shirley Gut]], which separated it from Winthrop, was filled in. The island has a sordid past as an [[internment camp]] for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] during [[King Philip's War]], a [[quarantine]] station where many immigrants died, and the site of a [[county jail]]. Today, the island is home to the mammoth [[Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant]], which provides sewage treatment for the Boston area.<ref name=\"bhidifs\">{{cite web| title = Deer Island Factsheet | url = http://www.bostonislands.org/factsheet_template.asp?rsIslands__MMColParam=deer | publisher = Boston Harbor Islands Partnership | accessdate = August 21, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060629061118/http://www.bostonislands.org/factsheet_template.asp?rsIslands__MMColParam=deer <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 29, 2006}}</ref> In spite of the presence of the water treatment plant, Deer Island has been part of the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]] since 1996 and the remainder of the island consists of park land and offers walking, jogging, sightseeing, picnicking, and fishing. Part of the park land consists of a man-made earthen [[berm]] that partly conceals the treatment plant from view from Winthrop. The island is now popular with many Winthrop residents, due to the park landscaping and views of Boston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[Massachusetts Route 145]] passes through the town as its only state route and the only connection to the mainland (via Main Street and Winthrop Parkway at opposite ends of town).  It enters from the [[Orient Heights]] neighborhood of [[East Boston]] then passes in a loop around the main body of the town (bypassing Cottage Hill and Point Shirley) before leaving the town to the north, turning into the Winthrop Parkway in Revere.  Two bus routes are provided by Paul Revere Transportation, which run from Point Shirley through the highlands and center of the town and terminate at [[Orient Heights]].  Paul Revere Transportation has operated the bus service in town since 1991.  The service, which is subsidized by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]], operates as Route 712 Point Shirley or Winthrop Beach to [[Orient Heights (MBTA station)|Orient Heights Station]] via Winthrop Highlands and Route 713 Point Shirley or Winthrop Beach to Orient Heights via Winthrop Center.<ref>[http://mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/private_bus/?loc=Winthrop > Schedules & Maps > Private Bus]. MBTA. Retrieved on 2013-09-18.</ref>  Prior to this, the service was operated by Rapid Transit, which began bus service in Winthrop on January 28, 1940, the day immediately following the closure of the [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]] (known as the \"Narrow Gauge\") which had a Winthrop Branch (1877-1940) with nine stations.  The [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority|MBTA]] subway system crosses near the town, with stops at [[Orient Heights (MBTA station)|Orient Heights Station]], [[Suffolk Downs (MBTA station)|Suffolk Downs Station]], and [[Beachmont (MBTA station)|Beachmont Station]], all of which are just a half mile from the city limits.  A water transportation dock is located at the public landing and provides ferry service across Boston Harbor.  Currently, Boston Harbor Cruises operates the service seasonally (May through October) between Winthrop and Rowes Wharf.<ref>[http://www.bostonharborcruises.com/boston-commuter-boat-services/winthrop-to-boston.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007002430/http://www.bostonharborcruises.com/boston-commuter-boat-services/winthrop-to-boston.aspx |date=October 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|align= left\n|state= collapsed\n|1860|544\n|1870|532\n|1880|1043\n|1890|2726\n|1900|6058\n|1910|10132\n|1920|15455\n|1930|16852\n|1940|16768\n|1950|19496\n|1960|20303\n|1970|20335\n|1980|19294\n|1990|18127\n|2000|18303\n|2010|17497\n|2018|18688\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* = population estimate.  {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 18,303 people, 7,843 households, and 4,580 families residing in the town.

He attended [[Lower Merion High School]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where he was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the country. Upon graduation, he declared for the [[1996 NBA draft]] and was selected by the [[1996\u201397 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte Hornets]] with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 [[Slam Dunk Contest]], and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|feud]] with teammate [[Shaquille O'Neal]], the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]] to [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]. In 2003, Bryant was [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|accused of sexual assault]] by a 19-year-old hotel clerk.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Draper|first=Kevin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-rape-case.html|title=Kobe Bryant and the Sexual Assault Case That Was Dropped but Not Forgotten|date=2020-01-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-14|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Criminal charges were brought and then dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a civil suit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology.\n\nAfter the Lakers lost the [[2004 NBA Finals]], O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306]] and [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307]] seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second [[List of National Basketball Association single-game scoring leaders|most points scored in a single game]] in league history, behind [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game]] in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]] and [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]], and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a [[torn Achilles tendon]] at age 34. Although he recovered from that injury, he suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing his physical decline, Bryant retired after the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\nAt 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on February 1, 2010, surpassing [[Jerry West]]. Bryant was also the first [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] in NBA history to play at least [[List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders|20 seasons]]. His 18 All-Star designations are the [[List of NBA All-Stars|second most all time]], while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP Awards]] are tied with [[Bob Pettit]] for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname \"'''Black Mamba'''\" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]] and [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]], he won two [[gold medal]]s as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]].

He attended [[Lower Merion High School]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where he was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the country. Upon graduation, he declared for the [[1996 NBA draft]] and was selected by the [[1996\u201397 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte Hornets]] with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 [[Slam Dunk Contest]], and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|feud]] with teammate [[Shaquille O'Neal]], the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]] to [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]. In 2003, Bryant was [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|accused of sexual assault]] by a 19-year-old hotel clerk.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Draper|first=Kevin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-rape-case.html|title=Kobe Bryant and the Sexual Assault Case That Was Dropped but Not Forgotten|date=2020-01-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-14|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Criminal charges were brought and then dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a civil suit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology.\n\nAfter the Lakers lost the [[2004 NBA Finals]], O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306]] and [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307]] seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second [[List of National Basketball Association single-game scoring leaders|most points scored in a single game]] in league history, behind [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game]] in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]] and [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]], and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a [[torn Achilles tendon]] at age 34. Although he recovered from that injury, he suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing his physical decline, Bryant retired after the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\nAt 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on February 1, 2010, surpassing [[Jerry West]]. Bryant was also the first [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] in NBA history to play at least [[List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders|20 seasons]]. His 18 All-Star designations are the [[List of NBA All-Stars|second most all time]], while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP Awards]] are tied with [[Bob Pettit]] for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname \"'''Black Mamba'''\" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]] and [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]], he won two [[gold medal]]s as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]].
