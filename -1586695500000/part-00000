It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910, who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported +next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the existence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. This mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor''.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Oldfield |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil'').

Earl and Mooch interact with each other, their human owners, and also the animals around their neighborhood.\n\n''[[Peanuts]]'' creator [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]] praised ''Mutts'', calling it \"one of the best comic strips of all time.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mutts.com/strip-history|title=Strip History|date=13 August 2013|website=Mutts.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Characters and story==\n[[Image:Mutts (Earl and Mooch).png|frame|right|Earl and Mooch]]\nThe friendship of Mooch and Earl focuses on the differences between cats and dogs as human companions and as friends with each other: Earl is friendly, loves the company of his human companion and likes to play outside; Mooch is often indifferent to his human companions, except for being fed, and prefers to stay inside or is often seen with Earl, his best friend. Both animals frequently express themselves through [[thought balloons]] when their owners are present.\n\n===Earl===\nEarl is an innocent [[Jack Russell terrier]] who lives with his human companion Ozzie, a bachelor. They love spending time together and taking frequent walks. Earl often howls in loneliness when Ozzie is away from home. Earl spends much of his free time with Mooch, either inside or wandering around town visiting other domesticated and wild animals. He loves to eat both human food and his own dog food. It is revealed in a 2011 Valentine's Day strip that Earl was adopted by Ozzie from a shelter.\n\n===Mooch===\nMooch is a curious tuxedo cat with a large nose who lives next door to Earl with his human companions Millie (who often calls him \"Moochie,\" \"Moo Moo Cakes,\" or \"Shmoochums,\" and he calls her \"Shmillie\") and Frank, a goldfish named Sid, and a snail named Little Earl. Mooch is somewhat reclusive, sometimes preferring to stay inside and nap, or play with his little pink sock, rather than go outside with Earl. He has an impediment that causes him to insert an ''sh'' into words, such as ''yesh'' (yes), ''shmilk'' ([[milk]]) and ''shmousie'' (mousie). He frequently snubs his cat food, much to Millie's chagrin, dislikes car rides, and, like Earl, he eats human food at every opportunity. He frequently uses a little girl's Bobbie Doll toy car. For years, Mooch thought that Earl was a \"weird-looking cat\" and didn't realize he was a dog.\n\nIn 2005, Earl and Mooch appeared as guests in Blondie and Dagwood's 75th anniversary in the comic strip ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]].'' In 2004, ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'' crossed over with ''Mutts.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2004/04/26|title=Pearls Before Swine by Stephan Pastis, April 26, 2004 Via @GoComics|last=Pastis|first=Stephan|website=GoComics.com|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref> In that strip, Rat goes to Comics Re-education Camp, where Earl and Mooch try to teach Rat to be a Lovable comic strip character. In another strip, Frank and Mooch are hanging out with many old comic strip characters, including but not limited to: ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'', and [[Little Nemo]]''.\n\n==Other characters==\n===Humans===\n*'''Ozzie'''&nbsp;\u2013 Earl's owner, a 30-something bachelor\n*'''Millie'''&nbsp;\u2013 Mooch's owner, a middle-aged housewife, married to Frank\n*'''Frank'''&nbsp;\u2013 Retired, married to Millie\n*'''Butchie'''&nbsp;\u2013 A butcher, and owner of Fatty Snax Deli, who tries to stop Mooch and Earl from eating his food\n*'''Doozy'''&nbsp;\u2013 A little girl who loves animals, she gives Guard Dog food\n*'''Bushy'''&nbsp;\u2013 Doozy's best friend and a hero to Tom-Tom\n*'''Ms. Lulu'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pet psychic\n*'''Sourpuss's Owner'''&nbsp;\u2013 Sourpusses's owner, also a friend of Millie\n\n===Animals===\n*'''Bip and Bop'''&nbsp;\u2013 Two squirrels who like bonking ground-dwellers with nuts (described as the antagonists of the strip)\n*'''Crabby'''&nbsp;\u2013 An unhappy crab who speaks with frequent expletives (denoted by stars and typographical symbols); he claims to have gone on many adventures, such as on a pirate ship, inside a whale, and even meeting the ''[[Popeye]]'' cast.\n*'''Guard Dog'''&nbsp;\u2013 A fierce-looking bulldog, perpetually chained in his yard\n*'''King Crab'''&nbsp;\u2013 The crabbiest of them all, ruler of all he sees (since he is at the bottom of the ocean, however, he can not see anything)\n*'''Lollipop'''&nbsp;\u2013 Crabby's soft-shell wife\n*'''McGarry'''&nbsp;\u2013 A bird who lives at the shore and tries to get Crabby not to swear\n*'''Mussels Marinara'''&nbsp;\u2013 A mussel that's always talking about its muscles; Crabby's buddy\n*'''Noodles'''&nbsp;\u2013 An alley cat friend of Shtinky's\n*'''Philippe'''&nbsp;\u2013 A bird always wooing his love, Phoebe\n*'''Shnelly'''&nbsp;\u2013 The house cat for whose love Mooch and Noodles fight; only the tip of her ears are seen through her owner's window\n*'''Shtinky Puddin''' (A.K.A.

More recently, some strips have served as an homage of sorts for ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', featuring Mooch as the Dude, with different characters quoting lines from other characters from the film. Every summer, Earl and Mooch and their families visit the Jersey Shore, where they are joined by Crabby, Mussels Marinara, and McGarry. From time to time, Mooch drapes a towel over his head and delivers oracles or answers to chipmunk's questions as The Shphinx. In the fall, Bip and Bop embark on their campaign of bonking ground-dwellers' heads with nuts. Occasionally Mooch can be seen playing with his little pink sock. Mooch also does the Mutts Book Club, where he sits on a rock and reads books to Chippy and Monk. In the winter, Earl and Mooch try to hibernate for the winter. At Thanksgiving, the characters talk about what their thankful for. On ''[[Groundhog Day]]'' Lamont talks to Earl and Mooch about seeing his shadow or not. For ''[[Valentines Day]]'', the ''[[Spring (season)|Spring]]'', ''[[Thanksgiving]]'', and ''[[Christmas]],'' they have quotes from people on occasion, and sometimes Guard Dog sings to the Man on the Moon who comments on his song. Sometimes Shtinky Puddin' will hold a sign, then a group of people walk by and the sign will be different. During Farm Animal Awareness Week, Earl and Mooch visit a farm animal sanctuary. Every so often, the characters will encounter lifelike drawings of animals. Often, Mooch can be seen riding Doozy's [[electric car]].\n\n==Animal welfare and animal rights==\n[[File:Patrick McDonnell.JPG|200px|thumbnail|Patrick McDonnell, the creator of ''Mutts'']]\nOn occasion, McDonnell devotes the strip for a week or so to [[animal welfare]] issues, especially the adoption of pets from [[animal shelter]]s. Themes include Farm Animal Awareness Week and Shelter Stories, where pet adoption as well as pet shelter life is focused on. McDonnell also created artwork for the second generation [[New Jersey]] [[Vehicle registration plates of New Jersey|Animal Friendly specialty license plate]] first issued in 2001. A portion of the revenue from the plates goes to the New Jersey State Department of Health's Animal Population Control Program. Also, he speaks out (usually using Shtinky) about numerous animal rights causes, including [[seal clubbing]], [[whale hunting]], and most of all, saving the tigers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/Vehicle/AnimalFriendly.htm|title=State of New Jersey - Motor Vehicle Commission|website=State.nj.us|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> He has also produced several short animated public service announcements advocating animal adoption from shelters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cartoonician.com/reigning-cat-and-dog-an-interview-with-mutts-creator-patrick-mcdonnell/|title=Reigning Cat and Dog: An Interview with MUTTS Creator Patrick McDonnell|date=20 January 2017|website=Cartoonician.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne week there was a reference to the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2010/08/17/sea-shepherd-featured-in-mutts-comic-strip-148|title=Sea Shepherd Featured in MUTTS Comic Strip|website=Seashepherd.org|accessdate=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026215805/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2010/08/17/sea-shepherd-featured-in-mutts-comic-strip-148|archive-date=2016-10-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Sunday title panels==\n[[Sunday strip]]s are in color and their title panels are sometimes a tribute to a famous comic strip, a work of art, or another subject, including [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] #1, [[Dal\u00ed]]'s ''[[The Persistence of Memory]],'' [[Elvis Presley]], ''[[Trout Mask Replica]],'' and [[Magritte]]'s ''[[Golconda (painting)|Golconda]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mutts.com/title.aspx|title=Title Panel Tributes|website=Mutts.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\n''Mutts'' is set in New Jersey.\n\n==Mutts books==\n===Annual collections===\nBlack-and-white reproductions of full year's strips (until 2005).\n#''Mutts'' (July 1996) {{ISBN|978-0-8362-1025-5}}\n#''Cats & Dogs'' (October 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-8362-3732-0}}\n#''More Shtuff'' (September 1998) {{ISBN|978-0-8362-6823-2}}\n#''Yesh!''

Earl and Mooch interact with each other, their human owners, and also the animals around their neighborhood.\n\n''[[Peanuts]]'' creator [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]] praised ''Mutts'', calling it \"one of the best comic strips of all time.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mutts.com/strip-history|title=Strip History|date=13 August 2013|website=Mutts.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Characters and story==\n[[Image:Mutts (Earl and Mooch).png|frame|right|Earl and Mooch]]\nThe friendship of Mooch and Earl focuses on the differences between cats and dogs as human companions and as friends with each other: Earl is friendly, loves the company of his human companion and likes to play outside; Mooch is often indifferent to his human companions, except for being fed, and prefers to stay inside or is often seen with Earl, his best friend. Both animals frequently express themselves through [[thought balloons]] when their owners are present.\n\n===Earl===\nEarl is an innocent [[Jack Russell terrier]] who lives with his human companion Ozzie, a bachelor. They love spending time together and taking frequent walks. Earl often howls in loneliness when Ozzie is away from home. Earl spends much of his free time with Mooch, either inside or wandering around town visiting other domesticated and wild animals. He loves to eat both human food and his own dog food. It is revealed in a 2011 Valentine's Day strip that Earl was adopted by Ozzie from a shelter.\n\n===Mooch===\nMooch is a curious tuxedo cat with a large nose who lives next door to Earl with his human companions Millie (who often calls him \"Moochie,\" \"Moo Moo Cakes,\" or \"Shmoochums,\" and he calls her \"Shmillie\") and Frank, a goldfish named Sid, and a snail named Little Earl. Mooch is somewhat reclusive, sometimes preferring to stay inside and nap, or play with his little pink sock, rather than go outside with Earl. He has an impediment  that causes him to insert an ''sh'' into words, such as ''yesh'' (yes), ''shmilk'' ([[milk]]) and ''shmousie'' (mousie). He frequently snubs his cat food, much to Millie's chagrin, dislikes car rides, and, like Earl, he eats human food at every opportunity. He frequently uses a little girl's Bobbie Doll toy car. For years, Mooch thought that Earl was a \"weird-looking cat\" and didn't realize he was a dog.\n\nIn 2005, Earl and Mooch appeared as guests in Blondie and Dagwood's 75th anniversary in the comic strip ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]].'' In 2004, ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'' crossed over with ''Mutts.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2004/04/26|title=Pearls Before Swine by Stephan Pastis, April 26, 2004 Via @GoComics|last=Pastis|first=Stephan|website=GoComics.com|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref> In that strip, Rat goes to Comics Re-education Camp, where Earl and Mooch try to teach Rat to be a Lovable comic strip character. In another strip, Frank and Mooch are hanging out with many old comic strip characters, including but not limited to: ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'', and [[Little Nemo]]''.\n\n==Other characters==\n===Humans===\n*'''Ozzie'''&nbsp;\u2013 Earl's owner, a 30-something bachelor\n*'''Millie'''&nbsp;\u2013 Mooch's owner, a middle-aged housewife, married to Frank\n*'''Frank'''&nbsp;\u2013 Retired, married to Millie\n*'''Butchie'''&nbsp;\u2013 A butcher, and owner of Fatty Snax Deli, who tries to stop Mooch and Earl from eating his food\n*'''Doozy'''&nbsp;\u2013 A little girl who loves animals, she gives Guard Dog food\n*'''Bushy'''&nbsp;\u2013 Doozy's best friend and a hero to Tom-Tom\n*'''Ms. Lulu'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pet psychic\n*'''Sourpuss's Owner'''&nbsp;\u2013 Sourpusses's owner, also a friend of Millie\n\n===Animals===\n*'''Bip and Bop'''&nbsp;\u2013 Two squirrels who like bonking ground-dwellers with nuts (described as the antagonists of the strip)\n*'''Crabby'''&nbsp;\u2013 An unhappy crab who speaks with frequent expletives (denoted by stars and typographical symbols); he claims to have gone on many adventures, such as on a pirate ship, inside a whale, and even meeting the ''[[Popeye]]'' cast.\n*'''Guard Dog'''&nbsp;\u2013 A fierce-looking bulldog, perpetually chained in his yard\n*'''King Crab'''&nbsp;\u2013 The crabbiest of them all, ruler of all he sees (since he is at the bottom of the ocean, however, he can not see anything)\n*'''Lollipop'''&nbsp;\u2013 Crabby's soft-shell wife\n*'''McGarry'''&nbsp;\u2013 A bird who lives at the shore and tries to get Crabby not to swear\n*'''Mussels Marinara'''&nbsp;\u2013 A mussel that's always talking about its muscles; Crabby's buddy\n*'''Noodles'''&nbsp;\u2013 An alley cat friend of Shtinky's\n*'''Philippe'''&nbsp;\u2013 A bird always wooing his love, Phoebe\n*'''Shnelly'''&nbsp;\u2013 The house cat for whose love Mooch and Noodles fight; only the tip of her ears are seen through her owner's window\n*'''Shtinky Puddin''' (A.K.A.

More recently, some strips have served as an homage of sorts for ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', featuring Mooch as the Dude, with different characters quoting lines from other characters from the film. Every summer, Earl and Mooch and their families visit the Jersey Shore, where they are joined by Crabby, Mussels Marinara, and McGarry. From time to time, Mooch drapes a towel over his head and delivers oracles or answers to chipmunk's questions as The Shphinx. In the fall, Bip and Bop embark on their campaign of bonking ground-dwellers' heads with nuts. Occasionally Mooch can be seen playing with his little pink sock. Mooch also does the Mutts Book Club, where he sits on a rock and reads books to Chippy and Monk. In the winter, Earl and Mooch try to hibernate for the winter. At Thanksgiving, the characters talk about what their thankful for. On ''[[Groundhog Day]]'' Lamont talks to Earl and Mooch about seeing his shadow or not. For ''[[Valentines Day]]'', the ''[[Spring (season)|Spring]]'', ''[[Thanksgiving]]'', and ''[[Christmas]],'' they have quotes from people on occasion, and sometimes Guard Dog sings to the Man on the Moon who comments on his song. Sometimes Shtinky Puddin' will hold a sign, then a group of people walk by and the sign will be different. During Farm Animal Awareness Week, Earl and Mooch visit a farm animal sanctuary. Every so often, the characters will encounter lifelike drawings of animals. Often, Mooch can be seen riding Doozy's [[electric car]].\n\n==Animal welfare and animal rights==\n[[File:Patrick McDonnell.JPG|200px|thumbnail|Patrick McDonnell, the creator of ''Mutts'']]\nOn occasion, McDonnell devotes the strip for a week or so to [[animal welfare]] issues, especially the adoption of pets from [[animal shelter]]s. Themes include Farm Animal Awareness Week and Shelter Stories, where pet adoption as well as pet shelter life is focused on. McDonnell also created artwork for the second generation [[New Jersey]] [[Vehicle registration plates of New Jersey|Animal Friendly specialty license plate]] first issued in 2001. A portion of the revenue from the plates goes to the New Jersey State Department of Health's Animal Population Control Program. Also, he speaks out (usually using Shtinky) about numerous animal rights causes, including [[seal clubbing]], [[whale hunting]], and most of all, saving the tigers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/Vehicle/AnimalFriendly.htm|title=State of New Jersey - Motor Vehicle Commission|website=State.nj.us|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> He has also produced several short animated public service announcements advocating animal adoption from shelters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cartoonician.com/reigning-cat-and-dog-an-interview-with-mutts-creator-patrick-mcdonnell/|title=Reigning Cat and Dog: An Interview with MUTTS Creator Patrick McDonnell|date=20 January 2017|website=Cartoonician.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne week there was a reference to the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2010/08/17/sea-shepherd-featured-in-mutts-comic-strip-148|title=Sea Shepherd Featured in MUTTS Comic Strip|website=Seashepherd.org|accessdate=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026215805/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2010/08/17/sea-shepherd-featured-in-mutts-comic-strip-148|archive-date=2016-10-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Sunday title panels==\n[[Sunday strip]]s are in color and their title panels are sometimes a tribute to a famous comic strip, a work of art, or another subject, including [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] #1, [[Dal\u00ed]]'s ''[[The Persistence of Memory]],'' [[Elvis Presley]], ''[[Trout Mask Replica]],'' and [[Magritte]]'s ''[[Golconda (painting)|Golconda]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mutts.com/title.aspx|title=Title Panel Tributes|website=Mutts.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\n''Mutts'' is set in New Jersey.\n\n==Mutts books==\n===Annual collections===\nBlack-and-white reproductions of full year's strips (until 2005).\n#''Mutts'' (July 1996) {{ISBN|978-0-8362-1025-5}}\n#''Cats & Dogs'' (October 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-8362-3732-0}}\n#''More Shtuff'' (September 1998) {{ISBN|978-0-8362-6823-2}}\n#''Yesh!''

''Ostafrikasaurus''<nowiki/>'s well-developed serrations, compared to the smaller, finer ones of later relatives like ''[[Baryonyx]]'', and the lack of serrations on taxa like ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', led Buffetaut to hypothesize that spinosaurid teeth lost their serrations as they became more specialised for an aquatic diet.

The [[Name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from the German name of the colony in which the fossils were found, ''Deutsch-Ostafrika,'' meaning \"German East Africa\", combined with the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}''), meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\". The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|crassus}},'' meaning \"thick\"; and ''{{lang|la|serratus}},'' meaning \"serrated\", in reference to the large [[Serration|serrations]] of its teeth. MB R 1084 differs in several respects from the other eight teeth found in the Middle Dinosaur Member.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ostafrikasaurus_crassiserratus_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|Hypothetical life [[paleoart|restoration]]]]\n\nIn 2016, Spanish palaeontologists Molina-P\u00e9rez and Larramendi estimated ''Ostafrikasaurus'' at about {{convert|8.4|m|ft}} long, {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall at the hips and weighing {{convert|1.15|t|lb}}.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Molina-Per\u00e9z & Larramendi|title=R\u00e9cords y curiosidades de los dinosaurios Ter\u00f3podos y otros dinosauromorfos|publisher=Larousse|year=2016|isbn=9780565094973|location=Barcelona, Spain|pages=275}}</ref> However, without more complete material, such as a skull or body fossil, the body size and weight of fragmentary spinosaur taxa, especially those known only from teeth, can not be reliably calculated.<ref name=\"hone2017\">{{Cite journal|last=Hone|first=David William Elliott|last2=Holtz|first2=Thomas Richard|date=June 2017|title=A century of spinosaurs \u2013 a review and revision of the Spinosauridae with comments on their ecology|journal=Acta Geologica Sinica \u2013 English Edition|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=1120\u20131132|doi=10.1111/1755-6724.13328|issn=1000-9515}}</ref> \n\nThe holotype tooth is thick, somewhat flattened sideways, and {{Convert|46|mm|}} in length from top to bottom. Its tip has been rounded by [[erosion]] and the base is not fully preserved. The tooth [[Crown (tooth)|crown]] has well-defined carinae (cutting edges), with the front carina being curved and the back carina almost straight. There is only mild side-to-side curvature. Both carinae are [[serrated]], with rounded [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] perpendicular to the edge of the tooth. The serrations have no inderdenticle sulci, or grooves, in between them. They line the front carina from the base to its tip, and probably also did on the back carina, whose base has been largely eroded. Towards the tip of the tooth, these serrations are very worn down (especially on the front carina). On the front carina, there are two [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per millimetre (0.04 in) near the tip of the tooth, and three to four per millimetre (0.04 in) as the denticles shrink towards the base of the crown. There are two denticles per millimetre (0.04 in) all along the back carina. The serrations are notably larger than in other known spinosaurids.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" /> \n\nThe [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] (outermost layer) of the tooth bears a series of lengthwise ridges on its surface - ten on the [[Glossary of dentistry#lingual|lingual]] side, which faced the inside of the mouth; and four fainter, less extensive ones on the [[Glossary of dentistry#labial|labial]] side, which faced the outside of the mouth. The gaps between ridges are {{Convert|1|mm||abbr=on}} wide at most. None of the ridges on either side reach the tip of the crown. There is a {{Convert|3|mm||abbr=on}} wide region at the front of the tooth on both sides that lacks ridges; a similar area on the rear of the tooth side diminishes in width, from {{Convert|8 to 4|mm||abbr=on}} as it approaches the tip of the crown. On both sides of the tooth, between the ridges and ridge-less parts of the teeth, the enamel surface is finely wrinkled.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Bryonyx.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed skeleton of ''[[Baryonyx]]'', a [[spinosaurid]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]]]]\n\nIn 2008, Buffetaut suggested that MB R 1084 represented a new genus of spinosaurid, and that it differs from other teeth previously referred to ''L.? stechowi''.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|year=2012|title=An early spinosaurid dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru (Tanzania) and the evolution of the spinosaurid dentition|url=http://www.dinosauria.org/documents/2017/buffetaut_2013.pdf|journal=Oryctos|volume=10|issue=|pages=1\u20138|via=}}</ref> In 2011, German palaeontologist Oliver Rauhut listed some of these differences: MB R 1084 has a much higher number of lingual ridges (up to eleven) and presents three ridges and grooves on the labial side. Furthermore, some of the lingual ridges extend over almost the entire length of the crown, leaving only the apicalmost 5 mm of the crown smooth, whereas others are restricted to the basal part, being intercalated with ridges that extend further apically. Additionally, ridges are present over almost the entire mesial (front) three-fifths of the crown, whereas the distal (back) two-fifths are devoid of any ornamentation. Mesially, the ridged area is slightly set off from the mesial carina by a slightly mesiodistally concave area. However, its general shape and serration density is very similar to the teeth from the Middle Dinosaur Marl, as all teeth have 10 denticles per 5 mm distally and 13 denticles per 5 mm mesially. Finally, Rauhut suggested that it is possible that this tooth represents the same taxon as the other teeth, or a closely related taxon.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

He also considered that another isolated tooth (specimen MB R 1091) from the Middle Dinosaur Member, might represent the same genus as MB R 1084. In a [[2012 in paleontology|2012]] paper, he named the new [[genus]] and [[species]] ''Ostafrikasaurus crassiserratus'', with MB R 1084 as the [[holotype specimen]], and MB R 1091 as referred material. The [[Name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from the German name of the colony in which the fossils were found, ''Deutsch-Ostafrika,'' meaning \"German East Africa\", combined with the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}''), meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\". The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|crassus}},'' meaning \"thick\"; and ''{{lang|la|serratus}},'' meaning \"serrated\", in reference to the large [[Serration|serrations]] of its teeth. MB R 1084 differs in several respects from the other eight teeth found in the Middle Dinosaur Member.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ostafrikasaurus_crassiserratus_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|Hypothetical life [[paleoart|restoration]]]]\n\nIn 2016, Spanish palaeontologists Molina-P\u00e9rez and Larramendi estimated ''Ostafrikasaurus'' at about {{convert|8.4|m|ft}} long, {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall at the hips and weighing {{convert|1.15|t|lb}}.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Molina-Per\u00e9z & Larramendi|title=R\u00e9cords y curiosidades de los dinosaurios Ter\u00f3podos y otros dinosauromorfos|publisher=Larousse|year=2016|isbn=9780565094973|location=Barcelona, Spain|pages=275}}</ref> However, without more complete material, such as a skull or body fossil, the body size and weight of fragmentary spinosaur taxa, especially those known only from teeth, can not be reliably calculated.<ref name=\"hone2017\">{{Cite journal|last=Hone|first=David William Elliott|last2=Holtz|first2=Thomas Richard|date=June 2017|title=A century of spinosaurs \u2013 a review and revision of the Spinosauridae with comments on their ecology|journal=Acta Geologica Sinica \u2013 English Edition|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=1120\u20131132|doi=10.1111/1755-6724.13328|issn=1000-9515}}</ref> \n\nThe holotype tooth is thick, somewhat flattened sideways, and {{Convert|46|mm|}} in length from top to bottom. Its tip has been rounded by [[erosion]] and the base is not fully preserved. The tooth [[Crown (tooth)|crown]] has well-defined carinae (cutting edges), with the front carina being curved and the back carina almost straight. There is only mild side-to-side curvature. Both carinae are [[serrated]], with rounded [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] perpendicular to the edge of the tooth. The serrations have no inderdenticle sulci, or grooves, in between them. They line the front carina from the base to its tip, and probably also did on the back carina, whose base has been largely eroded. Towards the tip of the tooth, these serrations are very worn down (especially on the front carina). On the front carina, there are two [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per millimetre (0.04 in) near the tip of the tooth, and three to four per millimetre (0.04 in) as the denticles shrink towards the base of the crown. There are two denticles per millimetre (0.04 in) all along the back carina. The serrations are notably larger than in other known spinosaurids.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" /> \n\nThe [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] (outermost layer) of the tooth bears a series of lengthwise ridges on its surface - ten on the [[Glossary of dentistry#lingual|lingual]] side, which faced the inside of the mouth; and four fainter, less extensive ones on the [[Glossary of dentistry#labial|labial]] side, which faced the outside of the mouth. The gaps between ridges are {{Convert|1|mm||abbr=on}} wide at most. None of the ridges on either side reach the tip of the crown. There is a {{Convert|3|mm||abbr=on}} wide region at the front of the tooth on both sides that lacks ridges; a similar area on the rear of the tooth side diminishes in width, from {{Convert|8 to 4|mm||abbr=on}} as it approaches the tip of the crown. On both sides of the tooth, between the ridges and ridge-less parts of the teeth, the enamel surface is finely wrinkled.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus2\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Bryonyx.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed skeleton of ''[[Baryonyx]]'', a [[spinosaurid]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]]]]\n\nIn 2008, Buffetaut suggested that MB R 1084 represented a new genus of spinosaurid, and that it differs from other teeth previously referred to ''L.? stechowi''.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|year=2012|title=An early spinosaurid dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru (Tanzania) and the evolution of the spinosaurid dentition|url=http://www.dinosauria.org/documents/2017/buffetaut_2013.pdf|journal=Oryctos|volume=10|issue=|pages=1\u20138|via=}}</ref> In 2011, German palaeontologist Oliver Rauhut listed some of these differences: MB R 1084 has a much higher number of lingual ridges (up to eleven) and presents three ridges and grooves on the labial side. Furthermore, some of the lingual ridges extend over almost the entire length of the crown, leaving only the apicalmost 5 mm of the crown smooth, whereas others are restricted to the basal part, being intercalated with ridges that extend further apically. Additionally, ridges are present over almost the entire mesial (front) three-fifths of the crown, whereas the distal (back) two-fifths are devoid of any ornamentation. Mesially, the ridged area is slightly set off from the mesial carina by a slightly mesiodistally concave area. However, its general shape and serration density is very similar to the teeth from the Middle Dinosaur Marl, as all teeth have 10 denticles per 5 mm distally and 13 denticles per 5 mm mesially. Finally, Rauhut suggested that it is possible that this tooth represents the same taxon as the other teeth, or a closely related taxon.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

In regards to dental traits, baryonychines are characterized by slightly curved, finely-serrated teeth with more oval cross sections, while spinosaurine teeth are usually observed to be straight, having highly reduced or completely absent serrations, more circular cross sections, and prominent lengthwise ridges on their enamel.<ref name=\"hone2017\" />''<ref name=\"EBetal082\">{{cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=E.|author2=Suteethorn, V.|author3=Tong, H.|author4=Amiot, R.|year=2008|title=An Early Cretaceous spinosaur theropod from southern China|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=145|issue=5|pages=745\u2013748|bibcode=2008GeoM..145..745B|doi=10.1017/S0016756808005360}}</ref>'' In 2012, Buffetaut assigned ''Ostafrikasaurus'' to the Spinosauridae, based on the fact that the tooth displays an enamel ornamentation that resembles many baryonychines including ''[[Baryonyx]]'', but differs from all other known spinosaurids by the large size of the denticles borne by the carinae. Thus, ''Ostafrikasaurus'', according to Buffetaut, represents the earliest currently known spinosaurid.
