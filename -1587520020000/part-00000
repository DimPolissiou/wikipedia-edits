The Hialeah Public Library has one central library, John F. Kennedy Library, and five neighborhood e-libraries.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1924, the Hialeah [[Woman's club movement|Woman's Club]] set their first goal as an organization to open a local library for soon to be incorporated City of Hialeah,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://www.gfwcwomansclubofhialeah.com/sample-page/|website = www.gfwcwomansclubofhialeah.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151129213255/http://www.gfwcwomansclubofhialeah.com/sample-page/|archive-date = 2015-11-29|url-status = dead}}</ref> and with the backing of Ms. Lua Adams Curtiss, they reached out to the community for donated books. After a book tea, hosted by the Woman's Club in 1924, fifty books were acquired, and the Woman's Club was able to open Hialeah's first \"library\"; a single room in Ms. J Sommers Garwood's home. Garwood was the President of the Woman's Club during that time.<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = New Home for Woman's Club Long Time Coming|last = Karantsalis|first = Theo|date = October 9, 2011|work = |access-date = |via = }}</ref> The next year, the Woman's Club received a large donation from a benefactor after her death, and needed to find a larger location for the library. The Hialeah School Board decided to help by donating the use of a portable classroom at South Hialeah Elementary. The library was housed in this location until the hurricane of 1926 severely damaged the building and some of the collection.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = City of Hialeah, Florida - Our History|url = http://www.hialeahfl.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=84&Itemid=310&lang=en|website = www.hialeahfl.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103184801/http://www.hialeahfl.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=84&Itemid=310&lang=en|archive-date = 2013-11-03|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Hurricane of 1926, the library moved to a room within city hall. The Hialeah Woman's Club was also able to reach out to the community and request more donations to make up for the lost titles. The library was housed in this temporary location for about 20 years. During that time, it was staffed by volunteers and acquired titles only through donation. In the early 1950s, the library moved to its first permanent location, the two-story water tower adjoining the City of Hialeah's fire station. When the library moved to this location, the City of Hialeah began to pay for the utilities, and hired the first part-time librarian.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1958, the City of Hialeah had increased to a population of 40,000 and in order to meet the needs of the community, the library moved into a newer and larger location, The Lua A. Curtiss Branch Library. At this time, the library hired its first full-time librarian.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Lua A. Curtiss Branch Library was named after one of the first members of the Hialeah Woman's Club who championed the creation of Hialeah's local library. It is a single story, one room building that, at its opening, housed 14,000 items to be borrowed. In 1965, the Hialeah Public Library grew to include the John F. Kennedy Library, which is currently the main branch of the system.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nStarting in 2001, Hialeah added five e-library locations throughout the city. These sites serve heavily populated, underprivileged areas that may not have internet access at home or may not have the transportation available to visit a more distant library branch. The e-libraries share space with a police substation or a community center and are staffed by library paraprofessionals. The e-library locations provide computers for internet access. Customers may request items for interlibrary loan, pick up reserved items or return material. There is a revolving book collection at each e-library, and programs such as children's story time are offered.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aranda|first=Jose|last2=Miro|first2=Elizabeth|year=2004|title=Hialeah Public e-Libraries Deliver Services to Underserved Neighborhoods|url=|journal=Florida Libraries|volume=47|issue=2|pages=4\u20136|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Branches ==\n* '''John F.

The Hialeah Public Library has one central library, John F. Kennedy Library, and five neighborhood e-libraries.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1924, the Hialeah [[Woman's club movement|Woman's Club]] set their first goal as an organization to open a local library for soon to be incorporated City of Hialeah,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://www.gfwcwomansclubofhialeah.com/sample-page/|website = www.gfwcwomansclubofhialeah.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151129213255/http://www.gfwcwomansclubofhialeah.com/sample-page/|archive-date = 2015-11-29|url-status = dead}}</ref> and with the backing of Ms. Lua Adams Curtiss, they reached out to the community for donated books. After a book tea, hosted by the Woman's Club in 1924, fifty books were acquired, and the Woman's Club was able to open Hialeah's first \"library\"; a single room in Ms. J Sommers Garwood's home. Garwood was the President of the Woman's Club during that time.<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = New Home for Woman's Club Long Time Coming|last = Karantsalis|first = Theo|date = October 9, 2011|work = |access-date = |via = }}</ref> The next year, the Woman's Club received a large donation from a benefactor after her death, and needed to find a larger location for the library. The Hialeah School Board decided to help by donating the use of a portable classroom at South Hialeah Elementary. The library was housed in this location until the hurricane of 1926 severely damaged the building and some of the collection.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = City of Hialeah, Florida - Our History|url = http://www.hialeahfl.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=84&Itemid=310&lang=en|website = www.hialeahfl.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103184801/http://www.hialeahfl.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=84&Itemid=310&lang=en|archive-date = 2013-11-03|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Hurricane of 1926, the library moved to a room within city hall. The Hialeah Woman's Club was also able to reach out to the community and request more donations to make up for the lost titles. The library was housed in this temporary location for about 20 years. During that time, it was staffed by volunteers and acquired titles only through donation. In the early 1950s, the library moved to its first permanent location, the two-story water tower adjoining the City of Hialeah's fire station. When the library moved to this location, the City of Hialeah began to pay for the utilities, and hired the first part-time librarian.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1958, the City of Hialeah had increased to a population of 40,000 and in order to meet the needs of the community, the library moved into a newer and larger location, The Lua A. Curtiss Branch Library. At this time, the library hired its first full-time librarian.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Lua A. Curtiss Branch Library was named after one of the first members of the Hialeah Woman's Club who championed the creation of Hialeah's local library. It is a single story, one room building that, at its opening, housed 14,000 items to be borrowed. In 1965, the Hialeah Public Library grew to include the John F. Kennedy Library, which is currently the main branch of the system.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nStarting in 2001, Hialeah added five e-library locations throughout the city. These sites serve heavily populated, underprivileged areas that may not have internet access at home or may not have the transportation available to visit a more distant library branch. The e-libraries share space with a police substation or a community center and are staffed by library paraprofessionals. The e-library locations provide computers for internet access. Customers may request items for interlibrary loan, pick up reserved items or return material. There is a revolving book collection at each e-library, and programs such as children's story time are offered.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aranda|first=Jose|last2=Miro|first2=Elizabeth|year=2004|title=Hialeah Public e-Libraries Deliver Services to Underserved Neighborhoods|url=|journal=Florida Libraries|volume=47|issue=2|pages=4\u20136|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Branches ==\n* '''John F.

Retrieved 2010-08-04</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn 1851, [[Massachusetts]] towns and cities were legally authorized to designate funds for libraries. On March 11, 1853, an article was issued \"to see if the town will take measures to establish and maintain a public library for the use of the inhabitants of the town and appropriate money therefore, as petitioned for by John Wells and others\".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The town accepted the article, establishing the first free public library in the Western part of the state. In 1853, 900 books were donated to the city by the Cabot Institute, a literary and social club of at least 150 members, including D.K. Pearson, a local doctor who also donated money to [[Mount Holyoke College]] for the building of Pearson's dormitory, and John Chase, who planned and built the dams to power the mills in Chicopee.\n\nIn 1863 library duties were performed by the [[town clerk]]s, among them J.R. Childs, William L. Bemis and Lester Dickinson. In 1864 the Town of Chicopee voted to \"put [the duties of the library] in the hands of a library committee and such remained the official designation of the officers until acceptance of the present charter\". John Wells (1864\u20131875), Edwin O. Carter (1864-1800) and Simon G. Southworth were among the first committee of the library. From 1857 to 1864, George V. Wheelock was the elected librarian of the library. The first library catalogue was printed in 1859, with a supplement issued in 1866. In 1872 the library moved Cabot Hall to City Hall. A second catalogue was printed in 1875.\n\nIn 1879 the library committee began sending books to a second branch of the library in Union Hall, [[Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts|Chicopee Falls]], where Miss Gorton acted a librarian for the salary of twenty cents per week. In 1884 the library received US$500 to pay for the expansion of the Chicopee Falls branch into a room in Bray's building. The [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] donated approximately 300 books to Chicopee Falls, and additional books were donated by Chicopee Falls residents including Bilad B. Belcher. The Chicopee Falls branch continued to grow until it occupied a room in the Wildes Hotel, a store at the corner of Market and Church Streets, and then the basement of the George S. Taylor School.\n\nIn 1879 a reading room was opened in the evenings and used by the library. The reading book was a private subscription run by J.W. Cumnock, Rev. I. F. Porter, George A. Denison, A. F. Gaylord and [[William W. McClench]]. In May 1884, the townspeople of Chicopee voted to make the library free. Until that point, patrons had been charged an annual fee of fifty cents on the grounds that \"theoretically people are more appreciative of privileges if it costs something\". In 1888 the library outgrew its space in City Hall, and the library trustees issued a statement saying \"we feel justified in calling upon our public spirited citizens to unite and erect a public library building from private funds\". In 1890 Chicopee became a city and the rooms occupied by the library were needed for meetings of the city council. As a result, the building next to the library, which was the home of Jerome Wells, the first president of Chicopee Savings Bank (then Cabot Bank), was purchased and the library housed within. In 1899 an addition was made to the building which greatly enlarged the storage capacity.\n\nIn 1898 a branch was opened in Willimansett. However, this branch was not as extensively used as the Chicopee Falls branch and the Trustees report of 1913 highlights the low usage. In 1906 the Trustees transferred 1,000 books to the Chicopee Falls branch and 500 to the Willimansett branch, and a card catalogue was completed in the same year. 1910 saw another branch established in Fairview.\n\nIn 1907 Mrs. Spaulding, the wife of Justin Spaulding, founder of Spaulding, left US$20,000 in her will to the city for the construction of a new library. The plans for the new building in Market Square were drawn up by Kirkham & Parlet and the construction was completed by Denis Murphy and Patrick Rourke. The new library on the Market Square site was dedicated on May 13, 1913. The 1913 Trustees report stated that \"the trustees hope in the near future to enlarge the usefulness of the library by keeping the main building open every day from nine o'clock in the forenoon to nine o'clock in the evening and a part of a Sunday afternoon\".\n\n==The library today==\nOver time, the building built with the donations from Spaulding and others became too small as the population and the collection grew, and the once state-of-the-art facilities could not accommodate the technological needs of the new century. In response, planning began for a new public library building to meet the needs of the large community and the new century. On March 20, 2007, the Chicopee Public Library building in Market Square was closed and on May 22, 2004, during National Library Week, a new library building opened at 449 Front Street. The formal dedication was held on May 21, 2004; Mayor Richard R. Goyette and Lt. Gov. [[Kerry Healey]] addressed state legislators, trustees, friends of the library, supporters and regional library commissioners. Other speakers included John Krzeminski Jr, a representative of the Partyka family, who donated US$500,000 in the name of Emily Partyka to the \"Raise the Roof\" campaign for a new library.\n\nThe new US$9.3 million Front Street location houses the collection, now totalling over 100,000 items, and the {{convert|34000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility also provides room for the collection to grow.

Retrieved 2010-08-04</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn 1851, [[Massachusetts]] towns and cities were legally authorized to designate funds for libraries. On March 11, 1853, an article was issued \"to see if the town will take measures to establish and maintain a public library for the use of the inhabitants of the town and appropriate money therefore, as petitioned for by John Wells and others\".{{cn|date=September 2018}} The town accepted the article, establishing the first free public library in the Western part of the state. In 1853, 900 books were donated to the city by the Cabot Institute, a literary and social club of at least 150 members, including D.K. Pearson, a local doctor who also donated money to [[Mount Holyoke College]] for the building of Pearson's dormitory, and John Chase, who planned and built the dams to power the mills in Chicopee.\n\nIn 1863 library duties were performed by the [[town clerk]]s, among them J.R. Childs, William L. Bemis and Lester Dickinson. In 1864 the Town of Chicopee voted to \"put [the duties of the library] in the hands of a library committee and such remained the official designation of the officers until acceptance of the present charter\". John Wells (1864\u20131875), Edwin O. Carter (1864-1800) and Simon G. Southworth were among the first committee of the library. From 1857 to 1864, George V. Wheelock was the elected librarian of the library. The first library catalogue was printed in 1859, with a supplement issued in 1866. In 1872 the library moved Cabot Hall to City Hall. A second catalogue was printed in 1875.\n\nIn 1879 the library committee began sending books to a second branch of the library in Union Hall, [[Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts|Chicopee Falls]], where Miss Gorton acted a librarian for the salary of twenty cents per week. In 1884 the library received US$500 to pay for the expansion of the Chicopee Falls branch into a room in Bray's building. The [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] donated approximately 300 books to Chicopee Falls, and additional books were donated by Chicopee Falls residents including Bilad B. Belcher. The Chicopee Falls branch continued to grow until it occupied a room in the Wildes Hotel, a store at the corner of Market and Church Streets, and then the basement of the George S. Taylor School.\n\nIn 1879 a reading room was opened in the evenings and used by the library. The reading book was a private subscription run by J.W. Cumnock, Rev. I. F. Porter, George A. Denison, A. F. Gaylord and [[William W. McClench]]. In May 1884, the townspeople of Chicopee voted to make the library free. Until that point, patrons had been charged an annual fee of fifty cents on the grounds that \"theoretically people are more appreciative of privileges if it costs something\". In 1888 the library outgrew its space in City Hall, and the library trustees issued a statement saying \"we feel justified in calling upon our public spirited citizens to unite and erect a public library building from private funds\". In 1890 Chicopee became a city and the rooms occupied by the library were needed for meetings of the city council. As a result, the building next to the library, which was the home of Jerome Wells, the first president of Chicopee Savings Bank (then Cabot Bank), was purchased and the library housed within. In 1899 an addition was made to the building which greatly enlarged the storage capacity.\n\nIn 1898 a branch was opened in Willimansett. However, this branch was not as extensively used as the Chicopee Falls branch and the Trustees report of 1913 highlights the low usage. In 1906 the Trustees transferred 1,000 books to the Chicopee Falls branch and 500 to the Willimansett branch, and a card catalogue was completed in the same year. 1910 saw another branch established in Fairview.\n\nIn 1907 Mrs. Spaulding, the wife of Justin Spaulding, founder of Spaulding, left US$20,000 in her will to the city for the construction of a new library. The plans for the new building in Market Square were drawn up by Kirkham & Parlet and the construction was completed by Denis Murphy and Patrick Rourke. The new library on the Market Square site was dedicated on May 13, 1913. The 1913 Trustees report stated that \"the trustees hope in the near future to enlarge the usefulness of the library by keeping the main building open every day from nine o'clock in the forenoon to nine o'clock in the evening and a part of a Sunday afternoon\". \n\n==The library today==\nOver time, the building built with the donations from Spaulding and others became too small as the population and the collection grew, and the once state-of-the-art facilities could not accommodate the technological needs of the new century. In response, planning began for a new public library building to meet the needs of the large community and the new century. On March 20, 2007, the Chicopee Public Library building in Market Square was closed and on May 22, 2004, during National Library Week, a new library building opened at 449 Front Street. The formal dedication was held on May 21, 2004; Mayor Richard R. Goyette and Lt. Gov. [[Kerry Healey]] addressed state legislators, trustees, friends of the library, supporters and regional library commissioners. Other speakers included John Krzeminski Jr, a representative of the Partyka family, who donated US$500,000 in the name of Emily Partyka to the \"Raise the Roof\" campaign for a new library.\n\nThe new US$9.3 million Front Street location houses the collection, now totalling over 100,000 items, and the {{convert|34000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility also provides room for the collection to grow. The library has two levels with a local history room, as well as a quiet study room, a computer lab for classes, and a community room that can seat over 150 people. It is handicap accessible and has increased parking space compared to the previous building. The library is open 9am-9pm Monday-Thursday, 9-5pm Friday, and is only closed weekends during the summer.<ref>[http://www.chicopeepubliclibrary.org/hrs_dir.html Hours and Directions]</ref> The trustees are the managers of the library according to the current charter. \n\nLibrary services include: [[interlibrary loan]] with the whole of Massachusetts; lending of museum passes, as well as DVDs, [[Playaway]]s, VHS, CDs, books, magazines, and newspapers; virtual reference with Meebo from the Chicopee Library Staff; access to electronic databases; [[eBooks]], eAudiobooks, and eVideos from C/W MARS; and computer skills and programming classes for adults, children, and young adults.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chicopeepubliclibrary.org The Chicopee Public Library]\n*[http://www.chicopeema.gov/ City of Chicopee]\n*[http://www.wmrls.org Western Massachusetts Regional Library System]\n*[http://www.cwmars.org/ Central & Western Massachusetts Regional System]\n*[http://mblc.state.ma.us/ Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners]\n\n{{coord|42.1486|-72.6007|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Chicopee, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Public libraries in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Libraries in Hampden County, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Education in Chicopee, Massachusetts]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicopee_Public_Library"}
