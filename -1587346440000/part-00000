His doctoral thesis concerned the measurement of [[anaerobic threshold]] in the sport of running.\n\nFerrari was a consultant to the Italian Track and Field Federation ([[Federazione Italiana di Atletica Leggera|FIDAL]]) from 1977 to 1980. He became a specialist in sports medicine at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] in 1981.\nHe was co-author of more than 20 papers in journals of sports physiology. He studied parameters of athletes in a variety of sports, such as track and field, cycling, swimming, skiing, and speed-skating. Subsequently, until 1983, he was the sports physician of the National Italian Biathlon team ([[Federazione Italiana Sport Invernali|FISI]]).\n\nEventually he settled on his lifelong interest in the development of training programmes for professional cyclists. One of Ferrari's earliest successes was coaching [[Francesco Moser]] to achieve the [[hour record]] in 1984, crushing [[Eddy Merckx]]'s mark by more than a mile.\n\nInitially Ferrari worked with Professor [[Francesco Conconi]] at the University of Ferrara, who developed testing techniques for human performance, using methods such as monitoring the heart rate during exercise and recovery. Another controversial Italian doctor, [[Luigi Cecchini]], is their common disciple. They have shared the care for some cyclists throughout their careers.\n\nFrom 1984 onwards, Ferrari achieved extraordinary improvements in the fitness of many cyclists. Ferrari popularised the use of [[VAM (bicycling)|VAM]], a parameter now used in cycling as a measure of fitness and speed.\n\n===Cycling team doctor and increasing prominence===\n\nIn 1994, Ferrari was the team doctor for [[Gewiss]]. The team had an excellent season, winning many races. In the [[Fl\u00e8che Wallonne]], the team realized a historic triple victory. Concerned by the domination of the Italian team, some observers pointed a finger of suspicion at the team doctor. Far from calming this controversy, Ferrari compared [[erythropoietin]] to [[orange juice]]. \"EPO is not dangerous, it's the abuse that is. It's also dangerous to drink 10 liters of orange juice\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/riders/2003/interviews/?id=ferrari03b |title=An Interview With Dr. Michele Ferrari, part two |publisher=Cyclingnews.com |accessdate=2008-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728021254/http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/riders/2003/interviews/?id=ferrari03b |archivedate=2009-07-28 }}</ref> This statement cost him his job as team physician.

In 1909, the name changed to the Musconetcong Fire Company and then later to the Hampton Fire Company.  The fire company built the current Borough Hall/Fire House for the borough in 1951.  The Borough occupied the east side of the building and the fire company used the west side.  In 1981, the fire company expanded the building by adding a second floor for borough use and the Fire Company took over the entire lower floor.<ref>[https://hamptonfire.webs.com/history.htm History], Hampton Fire Company No. 1.

There are over 40 active members on the rolls which includes an active Junior Firefighter program for young people age 14 and over.\n\n;Emergency Squad\n\nIn 1955, the Hampton Fire Company selected one of its members, Gilbert Riddle, to organize an emergency squad.  With the backing of the Fire Company, the present squad became operational in 1956.  The Fire Company purchased the first ambulance, which was housed in the firehouse until the squad's permanent facilities were completed.  On August 6, 1966 the dedication of the permanent home of the Emergency Squad took place. The Hampton Emergency Squad incorporated itself in 1976, becoming independent of the Fire Company, however its name did not change.  In January 1978, the squad established an auxiliary membership.  This membership is made up of people who wish to help the Hampton Fire Company Emergency Squad in its endeavors to provide the finest in first aid protection. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}} A new GMC rescue truck was purchased in 1978.  It was specially equipped with four-wheel drive and quartz spotlights for better lighting during accidents and fires.  The rescue truck is still in service with the fire company today. The old 1968 Cadillac ambulance was replaced in 1982 by a Braun ambulance, and was later used as a service vehicle.  A [[Ford Horton]] ambulance was purchased in 1987, and in 1992 another Ford Horton ambulance was added. An additional bay was added to the building in 1979 to provide storage of emergency vehicles and equipment.  The Hampton Emergency Squad dedicated their building to the memory of Charles Tampier and William Deemer in 1982 in recognition of their exceptional service to our squad and community.  Construction of the second story addition began in September 1985.  After many long hours of planning sessions, the building committee and the community saw the fruits of their labor come to completion in 1986.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The members of the Hampton Emergency Squad are committed to providing the latest in pre-hospital emergency medical care to the community.

In 1909, the name changed to the Musconetcong Fire Company and then later to the Hampton Fire Company.  The fire company built the current Borough Hall/Fire House for the borough in 1951.  The Borough occupied the east side of the building and the fire company used the west side.  In 1981, the fire company expanded the building by adding a second floor for borough use and the Fire Company took over the entire lower floor.<ref>[https://hamptonfire.webs.com/history.htm History], Hampton Fire Company No. 1. Accessed August 14, 2018.</ref>\n\nThe Fire Company currently has as active apparatuses a 1959 International Harvester fire engine, a 1987 Emergency One Fire Engine, a 2000 Pierce Fire Engine, a 1995 Chevy Suburban command vehicle, and a 1978 GMC Rescue Truck.  There are over 40 active members on the rolls which includes an active Junior Firefighter program for young people age 14 and over.\n\n;Emergency Squad\n\nIn 1955, the Hampton Fire Company selected one of its members, Gilbert Riddle, to organize an emergency squad.  With the backing of the Fire Company, the present squad became operational in 1956.  The Fire Company purchased the first ambulance, which was housed in the firehouse until the squad's permanent facilities were completed.  On August 6, 1966 the dedication of the permanent home of the Emergency Squad took place. The Hampton Emergency Squad incorporated itself in 1976, becoming independent of the Fire Company, however its name did not change.  In January 1978, the squad established an auxiliary membership.  This membership is made up of people who wish to help the Hampton Fire Company Emergency Squad in its endeavors to provide the finest in first aid protection. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}} A new GMC rescue truck was purchased in 1978.  It was specially equipped with four-wheel drive and quartz spotlights for better lighting during accidents and fires.  The rescue truck is still in service with the fire company today. The old 1968 Cadillac ambulance was replaced in 1982 by a Braun ambulance, and was later used as a service vehicle.  A [[Ford Horton]] ambulance was purchased in 1987, and in 1992 another Ford Horton ambulance was added. An additional bay was added to the building in 1979 to provide storage of emergency vehicles and equipment.  The Hampton Emergency Squad dedicated their building to the memory of Charles Tampier and William Deemer in 1982 in recognition of their exceptional service to our squad and community.  Construction of the second story addition began in September 1985.  After many long hours of planning sessions, the building committee and the community saw the fruits of their labor come to completion in 1986.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The members of the Hampton Emergency Squad are committed to providing the latest in pre-hospital emergency medical care to the community.  All members are certified Emergency Medical Technicians who continuously train and refresh their skills through drills and classroom experience.

It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire]], and [[Wei Yuan]], a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from ''Zhongguo'', which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"[[China proper]]\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country.

The phrase ''Tianchao'' continues to see use on Chinese internet discussion boards, in reference to China.<ref name=tianchao/>\n\nThe phrase ''Tianchao'' was first translated into English and French in the early 19th century, appearing in foreign publicans and diplomatic correspondences,<ref name=mailt>{{cite web|url=https://mailtribune.com/archive/-celestial-origins-come-from-long-ago-in-chinese-history|title='Celestial' origins come from long ago in Chinese history|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=25 November 2019|work=Mail Tribune|publisher=Rosebud Media LLC}}</ref> with the translated phrase \"Celestial Empire\" occasionally used to refer to China. During this period, the term ''celestial'' was used by some to refer to the subjects of the [[Qing dynasty]] in a non-prejudicial manner,<ref name=mailt/> derived from the term \"Celestial Empire\". However, the term ''celestial'' was also used in a pejorative manner during the 19th century, in reference to Chinese immigrants in Australasia and North America.<ref name=mailt/> The translated phrase has largely fallen into disuse in the 20th century.\n\nTranslations for ''Tianxia'' include:\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f (''Podneb\u00e9snaya''; lit. \"under the heaven\")\n\n=== Jiangshan ===\n''Jiangshan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n}}) literally means \"rivers and mountains\". This term is quite similar in usage to ''Tianxia'', and simply refers to the entire world, and here the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age. It was during the Tang Dynasty that South China was finally and fully [[Sinicized]]; Tang would become synonymous with China in Southern China and it is usually Southern Chinese who refer to themselves as \"''People of Tang''\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510\u4eba}}}}, {{zh|p=T\u00e1ngr\u00e9n}}).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbDdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=China: A Cultural and Historical Dictionary |first= Michael|last= Dillon |date=13 September 2013 |page=132 |isbn=9781136791413 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> For example, the sinicization and rapid development of [[Guangdong]] during the Tang period would lead the Cantonese to refer to themselves as ''Tong-yan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510\u4eba}}}}) in Cantonese, while China is called ''Tong-saan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510\u5c71}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ngsh\u0101n|l=Tang Mountain|links=no}}).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZjruI0_XmcC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions|author= H.

In certain contexts, it is equivalent to the term ''Neidi'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5185\u5730}}; {{zh|p=n\u00e8id\u00ec}}, literally \"the inner land\"). While ''Neidi'' generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\nThe term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the

An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; Books\n* {{cite book |title = Grounds of Judgment: Extraterritoriality and Imperial Power in Nineteenth-Century China and Japan |first = Par Kristoffer |last=Cassel |volume= |edition= |year = 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qlJpAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0199792122 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Chinas religionen ...|first=Rudolf |last=Dvo\u0159\u00e1k |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition=illustrated |year=1895 |publisher = Aschendorff (Druck und Verlag der Aschendorffschen Buchhandlung) |url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0199792054 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = New Qing Imperial History: The Making of Inner Asian Empire at Qing Chengde |first1=Ruth W. |last1=Dunnell |first2=Mark C. |last2=Elliott |first3=Philippe |last3=Foret |first4=James A |last4=Millward |volume=|edition=|year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |url = https://books.google.com/?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 1134362226 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|first=Mark C. |last=Elliott |volume=|edition=illustrated, reprint|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0804746842 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Mandschusprache |first = Erich |last= Hauer |editor-first = Oliver |editor-last = Corff |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition = illustrated |year = 2007 |publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |url = https://books.google.com/?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-3447055284 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |first = Joseph |last= Esherick |chapter=How the Qing Became China |title =Empire to Nation: Historical Perspectives on the Making of the Modern World |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2006 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title = China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia |first=Peter C. |last=Perdue |volume= |edition=reprint |year=2009 |publisher = Harvard University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0674042025 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Geoff |url = http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp188_yelang_china.pdf |title = The Polity of Yelang and the Origin of the Name 'China' |journal = Sino-Platonic Papers |volume = 188 |date = May 2009 |accessdate= 4 October 2011 |ref=harv}} \n*{{citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion|year=2012 |title=Chinese History: A New Manual |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute }}\n* {{cite book |last = Wilkinson |first = Endymion |year = 2015 |title = Chinese History: A New Manual, 4th edition |publisher = Harvard University Asia Center distributed by Harvard University Press |location = Cambridge, MA |isbn = 9780674088467 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Die Eroberung von Qinghai unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Tibet und Khams 1717 -

It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire]], and [[Wei Yuan]], a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from ''Zhongguo'', which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"[[China proper]]\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as ''Zhongguo'' (see the discussion below).<ref>{{harvp|Esherick|2006|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n''Dulimbai Gurun'' is the Manchu name for China.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&pg=PA117&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iT7tUsrhM4bhyQH_04HYBg&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Hauer 2007], p. 117.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA80&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-0PtUoKZEKWgyAH8oIHgBQ&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Dvo\u0159\u00e1k 1895], p. 80.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqVug_wN4hEC&pg=PA102&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m0PtUtv-OIOTyQHX8YCwAQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Wu 1995], p. 102.</ref> The historian Zhao Gang writes that \"not long after the collapse of the Ming, China [Zhongguo] became the equivalent of Great Qing (Da Qing)\u2014another official title of the Qing state\", and  \"Qing and China became interchangeable official titles, and the latter often appeared as a substitute for the former in official documents.\"{{sfnb|Zhao|2006| p = 7}}  The Qing dynasty referred to their realm as \"''Dulimbai Gurun''\" in Manchu.

This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world.

However, the term ''celestial'' was also used in a pejorative manner during the 19th century, in reference to Chinese immigrants in Australasia and North America.<ref name=mailt/> The translated phrase has largely fallen into disuse in the 20th century.\n\nTranslations for ''Tianxia'' include:\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f (''Podneb\u00e9snaya''; lit. \"under the heaven\")\n\n=== Jiangshan ===\n''Jiangshan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n}}) literally means \"rivers and mountains\". This term is quite similar in usage to ''Tianxia'', and simply refers to the entire world, and here the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age.

While ''Neidi'' generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, which eventually became '''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3''' (see below), known in English as the \"People's Republic of China\". This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the [[Cold War]] as \"'''Communist China'''\" or \"Red China\" to distinguish it from the [[Republic of China]] which is commonly called \"Taiwan\", \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, \"China\" is often used to refer to [[mainland China]] to the exclusion of Hong Kong, [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nThe official name of

''Chinese History: A Manual.'' p. 32.</ref> With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of [[Taiwan]] and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"'''[[Taiwan]]'''\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See [[Taiwan Independence]].) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the [[Cold War]], the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u532a\u5340}}) by the ROC).

Martin, ''Dagur Mongolian Grammar, Texts, and Lexicon'', Indiana University Publications Uralic and Altaic Series, Vol. 4, 1961</ref> As in the case of the Manchu language, the Daur word ''Niaken'' is essentially an ethnonym, and the proper way to refer to the country of the Han Chinese (i.e., \"China\" in a cultural sense) is ''Niaken gurun'', while ''niakendaaci-'' is a verb meaning \"to talk in Chinese.\"\n\n===Kara===\nJapanese: ''Kara'' ({{lang|ja|\u304b\u3089}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n;
