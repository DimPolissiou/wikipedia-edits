Garfield|Garfield]] died 79 days later on September 19, 1881. He was shot by [[Charles J. Guiteau]] at the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and died in [[Elberon, New Jersey]]. Guiteau's motive was revenge against Garfield for an imagined political debt.\n\n== Assassination ==\n\n=== Background === \n[[File:CharlesJGuiteau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles J. Guiteau, President James A. Garfield's assassin]]\nCharles Guiteau turned to politics after failing in several ventures, including theology, a law practice, bill collecting, and time in the utopian [[Oneida Community]].<ref>{{harvp|Addams|2009|pp=26\u201327}}</ref> Former President [[Ulysses S.

The result was that Guiteau appeared to give Garfield credit for accomplishments that he had originally ascribed to Grant, yet he convinced himself that his speech was largely responsible for Garfield's narrow victory over Democratic nominee [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].<ref name=\"harvp|Millard|2011|pp=106\u2013107\">{{harvp|Millard|2011|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref> Guiteau believed he should be awarded a diplomatic post for his supposedly vital assistance, first asking for a consulship in [[Vienna]], then expressing a willingness to \"settle\" for one in [[Paris]].<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=588\u2013589}}</ref> He loitered around Republican headquarters in New York City during the winter of 1880\u20131881, expecting rewards for his speech, but to no avail.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=588}}</ref>\n\nGuiteau arrived in Washington on March 5, 1881, the day after [[Inauguration of James A.

Also, Bliss had supplanted Garfield's physician [[Jedediah Hyde Baxter]]. Bliss and the other doctors who attended Garfield had guessed wrong about the path of the bullet in his body; they had probed rightward into his back instead of leftward, missing the location of the bullet but creating a new channel which filled with pus. The autopsy discovered this error and revealed pneumonia in both lungs and a body that was filled with pus due to uncontrolled [[sepsis]].<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|pp=312\u2013313}}</ref> The conventional narrative in regards to James A. Garfield's post-shooting medical condition was challenged by Theodore Pappas and Shahrzad Joharifard in a 2013 article of theirs in the [[American Journal of Surgery]], where they argued that Garfield died from a late rupture of a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (that initially developed shortly after Guiteau's shooting of Garfield, thus preventing Garfield from bleeding to death immediately after he was shot by Guiteau but instead allowing him to live for an additional 80 days) and that the symptoms that Garfield suffered in the last couple of months of his life were actually caused by acute [[cholecystitis]], a condition that these authors speculate (based on Garfield's [[autopsy]] report) that Garfield developed as a result of his doctors accidentally puncturing his [[bladder]] in July 1881, specifically three or four weeks after he was shot by Guiteau--thus causing the decline in Garfield's condition that was visible starting from July 23, 1881.<ref>[https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(13)00297-3/abstract]</ref>\n\nChester Arthur was at his home in New York City when word came the night of September 19 that Garfield had died. He said, \"I hope\u2014my God, I do hope it is a mistake\", but confirmation by telegram came soon after. Arthur was [[Inauguration of Chester A. Arthur|inaugurated]] early in the morning on September 20, and he took the presidential oath of office from [[John R. Brady]], a New York Supreme Court judge. Arthur then left for Long Branch to pay his respects to Mrs. Garfield before going on to Washington.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=608}}</ref>\n\nGarfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] before being taken to [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], where the funeral was held on September 26.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=608\u2013609}}</ref>\n\n== Trial and execution ==\nGuiteau went on trial in November,<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=321}}</ref> represented by his brother-in-law George Scolville. He received ample media attention during his trial for his bizarre behavior, including constantly insulting his defense team, formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He claimed that he was not guilty because Garfield's murder was the will of God and he was only an instrument of it.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=173}}</ref> He sang \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" to the court.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=136}}</ref> He dictated an autobiography to the ''[[New York Herald]]'', ending it with a personal ad for a nice Christian lady under 30.<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=250}}</ref> He was oblivious to the American public's outrage and hatred of him, even after he was almost killed twice himself\u2014once while in prison, and again while being transported there. At one point, he argued that Garfield was killed not by him but by medical malpractice: \"I deny the killing, if your honor please. We admit the shooting.\"<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=322}}</ref> He was housed at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C. throughout the trial and up until his execution.\n\n[[File:SheetMusicCoverPrezGarfieldsFuneralMarch1881.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Funeral music written in Garfield's honor]]\nGuiteau's trial was one of the first high-profile cases in the United States where the insanity defense was considered.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=175}}</ref> Guiteau vehemently insisted that he had been legally insane at the time of the shooting, but he was not really medically insane, which caused a major rift with his defense lawyers, and which probably contributed to the jury's impression that Guiteau was merely trying to deny responsibility.\n\n[[File:MourningRibbonUSPresidentJamesAGarfieldDeath1881.jpg|thumb|upright|Silk mourning ribbon]]\nGuiteau was actively making plans to start a lecture tour after his release and to run for president himself in 1884; at the same time, he delighted in the media circus surrounding his trial.

Garfield himself had called for civil service reform in his inaugural address<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=540}}</ref> and supported it as President in the belief that it would make government more efficient.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=551\u2013553}}</ref> It was passed as something of a memorial to the fallen President.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=610}}</ref> Arthur lost the Republican Party nomination in 1884 to Blaine, who went on to lose a [[1884 United States presidential election|close election]] to Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]].\n\nThe Sixth Street rail station was later demolished. The site is now occupied by the West Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]]. No plaque or memorial marks the spot where Garfield was shot,<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=159}}</ref> but a few blocks away, a Garfield memorial statue stands on the southwest corner of the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe question of Presidential disability was not addressed. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, section 1, clause 6]] of the Constitution says that in case of the \"Inability [of the President] to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President\", but gives no further instruction on what constitutes inability or how the President's inability should be determined. Garfield had lain on his sickbed for 80 days without performing any of the duties of his office except for the signing of an extradition paper, but this did not prove to be a difficulty because in the 19th century the federal government effectively shut down for the summer regardless. During Garfield's ordeal, the Congress was not in session and there was little for a President to do. Blaine suggested the Cabinet declare Arthur acting President, but this option was rejected by all, including Arthur, who did not wish to be perceived as grasping for power.<ref name=\"Peskin 604\" /><ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=171}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Garfield Tea House.jpg|thumb|The Garfield Tea House in October 2007]]\nCongress did not deal with the problem of what to do if a President were alive but incapacitated as Garfield was, nor did the Congress take up the question 38 years later, when [[Woodrow Wilson]] suffered a [[stroke]] that put him in a [[coma]] for days and left him partially paralyzed and blind in one eye for the last year and a half of his presidency. It was not until the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to do if the president became incapacitated.\n\nLincoln's assassination had taken place roughly 16 years before in the closing stages of the Civil War. On the other hand, Garfield's term was marked (for the most part) by peacetime, and a general complacency with respect to presidential security had developed by this time. Garfield, like many other presidents, often preferred to interact directly with the public, and although some form of security was almost certainly in place, a comprehensive security detail had not been seriously considered by either Congress or the president up to that point. Remarkably, it would not be until the [[assassination of William McKinley]] some twenty years later that Congress would finally task the [[United States Secret Service]] (founded to prevent counterfeiting) with the responsibility of ensuring the president's personal safety.<ref>{{cite book | author = President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Guiteau, President James A.

The result was that Guiteau appeared to give Garfield credit for accomplishments that he had originally ascribed to Grant, yet he convinced himself that his speech was largely responsible for Garfield's narrow victory over Democratic nominee [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].<ref name=\"harvp|Millard|2011|pp=106\u2013107\">{{harvp|Millard|2011|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref> Guiteau believed he should be awarded a diplomatic post for his supposedly vital assistance, first asking for a consulship in [[Vienna]], then expressing a willingness to \"settle\" for one in [[Paris]].<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=588\u2013589}}</ref> He loitered around Republican headquarters in New York City during the winter of 1880\u20131881, expecting rewards for his speech, but to no avail.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=588}}</ref>\n\nGuiteau arrived in Washington on March 5, 1881, the day after [[Inauguration of James A.

Blaine]]; Secretary of War [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] waited at the station to see him off.<ref name=\"Vowell 160\" /> Garfield had no bodyguard or security detail; early Presidents did not employ them, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln during the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"Peskin 593\" />\n\nAs Garfield entered the station's waiting room, Guiteau stepped forward and shot the president at point-blank range from behind. Garfield cried out, \"My God, what is that?\", flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again, and Garfield collapsed.<ref name=\"Peskin 596\">{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=596}}</ref> The first bullet grazed the President's shoulder, and the other struck him in the back, passing the first lumbar vertebra but missing the spinal cord before coming to rest behind his pancreas.<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|pp=189, 312}}</ref> Guiteau put his pistol back in his pocket and turned to leave via a cab that he had waiting for him outside the station, but he collided with policeman Patrick Kearney who was entering the station after hearing the gunfire.\n\nKearney apprehended Guiteau and was so excited at having arrested the man who had shot Garfield that he neglected to take his gun from him until after they arrived at the police station.<ref>{{cite web |title=Garfield II: A Lengthy Demise |url=http://www.historyhouse.com/in_history/garfield/ |publisher=History House |access-date=April 25, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222214321/http://www.historyhouse.com/in_history/garfield|archive-date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> Kearney demanded, \"In God's name, man, what did you shoot the president for?\" Guiteau did not respond. The rapidly gathering crowd screamed, \"Lynch him\", but Kearney and several other police officers took the assassin to the police station a few blocks away.<ref name=\"Peskin 596\" /> As he surrendered to authorities, Guiteau uttered the exulting words, repeated everywhere: \"I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts! I did it, and I want to be arrested! [[Chester A.

Chester A. Arthur, a Conkling ally, had been selected as Garfield's running mate to placate the Stalwart faction.

Also, Bliss had supplanted Garfield's physician [[Jedediah Hyde Baxter]]. Bliss and the other doctors who attended Garfield had guessed wrong about the path of the bullet in his body; they had probed rightward into his back instead of leftward, missing the location of the bullet but creating a new channel which filled with pus. The autopsy discovered this error and revealed pneumonia in both lungs and a body that was filled with pus due to uncontrolled [[sepsis]].<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|pp=312\u2013313}}</ref> The conventional narrative in regards to James A. Garfield's post-shooting medical condition was challenged by Theodore Pappas and Shahrzad Joharifard in a 2013 article of theirs in the [[American Journal of Surgery]], where they argued that Garfield died from a late rupture of a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (that initially developed shortly after Guiteau's shooting of Garfield, thus preventing Garfield from bleeding to death immediately after he was shot by Guiteau but instead allowing him to live for an additional 80 days) and that the symptoms that Garfield suffered in the last couple of months of his life were actually caused by acute [[cholecystitis]], a condition that these authors speculate (based on Garfield's [[autopsy]] report) that Garfield developed as a result of his doctors accidentally puncturing his [[bladder]] in July 1881, specifically three or four weeks after he was shot by Guiteau--thus causing the decline in Garfield's condition that was visible starting from July 23, 1881.<ref>[https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(13)00297-3/abstract]</ref>\n\nChester Arthur was at his home in New York City when word came the night of September 19 that Garfield had died. He said, \"I hope\u2014my God, I do hope it is a mistake\", but confirmation by telegram came soon after. Arthur was [[Inauguration of Chester A. Arthur|inaugurated]] early in the morning on September 20, and he took the presidential oath of office from [[John R. Brady]], a New York Supreme Court judge. Arthur then left for Long Branch to pay his respects to Mrs. Garfield before going on to Washington.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=608}}</ref>\n\nGarfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] before being taken to [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], where the funeral was held on September 26.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=608\u2013609}}</ref>\n\n== Trial and execution ==\nGuiteau went on trial in November,<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=321}}</ref> represented by his brother-in-law George Scolville. He received ample media attention during his trial for his bizarre behavior, including constantly insulting his defense team, formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He claimed that he was not guilty because Garfield's murder was the will of God and he was only an instrument of it.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=173}}</ref> He sang \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" to the court.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=136}}</ref> He dictated an autobiography to the ''[[New York Herald]]'', ending it with a personal ad for a nice Christian lady under 30.<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=250}}</ref> He was oblivious to the American public's outrage and hatred of him, even after he was almost killed twice himself\u2014once while in prison, and again while being transported there. At one point, he argued that Garfield was killed not by him but by medical malpractice: \"I deny the killing, if your honor please. We admit the shooting.\"<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=322}}</ref> He was housed at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C. throughout the trial and up until his execution.\n\n[[File:SheetMusicCoverPrezGarfieldsFuneralMarch1881.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Funeral music written in Garfield's honor]]\nGuiteau's trial was one of the first high-profile cases in the United States where the insanity defense was considered.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=175}}</ref> Guiteau vehemently insisted that he had been legally insane at the time of the shooting, but he was not really medically insane, which caused a major rift with his defense lawyers, and which probably contributed to the jury's impression that Guiteau was merely trying to deny responsibility.\n\n[[File:MourningRibbonUSPresidentJamesAGarfieldDeath1881.jpg|thumb|upright|Silk mourning ribbon]]\nGuiteau was actively making plans to start a lecture tour after his release and to run for president himself in 1884; at the same time, he delighted in the media circus surrounding his trial. He was dismayed when the jury was unconvinced of his divine inspiration, convicting him of the murder. He was found guilty on January 25, 1882.<ref>\"Guiteau Found Guilty,\" New York Times. January 26, 1882, p. 1</ref> He appealed, but his appeal was rejected, and he was hanged on June 30, 1882, in the District of Columbia.

Garfield himself had called for civil service reform in his inaugural address<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=540}}</ref> and supported it as President in the belief that it would make government more efficient.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=551\u2013553}}</ref> It was passed as something of a memorial to the fallen President.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=610}}</ref> Arthur lost the Republican Party nomination in 1884 to Blaine, who went on to lose a [[1884 United States presidential election|close election]] to Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]].\n\nThe Sixth Street rail station was later demolished. The site is now occupied by the West Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]]. No plaque or memorial marks the spot where Garfield was shot,<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=159}}</ref> but a few blocks away, a Garfield memorial statue stands on the southwest corner of the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe question of Presidential disability was not addressed. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, section 1, clause 6]] of the Constitution says that in case of the \"Inability [of the President] to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President\", but gives no further instruction on what constitutes inability or how the President's inability should be determined. Garfield had lain on his sickbed for 80 days without performing any of the duties of his office except for the signing of an extradition paper, but this did not prove to be a difficulty because in the 19th century the federal government effectively shut down for the summer regardless. During Garfield's ordeal, the Congress was not in session and there was little for a President to do. Blaine suggested the Cabinet declare Arthur acting President, but this option was rejected by all, including Arthur, who did not wish to be perceived as grasping for power.<ref name=\"Peskin 604\" /><ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=171}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Garfield Tea House.jpg|thumb|The Garfield Tea House in October 2007]]\nCongress did not deal with the problem of what to do if a President were alive but incapacitated as Garfield was, nor did the Congress take up the question 38 years later, when [[Woodrow Wilson]] suffered a [[stroke]] that put him in a [[coma]] for days and left him partially paralyzed and blind in one eye for the last year and a half of his presidency. It was not until the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to do if the president became incapacitated.\n\nLincoln's assassination had taken place roughly 16 years before in the closing stages of the Civil War. On the other hand, Garfield's term was marked (for the most part) by peacetime, and a general complacency with respect to presidential security had developed by this time. Garfield, like many other presidents, often preferred to interact directly with the public, and although some form of security was almost certainly in place, a comprehensive security detail had not been seriously considered by either Congress or the president up to that point. Remarkably, it would not be until the [[assassination of William McKinley]] some twenty years later that Congress would finally task the [[United States Secret Service]] (founded to prevent counterfeiting) with the responsibility of ensuring the president's personal safety.<ref>{{cite book | author = President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

The song was performed by the Greek-Albanian singer [[Eleni Foureira]], who had previously attempted to represent [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]].\n\nThe Cypriot entry for the 2018 contest in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] was originally planned to be selected through a televised national final by the country's public broadcasting service [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]] (CyBC) with half the points being given by a televote and the other half a jury vote, but this aspect was discarded in January 2018 and the broadcaster opted to choose the artist via an internal selection. Foureira was announced as the singer who would represent Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 on 1 February, and her song \"Fuego\" and the accompanying music video premiered on the CyBC evening news bulletin on 2 March. Foureira travelled to [[Stockholm]] in mid-April to prepare for the competition in Lisbon by meeting and working with her dancers.\n\nCyprus was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 8 May 2018. Performing as the closing entry of the show in position 19, \"Fuego\" was announced among the top 10 entries and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 12 May.

with the song \"[[Fuego (Eleni Foureira song)|Fuego]]\" written by [[Alex P]]apaconstantinou, Gerlado Sandell, Viktor Svensson, [[Anderz Wrethov]] and Didrick. The song was performed by the Greek-Albanian singer [[Eleni Foureira]], who had previously attempted to represent [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]] in the Eurovision Song Contest in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 edition]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 competition]].\n\nThe Cypriot entry for the 2018 contest in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] was originally planned to be selected through a televised national final by the country's public broadcasting service [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]] (CyBC) with half the points being given by a televote and the other half a jury vote, but this aspect was discarded in January 2018 and the broadcaster opted to choose the artist via an internal selection. Foureira was announced as the singer who would represent Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 on 1 February, and her song \"Fuego\" and the accompanying music video premiered on the CyBC evening news bulletin on 2 March. Foureira travelled to [[Stockholm]] in mid-April to prepare for the competition in Lisbon by meeting and working with her dancers.\n\nCyprus was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 8 May 2018. Performing as the closing entry of the show in position 19, \"Fuego\" was announced among the top 10 entries and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 12 May. It was later revealed that Cyprus placed second out of eighteen participating countries in the first semi-final with 262 points. In the final, Cyprus performed second-to-last in position twenty-five and received 436 points, finishing as runners-up to [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018|Israel]] in the island nation's best ever result of its Eurovision Song Contest history.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|2=Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest}}Prior to the 2018 contest, Cyprus had participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] thirty-four times since the island country made its debut in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981 contest]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2017/08/03/cyprus-songwriter-internal-selection/|title=Cyprus: Broadcaster reportedly will internally select songwriter for 2018|last=Gallagher|first=Robyn|date=3 August 2017|publisher=[[Wiwibloggs]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024120014/https://wiwibloggs.com/2017/08/03/cyprus-songwriter-internal-selection/|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live|access-date=22 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Its best placing was fifth, which it achieved three times: in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982 competition]] with the song \"[[Mono I Agapi]]\" performed by [[Anna Vissi]], in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997 edition]] with \"[[Mana Mou]]\" performed by Hara and Andreas Constantinou, and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 contest]] with \"[[Stronger Every Minute]]\" performed by [[Lisa Andreas]].

This was the first feature film role for star [[James Naughton]], who portrays a [[stock broker]] whose new jogging hobby turns into an obsession to excel at [[long distance running]], straining his career and his relationship with his wife ([[Lindsay Wagner]]).\n\nThe film is Shebib's fourth feature. Commercially unsuccessful, reviews of ''Second Wind'' were mixed, tending to praise the cinematography and acting, but usually faulting the script. ''Second Wind'' won a [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] award and two [[Canadian Screen Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nRoger Mathieson ([[James Naughton]]) is a 30-year-old stockbroker for whom everything has come easily. One day, he sees a TV report about a 26-year's old running champion and listens intently to remarks from that athlete's coach. Inspired, Mathieson begins jogging, soon discovering he's not in great shape\u2014yet Mathieson persists, fascinated by the notion of trying something difficult for the first time in his life. He trains obsessively to be a winner. This creates friction with his wife, Linda ([[Lindsay Wagner]]), who does not understand why her husband prefers spending time alone to spending time with her. His new hobby also creates problems at work, distracted when he should be focused on a major deal, allowing an ambitious coworker to usurp his stature as the firm's golden boy.

Walsh hails the direction, the script, the cinematography and especially the cast, who are \"little-known but solidly professional performers who put it across to near perfection\", reserving particular praise for Naughton. \"Shebib provides him with top direction and solid support in all departments. Cameraman Reginald Morris\u2019s cinematography is slick and sophisticated. Hagood Hardy\u2019s inspired musical score knows just when to shut up and when to come on strong.\" And writer Hal Ackerman \"skillfully steers a course between plot excesses and banality\".<ref name=\"Walsh\" /> Six years later, Walsh reaffirmed that ''Second Wind'' was \"a finely-wrought film\" and considered it \"the precursor\" of films such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982) and ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=Secret too good to keep |url=http://reelingback.com/articles/secret_too_good_to_keep |website=Reeling Back |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nClive Denton, while less effusive, nevertheless also praised the film for its music, cinematography and direction, calling the script \"well-structured\", and \"often sharp and witty\", though he felt there was some \"sketchiness\" to the family relationship, saying the script is \"below its best level\" with the wife and the son seems like a \"perky little visitor\" rather than their own child.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Clive |title=Don Shebib's Second Wind |journal=Cinema Canada |date=April 1976 |pages= 53\u201354 |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/547/619 |accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> [[Marni Jackson]] thought the story was \"a good idea\" and called the film \"dutifully pretty,\" but called the characters \"so diaphanous you can see daylight through them,\" concluding the project suffered from a low budget, \"which says more about the Canadian film-making climate than Shebib.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Maurice \u00c9lia echoed many of Jackson's impressions: the story itself is quite original and a source of inspiration in some sense, and, for the first time (on the screen or off), Toronto actually looks good (perhaps to the point of exaggeration).<ref name=\"Elia\" /> The film begins well, but loses its way due to an ineptly written script littered with the kind of dialogue which undermines the credibility of the supporting characters: Paula is a sketch at best and the couple's son barely exists at all; even Lindsay Wagner's character is effectively a secondary character made up of unacceptable rejoinders.<ref name=\"Elia\" />\n\nJohn Reeves said that ''Second Wind'' is well filmed and acted, but likewise faulted the script as unbelievable: the film does not accurately show the realities of training for competition, and thereby relegates itself to the realm of [[melodrama]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reeves |first1=John |title=The soup opera route |journal=Cinema Canada |date=May 1976 |issue= 28 |pages= 22\u201323}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5, calling it an \"innocuous saga,\" and faulting it for not explaining why the protagonist \"refuses to explain the character of his obsession to his wife.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Wind |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/second-wind/review/117081/ |website=TV Guide |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Retrospective====\nPeter Hanson describes ''Second Wind'' as \"amiably predictable\", a kind of cinematic \"comfort food\", made when \"small movies about the everyday lives of ordinary people were made regularly, even if those pictures sometimes emerged from the fringes of the industry\".<ref name=\"Hanson\">{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Peter |title=Second Wind (1976) |url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2018/02/second-wind-1976.html |website=Every 70's Movie |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>  The characters are \"drawn fairly well\" (Hanson notes that Hal Ackerman went on to become a popular screenwriting teacher at [[UCLA]]'s film school), \"and some of the dialogue clicks, especially passages of sarcastic banter.\"<blockquote>More importantly, the overall narrative has a pleasing shape, fully exploring Roger's dalliance with athletic endeavor. Therefore, fretting that the picture lacks surprise somewhat misses the point, since the focus is Roger testing his limits. Naughton, never the deepest of players, lends likeability and sincerity, while Wagner mostly runs her fingers through her hair.

This was the first feature film role for star [[James Naughton]], who portrays a [[stock broker]] whose new jogging hobby turns into an obsession to excel at [[long distance running]], straining his career and his relationship with his wife ([[Lindsay Wagner]]).\n\nThe film is Shebib's fourth feature. Commercially unsuccessful, reviews of ''Second Wind'' were mixed, tending to praise the cinematography and acting, but usually faulting the script. ''Second Wind'' won a [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] award and two [[Canadian Screen Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nRoger Mathieson ([[James Naughton]]) is a 30-year-old stockbroker for whom everything has come easily. One day, he sees a TV report about a 26-year's old running champion and listens intently to remarks from that athlete's coach. Inspired, Mathieson begins jogging, soon discovering he's not in great shape\u2014yet Mathieson persists, fascinated by the notion of trying something difficult for the first time in his life. He trains obsessively to be a winner. This creates friction with his wife, Linda ([[Lindsay Wagner]]), who does not understand why her husband prefers spending time alone to spending time with her. His new hobby also creates problems at work, distracted when he should be focused on a major deal, allowing an ambitious coworker to usurp his stature as the firm's golden boy. As if that were not enough, an attractive woman named Paula ([[Tedde Moore]]) hits on him one day while he is out jogging, then tries to seduce him, testing his fidelity to his long-suffering wife. It's almost too late for his marriage by the time he learns that he's been risking \"the right things in the wrong place.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[James Naughton]] as Roger Mathieson\n*[[Lindsay Wagner]] as Linda Mathieson\n* [[Ken Pogue|Kenneth Pogue]] as Pete\n* [[Tedde Moore]] as Paula\n* Tom Harvey as Frank\n* [[Louis Del Grande]] as Howie\n* [[Gerard Parkes]] as Packard\n* [[Jonathan Welsh]] as Simon\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Graham\n* Allan Levson as Kevin\n* Vivian Reis as Winnie\n* Robert Goodier as broker\n* Mike Hurley as runner\n* Robyn Jaffe as Rodger's secretary\n* Robert Slee as broker\n* John D.

Walsh hails the direction, the script, the cinematography and especially the cast, who are \"little-known but solidly professional performers who put it across to near perfection\", reserving particular praise for Naughton. \"Shebib provides him with top direction and solid support in all departments. Cameraman Reginald Morris\u2019s cinematography is slick and sophisticated. Hagood Hardy\u2019s inspired musical score knows just when to shut up and when to come on strong.\" And writer Hal Ackerman \"skillfully steers a course between plot excesses and banality\".<ref name=\"Walsh\" /> Six years later, Walsh reaffirmed that ''Second Wind'' was \"a finely-wrought film\" and considered it \"the precursor\" of films such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982) and ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=Secret too good to keep |url=http://reelingback.com/articles/secret_too_good_to_keep |website=Reeling Back |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nClive Denton, while less effusive, nevertheless also praised the film for its music, cinematography and direction, calling the script \"well-structured\", and \"often sharp and witty\", though he felt there was some \"sketchiness\" to the family relationship, saying the script is \"below its best level\" with the wife and the son seems like a \"perky little visitor\" rather than their own child.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Clive |title=Don Shebib's Second Wind |journal=Cinema Canada |date=April 1976 |pages= 53\u201354 |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/547/619 |accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> [[Marni Jackson]] thought the story was \"a good idea\" and called the film \"dutifully pretty,\" but called the characters \"so diaphanous you can see daylight through them,\" concluding the project suffered from a low budget, \"which says more about the Canadian film-making climate than Shebib.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Maurice \u00c9lia echoed many of Jackson's impressions: the story itself is quite original and a source of inspiration in some sense, and, for the first time (on the screen or off), Toronto actually looks good (perhaps to the point of exaggeration).<ref name=\"Elia\" /> The film begins well, but loses its way due to an ineptly written script littered with the kind of dialogue which undermines the credibility of the supporting characters: Paula is a sketch at best and the couple's son barely exists at all; even Lindsay Wagner's character is effectively a secondary character made up of unacceptable rejoinders.<ref name=\"Elia\" />\n\nJohn Reeves said that ''Second Wind'' is well filmed and acted, but likewise faulted the script as unbelievable: the film does not accurately show the realities of training for competition, and thereby relegates itself to the realm of [[melodrama]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reeves |first1=John |title=The soup opera route |journal=Cinema Canada |date=May 1976 |issue= 28 |pages= 22\u201323}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5, calling it an \"innocuous saga,\" and faulting it for not explaining why the protagonist \"refuses to explain the character of his obsession to his wife.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Wind |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/second-wind/review/117081/ |website=TV Guide |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Retrospective====\nPeter Hanson describes ''Second Wind'' as \"amiably predictable\", a kind of cinematic \"comfort food\", made when \"small movies about the everyday lives of ordinary people were made regularly, even if those pictures sometimes emerged from the fringes of the industry\".<ref name=\"Hanson\">{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Peter |title=Second Wind (1976) |url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2018/02/second-wind-1976.html |website=Every 70's Movie |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>  The characters are \"drawn fairly well\" (Hanson notes that Hal Ackerman went on to become a popular screenwriting teacher at [[UCLA]]'s film school), \"and some of the dialogue clicks, especially passages of sarcastic banter.\"<blockquote>More importantly, the overall narrative has a pleasing shape, fully exploring Roger's dalliance with athletic endeavor. Therefore, fretting that the picture lacks surprise somewhat misses the point, since the focus is Roger testing his limits. Naughton, never the deepest of players, lends likeability and sincerity, while Wagner mostly runs her fingers through her hair.

The majority of the American settlers who founded Coles County, Illinois were either from the six [[New England]] states, or were born in [[upstate New York]] to parents who had moved to that region from [[New England]] shortly after the [[American Revolution]].  This population was referred to as \"Yankee\" settlers, meaning that they were descended from the [[English American|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled New England in the 1600s.  They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the [[Northwest Territory]] during the early 1800s.  Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the [[Erie Canal]].    When the \"Yankee\" settlers originally arrived in the area, there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. The settlers laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.  They brought with them many of their \"Yankee\" New England values, such as staunch support for [[abolitionism]] as well as a passion for education and the subsequent construction of many schools. They were mostly members of the [[Congregationalist Church]], though some were [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]. Due to the [[second Great Awakening]] many of them had either become [[Baptists]] or converted to denominations such as [[Methodism]] or [[Presbyterianism]] before moving to what is now Coles county.  The prevalence of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York made Coles county culturally continuous with the culture of New England for the first several decades of its history, this resulted in the county having a large amount of support for the abolitionist movement during the decades preceding the Civil War, and correspondingly a strong support for the Republican party.  Relatively large amounts of German immigrants arrived in Coles County beginning in 1849, these immigrants were also almost unanimously abolitionists.  There was a small portion of the county who were Irish Catholic immigrants, Illinois Senator [[Stephen Douglas]] was extremely popular in this community, and during the Civil War the Irish Catholic community of Coles County would overwhelmingly be [[Copperhead (politics)|copperheads]].<ref>The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart H.

The majority of the American settlers who founded Coles County, Illinois were either from the six [[New England]] states, or were born in [[upstate New York]] to parents who had moved to that region from [[New England]] shortly after the [[American Revolution]].  This population was referred to as \"Yankee\" settlers, meaning that they were descended from the [[English American|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled New England in the 1600s.  They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the [[Northwest Territory]] during the early 1800s.  Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the [[Erie Canal]].    When the \"Yankee\" settlers originally arrived in the area, there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. The settlers laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.  They brought with them many of their \"Yankee\" New England values, such as staunch support for [[abolitionism]] as well as a passion for education and the subsequent construction of many schools. They were mostly members of the [[Congregationalist Church]], though some were [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]. Due to the [[second Great Awakening]] many of them had either become [[Baptists]] or converted to denominations such as [[Methodism]] or [[Presbyterianism]] before moving to what is now Coles county.  The prevalence of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York made Coles county culturally continuous with the culture of New England for the first several decades of its history, this resulted in the county having a large amount of support for the abolitionist movement during the decades preceding the Civil War, and correspondingly a strong support for the Republican party.  Relatively large amounts of German immigrants arrived in Coles County beginning in 1849, these immigrants were also almost unanimously abolitionists.  There was a small portion of the county who were Irish Catholic immigrants, Illinois Senator [[Stephen Douglas]] was extremely popular in this community, and during the Civil War the Irish Catholic community of Coles County would overwhelmingly be [[Copperhead (politics)|copperheads]].<ref>The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart H.
