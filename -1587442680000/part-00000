Clancy decides to interview the sim Glasses Man, who he discovers is, in fact, the President in this universe. In front of the White House, a group of anti-marijuana protesters are gathered, seemingly unbothered by the zombies around them. This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth.\n| LineColor       = FEDA4A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Officers and Wolves\n| DirectedBy      = Pendleton Ward \n| WrittenBy       = Mike L.
