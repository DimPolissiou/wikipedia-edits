They support the independence of [[Catalonia]] and the rest of the ''Pa\u00efsos Catalans''. It is currently the largest youth organisation in Catalonia, with over 1,400 members.\n\nOne of their main annual activities is the political music festival, ''Acampada Jove'', which attracts thousands of Catalan youngsters each year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tarragonadigital.com/tags/acampada-jove|title=Acampada Jove {{!}} TarragonaDigital.com|last=tarragonadigital.com|website=Tarragona Digital|language=ca|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> For the past ten years it has been held in the southern Catalan town of Montblanc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acampadajove.cat/lacampada-jove-incorpora-un-nou-escenari-i-amplia-loferta-musical/|title=L\u2019Acampada Jove incorpora un nou escenari i amplia l\u2019oferta musical|language=ca|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\nTheir current spokesman is Pau Morales i Romero, serving his second term in the position. Jovent Republic\u00e0 also publishes its own magazine, called ''La Veu del Jovent'' (The Voice of the Young). Like ERC, they use both the traditional blue and socialist red versions of the Catalan pro-independence flag, the [[estelada]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nAs a result of the merge of several local republican youth organizations, the Assembly of the Catalan Left was called on October 26<sup>th</sup>, 1931. On this day, the JEREC, Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana - Estat Catal\u00e0, was created at the headquarters of the Autonomous Commerce and Industry Deputy Center (CADCI) in Barcelona. The Assembly consisted of approximately 600 people and Josep Denc\u00e0s, Miquel Badia, Ramon Duran, Josep Fontbernat and Carles Duran were chosen to the board of the executive committee. The JEREC began to implement itself around Catalonia, cementing their presence in new headquarters around Barcelona and by organising various public acts throughout the 30s. Despite being essentially a local force in Barcelona, throughout the 30s they promote a process of expansion which will promote growth in inland Catalonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://joventrepublica.cat/joventuts_esquerra_republicana/historia|title=Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana|website=joventrepublica.cat|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\n=== The Republican Era. 1931 ===\nWith the proclamation of the republic and the restitution of the Generalitat of Catalonia, a stage of progress in social rights and freedoms begins, where approval by referendum on the autonomy statute that corresponds to Catalan self-government and recovers part of the freedoms snatched during the war of succession, becomes an indispensable point. During these years of republican government the JEREC also participate in the governability of the country and during the first years of the republic when they constitute the guerrillas, there are multitudinal acts, athletic days and parades.\n\nIn May of the 36, in a complicated context and with the attempt to reunify and to fortify the youths, the change of denomination and the adoption of the new abbreviations is proposed: JERC, like at present. With the outbreak of the civil war, much of the militancy became part of the Maci\u00e0-Companys Column and other detachments of what would be the Regular People's Army in order to defend the Republican legitimacy on the front.\n\n=== During the dictatorship, the dark age. 1939 ===\nThe end of the civil war and the victory of the Franco regime generates an exodus and personal losses hardly repairable. A lot of youthful militancy must be exiled, imprisoned or killed in the battlefields.\n\nEven so, despite the difficulties, the flame of youth republicanism is maintained since exile and underground embodied by the leaders of the V\u00edctor Torres and Heribert Barrera periods. In the first years some militants, both of Esquerra and of the JERC, also join the National Front of Catalonia, which brings together the clandestine struggle. In 1945 the JERC were recompiled in exile, however, the long tunnel of the Franco regime leads to a testimonial survival of the political organizations overdue. The main task during the Franco regime is to maintain the activity in exile and to resist in the clandestine struggle inside the country.\n\n=== The reconstruction of the JERC. 1976 ===\nAt the end of 1976, the younger members of Esquerra headed by Boi Fuster, Maria Teresa Puigoriol, Jordi Rull and Mart\u00ed Marc\u00f3 - who was murdered by the Spanish police in a shooting in 1979 - set in motion the reconstruction of the youth political space near Esquerra and adopt the official, refundacional and definitive name of Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, the JERC. During this stage and under the leadership (in that order) by Jordi Rull, Joan L\u00f3pez, Santiago Sala, Dolors Rovira, Albert Freixa, Joaquim Mic\u00f3, Francesc Garriga, Jordi Olivella and Francesc Xavier Sim\u00f3, the JERC will fight to organize around the territory and gain visibility.\n\n=== Growth and social influence. 1987 ===\nIt is from 1987, when with the Crida to Esquerra, hundreds of young people rebuild the party and youth, and recover the space of the Left Independent. The reception of a new militancy quadruplies the existing organization before 1987. In that same year the JERC celebrated its 10th congress, under the motto \"The Independent Force of the Future\" and Joan Puigcerc\u00f3s is elected as Secretary General of the \" organization\n\nThe refurbishment of the JERC, led by the same Puigcerc\u00f3s, is to organize the organization internally, establish the ideological bases and establish a new image, with the incorporation of the current logo. It is also in the early 1990s when the JERC assume the scope of the Catalan Countries in their statutes. The JERC continues to expand its militant base, both from the point of numerical development, as well as territorial, and from international relations.\n\nThe recognition of the JERC as an autonomous youth political organization during the 18th National Left Congress in Vic in 1992 and the signing of a Protocol of Relationships between Esquerra and JERC in January 1993 represent full consolidation and maturity. It is from this moment that the JERC acquires the total competition in the youth field, work that is consolidated as of the 13th national congress where David Minoves is elected as Secretary General.\nDuring this time it is when the social incidence increases with media and multimodal actions. Highlighted are the campaigns in favor of disobedience to compulsory military service or the fight against repression, arrests and torture during the Olympic Games in Barcelona.\n\nWith the national leadership of Esquerra headed by \u00c0ngel Colom and Pilar Rahola there is a distancing between the two organizations due to discrepancies over methods of action and political practice. In 1996, the JERC celebrated its national congress in Tarragona where they chose Camil Ros as Secretary General to continue betting and extending the ideological struggle to build a party that embodies the values of the left and independence.\n\n=== The JERC as a youth movement. 1997 ===\nAs of 1997, the organization makes a generational change and at the National Congress of Manlleu they choose Uriel Bertran with the Secretary General, who will be 6 years holding this responsibility. In those years, work is prioritized in improving the living conditions of young people from a pro-independence analysis and a popular mobilization strategy. The organizational structure is changed and it is simplified by adopting the terminology of the national spokesperson to define the person who leads the organization.\nThe conception of the JERC as a true youth movement is to promote and dynamize the participation of the militancy in sectoral organizations and fabricate a network to open the organization to society. This social and popular dynamic is promoted, in order to combine institutional work with the street fight. Starting in 1996, the Acampada Jove project, the political-musical festival of reference in the Catalan Countries, that thousands of young people congregate each summer, as well as the Casals Tio Canya, which become meeting points and youth social centers, opens . Also, it emphasizes all the work that was done in institutes and universities with the student movements.\n\nIt is a politically intense period in which the JERC becomes a youth mobilization tool to fight against the different educational reforms, the national hydrological plan, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or the struggle for decent housing.\n\n=== The first left-wing and Catalanist government since 1939. 2003 ===\n[[Image:Muralmarti1642zu1.jpg|278x278px|thumb|right|Mural by JERC in [[Sabadell]]]]\nIn the framework of the 19th National Congress held in 2003, Pere Aragon\u00e8s, he became the new national spokesman in a new political context for the modern JERC. The increase of Left in the polls and the consequent formation of the first Catalan and leftist government, leads the JERC to jump. They move from the youth mobilization to having government responsibilities and managing the youth policies of the Principality. The JERC faces the challenge of moving what they said to the streets in the institutions. At this stage, the JERC are opposed to the reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia that had been cut in Madrid, leading this position in the party itself, as well as the constant mobilization of the youth with important media actions such as It was chained to the headquarters of the COPE chain in Madrid.\n\nFrom 2007 until 2011, Gerard Coca becomes the new spokesman for the organization. In this period, it is about managing a moment of internal convulsion to the left wing and administering the second left coalition government in which, the JERC, with responsibilities in the leadership of the secretariat of youth, drives a true emancipation network with the young offices around the Catalan territory. Special emphasis is placed on youth policies, affecting decent housing, the right to work or quality education. In this context, the economic crisis explodes and the JERC continue fighting to improve the conditions of life of the youth as well as to link the exit of the crisis when leaving Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://joventrepublica.cat/joventuts_esquerra_republicana/historia|title=Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana|website=joventrepublica.cat|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Reorganisation and rise of the independentist youth movement. 2011 ===\nAt the 23rd national congress held in Terrassa in 2011, the militancy chose [[Gerard G\u00f3mez del Moral]] as the new spokesman. At this time the JERC are facing the challenge of becoming the referent organization of the youth of the Catalan Countries to relaunch youth independentism.\n\nIn a moment of demand for more transparency and democracy, the JERC participate in the impulse of the independentist debate in order to build a better future for the youth of the country. There are massive mobilizations that force the beginning of the process of independence of the Principality and a growing democratic confrontation with a recent, antisocial and demophobic Spanish state. After the celebration of the 9N of 2014, where more than 2 million citizens are expressed in favor of independence, they face a plebiscitation election from which the first Independent Parliament and Government of the Principality will emerge.\n[[File:Acte municipals 2019 Jovent.jpg|thumb|353x353px|Members and municipal election candidates of Jovent Republic\u00e0 in Barcelona, 2018.]]\n\n=== The Present, Referendum for Catalan Independence and Creation of the Republic. 2017 ===\nAt the 26th National Congress held in Benicarl\u00f3 in 2017, the militancy chooses Pau Morales as the new spokesman. The JERC are facing a new stage by approving new statutes for the first time in 18 years with the intention of becoming a more modern and effective tool that acts in symbiosis with many other social, associative, student and political groups.\n\nIt is about becoming the most useful and most useful political tool to reclaim the role of the youth when dealing with the Independence Referendum on October 1, 2017 and trigger the opening of a constituent process popular of the Catalan Republic, opposite of the social and national liberation of the Catalan Countries. We fight for a revolutionary idea in this crazy world we live in: being ordinary young people living in a country in which it is worth living.\n\n== Congresses ==\n\n* I National Congress ([[Barcelona]]) 1977: Jordi Rull is elected Secretary General.\n* II National Congress (Barcelona) November 18, 1979: Santiago Sala is elected Secretary General.\n* III National Congress (Barcelona) April 27, 1980: Dolors Rovira is chosen as Secretary General.\n* IV National Congress (Barcelona) December 21, 1980: Albert Freixa is elected Secretary General.\n* V National Congress (Barcelona) March 27, 1982\n* VI National Congress (Barcelona) July 9 and 10, 1983: Francesc Garriga is elected Secretary General.\n* VII National Congress (Barcelona) September 1984\n* VIII National Congress (Barcelona) January 12, 1986: Jordi Olivella is made Secretary General.\n* IX National Congress (Barcelona) On 20 and 21 December 1986 Francesc Xavier Sim\u00f3 is elected as the new Secretary General.\n* X National Congress (Barcelona) December 12 and 13, 1987: Joan Puigcerc\u00f3s is chosen as Secretary General.\n* XI National Congress ([[Sitges]], [[Garraf]]) March 17 and 18, 1990: Joan Puigcerc\u00f3s is re-elected as Secretary General.\n* XII National Congress ([[Girona]]) October 10 and 11, 1992: Joan Puigcerc\u00f3s is re-elected as Secretary General.\n* XIII National Congress (Barcelona) March 19 and 20, 1994: David Minoves is elected as Secretary General.\n* XIV National Congress ([[Tarragona]]) April 27 and 28, 1996: Camil Ros is elected as Secretary General.\n* XV National Congress ([[Manlleu]], [[Osona]]) December 20 and 21, 1997: Uriel Bertran is elected as the new Secretary General.\n* XVI National Congress ([[Calella]], [[Maresme]]) December 18 and 19, 1999: Uriel Bertran is re-elected as Secretary General.\n* XVII National Congress (Barcelona) November 25, 2000: Reform of the statutes.\n* XVIII National Congress ([[Molins de Rei]], Baix Llobregat) November 17 and 18, 2001: Uriel Bertran is re-elected.

Until April 2018 it was known as '''Young Republican Left of Catalonia'''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/152240/jerc/canvien/nom/imatge|title=Les JERC canvien de nom i imatge|last=|first=|date=8 April 2018|work=Naci\u00f3 Digital|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref> (JERC in Catalan initals)\n\nAccording to their declaration of principles, the aim of Jovent Republic\u00e0 is to \"attain a democratic society, free of any social or national oppression within an ecologically balanced territory, by bringing awareness and mobilizing the youth of the [[Paisos Catalans|Catalan Countries]] (Pa\u00efsos Catalans)\". They support the independence of [[Catalonia]] and the rest of the ''Pa\u00efsos Catalans''. It is currently the largest youth organisation in Catalonia, with over 1,400 members.\n\nOne of their main annual activities is the political music festival, ''Acampada Jove'', which attracts thousands of Catalan youngsters each year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tarragonadigital.com/tags/acampada-jove|title=Acampada Jove {{!}} TarragonaDigital.com|last=tarragonadigital.com|website=Tarragona Digital|language=ca|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref>.

Jovent Republic\u00e0 also publishes its own magazine, called ''La Veu del Jovent'' (The Voice of the Young). Like ERC, they use both the traditional blue and socialist red versions of the Catalan pro-independence flag, the [[estelada]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nAs a result of the merge of several local republican youth organizations, the Assembly of the Catalan Left was called on October 26<sup>th</sup>, 1931. On this day, the JEREC, Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana - Estat Catal\u00e0, was created at the headquarters of the Autonomous Commerce and Industry Deputy Center (CADCI) in Barcelona. The Assembly consisted of approximately 600 people and Josep Denc\u00e0s, Miquel Badia, Ramon Duran, Josep Fontbernat and Carles Duran were chosen to the board of the executive committee. The JEREC began to implement itself around Catalonia, cementing their presence in new headquarters around Barcelona and by organising various public acts throughout the 30s. Despite being essentially a local force in Barcelona, throughout the 30s they promote a process of expansion which will promote growth in inland Catalonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://joventrepublica.cat/joventuts_esquerra_republicana/historia|title=Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana|website=joventrepublica.cat|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\n=== The Republican Era. 1931 ===\nWith the proclamation of the republic and the restitution of the Generalitat of Catalonia, a stage of progress in social rights and freedoms begins, where approval by referendum on the autonomy statute that corresponds to Catalan self-government and recovers part of the freedoms snatched during the war of succession, becomes an indispensable point. During these years of republican government the JEREC also participate in the governability of the country and during the first years of the republic when they constitute the guerrillas, there are multitudinal acts, athletic days and parades.\n\nIn May of the 36, in a complicated context and with the attempt to reunify and to fortify the youths, the change of denomination and the adoption of the new abbreviations is proposed: JERC, like at present. With the outbreak of the civil war, much of the militancy became part of the Maci\u00e0-Companys Column and other detachments of what would be the Regular People's Army in order to defend the Republican legitimacy on the front.\n\n=== During the dictatorship, the dark age. 1939 ===\nThe end of the civil war and the victory of the Franco regime generates an exodus and personal losses hardly repairable. A lot of youthful militancy must be exiled, imprisoned or killed in the battlefields.\n\nEven so, despite the difficulties, the flame of youth republicanism is maintained since exile and underground embodied by the leaders of the V\u00edctor Torres and Heribert Barrera periods. In the first years some militants, both of Esquerra and of the JERC, also join the National Front of Catalonia, which brings together the clandestine struggle. In 1945 the JERC were recompiled in exile, however, the long tunnel of the Franco regime leads to a testimonial survival of the political organizations overdue. The main task during the Franco regime is to maintain the activity in exile and to resist in the clandestine struggle inside the country.\n\n=== The reconstruction of the JERC. 1976 ===\nAt the end of 1976, the younger members of Esquerra headed by Boi Fuster, Maria Teresa Puigoriol, Jordi Rull and Mart\u00ed Marc\u00f3 - who was murdered by the Spanish police in a shooting in 1979 - set in motion the reconstruction of the youth political space near Esquerra and adopt the official, refundacional and definitive name of Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, the JERC. During this stage and under the leadership (in that order) by Jordi Rull, Joan L\u00f3pez, Santiago Sala, Dolors Rovira, Albert Freixa, Joaquim Mic\u00f3, Francesc Garriga, Jordi Olivella and Francesc Xavier Sim\u00f3, the JERC will fight to organize around the territory and gain visibility.\n\n=== Growth and social influence. 1987 ===\nIt is from 1987, when with the Crida to Esquerra, hundreds of young people rebuild the party and youth, and recover the space of the Left Independent. The reception of a new militancy quadruplies the existing organization before 1987. In that same year the JERC celebrated its 10th congress, under the motto \"The Independent Force of the Future\" and Joan Puigcerc\u00f3s is elected as Secretary General of the \" organization\n\nThe refurbishment of the JERC, led by the same Puigcerc\u00f3s, is to organize the organization internally, establish the ideological bases and establish a new image, with the incorporation of the current logo. It is also in the early 1990s when the JERC assume the scope of the Catalan Countries in their statutes. The JERC continues to expand its militant base, both from the point of numerical development, as well as territorial, and from international relations.\n\nThe recognition of the JERC as an autonomous youth political organization during the 18th National Left Congress in Vic in 1992 and the signing of a Protocol of Relationships between Esquerra and JERC in January 1993 represent full consolidation and maturity. It is from this moment that the JERC acquires the total competition in the youth field, work that is consolidated as of the 13th national congress where David Minoves is elected as Secretary General.\nDuring this time it is when the social incidence increases with media and multimodal actions. Highlighted are the campaigns in favor of disobedience to compulsory military service or the fight against repression, arrests and torture during the Olympic Games in Barcelona.\n\nWith the national leadership of Esquerra headed by \u00c0ngel Colom and Pilar Rahola there is a distancing between the two organizations due to discrepancies over methods of action and political practice. In 1996, the JERC celebrated its national congress in Tarragona where they chose Camil Ros as Secretary General to continue betting and extending the ideological struggle to build a party that embodies the values of the left and independence.\n\n=== The JERC as a youth movement. 1997 ===\nAs of 1997, the organization makes a generational change and at the National Congress of Manlleu they choose Uriel Bertran with the Secretary General, who will be 6 years holding this responsibility. In those years, work is prioritized in improving the living conditions of young people from a pro-independence analysis and a popular mobilization strategy. The organizational structure is changed and it is simplified by adopting the terminology of the national spokesperson to define the person who leads the organization.\nThe conception of the JERC as a true youth movement is to promote and dynamize the participation of the militancy in sectoral organizations and fabricate a network to open the organization to society. This social and popular dynamic is promoted, in order to combine institutional work with the street fight. Starting in 1996, the Acampada Jove project, the political-musical festival of reference in the Catalan Countries, that thousands of young people congregate each summer, as well as the Casals Tio Canya, which become meeting points and youth social centers, opens . Also, it emphasizes all the work that was done in institutes and universities with the student movements.\n\nIt is a politically intense period in which the JERC becomes a youth mobilization tool to fight against the different educational reforms, the national hydrological plan, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or the struggle for decent housing.\n\n=== The first left-wing and Catalanist government since 1939. 2003 ===\n[[Image:Muralmarti1642zu1.jpg|278x278px|thumb|right|Mural by JERC in [[Sabadell]]]]\nIn the framework of the 19th National Congress held in 2003, Pere Aragon\u00e8s, he became the new national spokesman in a new political context for the modern JERC. The increase of Left in the polls and the consequent formation of the first Catalan and leftist government, leads the JERC to jump. They move from the youth mobilization to having government responsibilities and managing the youth policies of the Principality. The JERC faces the challenge of moving what they said to the streets in the institutions. At this stage, the JERC are opposed to the reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia that had been cut in Madrid, leading this position in the party itself, as well as the constant mobilization of the youth with important media actions such as It was chained to the headquarters of the COPE chain in Madrid.\n\nFrom 2007 until 2011, Gerard Coca becomes the new spokesman for the organization. In this period, it is about managing a moment of internal convulsion to the left wing and administering the second left coalition government in which, the JERC, with responsibilities in the leadership of the secretariat of youth, drives a true emancipation network with the young offices around the Catalan territory. Special emphasis is placed on youth policies, affecting decent housing, the right to work or quality education. In this context, the economic crisis explodes and the JERC continue fighting to improve the conditions of life of the youth as well as to link the exit of the crisis when leaving Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://joventrepublica.cat/joventuts_esquerra_republicana/historia|title=Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana|website=joventrepublica.cat|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Reorganisation and rise of the independentist youth movement. 2011 ===\nAt the 23rd national congress held in Terrassa in 2011, the militancy chose [[Gerard G\u00f3mez del Moral]] as the new spokesman. At this time the JERC are facing the challenge of becoming the referent organization of the youth of the Catalan Countries to relaunch youth independentism.\n\nIn a moment of demand for more transparency and democracy, the JERC participate in the impulse of the independentist debate in order to build a better future for the youth of the country. There are massive mobilizations that force the beginning of the process of independence of the Principality and a growing democratic confrontation with a recent, antisocial and demophobic Spanish state. After the celebration of the 9N of 2014, where more than 2 million citizens are expressed in favor of independence, they face a plebiscitation election from which the first Independent Parliament and Government of the Principality will emerge.\n[[File:Acte municipals 2019 Jovent.jpg|thumb|353x353px|Members and municipal election candidates of Jovent Republic\u00e0 in Barcelona, 2018.]]\n\n=== The Present, Referendum for Catalan Independence and Creation of the Republic. 2017 ===\nAt the 26th National Congress held in Benicarl\u00f3 in 2017, the militancy chooses Pau Morales as the new spokesman. The JERC are facing a new stage by approving new statutes for the first time in 18 years with the intention of becoming a more modern and effective tool that acts in symbiosis with many other social, associative, student and political groups.\n\nIt is about becoming the most useful and most useful political tool to reclaim the role of the youth when dealing with the Independence Referendum on October 1, 2017 and trigger the opening of a constituent process popular of the Catalan Republic, opposite of the social and national liberation of the Catalan Countries. We fight for a revolutionary idea in this crazy world we live in: being ordinary young people living in a country in which it is worth living.\n\n== Congresses ==\n\n* I National Congress ([[Barcelona]]) 1977: Jordi Rull is elected Secretary General.\n* II National Congress (Barcelona) November 18, 1979: Santiago Sala is elected Secretary General.\n* III National Congress (Barcelona) April 27, 1980: Dolors Rovira is chosen as Secretary General.\n* IV National Congress (Barcelona) December 21, 1980: Albert Freixa is elected Secretary General.\n* V National Congress (Barcelona) March 27, 1982\n* VI National Congress (Barcelona) July 9 and 10, 1983: Francesc Garriga is elected Secretary General.\n* VII National Congress (Barcelona) September 1984\n* VIII National Congress (Barcelona) January 12, 1986: Jordi Olivella is made Secretary General.\n* IX National Congress (Barcelona) On 20 and 21 December 1986 Francesc Xavier Sim\u00f3 is elected as the new Secretary General.\n* X National Congress (Barcelona) December 12 and 13, 1987: Joan Puigcerc\u00f3s is chosen as Secretary General.\n* XI National Congress ([[Sitges]], [[Garraf]]) March 17 and 18, 1990: Joan Puigcerc\u00f3s is re-elected as Secretary General.\n* XII National Congress ([[Girona]]) October 10 and 11, 1992: Joan Puigcerc\u00f3s is re-elected as Secretary General.\n* XIII National Congress (Barcelona) March 19 and 20, 1994: David Minoves is elected as Secretary General.\n* XIV National Congress ([[Tarragona]]) April 27 and 28, 1996: Camil Ros is elected as Secretary General.\n* XV National Congress ([[Manlleu]], [[Osona]]) December 20 and 21, 1997: Uriel Bertran is elected as the new Secretary General.\n* XVI National Congress ([[Calella]], [[Maresme]]) December 18 and 19, 1999: Uriel Bertran is re-elected as Secretary General.\n* XVII National Congress (Barcelona) November 25, 2000: Reform of the statutes.\n* XVIII National Congress ([[Molins de Rei]], Baix Llobregat) November 17 and 18, 2001: Uriel Bertran is re-elected.

It was produced by the [[Roland Corporation]] from 1974 to 1990.\n\n==Background==\nA tape echo device records incoming audio to a loop of [[magnetic tape]], then replays the continuous loop over the playback head before it is erased again by new incoming audio. The first commercial echo unit was the [[EchoSonic]] which had its own amplification and a delicate tape mechanism that required frequent attention. The design was further perfected in the [[Echoplex]] with adjustable echo delay. It provided a reliable and much smaller, portable package that could be used with any amplifier. \n\nIn the late 1960s [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]], later the founder of the [[Roland Corporation]], built a tape echo using a short tape loop based on the design of the Echoplex and the EchoSonic; his Ace Tone EC-1 Echo Chamber was the first of a number of models. In 1973, then operating under the Roland brand, Kakehashi introduced the Roland Echo Chamber RE-100 and RE-200, the latter with an added [[Reverberation#Spring_reverberators|spring reverb]].<ref name=\"dregni\" />\n\nKakehashi's breakthrough development came in 1974 with the RE-101 and RE-201 Space Echo units, which used the standard 1/4\" tape of the open-reel variety, but made as one, continuous loop. It uses no reels of any kind; the tape is transported via a [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] drive. The tape loop is contained in a loose, constantly moving jumble in the tape chamber (also known as the tape tank) under a plastic panel which protects the tape and keeps it from getting tangled.

It was produced by the [[Roland Corporation]] from 1974 to 1990.\n\n==Background==\nA tape echo device records incoming audio to a loop of [[magnetic tape]], then replays the continuous loop over the playback head before it is erased again by new incoming audio. The first commercial echo unit was the [[EchoSonic]] which had its own amplification and a delicate tape mechanism that required frequent attention. The design was further perfected in the [[Echoplex]] with adjustable echo delay. It provided a reliable and much smaller, portable package that could be used with any amplifier. \n\nIn the late 1960s [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]], later the founder of the [[Roland Corporation]], built a tape echo using a short tape loop based on the design of the Echoplex and the EchoSonic; his Ace Tone EC-1 Echo Chamber was the first of a number of models. In 1973, then operating under the Roland brand, Kakehashi introduced the Roland Echo Chamber RE-100 and RE-200, the latter with an added [[Reverberation#Spring_reverberators|spring reverb]].<ref name=\"dregni\" />\n\nKakehashi's breakthrough development came in 1974 with the RE-101 and RE-201 Space Echo units, which used the standard 1/4\" tape of the open-reel variety, but made as one, continuous loop.

Its features include [[Linear Arithmetic synthesis]], on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analogue synthesis-styled layout design. The external Roland PG-1000 (1987-1990) programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of its sounds. It was also produced in a rack-mount variant design, the D-550 (1987-1990), with almost 450 user-adjustable parameters.<ref name=\"SOSjul97\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/jul97/rolandd50.html|title=Roland D50|work=Sound On Sound|date=July 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606075921/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/jul97/rolandd50.html|archivedate=6 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe D-50's capabilities could be modified through the addition of third-party products by Musitronics, most notably the M-EX which made the D-50 multitimbral (the D-50 was bi-timbral), as well as a chip that improved the D-50's response to incoming MIDI commands and a system for burning custom PCM cards with user samples for playback in the D-50.<ref>Mark Vail, Vintage Synthesizers, Miller Freeman, 1993, p. 63</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe D-50 was the first affordable synthesizer to combine [[Sample-based synthesis|sample playback]] with [[Digital synthesizer|digital synthesis]], a process that Roland called [[Linear Arithmetic synthesis]]. The engineers at Roland determined that the most difficult component of an instrument's sound to simulate realistically is the attack. To better emulate realistic sounds, the D-50 included almost 100 attack samples in ROM. The synthesizer played back an attack sample which was dove-tailed with more conventional subtractive synthesis to create the sustain of the sound. This dual-use method was required in 1987 since RAM was so expensive. Roland did, however, incorporate a number of \"texture\" samples that could be mixed into the synthesized sustain-part of a patch. These sustain samples gave many D-50 patches a lush and airy quality, particularly with its heavy use of choir, wind and string samples.<ref name=\"SOSjul97\" /> The D-50 is probably the first virtual analog synthesizer.<ref>http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan05/articles/roland.htm \"LA synthesis provided two simultaneous tone generators -- each comprising a PCM snippet and what was probably the first 'virtual-analogue' synth architecture\"</ref> The D50 also was an early digital synthesizer to integrate onboard digital effects: it took the possibilities found in the 1985 Korg DW8000 digital delay section a step further by including better stereo imaging and an equalizer<ref>[http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/dw8000.php \"Korg DW-8000\"]</ref>, to see Korg include more digital effects next year in their M1.\n\nThe Roland D-50 was awarded a [[TEC Awards|TEC Award]] for outstanding technical achievement in musical technology in 1988.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120710084118/http://mixonline.com/images/archive/tecawards/past/1988.html 1988 TEC Awards]</ref>\n\n==Technology==\nAlthough the D-50 was among the first non-sampling machines to be able to produce sounds with [[Sampling (signal processing)|sample]]-based characteristics, it was not long before many synthesizers on the market began using similar methods to create sounds.  Roland later released a series of lower-priced keyboards and modules that allowed musicians who couldn't afford the relatively expensive flagship D-50 to have some of these sounds (Roland D-10 (1988), D-110 (rack version of D-10) (1988) D-20 (1988), D-5 (1989), [[Roland MT-32|MT-32]]). Though these lower priced D-series synthesizers did not contain the full \"LA\" synth engine, each was 8 part multi-timbral, and Roland doubled the number of onboard PCM samples. Roland also produced the 76-key, 6-octave \"Super-LA\" D-70 (1989-1990). With the D-70 Roland removed the digital synthesis section, which was replaced with full-length, more realistic and natural sounding samples, including an acoustic piano, which the D-50 lacked. The D-70 also had an expanded filter and effects section and was 5 part multi-timbral. Even with its improvements, however, the D-70 was unable to catch up with the dominant workstation of the time\u2014the [[Korg M1]]\u2014and failed to become the next Roland flagship synthesizer.\n\nThe D-50 produces a hybrid \"analog/digital\" sound: one can use traditional analog waveforms like saw and square (digitally created on the fly unlike competing synths of the time that used PCM samples of waveforms, such as the Korg DW-8000) together with PCM samples of actual acoustic instrument attack transients and famous analog synths of the past, filtered through analog-style processing (LFOs, TVFs, TVAs, ring modulator, effects, etc.). This breakthrough led to the creation of totally new sounds never done before on either purely analog synths or digital samplers.\n\nEach D-50 sound (\"patch\") was made up of 2 \"tones\" (Upper and Lower) and each tone was made up of 2 \"partials\". Each partial could be either a \"synth waveform\" (pulse or sawtooth waveform) and a TVF (time-variant filter, the digital equivalent of a VCF) or a digital PCM waveform (sampled attack transient or looped sustain waveform). The partials could be arranged following 1 of 7 possible \"structures\" (algorithms), with a combination of either a PCM waveform or synthesized waveform, with an option to ring-modulate the two partials together. The synthesized waveforms could be pulse-width modulated and passed through a digital 4-stage Low-Pass filter, allowing for subtractive synthesis. The lower and upper part could be split or played in dual on the keyboard. The dual configuration allows an 8-voice polyphony bi-timbrality while only one partial plays, which allows for 32 voices.<ref>Julian Colbeck, Keyfax Omnibus Edition, MixBooks 1996, p. 97-100</ref>\n\nNot only was the synthesis method new; the D-50 was arguably the first commercial synthesizer to include digital effects such as chorus and reverb, adding to the characteristically bright, rich, lively and sometimes realistic sound, featured on countless records of the period. Each of those effects had 10+ variations with editable parameters usually found in dedicated rack effects processors rather than keyboard synths. It was also on the forefront of the change of the look of a typical keyboard player on stage: instead of being surrounded with multiple instruments, with more versatile instruments and the continued adoption of the MIDI standard, they were starting to appear with only one or two keyboards, typically a D-50 with either [[Yamaha DX7]] or Korg M1.\n\nThe D-50 was fully MIDI-compatible, though it transmits on only one channel. The keyboard was velocity- and after-touch-sensitive, and the keys were slightly \"weighted\" with metal for a higher-quality feel. It included 64 patches on-board, and 64 more patches were available on the expansion RAM card that was included. It uses a CR2032 lithium battery for memory backup.\n\nFor its sound and build quality, and the unique synthesis method it featured, the D-50 has remained popular to this day. Its synthesis engine, in more or less updated forms, was used in Roland's JV and XP series synths, among others. Furthermore, in 2004, Roland released a VC-1 expansion card for V-Synth and [[Roland VariOS|VariOS]] synthesizers. It contained a modeled and updated D-50 synthesis engine and the original operating system, including factory- and all Roland \"expansion cards\" patches. Since the newer DAC chips sounded \"cleaner\" with less noise output and overall higher bit and sample rates, it included the option to simulate the D-50's \"rougher\" output. \n\nThe D-550 is a rack-mount version of D-50, with fewer front panel controls, no joystick and sliders. It employs the same sound circuitry (the main circuit board is exactly the same in both, labeled \"D-50/D-550\")\n\n==Legacy==\nThe D-50 was introduced in 1987 as the popularity of the Yamaha DX7 was declining, resulting in the D-50 being the most popular synthesizer on the market until the introduction of the [[Korg M1]] the following year.<ref>Mark Vail, Vintage Synthesizers, Miller Freeman, 1993, p. 251</ref> The D-50's synthesizer-on-top-of-samples-and-through-effects innovation was an influence on the M1, which went on to become Korg's top selling keyboard, until the release of the [[Korg Triton]]. In fact, this scheme was a common method of digital keyboard sound creation for more than a decade, until ROM and Flash RAM were finally inexpensive enough to store entire samples or multisamples.\n\nIn the case of the D-50, for sound synthesis, the use of PCM samples can be bypassed completely when using Synth Partials only as the basis for sound creation. This effectively gives 4 DCO subtractive synthesis (resonant filters), which can produce some very analog like sounds that later synths could not due to their sole use of PCM samples, or 'more digital' sounding synthesis methods (such as FM or PM) as the basis for their sound creation. This digital subtractive synthesis method of sound production gave a similar, but colder and more clinical, sound when compared to the analog technology employed by previous Roland synthesizers, e.g. the previous flagship [[Roland JX-10|JX-10]].<ref>Julian Colbeck, Keyfax Omnibus Edition, MixBooks 1996, p. 97-100</ref>\n\nThe presets of the D-50, authored by [[Eric Persing]] and Adrian Scott, were well received by the artists' community, and most of them can be heard on numerous commercial albums of the late 1980s. The D-50's factory presets have enjoyed a long legacy, as patches like \"Digital Native Dance\", \"Staccato Heaven\", \"Fantasia\", \"Glass Voices\", and \"Living Calliope\" are so common that they border on cliche. Some other D-50 presets live on in every machine that conforms to the [[General MIDI]] specification, including \"Fantasia\" (alternatively called \"New Age Pad\"), \"Soundtrack\", \"Atmosphere\", and \"Nylon Atmosphere\".<ref name=\"SOSjul97\" />\n\nThe Roland V-Synth and V-Synth XT can load a card which emulates the D-50.

Its features include [[Linear Arithmetic synthesis]], on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analogue synthesis-styled layout design. The external Roland PG-1000 (1987-1990) programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of its sounds. It was also produced in a rack-mount variant design, the D-550 (1987-1990), with almost 450 user-adjustable parameters.<ref name=\"SOSjul97\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/jul97/rolandd50.html|title=Roland D50|work=Sound On Sound|date=July 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606075921/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/jul97/rolandd50.html|archivedate=6 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe D-50's capabilities could be modified through the addition of third-party products by Musitronics, most notably the M-EX which made the D-50 multitimbral (the D-50 was bi-timbral), as well as a chip that improved the D-50's response to incoming MIDI commands and a system for burning custom PCM cards with user samples for playback in the D-50.<ref>Mark Vail, Vintage Synthesizers, Miller Freeman, 1993, p. 63</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe D-50 was the first affordable synthesizer to combine [[Sample-based synthesis|sample playback]] with [[Digital synthesizer|digital synthesis]], a process that Roland called [[Linear Arithmetic synthesis]]. The engineers at Roland determined that the most difficult component of an instrument's sound to simulate realistically is the attack. To better emulate realistic sounds, the D-50 included almost 100 attack samples in ROM. The synthesizer played back an attack sample which was dove-tailed with more conventional subtractive synthesis to create the sustain of the sound. This dual-use method was required in 1987 since RAM was so expensive. Roland did, however, incorporate a number of \"texture\" samples that could be mixed into the synthesized sustain-part of a patch. These sustain samples gave many D-50 patches a lush and airy quality, particularly with its heavy use of choir, wind and string samples.<ref name=\"SOSjul97\" /> The D-50 is probably the first virtual analog synthesizer<ref>http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan05/articles/roland.htm \"LA synthesis provided two simultaneous tone generators -- each comprising a PCM snippet and what was probably the first 'virtual-analogue' synth architecture\"</ref>. The D50 also was an early digital synthesizer to integrate onboard digital effects: it took the possibilities found in the 1985 Korg DW8000 digital delay section a step further by including better stereo imaging and an equalizer<ref>[http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/dw8000.php \"Korg DW-8000\"]</ref>, to see Korg include more digital effects next year in their M1.\n\nThe Roland D-50 was awarded a [[TEC Awards|TEC Award]] for outstanding technical achievement in musical technology in 1988.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120710084118/http://mixonline.com/images/archive/tecawards/past/1988.html 1988 TEC Awards]</ref>\n\n==Technology==\nAlthough the D-50 was among the first non-sampling machines to be able to produce sounds with [[Sampling (signal processing)|sample]]-based characteristics, it was not long before many synthesizers on the market began using similar methods to create sounds.  Roland later released a series of lower-priced keyboards and modules that allowed musicians who couldn't afford the relatively expensive flagship D-50 to have some of these sounds (Roland D-10 (1988), D-110 (rack version of D-10) (1988) D-20 (1988), D-5 (1989), [[Roland MT-32|MT-32]]). Though these lower priced D-series synthesizers did not contain the full \"LA\" synth engine, each was 8 part multi-timbral, and Roland doubled the number of onboard PCM samples. Roland also produced the 76-key, 6-octave \"Super-LA\" D-70 (1989-1990). With the D-70 Roland removed the digital synthesis section, which was replaced with full-length, more realistic and natural sounding samples, including an acoustic piano, which the D-50 lacked. The D-70 also had an expanded filter and effects section and was 5 part multi-timbral. Even with its improvements, however, the D-70 was unable to catch up with the dominant workstation of the time\u2014the [[Korg M1]]\u2014and failed to become the next Roland flagship synthesizer.\n\nThe D-50 produces a hybrid \"analog/digital\" sound: one can use traditional analog waveforms like saw and square (digitally created on the fly unlike competing synths of the time that used PCM samples of waveforms, such as the Korg DW-8000) together with PCM samples of actual acoustic instrument attack transients and famous analog synths of the past, filtered through analog-style processing (LFOs, TVFs, TVAs, ring modulator, effects, etc.). This breakthrough led to the creation of totally new sounds never done before on either purely analog synths or digital samplers.\n\nEach D-50 sound (\"patch\") was made up of 2 \"tones\" (Upper and Lower) and each tone was made up of 2 \"partials\". Each partial could be either a \"synth waveform\" (pulse or sawtooth waveform) and a TVF (time-variant filter, the digital equivalent of a VCF) or a digital PCM waveform (sampled attack transient or looped sustain waveform). The partials could be arranged following 1 of 7 possible \"structures\" (algorithms), with a combination of either a PCM waveform or synthesized waveform, with an option to ring-modulate the two partials together. The synthesized waveforms could be pulse-width modulated and passed through a digital 4-stage Low-Pass filter, allowing for subtractive synthesis. The lower and upper part could be split or played in dual on the keyboard. The dual configuration allows an 8-voice polyphony bi-timbrality while only one partial plays, which allows for 32 voices.<ref>Julian Colbeck, Keyfax Omnibus Edition, MixBooks 1996, p. 97-100</ref>\n\nNot only was the synthesis method new; the D-50 was arguably the first commercial synthesizer to include digital effects such as chorus and reverb, adding to the characteristically bright, rich, lively and sometimes realistic sound, featured on countless records of the period. Each of those effects had 10+ variations with editable parameters usually found in dedicated rack effects processors rather than keyboard synths. It was also on the forefront of the change of the look of a typical keyboard player on stage: instead of being surrounded with multiple instruments, with more versatile instruments and the continued adoption of the MIDI standard, they were starting to appear with only one or two keyboards, typically a D-50 with either [[Yamaha DX7]] or Korg M1.\n\nThe D-50 was fully MIDI-compatible, though it transmits on only one channel. The keyboard was velocity- and after-touch-sensitive, and the keys were slightly \"weighted\" with metal for a higher-quality feel. It included 64 patches on-board, and 64 more patches were available on the expansion RAM card that was included. It uses a CR2032 lithium battery for memory backup.\n\nFor its sound and build quality, and the unique synthesis method it featured, the D-50 has remained popular to this day. Its synthesis engine, in more or less updated forms, was used in Roland's JV and XP series synths, among others. Furthermore, in 2004, Roland released a VC-1 expansion card for V-Synth and [[Roland VariOS|VariOS]] synthesizers. It contained a modeled and updated D-50 synthesis engine and the original operating system, including factory- and all Roland \"expansion cards\" patches. Since the newer DAC chips sounded \"cleaner\" with less noise output and overall higher bit and sample rates, it included the option to simulate the D-50's \"rougher\" output. \n\nThe D-550 is a rack-mount version of D-50, with fewer front panel controls, no joystick and sliders. It employs the same sound circuitry (the main circuit board is exactly the same in both, labeled \"D-50/D-550\")\n\n==Legacy==\nThe D-50 was introduced in 1987 as the popularity of the Yamaha DX7 was declining, resulting in the D-50 being the most popular synthesizer on the market until the introduction of the [[Korg M1]] the following year.<ref>Mark Vail, Vintage Synthesizers, Miller Freeman, 1993, p. 251</ref> The D-50's synthesizer-on-top-of-samples-and-through-effects innovation was an influence on the M1, which went on to become Korg's top selling keyboard, until the release of the [[Korg Triton]]. In fact, this scheme was a common method of digital keyboard sound creation for more than a decade, until ROM and Flash RAM were finally inexpensive enough to store entire samples or multisamples.\n\nIn the case of the D-50, for sound synthesis, the use of PCM samples can be bypassed completely when using Synth Partials only as the basis for sound creation. This effectively gives 4 DCO subtractive synthesis (resonant filters), which can produce some very analog like sounds that later synths could not due to their sole use of PCM samples, or 'more digital' sounding synthesis methods (such as FM or PM) as the basis for their sound creation. This digital subtractive synthesis method of sound production gave a similar, but colder and more clinical, sound when compared to the analog technology employed by previous Roland synthesizers, e.g. the previous flagship [[Roland JX-10|JX-10]].<ref>Julian Colbeck, Keyfax Omnibus Edition, MixBooks 1996, p. 97-100</ref>\n\nThe presets of the D-50, authored by [[Eric Persing]] and Adrian Scott, were well received by the artists' community, and most of them can be heard on numerous commercial albums of the late 1980s. The D-50's factory presets have enjoyed a long legacy, as patches like \"Digital Native Dance\", \"Staccato Heaven\", \"Fantasia\", \"Glass Voices\", and \"Living Calliope\" are so common that they border on cliche. Some other D-50 presets live on in every machine that conforms to the [[General MIDI]] specification, including \"Fantasia\" (alternatively called \"New Age Pad\"), \"Soundtrack\", \"Atmosphere\", and \"Nylon Atmosphere\".<ref name=\"SOSjul97\" />\n\nThe Roland V-Synth and V-Synth XT can load a card which emulates the D-50.  In this mode, they copy the D-50 almost perfectly, although they lose the more sophisticated V-Synth capabilities.\n\nOn September 8, 2017, Roland announced the [[Roland D-05]], a miniaturized version of the D-50, as part of their Boutique series.

It remained largely abandoned until the [[War Relocation Authority]], which oversaw the World War II incarceration program, took it over in 1942. It planned to use this facility to incarcerate ethnic Japanese, including American citizens from West Coast areas considered strategic to the war effort. Governor [[Homer Martin Adkins|Homer Adkins]] initially opposed the WRA's proposal to build Rohwer and its neighbor, [[Jerome War Relocation Center|Jerome]], in Arkansas, but relented after being assured that the Japanese American detainees would be controlled by armed white guards at these facilities and they would be removed from the state at the end of the war. During this era, Arkansas had Jim Crow laws and continued with its [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of African-American citizens]] started at the turn of the century.\n\nThe Linebarger-Senne Construction Company was contracted to build the camp at a cost of $4.8 million; it worked under the supervision of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. The land was heavily forested and swampy due to its proximity to the Mississippi River 5 miles to the east. Extensive clearing and draining was necessary, making construction at the site a difficult and slow-going task. The camp was still under construction when the first inmates began to arrive. Ultimately the camp held administrative offices, schools, a hospital, and 36 residential blocks, each with twelve 20' by 120' barracks divided into several \"apartments\", as well as communal dining and sanitary facilities, all contained within a guarded barbed-wire fence.<ref name='Niiya-Rohwer'/>\n\nThe architect of the camp was [[Edward F.

Most detainees had been forced out of their homes and businesses in [[Los Angeles]] or the [[San Joaquin Valley]] in California. A large portion of Rohwer inmates were school-age children, most born in the US. About 2,000 students attended the camp's schools, which were opened on November 9, 1942 after some delay. Adults took jobs with the administration, hospital, schools, and mess halls, in addition to agricultural work or labor details outside camp. As {{convert|500|acres}} of the site used for residences and other buildings, officials used the remainder of Rohwer's land to grow more than 100 agricultural products. These were used to supplement the inmates' food rations (kept to a bare minimum of 37 cents a day per inmate to avoid rumors that the WRA was \"coddling\" Japanese Americans).<ref name='Niiya-Rohwer'/>\n\nIn 1943, the WRA required all adults in Rohwer and the other camps to submit to a series of questions. Officially, it was presented as the registration process to obtain clearance to leave camp for work or school \u2014 and it was initially distributed only to the citizen [[Nisei]] who were eligible for leave, before being extended to the first-generation [[Issei]] \u2014 but administrators soon began to focus instead on assessing the \"loyalty\" of imprisoned Japanese Americans.\n\nThe \"[[Internment of Japanese Americans#Loyalty questions and segregation|loyalty questionnaire]],\" as it came to be known, created anger and confusion because of two questions: one asked Japanese Americans if they were willing to volunteer for military service (despite their mistreatment by the government and the army) and the other if they would \"forswear their allegiance to the Emperor of Japan\" (although many had never held such allegiance in the first place). The set-up of the questions was confusing and internees were suspicious of their true purpose.\n\nThe loyalty questionnaire and subsequent recruitment efforts proved especially unpopular in the Jerome camp, located 27 miles south of Rohwer. Only 2 percent of eligible men in Jerome (and in Rohwer) enlisted. Some 2,147 others, a quarter of Jerome's population, were classified as \"disloyal\" after giving unfavorable responses to the questionnaire. They were transferred to the \"segregation center\" at [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake]], California.<ref>Niiya, Brian. \"[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Jerome/ Jerome]\" ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 2014-08-07.</ref> The decline in population, combined with earlier unrest over poor working conditions in the camp, resulted in authorities closing the Jerome camp at the end of June 1944. A significant number of former Jerome inmates were transferred to Rohwer.\n\nTogether with the Tule Lake Segregation Center, Rohwer was the last WRA camp to close, on November 30, 1945.<ref name='Niiya-Rohwer'/>\n\n==Rohwer today==\n[[File:Monument to the Men of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team, Rohwer Memorial Cemetery.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to the Men of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team, Rohwer Memorial Cemetery]]\n[[File:Rohwer War Relocation Center 007.jpg|thumb|Monument to the men of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team]]\nThe largest remaining structure is the high school gymnasium/auditorium, which was added to and was in service with the local school before it closed in July 2004.

It was in operation from September 18, 1942, until November 30, 1945, and held as many as 8,475 Japanese Americans forcibly evacuated from California.<ref name='Niiya-Rohwer'>Niiya, Brian. \"[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Rohwer/ Rohwer]\" ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

It remained largely abandoned until the [[War Relocation Authority]], which oversaw the World War II incarceration program, took it over in 1942. It planned to use this facility to incarcerate ethnic Japanese, including American citizens from West Coast areas considered strategic to the war effort. Governor [[Homer Martin Adkins|Homer Adkins]] initially opposed the WRA's proposal to build Rohwer and its neighbor, [[Jerome War Relocation Center|Jerome]], in Arkansas, but relented after being assured that the Japanese American detainees would be controlled by armed white guards at these facilities and they would be removed from the state at the end of the war. During this era, Arkansas had Jim Crow laws and continued with its [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of African-American citizens]] started at the turn of the century.\n\nThe Linebarger-Senne Construction Company was contracted to build the camp at a cost of $4.8 million; it worked under the supervision of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. The land was heavily forested and swampy due to its proximity to the Mississippi River 5 miles to the east. Extensive clearing and draining was necessary, making construction at the site a difficult and slow-going task. The camp was still under construction when the first inmates began to arrive. Ultimately the camp held administrative offices, schools, a hospital, and 36 residential blocks, each with twelve 20' by 120' barracks divided into several \"apartments\", as well as communal dining and sanitary facilities, all contained within a guarded barbed-wire fence.<ref name='Niiya-Rohwer'/>\n\nThe architect of the camp was [[Edward F. Neild]] of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], who also designed the camp at Jerome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site31.php|title=Neild, Edward F.|publisher=lahisatory.org|accessdate=April 18, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512114056/http://www.lahistory.org/site31.php|archivedate=May 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rohwer Relocation Center, McGehee, Arkansas. In the wood carving class, at the Rohwer Center, this . . . - NARA - 539387.jpg|thumb|left|A young woman in the woodworking class]]\nRohwer opened on September 18, 1942, and reached a peak population of 8,475 by March 1943. Most detainees had been forced out of their homes and businesses in [[Los Angeles]] or the [[San Joaquin Valley]] in California. A large portion of Rohwer inmates were school-age children, most born in the US. About 2,000 students attended the camp's schools, which were opened on November 9, 1942 after some delay. Adults took jobs with the administration, hospital, schools, and mess halls, in addition to agricultural work or labor details outside camp. As {{convert|500|acres}} of the site used for residences and other buildings, officials used the remainder of Rohwer's land to grow more than 100 agricultural products. These were used to supplement the inmates' food rations (kept to a bare minimum of 37 cents a day per inmate to avoid rumors that the WRA was \"coddling\" Japanese Americans).<ref name='Niiya-Rohwer'/>\n\nIn 1943, the WRA required all adults in Rohwer and the other camps to submit to a series of questions. Officially, it was presented as the registration process to obtain clearance to leave camp for work or school \u2014 and it was initially distributed only to the citizen [[Nisei]] who were eligible for leave, before being extended to the first-generation [[Issei]] \u2014 but administrators soon began to focus instead on assessing the \"loyalty\" of imprisoned Japanese Americans.\n\nThe \"[[Internment of Japanese Americans#Loyalty questions and segregation|loyalty questionnaire]],\" as it came to be known, created anger and confusion because of two questions: one asked Japanese Americans if they were willing to volunteer for military service (despite their mistreatment by the government and the army) and the other if they would \"forswear their allegiance to the Emperor of Japan\" (although many had never held such allegiance in the first place). The set-up of the questions was confusing and internees were suspicious of their true purpose.\n\nThe loyalty questionnaire and subsequent recruitment efforts proved especially unpopular in the Jerome camp, located 27 miles south of Rohwer. Only 2 percent of eligible men in Jerome (and in Rohwer) enlisted. Some 2,147 others, a quarter of Jerome's population, were classified as \"disloyal\" after giving unfavorable responses to the questionnaire. They were transferred to the \"segregation center\" at [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake]], California.<ref>Niiya, Brian. \"[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Jerome/ Jerome]\" ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 2014-08-07.</ref> The decline in population, combined with earlier unrest over poor working conditions in the camp, resulted in authorities closing the Jerome camp at the end of June 1944. A significant number of former Jerome inmates were transferred to Rohwer.\n\nTogether with the Tule Lake Segregation Center, Rohwer was the last WRA camp to close, on November 30, 1945.<ref name='Niiya-Rohwer'/>\n\n==Rohwer today==\n[[File:Monument to the Men of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team, Rohwer Memorial Cemetery.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to the Men of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team, Rohwer Memorial Cemetery]]\n[[File:Rohwer War Relocation Center 007.jpg|thumb|Monument to the men of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team]]\nThe largest remaining structure is the high school gymnasium/auditorium, which was added to and was in service with the local school before it closed in July 2004.

Under this order, over 110,000 Japanese Americans and their immigrant parents were forcibly removed from the three Pacific Coast States&mdash;California, Oregon, and Washington. In all, ten camps were established in desolate sites, all chosen for their distance from the Pacific Coast. Over 10,000 evacuees passed through Rohwer during its existence, and over two thirds of these were American citizens. The monuments found within the camp's cemetery are perhaps the most poignant record of this time.\"<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn its summary on the Rohwer Relocation Center Cemetery, the National Park Service indicates that the cemetery's condition is threatened due to deterioration of the grave markers and monuments, but that ownership of the site is unclear.<ref name = \"nhlsum\"/> Deterioration is visible in photographs of the site.

Applications use RocksDB as a library, as it does not provide a server or command-line interface.\n\n== History ==\nRocksDB was created at [[Facebook]] by Dhruba Borthakur<ref>{{cite web |url= https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/cc6c32535aec596036c56fe742a39182539f76fa |title=First commit where RocksDB diverges from LevelDB |date=May 10, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/6eb5ed9a4922ec2d121768adfa3ab3b6ead5d627 |title=rocksdb README file |date=Nov 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref> in April 2012, as a fork of [[LevelDB]] with the initial stated goal of improving performance for server workloads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rocksdb.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-history-of-rocksdb.html |title=The History of RocksDB |date= November 24, 2013 |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_C-T5S-w8g |title=RocksDB: A High Performance Embedded Key-Value Store for Flash Storage - Data@Scale |date= November 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 10, 2016 |quote=...&nbsp;The story of why we decided to do RocksDB&nbsp;... |first1=Dhruba |last1=Borthakur}}</ref>\n\n== Integration ==\nAs an embeddable database, RocksDB can be used as a storage engine within a larger [[database]] management system (DBMS). For example, [[CockroachDB]] uses RocksDB as its storage engine<ref>{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Jessica |url=http://thenewstack.io/cockroachdb-unkillable-distributed-sql-database/ |title=Hello World: Meet CockroachDB, the Resilient SQL Database |work=The New Stack |date=2015-10-29 |accessdate=2016-07-08}}</ref>, mostly for transactional workloads while [https://rockset.com/blog/how-we-use-rocksdb-at-rockset/ Rockset] uses RocksDB mostly for analytical data processing. This shows that RocksDB can be used as a storage engine for both [[Online transaction processing]] and [[Online analytical processing]].\n\n=== Alternative backend ===\nThe following projects have been started to replace or offer an alternative storage engines for already-established database systems with RocksDB:\n\n==== ArangoDB ====\n[[ArangoDB]] has added RocksDB to its previous storage engine (\"mmfiles\")<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arangodb.com/why-arangodb/comparing-rocksdb-mmfiles-storage-engines/|title=Comparing new RocksDB and MMFiles storage engines|publisher=}}</ref>. Starting with ArangoDB 3.4, RocksDB will be the default storage engine in ArangoDB<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arangodb.com/2018/09/rc1-arangodb-3-4-whats-new/|title=RC1 ArangoDB 3.4 - Whats
