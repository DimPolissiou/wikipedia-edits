Ellmann (1982) p. 21.</ref> Aloysius Joyce''' (2 February 1882 \u2013 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, poet, teacher, and literary critic. He contributed to the [[Modernism|modernist]] [[avant-garde]] and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Other well-known works are the short-story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914), and the novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.\n\nJoyce was born in [[Dublin]] into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run [[O'Connell School]] before excelling at the Jesuit schools [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] and [[Belvedere College|Belvedere]], despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's unpredictable finances. He went on to attend [[University College Dublin]].\n\nIn 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) [[Nora Barnacle]]. They lived in [[Trieste]], [[Paris]], and [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. ''Ulysses'' in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of ''Ulysses'', he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, \"For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.\"<ref>Ellman, p. 505, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House'' (London, n.d.), pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:James Joyce birth and baptismal certificate.jpg|thumb|Joyce's birth and baptismal certificate]]\nOn 2 February 1882, Joyce was born at 41 Brighton Square, [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]], Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/what-does-joyce-mean-to-you-1.678911|title=What does Joyce mean to you?|first=Rosita|last=Bol|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> Joyce's father was [[John Stanislaus Joyce]] and his mother was Mary Jane \"May\" Murray. He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings; two died of [[typhoid]]. James was baptised according to the Rites of the [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic Church]] in the nearby St Joseph's Church in [[Terenure]] on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O'Mulloy. Joyce's godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann.\n\nJohn Stanislaus Joyce's family came from [[Fermoy]] in [[County Cork]], and had owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork Alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City.

Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, leading to his lifelong [[cynophobia]]. He suffered from [[astraphobia]]; a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms as a sign of God's wrath.<ref>\"'Why are you so afraid of thunder?' asked [Arthur] Power, 'your children don't mind it.' 'Ah,' said Joyce contemptuously, 'they have no religion.' Joyce's fears were part of his identity, and he had no wish, even if he had had the power, to slough any of them off.\" Ellmann (1982), p. 514, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House''  (London, n.d.), p. 71</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on the death of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic Church, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Home Rule Party]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|British Liberal Party]] and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce.<ref>In Search of Ireland's Heroes: [[Carmel McCaffrey]] pp. 279\u201386</ref> The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the [[Vatican Library]]. In November, John Joyce was entered in ''[[Stubbs' Gazette]]'' (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 32\u201334.</ref>\n\nJoyce had begun his education at [[Clongowes Wood College]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boarding school near [[Clane]], County Kildare, in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the [[O'Connell School|Christian Brothers O'Connell School]] on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits' Dublin school, [[Belvedere College]], in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest called [[John Conmee]] who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere.<ref>James Joyce: Richard Ellmann 1982 pp. 54\u201355</ref> In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] by his peers at Belvedere.<ref>[http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/joyce_chronology.html Themodernworld.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622062917/http://www.themodernword.com/Joyce/joyce_chronology.html |date=22 June 2011 }}</ref> The philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 60, 190, 340, 342; Cf.

He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' was published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]''; it was his first publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, [[Tom Kettle]], [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]] and [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]]. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by [[Arthur Griffith]] in his newspaper, ''[[United Irishman]]'', in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce.<ref>Jordan, Anthony, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0220/1224312050318.html \"An Irishman's Diary\"], ''Irish Times'', 20 February 2012</ref><ref>Arthur Griffith with James Joyce & WB Yeats \u2013 Liberating Ireland by Anthony J.

Richard Ellmann suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult. Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin. But Joyce claimed ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather.<ref>Richard Ellmann: James Joyce (1959) pp. 117\u201318</ref> He stayed on for a few months, appealing for finance his family could ill-afford and reading late in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]].

He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called ''Stephen Hero''. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''. The unfinished ''Stephen Hero'' was published after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=28 |title=Joyce \u2013 Other works |publisher=The James Joyce Centre |accessdate=22 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624115127/http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=28 |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1904, he met [[Nora Barnacle]], a young woman from [[Galway|Galway city]] who was working as a chambermaid.

It later became evident that the agent had been swindled; the director of the school sent Joyce on to [[Trieste]], which was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in [[Pula|Pola]], then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of [[Croatia]]). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians\u2014having discovered an espionage ring in the city\u2014expelled all [[Alien (law)|aliens]]. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.<ref name=\"mccourt\">McCourt 2001.</ref><ref>[https://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/james-joyce-in-trieste/ \"James Joyce in Trieste\", Radio Netherlands Archives, January 1, 2000]</ref>\n\nLater that year Nora gave birth to their first child, George (known as Giorgio). Joyce persuaded his brother, Stanislaus, to join him in Trieste, and secured a teaching position for him at the school. Joyce sought to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings.<ref>According to Ellmann, Stanislaus allowed Joyce to collect his pay, \"to simplify matters\" (p. 213).</ref> Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations while they lived together in Trieste, arguing about Joyce's drinking habits and frivolity with money.<ref>The worst of the conflicts were during July 1910 (Ellmann (1982), pp. 311\u201313).</ref>\n\nJoyce became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank. He disliked Rome and returned to Trieste in early 1907. His daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] was born later that year.<ref>Williams, Bob.

He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the [[Volta Cinematograph]], which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 300\u201303, 308, 311.</ref> Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying the [[Czech people|Czech]] bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 384\u201385.</ref>\n\nJoyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of ''Dubliners''. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem \"Gas from a Burner\", an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from his fellow Irish writer [[William Butler Yeats]].\n\nOne of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym [[Italo Svevo]]. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] in ''Ulysses'' came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), p. 272.</ref> While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 268, 417.</ref>\n\nJoyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema [[Business magnate|magnate]] in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in [[Dublin]]. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.\n\nIn 1915, after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in the [[World War I|Great War]], Joyce moved to Z\u00fcrich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.<ref>Ellman (1982), p. 386.</ref>\n\nDuring this period Joyce took an active interest in [[socialism]].<ref name=\"Sultan\">{{cite book |last1=Sultan |first1=Stanley |title=Eliot, Joyce, and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/nley00stan |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nley00stan/page/208 208\u2013209]}}</ref> He had attended socialist meetings when he was still in Dublin and 1905, while in Trieste, he described his politics as \"those of a socialist artist.\"<ref name=\"Sultan\" /> Although his practical engagement waned after 1907 due to the \"endless internecine warfare\" he observed in socialist organizations, many Joyce scholars such as [[Richard Ellmann]], Dominic Manganiello, [[Robert Scholes]], and George J.

Portrait by [[Patrick Tuohy]].]]\n\nJoyce set himself to finishing ''Ulysses'' in Paris, delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an [[eyepatch]]. He was treated by Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929.<ref>Ellmann (1982) pp. 566\u201374.</ref> Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. Lucia was analysed by [[Carl Jung]] at the time, who after reading ''Ulysses'' is said to have concluded that her father had schizophrenia.<ref>Shloss, p. 278.</ref> Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.<ref>Pepper, Tara</ref><ref>Shloss p. 297.</ref><ref>The literary executor of the Joyce estate, [[Stephen J.

Retrieved 9 July 2007). Stephen Joyce stated in a letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"Regarding the destroyed correspondence, these were all personal letters from Lucia to us.

Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's constant financial support), there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]'', the Jolases published serially various sections of ''Finnegans Wake'' under the title ''Work in Progress''. Joyce returned to Z\u00fcrich in late 1940, fleeing the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]]. Joyce used his contacts to help some sixteen Jews escape Nazi persecution.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Platt |first1=Len |title=James Joyce: Texts and Contexts |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=131}}</ref>\n\n===Joyce and religion===\nThe issue of Joyce's relationship with religion is somewhat controversial. Early in life, he lapsed from Catholicism, according to first-hand testimonies coming from himself, his brother Stanislaus Joyce, and his wife:\n\n<blockquote>My mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity\u2014home, the recognised virtues, classes of life and religious doctrines. ... Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.<ref>Letter to Nora Barnacle. 29 August 1904. In ''Selected Letters of James Joyce''. Richard Ellmann, ed.

Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A ''[[K\u00fcnstlerroman]]'', ''Portrait'' is a heavily autobiographical<ref>MacBride, p. 14.</ref> [[bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist [[Stephen Dedalus]] and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.<ref>Deming, p. 749.</ref>\n\n===''Exiles'' and poetry===\n{{Main|Pomes Penyeach|Chamber Music (poetry collection)}}\n\nDespite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'', begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.\n\nJoyce published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside \"The Holy Office\" (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the [[Celtic Revival]]. His first full-length poetry collection, ''[[Chamber Music (poetry collection)|Chamber Music]]'' (1907; referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot), consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by [[Ezra Pound]], who was a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime include \"Gas from a Burner\" (1912), ''Pomes Penyeach'' (1927) and \"Ecce Puer\" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in ''Collected Poems'' (1936).\n\n===''Ulysses''===\n{{Main|Ulysses (novel)}}\n{{See also|Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review}}\n\n[[File:Order form for ulysses.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Page saying 'ULYSSES by JAMES JOYCE will be published in the Autumn of 1921 by \"SHAKESPEARE AND COMPANY\" \u2013 SYLVIA BEACH \u2013 8, RUE DUPUYTREN, PARIS \u2013 VIe'|Announcement of the initial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.]]\nAs he was completing work on ''Dubliners'' in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).\n\nThanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in March 1918. This magazine was edited by [[Margaret C. Anderson]] and [[Jane Heap]], with the intermittent financial backing of [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature.\n\nThis provoked the first accusations of obscenity with which the book would be identified for so long. Its amorphous structure with frank, intimate musings (\u2018stream of consciousness\u2019) were seen to offend both church and state. The publication encountered problems with [[United States Postal Service|New York Postal Authorities]]; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920; the editors were convicted of publishing [[obscenity]] in February 1921.<ref>[[Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review]]; Gillers, pp. 251\u201362.</ref> Although the conviction was based on the \"Nausica\u00e4\" episode of ''Ulysses'', ''The Little Review'' had fuelled the fires of controversy with [[dada]] poet [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]'s defence of ''Ulysses'' in an essay \"The Modest Woman.\"<ref>[[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]]. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 253.</ref> Joyce's novel was not published in the United States until 1934.<ref>The fear of prosecution for publication ended after the court decision of ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'', 5 F.Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y. 1933). Ellman, pp. 666\u201367.</ref>\n\nPartly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by [[Sylvia Beach]] from her well-known [[Rive Gauche]] bookshop, ''[[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]]''. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, [[John Rodker]] produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at [[Folkestone]]. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of \"bootleg\" versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher [[Samuel Roth]]. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.\n\nWith the appearance of both ''Ulysses'' and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'', 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In ''Ulysses'', Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters.<ref>Examined at length in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Ulysses. A Facsimile of the Manuscript.'' Bloomfield Hills/Columbia: Bruccoli Clark, 1980.</ref> The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the [[Odyssey]] of [[Homer]] in modern Dublin and represents [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]] and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]] and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model.<ref>Adams, David. ''Colonial Odysseys: Empire and Epic in the Modernist Novel''. Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 84.</ref> In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of ''[[Thom's Directory]]''\u2014a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.\n\nThe book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8&nbsp;a.m. and ending sometime after 2&nbsp;a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature.<ref>Sherry, Vincent B. ''James Joyce: Ulysses''. Cambridge University\nPress, 2004, p. 102.</ref> Other contributions include the use of [[classical mythology]] as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, \"I may have oversystematised ''Ulysses'',\" and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer.<ref>Dettmar, Kevin J.H. ''Rereading the New: A Backward Glance at Modernism''. University of Michigan Press, 1992, p. 285.</ref> Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. It was only when [[Stuart Gilbert]] published his critical work on ''Ulysses'' in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.<ref name=\"Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen\">Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen</ref>\n\n===''Finnegans Wake''===\n{{Main|Finnegans Wake}}\nHaving completed work on ''Ulysses'', Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year.<ref>Bulson, Eric. ''The Cambridge Introduction to James Joyce''. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 14.</ref> On 10 March 1923 he informed his patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver: \"Yesterday I wrote two pages\u2014the first I have since the final ''Yes'' of ''Ulysses''. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of [[wikt:foolscap|foolscap]] so that I could read them. ''Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio'', the Italians say. 'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice' or 'the leopard cannot change his spots.'\"<ref>Joyce, James. ''Ulysses: The 1922 Text''. Oxford University Press, 1998, p. xlvii.</ref> Thus was born a text that became known, first, as ''Work in Progress'' and later ''Finnegans Wake''.\n\nBy 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine ''transition''. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]], and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including [[Samuel Beckett]]. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 591\u201392.</ref>\n\nReaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, Stanislaus Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 577\u201385.</ref> To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, [[William Carlos Williams]] and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]''. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and ''Finnegans Wake'' was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author [[Hervey M. Cleckley|Hervey Cleckley]], who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'', Cleckley refers to ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as \"a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital.\"<ref>Cleckley, Hervey (1982). The Mask of Sanity. Revised Edition. Mosby Medical Library. {{ISBN|0-452-25341-1}}.</ref>\n\nJoyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in ''Finnegans Wake'', which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in ''[[Jabberwocky]]''. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the ''Wake'' of ''Ulysses'' as his \"usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 179. 26\u201327.</ref> to the ''Wake'' itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.\n\nMuch of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.<ref>Gluck, p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by [[Giambattista Vico]], and the metaphysics of [[Giordano Bruno]] of [[Nola]] are important to the interplay of the \"characters\". Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. ''Finnegans Wake'' opens with the words \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs\" (\"vicus\" is a pun on Vico) and ends \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the\". In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle.<ref>{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Shockley |editor1-first=Alan W. |editor1-last=Friedman |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Rossman |title=De-Familiarizing Readings: Essays from the Austin Joyce Conference |publisher=Editions Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-420-2570-7 |series=European Joyce Studies |volume=18 |year=2009 |page=104 |chapter=Playing the Square Circle: Musical Form and Polyphony in the ''Wake'' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lW96fbBNRYsC&pg=PA104 }}</ref> Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the ''Wake'' would suffer from \"ideal insomnia\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 120. 9\u201316.</ref> and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Joyce oconnell dublin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Bronze statue of Joyce standing in a coat and broadbrimmed hat.

Ellmann (1982) p. 21.</ref> Aloysius Joyce''' (2 February 1882 \u2013 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, poet, teacher, and literary critic. He contributed to the [[Modernism|modernist]] [[avant-garde]] and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Other well-known works are the short-story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914), and the novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.\n\nJoyce was born in [[Dublin]] into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run [[O'Connell School]] before excelling at the Jesuit schools [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] and [[Belvedere College|Belvedere]], despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's unpredictable finances. He went on to attend [[University College Dublin]].\n\nIn 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) [[Nora Barnacle]]. They lived in [[Trieste]], [[Paris]], and [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. ''Ulysses'' in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of ''Ulysses'', he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, \"For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.\"<ref>Ellman, p. 505, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House'' (London, n.d.), pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:James Joyce birth and baptismal certificate.jpg|thumb|Joyce's birth and baptismal certificate]]\nOn 2 February 1882, Joyce was born at 41 Brighton Square, [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]], Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/what-does-joyce-mean-to-you-1.678911|title=What does Joyce mean to you?|first=Rosita|last=Bol|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> Joyce's father was [[John Stanislaus Joyce]] and his mother was Mary Jane \"May\" Murray. He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings; two died of [[typhoid]]. James was baptised according to the Rites of the [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic Church]] in the nearby St Joseph's Church in [[Terenure]] on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O'Mulloy. Joyce's godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann.\n\nJohn Stanislaus Joyce's family came from [[Fermoy]] in [[County Cork]], and had owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork Alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City.

Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, leading to his lifelong [[cynophobia]]. He suffered from [[astraphobia]]; a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms as a sign of God's wrath.<ref>\"'Why are you so afraid of thunder?' asked [Arthur] Power, 'your children don't mind it.' 'Ah,' said Joyce contemptuously, 'they have no religion.' Joyce's fears were part of his identity, and he had no wish, even if he had had the power, to slough any of them off.\" Ellmann (1982), p. 514, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House''  (London, n.d.), p. 71</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on the death of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic Church, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Home Rule Party]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|British Liberal Party]] and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce.<ref>In Search of Ireland's Heroes: [[Carmel McCaffrey]] pp. 279\u201386</ref> The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the [[Vatican Library]]. In November, John Joyce was entered in ''[[Stubbs' Gazette]]'' (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 32\u201334.</ref>\n\nJoyce had begun his education at [[Clongowes Wood College]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boarding school near [[Clane]], County Kildare, in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the [[O'Connell School|Christian Brothers O'Connell School]] on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits' Dublin school, [[Belvedere College]], in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest called [[John Conmee]] who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere.<ref>James Joyce: Richard Ellmann 1982 pp. 54\u201355</ref> In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] by his peers at Belvedere.<ref>[http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/joyce_chronology.html Themodernworld.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622062917/http://www.themodernword.com/Joyce/joyce_chronology.html |date=22 June 2011 }}</ref> The philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 60, 190, 340, 342; Cf.

He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' was published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]''; it was his first publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, [[Tom Kettle]], [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]] and [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]]. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by [[Arthur Griffith]] in his newspaper, ''[[United Irishman]]'', in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce.<ref>Jordan, Anthony, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0220/1224312050318.html \"An Irishman's Diary\"], ''Irish Times'', 20 February 2012</ref><ref>Arthur Griffith with James Joyce & WB Yeats \u2013 Liberating Ireland by Anthony J.

Richard Ellmann suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult. Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin. But Joyce claimed ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather.<ref>Richard Ellmann: James Joyce (1959) pp. 117\u201318</ref> He stayed on for a few months, appealing for finance his family could ill-afford and reading late in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]]. When his mother was diagnosed with cancer, his father sent a telegram which read, \"NOTHER {{sic}} DYING COME HOME FATHER\".<ref>She was originally diagnosed with [[cirrhosis of the liver]], but this proved incorrect, and she was diagnosed with cancer in April 1903. Ellmann (1982), pp. 128\u201329</ref> Joyce returned to Ireland. Fearing for her son's impiety, his mother tried unsuccessfully to get Joyce to make his confession and to take communion.

He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called ''Stephen Hero''. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''.

It later became evident that the agent had been swindled; the director of the school sent Joyce on to [[Trieste]], which was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in [[Pula|Pola]], then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of [[Croatia]]). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians\u2014having discovered an espionage ring in the city\u2014expelled all [[Alien (law)|aliens]]. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there.

He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the [[Volta Cinematograph]], which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 300\u201303, 308, 311.</ref> Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying the [[Czech people|Czech]] bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 384\u201385.</ref>\n\nJoyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of ''Dubliners''. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem \"Gas from a Burner\", an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from his fellow Irish writer [[William Butler Yeats]].\n\nOne of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym [[Italo Svevo]]. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] in ''Ulysses'' came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), p. 272.</ref> While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 268, 417.</ref>\n\nJoyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema [[Business magnate|magnate]] in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in [[Dublin]]. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.\n\nIn 1915, after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in the [[World War I|Great War]], Joyce moved to Z\u00fcrich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.<ref>Ellman (1982), p. 386.</ref>\n\nDuring this period Joyce took an active interest in [[socialism]].<ref name=\"Sultan\">{{cite book |last1=Sultan |first1=Stanley |title=Eliot, Joyce, and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/nley00stan |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nley00stan/page/208 208\u2013209]}}</ref> He had attended socialist meetings when he was still in Dublin and 1905, while in Trieste, he described his politics as \"those of a socialist artist.\"<ref name=\"Sultan\" /> Although his practical engagement waned after 1907 due to the \"endless internecine warfare\" he observed in socialist organizations, many Joyce scholars such as [[Richard Ellmann]], Dominic Manganiello, [[Robert Scholes]], and George J.

Portrait by [[Patrick Tuohy]].]]\n\nJoyce set himself to finishing ''Ulysses'' in Paris, delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an [[eyepatch]]. He was treated by Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929.<ref>Ellmann (1982) pp. 566\u201374.</ref> Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from [[schizophrenia]].

Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's constant financial support), there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]'', the Jolases published serially various sections of ''Finnegans Wake'' under the title ''Work in Progress''. Joyce returned to Z\u00fcrich in late 1940, fleeing the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]].

Early in life, he lapsed from Catholicism, according to first-hand testimonies coming from himself, his brother Stanislaus Joyce, and his wife:\n\n<blockquote>My mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity\u2014home, the recognised virtues, classes of life and religious doctrines. ... Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.<ref>Letter to Nora Barnacle. 29 August 1904. In ''Selected Letters of James Joyce''. Richard Ellmann, ed.

The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in ''Dubliners'' later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel ''Ulysses''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~mgroden/notes/charsfromdub.html |title=Notes on James Joyce's Ulysses |author=Michael Groden |publisher=[[The University of Western Ontario]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101010343/http://publish.uwo.ca/~mgroden/notes/charsfromdub.html |archivedate=1 November 2005 |df= }}</ref> The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.\n\n===''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''===\n{{Main|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man}}\n''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel ''[[Stephen Hero]]''. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A ''[[K\u00fcnstlerroman]]'', ''Portrait'' is a heavily autobiographical<ref>MacBride, p. 14.</ref> [[bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist [[Stephen Dedalus]] and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.<ref>Deming, p. 749.</ref>\n\n===''Exiles'' and poetry===\n{{Main|Pomes Penyeach|Chamber Music (poetry collection)}}\n\nDespite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'', begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.\n\nJoyce published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside \"The Holy Office\" (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the [[Celtic Revival]]. His first full-length poetry collection, ''[[Chamber Music (poetry collection)|Chamber Music]]'' (1907; referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot), consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by [[Ezra Pound]], who was a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime include \"Gas from a Burner\" (1912), ''Pomes Penyeach'' (1927) and \"Ecce Puer\" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in ''Collected Poems'' (1936).\n\n===''Ulysses''===\n{{Main|Ulysses (novel)}}\n{{See also|Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review}}\n\n[[File:Order form for ulysses.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Page saying 'ULYSSES by JAMES JOYCE will be published in the Autumn of 1921 by \"SHAKESPEARE AND COMPANY\" \u2013 SYLVIA BEACH \u2013 8, RUE DUPUYTREN, PARIS \u2013 VIe'|Announcement of the initial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.]]\nAs he was completing work on ''Dubliners'' in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).\n\nThanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in March 1918. This magazine was edited by [[Margaret C. Anderson]] and [[Jane Heap]], with the intermittent financial backing of [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature.\n\nThis provoked the first accusations of obscenity with which the book would be identified for so long. Its amorphous structure with frank, intimate musings (\u2018stream of consciousness\u2019) were seen to offend both church and state. The publication encountered problems with [[United States Postal Service|New York Postal Authorities]]; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920; the editors were convicted of publishing [[obscenity]] in February 1921.<ref>[[Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review]]; Gillers, pp. 251\u201362.</ref> Although the conviction was based on the \"Nausica\u00e4\" episode of ''Ulysses'', ''The Little Review'' had fuelled the fires of controversy with [[dada]] poet [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]'s defence of ''Ulysses'' in an essay \"The Modest Woman.\"<ref>[[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]]. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 253.</ref> Joyce's novel was not published in the United States until 1934.<ref>The fear of prosecution for publication ended after the court decision of ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'', 5 F.Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y. 1933). Ellman, pp. 666\u201367.</ref>\n\nPartly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by [[Sylvia Beach]] from her well-known [[Rive Gauche]] bookshop, ''[[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]]''. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, [[John Rodker]] produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at [[Folkestone]]. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of \"bootleg\" versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher [[Samuel Roth]]. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.\n\nWith the appearance of both ''Ulysses'' and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'', 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In ''Ulysses'', Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters.<ref>Examined at length in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Ulysses. A Facsimile of the Manuscript.'' Bloomfield Hills/Columbia: Bruccoli Clark, 1980.</ref> The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the [[Odyssey]] of [[Homer]] in modern Dublin and represents [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]] and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]] and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model.<ref>Adams, David. ''Colonial Odysseys: Empire and Epic in the Modernist Novel''. Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 84.</ref> In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of ''[[Thom's Directory]]''\u2014a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.\n\nThe book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8&nbsp;a.m. and ending sometime after 2&nbsp;a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature.<ref>Sherry, Vincent B. ''James Joyce: Ulysses''. Cambridge University\nPress, 2004, p. 102.</ref> Other contributions include the use of [[classical mythology]] as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, \"I may have oversystematised ''Ulysses'',\" and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer.<ref>Dettmar, Kevin J.H. ''Rereading the New: A Backward Glance at Modernism''. University of Michigan Press, 1992, p. 285.</ref> Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. It was only when [[Stuart Gilbert]] published his critical work on ''Ulysses'' in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.<ref name=\"Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen\">Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen</ref>\n\n===''Finnegans Wake''===\n{{Main|Finnegans Wake}}\nHaving completed work on ''Ulysses'', Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year.<ref>Bulson, Eric. ''The Cambridge Introduction to James Joyce''. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 14.</ref> On 10 March 1923 he informed his patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver: \"Yesterday I wrote two pages\u2014the first I have since the final ''Yes'' of ''Ulysses''. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of [[wikt:foolscap|foolscap]] so that I could read them. ''Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio'', the Italians say. 'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice' or 'the leopard cannot change his spots.'\"<ref>Joyce, James. ''Ulysses: The 1922 Text''. Oxford University Press, 1998, p. xlvii.</ref> Thus was born a text that became known, first, as ''Work in Progress'' and later ''Finnegans Wake''.\n\nBy 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine ''transition''. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]], and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including [[Samuel Beckett]]. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 591\u201392.</ref>\n\nReaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, Stanislaus Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 577\u201385.</ref> To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, [[William Carlos Williams]] and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]''. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and ''Finnegans Wake'' was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author [[Hervey M. Cleckley|Hervey Cleckley]], who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'', Cleckley refers to ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as \"a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital.\"<ref>Cleckley, Hervey (1982). The Mask of Sanity. Revised Edition. Mosby Medical Library. {{ISBN|0-452-25341-1}}.</ref>\n\nJoyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in ''Finnegans Wake'', which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in ''[[Jabberwocky]]''. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the ''Wake'' of ''Ulysses'' as his \"usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 179. 26\u201327.</ref> to the ''Wake'' itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.\n\nMuch of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.<ref>Gluck, p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by [[Giambattista Vico]], and the metaphysics of [[Giordano Bruno]] of [[Nola]] are important to the interplay of the \"characters\". Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. ''Finnegans Wake'' opens with the words \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs\" (\"vicus\" is a pun on Vico) and ends \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the\". In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle.<ref>{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Shockley |editor1-first=Alan W. |editor1-last=Friedman |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Rossman |title=De-Familiarizing Readings: Essays from the Austin Joyce Conference |publisher=Editions Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-420-2570-7 |series=European Joyce Studies |volume=18 |year=2009 |page=104 |chapter=Playing the Square Circle: Musical Form and Polyphony in the ''Wake'' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lW96fbBNRYsC&pg=PA104 }}</ref> Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the ''Wake'' would suffer from \"ideal insomnia\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 120. 9\u201316.</ref> and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Joyce oconnell dublin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Bronze statue of Joyce standing in a coat and broadbrimmed hat.
