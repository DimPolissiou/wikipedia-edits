{"title_page": "Enhanced Primary Care Case Management Program", "text_new": "\n\n'''Primary Care Case Management (PCCM),''' is a program of the United States government healthcare service [[Medicaid]].

Use increased steadily through the 1990s.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1981, the 97th session of [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) which allowed state Medicaid programs to implement risk-based managed care programs as well as PCCM, pending HCFA (now known as [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]]) waiver approval.  The state had to meet two requirements in order to be granted HCFA approval.\n* The case management restrictions must not \"substantially impair access\" to primary care services of \"adequate quality where medically necessary;\" and\n* The case management restrictions must be \"cost effective.\"<ref>{{cite report|first=Deborah A.|last=Freund|title=Medicaid Reform: Four Studies of Case Management|location=Washington, DC|publisher=American Enterprise Institute|year=1984}}</ref>\n\nIn their earliest forms, PCCM programs closely resembled traditional fee-for-service Medicaid than managed care. Some states developed PCCM as a first step towards risk-based managed care and considered their [[Managed Care Organization|MCO]] contracts as the main managed care system.

{"title_page": "Flight number", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}\n[[Image:Flight numbers.jpg|thumb|200px|Flight numbers on a [[split-flap display]] (Frankfurt airport)]]\nIn the aviation industry, a '''flight number''' or '''flight designator''' is a code for an airline service consisting of two-character [[Airline codes#IATA airline designator|airline designator]] and a 1 to 4 digit number.<ref>IATA Passenger Glossary of Terms (15 June 2018) [www.iata.org/whatwedo/passenger/.../IATA-Passenger-Glossary-of-Terms.xlsx]</ref> For example, \"BA 98\" is a [[British Airways]] service from [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto-Pearson]] to [[Heathrow Airport|London-Heathrow]]. A service is called \"[[direct flight|direct]]\" if it is covered by a single flight number, regardless of the number of stops or [[Change of gauge (aviation)|equipment changes]]. For example, \"WN 417\" flies from Jacksonville to Baltimore to Oakland to Los Angeles. A given flight segment may have multiple flight numbers on different airlines under a [[Codeshare agreement|code-sharing agreement]]. Strictly speaking, the flight number is just the numerical part, but it is commonly used for the entire flight designator.\n\nThe flight designator of the [[operating carrier]] of a commercial flight is used as a call sign.<ref>[[ICAO]], \"Glossary\" [https://www.icao.int/dataplus_archive/Documents/GLOSSARY.docx]</ref> This is distinct from the [[aircraft registration|aircraft's registration number]], which identifies a specific airplane.\n\n==Conventions==\nA number of conventions have been developed for defining flight numbers, although these vary widely from airline to airline, and are increasingly being modified.<ref>Peter Newell, \"Flight Numbering Alternatives\", ''Ascend: A Magazine for Airline Executives'', issue 2, 2014 [http://www.ascendforairlines.com/2014-issue-no-2/flight-numbering-alternatives]</ref> Eastbound and northbound flights are traditionally assigned [[Even and odd numbers|even numbers]], while westbound and southbound flights have odd numbers. Other airlines will use an odd number for an outbound flight and use the next even number for the reverse inbound flight.  For destinations served by multiple flights per day, numbers tend to increase during the day.  Hence, a flight from point A to point B might be flight 101 and the return flight from B to A would be 102, while the next pair of flights on the same route would usually be assigned codes 103 and 104.\n\nFlight numbers of less than three digits are often assigned to long-haul or otherwise premium flights. Flight number 1 is often used for an airline's \"flagship\" service. For example, British Airways flight 1 was the early morning [[supersonic]] [[Concorde]] service from [[London]] to [[New York City]] and is now a premium business-class only flight between the same cities; [[Air New Zealand]] flight 1 is the daily service from [[London]] to [[Auckland]] via [[Los Angeles]]; [[Qantas]] flight 1 is the daily [[Kangaroo Route]] from [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]]  via [[Singapore Changi Airport|Singapore]] to [[London Heathrow Airport|London]]. [[American Airlines]] Flight 1 is the daily flight from New York to Los Angeles; Both [[Singapore Airlines]] (SQ) and [[United Airlines]] (UA) Flights 1 are the daily flight from [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] to [[Singapore Changi Airport|Singapore]], although SQ1 does a stop-over in Hong Kong while UA1 is a nonstop flight, [[Virgin Atlantic]] VS1 is the daily Heathrow to [[Newark Liberty Airport|Newark]] flight but has now been terminated<ref> https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/virgin-atlantic-coronavirus-flight-cancelled-fleet-latest-a9404356.html </ref> ; [[El Al]] flight 1 is the daily overnight service from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[New York City]]; [[Air Canada]] flight 1 is a nonstop flight from [[Toronto Pearson Airport|Toronto-Pearson]] to [[Tokyo Haneda Airport|Tokyo-Haneda]] and; [[WestJet]] flight 1 is a nonstop flight from [[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] to [[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]].\n\nFour-digit numbers in the range 3000 to 5999 typically represent regional affiliate flights, while numbers larger than 6000 are generally [[code sharing|codeshare]] numbers for flights operated by different airlines or even [[high-speed rail|railways]].\n\nLikewise, flight numbers larger than 9000 usually refer to [[dead mileage|ferry flights]]; these carry no passengers and are used to relocate aircraft to or from a maintenance base, or from one air travel market to another in order to start new commercial flights. Flight numbers starting with 8 are often used for charter flights, but it always depends on the commercial carrier's choice.\n\n==Codeshare==\n{{main|Codeshare agreement}}\nIn a codeshare, airlines shares its aircraft with another airline, resulting in the flight having more than one flight number on the same sector, and either the same or different flight numbers on joined sectors.\n\nAs a hypothetical example, flight QQ1234 may fly from airport AAA to BBB to CCC. The AAA-BBB segment may be serviced by airline QQ, and the BBB-CCC segment by airline RR, on a different aircraft. The same flight may also be sold as RR3210, and by a third airline SS as SS2345. Also, the individual flight legs may have multiple flight numbers: AAA-BBB may be QQ12, RR23, and SS45.\n\nFor example, Alaska Airlines flight AS61 {{asof|June 2018|lc=y}} flies from Juneau (JNU) to Yakutat (YAK) to Cordova (CDV) to Anchorage (ANC). A ticket for the Yakutat to Anchorage segment is specified as AS61 YAK-ANC. It is even possible for a given flight number to cover a sequence beginning and ending at the same airport.\n\n== List of flight number 1 by airlines ==\nMost flights are non-stop from A to B, and few are from A to B then to C (both A-B and B-C have flight number 1). Aircraft type may change due to operation need.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Airline\n!IATA Flight No\n!ICAO Flight No\n!From\n!To\n!Then to (if applicable)\n!Aircraft Type\n|-\n|[[Aerom\u00e9xico]]\n|AM1\n|AMX1<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flightaware.com/live/flight/AMX1|title=AeroM\u00e9xico (AM)  #1 \u2708 FlightAware|website=FlightAware|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>\n|[[Mexico City International Airport|Mexico City]]\n|[[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]]\n|\n|[[Boeing 787]]\n|-\n|[[Air Canada]]\n|AC1\n|ACA1<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA1|title=Air Canada (AC)  #1 \u2708 FlightAware|website=FlightAware|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>\n|[[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto Pearson]]\n|[[Haneda Airport|Tokyo Haneda]]\n|\n|[[Boeing 777-300ER]]\n|-\n|[[Air Canada Express]]\n|QK1<ref>https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/qk1</ref>  AC8001\n|JZA1 ACA8001\n|[[Kingston Norman Rogers Airport|Kingston]] \n|[[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto Pearson]]\n|\n| [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|De Havilland Canada DHC-8-300]]\n|-\n|-\n|[[Air New Zealand]]\n|NZ1\n|ANZ1<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ANZ1|title=Air New Zealand (NZ)  #1 \u2708 FlightAware|website=FlightAware|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>\n|[[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]]\n|[[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]]\n|[[Auckland Airport|Auckland]]\n|[[Boeing 777-300ER]]\n|-\n|[[Air Tahiti Nui]]\n|TN1\n|THT1<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flightaware.com/live/flight/THT1|title=Air Tahiti Nui (TN)  #1 \u2708 FlightAware|website=FlightAware|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>\n|[[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]]\n|[[Faa'a International Airport|Papeete]]\n|\n|[[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-300]]\n|-\n|[[AirAsia Japan]]\n|DJ1\n|WAJ1\n|[[Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport|Nagoya]]\n|[[New Chitose Airport|Sapporo Chitose]]\n|\n|[[Airbus A320|Airbus A320-200 ]]\n|-\n|[[AirAsia X]]\n|D71\n|XAX1<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flightaware.com/live/flight/XAX1|title=AirAsia X (D7) #1 \u2708 FlightAware|website=FlightAware|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>\n|[[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur]]\n|[[Kansai International Airport|Osaka Kansai]]\n|[[Daniel K.

For example, following the crash of [[Alaska Airlines Flight 261]], the airline changed the flight number for subsequent flights following the same route to 229. Also, [[American Airlines Flight 77]], which regularly flew from [[Dulles International Airport]] in Washington, DC, to [[Los Angeles International Airport]], was changed to Flight 149 after the [[September 11 attacks]]. On the other hand, other considerations may lead an airline not to change a flight number; for instance, the aforementioned \"flagship\" American Airlines Flight 1 retains its designation despite a [[American Airlines Flight 1|major accident in 1962]]. There are at least four instances of flight numbers that have suffered two serious accidents: Flight 253 of [[Linea Aeropostal Venezolana]] (both in 1956, the [[Linea Aeropostal Venezolana Flight 253 (June 1956)|first in June]], and the [[Linea Aeropostal Venezolana Flight 253 (November 1956)|second in November]]), Flight 869 of [[United Arab Airlines]] (the [[United Arab Airlines Flight 869 (1962)|first in 1962]] and the [[United Arab Airlines Flight 869 (1963)|second in 1963]]), Flight 800 of [[TWA]] (the [[TWA Flight 800 (1964)|first in 1964]] and the [[TWA Flight 800|second in 1996]]), and Flight 383 of American Airlines (the [[American Airlines Flight 383 (1965)|first in 1965]] and the [[American Airlines Flight 383 (2016)|second in 2016]]). As of October 2019 the most recent flight number change due to an accident was from [[Aeroflot Flight 1492]] to Aeroflot Flight 1316.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mvestnik.ru/newslent/aeroflot-smenil-nomer-moskovskogo-rejsa-posle-katastrofy-v-sheremetevo/|title=\u00ab\u0410\u044d\u0440\u043e\u0444\u043b\u043e\u0442\u00bb \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b \u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0444\u044b \u0432 \u0428\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043e|accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Flight number conservation==\nAirline mega mergers, in markets such as the United States, have made it necessary to break conventional flight numbering schemes. Organizations such as IATA, ICAO, ARC, as well as [[CRS system]]s and the FAA's ATC systems limit flight numbers to four digits (0001 to 9999). The pool of available flight numbers has been outstripped by demand for them by emergent mega-carriers. As such, some carriers use the same flight number for back-and-forth flights (e.g. [[Washington-National|DCA]]-[[Palm Beach International Airport|PBI]]-DCA), or in other cases carriers have assigned a single flight number to an multi-leg flight (e.g. [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport|ICT]]-[[Dallas Love Field|DAL]]-[[Houston Hobby Airport|HOU]]-[[Chicago Midway International Airport|MDW]]-[[Eppley Airfield, Omaha|OMA]]-[[Denver International Airport|DEN]]-[[Albuquerque International Sunport|ABQ]]-[[Las Vegas McCarran International Airport|LAS]]-[[Bradley International Airport|BDL]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Science behind Flight Numbers |url=https://community.southwest.com/t5/Southwest-Stories/The-Science-behind-Flight-Numbers/ba-p/42760 |website=southwestaircommunity.com |accessdate=March 3, 2019 |language=en |date=June 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Flight designator==\nNote that, although 'flight number' is the term used colloquially, the official term as defined in the [[Standard Schedules Information Manual]] (SSIM) published annually by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) Schedules Information Standards Committee (SISC), is '''flight designator'''. Officially the term 'flight number' refers to the numeric part (up to four digits) of a flight code. For example, in the flight codes BA2490 and BA2491A, \"2490\" and \"2491\" are flight numbers. Even within the airline and airport industry, it is common to use the colloquial term rather than the official term.\n\n==Spacecraft==\nFlight numbers are also sometimes used for spacecraft, though a flight number for an expendable rocket (say, [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]]) might more reasonably be called the [[serial number]] of the vehicle used, since an expendable rocket can only be launched once.  Space Shuttle missions used numbers with the [[Space Shuttle program|STS]] prefix, for example, [[STS-93]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Airline call sign]]\n* [[Codeshare agreement]]\n* [[Change of gauge (aviation)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Civil aviation]]\n[[Category:Identifiers]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}\n[[Image:Flight numbers.jpg|thumb|200px|Flight numbers on a [[split-flap display]] (Frankfurt airport)]]\nIn the aviation industry, a '''flight number''' or '''flight designator''' is a code for an airline service consisting of two-character [[Airline codes#IATA airline designator|airline designator]] and a 1 to 4 digit number.<ref>IATA Passenger Glossary of Terms (15 June 2018) [www.iata.org/whatwedo/passenger/.../IATA-Passenger-Glossary-of-Terms.xlsx]</ref> For example, \"BA 98\" is a [[British Airways]] service from [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto-Pearson]] to [[Heathrow Airport|London-Heathrow]]. A service is called \"[[direct flight|direct]]\" if it is covered by a single flight number, regardless of the number of stops or [[Change of gauge (aviation)|equipment changes]]. For example, \"WN 417\" flies from Jacksonville to Baltimore to Oakland to Los Angeles. A given flight segment may have multiple flight numbers on different airlines under a [[Codeshare agreement|code-sharing agreement]]. Strictly speaking, the flight number is just the numerical part, but it is commonly used for the entire flight designator.\n\nThe flight designator of the [[operating carrier]] of a commercial flight is used as a call sign.<ref>[[ICAO]], \"Glossary\" [https://www.icao.int/dataplus_archive/Documents/GLOSSARY.docx]</ref> This is distinct from the [[aircraft registration|aircraft's registration number]], which identifies a specific airplane.\n\n==Conventions==\nA number of conventions have been developed for defining flight numbers, although these vary widely from airline to airline, and are increasingly being modified.<ref>Peter Newell, \"Flight Numbering Alternatives\", ''Ascend: A Magazine for Airline Executives'', issue 2, 2014 [http://www.ascendforairlines.com/2014-issue-no-2/flight-numbering-alternatives]</ref> Eastbound and northbound flights are traditionally assigned [[Even and odd numbers|even numbers]], while westbound and southbound flights have odd numbers. Other airlines will use an odd number for an outbound flight and use the next even number for the reverse inbound flight.  For destinations served by multiple flights per day, numbers tend to increase during the day.  Hence, a flight from point A to point B might be flight 101 and the return flight from B to A would be 102, while the next pair of flights on the same route would usually be assigned codes 103 and 104.\n\nFlight numbers of less than three digits are often assigned to long-haul or otherwise premium flights. Flight number 1 is often used for an airline's \"flagship\" service. For example, British Airways flight 1 was the early morning [[supersonic]] [[Concorde]] service from [[London]] to [[New York City]] and is now a premium business-class only flight between the same cities; [[Air New Zealand]] flight 1 is the daily service from [[London]] to [[Auckland]] via [[Los Angeles]]; [[Qantas]] flight 1 is the daily [[Kangaroo Route]] from [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]]  via [[Singapore Changi Airport|Singapore]] to [[London Heathrow Airport|London]]. [[American Airlines]] Flight 1 is the daily flight from New York to Los Angeles; Both [[Singapore Airlines]] (SQ) and [[United Airlines]] (UA) Flights 1 are the daily flight from [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] to [[Singapore Changi Airport|Singapore]], although SQ1 does a stop-over in Hong Kong while UA1 is a nonstop flight, [[Virgin Atlantic]] VS1 is the daily Heathrow to [[Newark Liberty Airport|Newark]] flight but has now been terminated<ref> https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/virgin-atlantic-coronavirus-flight-cancelled-fleet-latest-a9404356.html </ref> ; [[El Al]] flight 1 is the daily overnight service from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[New York City]]; [[Air Canada]] flight 1 is a nonstop flight from [[Toronto Pearson Airport|Toronto-Pearson]] to [[Tokyo Haneda Airport|Tokyo-Haneda]] and; [[WestJet]] flight 1 is a nonstop flight from [[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] to [[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]].\n\nFour-digit numbers in the range 3000 to 5999 typically represent regional affiliate flights, while numbers larger than 6000 are generally [[code sharing|codeshare]] numbers for flights operated by different airlines or even [[high-speed rail|railways]].\n\nLikewise, flight numbers larger than 9000 usually refer to [[dead mileage|ferry flights]]; these carry no passengers and are used to relocate aircraft to or from a maintenance base, or from one air travel market to another in order to start new commercial flights. Flight numbers starting with 8 are often used for charter flights, but it always depends on the commercial carrier's choice.\n\n==Codeshare==\n{{main|Codeshare agreement}}\nIn a codeshare, airlines shares its aircraft with another airline, resulting in the flight having more than one flight number on the same sector, and either the same or different flight numbers on joined sectors.\n\nAs a hypothetical example, flight QQ1234 may fly from airport AAA to BBB to CCC. The AAA-BBB segment may be serviced by airline QQ, and the BBB-CCC segment by airline RR, on a different aircraft. The same flight may also be sold as RR3210, and by a third airline SS as SS2345. Also, the individual flight legs may have multiple flight numbers: AAA-BBB may be QQ12, RR23, and SS45.\n\nFor example, Alaska Airlines flight AS61 {{asof|June 2018|lc=y}} flies from Juneau (JNU) to Yakutat (YAK) to Cordova (CDV) to Anchorage (ANC). A ticket for the Yakutat to Anchorage segment is specified as AS61 YAK-ANC. It is even possible for a given flight number to cover a sequence beginning and ending at the same airport.\n\n== List of flight number 1 by airlines ==\nMost flights are non-stop from A to B, and few are from A to B then to C (both A-B and B-C have flight number 1).

For example, following the crash of [[Alaska Airlines Flight 261]], the airline changed the flight number for subsequent flights following the same route to 229. Also, [[American Airlines Flight 77]], which regularly flew from [[Dulles International Airport]] in Washington, DC, to [[Los Angeles International Airport]], was changed to Flight 149 after the [[September 11 attacks]]. On the other hand, other considerations may lead an airline not to change a flight number; for instance, the aforementioned \"flagship\" American Airlines Flight 1 retains its designation despite a [[American Airlines Flight 1|major accident in 1962]]. There are at least four instances of flight numbers that have suffered two serious accidents: Flight 253 of [[Linea Aeropostal Venezolana]] (both in 1956, the [[Linea Aeropostal Venezolana Flight 253 (June 1956)|first in June]], and the [[Linea Aeropostal Venezolana Flight 253 (November 1956)|second in November]]), Flight 869 of [[United Arab Airlines]] (the [[United Arab Airlines Flight 869 (1962)|first in 1962]] and the [[United Arab Airlines Flight 869 (1963)|second in 1963]]), Flight 800 of [[TWA]] (the [[TWA Flight 800 (1964)|first in 1964]] and the [[TWA Flight 800|second in 1996]]), and Flight 383 of American Airlines (the [[American Airlines Flight 383 (1965)|first in 1965]] and the [[American Airlines Flight 383 (2016)|second in 2016]]). As of October 2019 the most recent flight number change due to an accident was from [[Aeroflot Flight 1492]] to Aeroflot Flight 1316.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mvestnik.ru/newslent/aeroflot-smenil-nomer-moskovskogo-rejsa-posle-katastrofy-v-sheremetevo/|title=\u00ab\u0410\u044d\u0440\u043e\u0444\u043b\u043e\u0442\u00bb \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b \u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0444\u044b \u0432 \u0428\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043e|accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Flight number conservation==\nAirline mega mergers, in markets such as the United States, have made it necessary to break conventional flight numbering schemes. Organizations such as IATA, ICAO, ARC, as well as [[CRS system]]s and the FAA's ATC systems limit flight numbers to four digits (0001 to 9999). The pool of available flight numbers has been outstripped by demand for them by emergent mega-carriers. As such, some carriers use the same flight number for back-and-forth flights (e.g. [[Washington-National|DCA]]-[[Palm Beach International Airport|PBI]]-DCA), or in other cases carriers have assigned a single flight number to an multi-leg flight (e.g. [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport|ICT]]-[[Dallas Love Field|DAL]]-[[Houston Hobby Airport|HOU]]-[[Chicago Midway International Airport|MDW]]-[[Eppley Airfield, Omaha|OMA]]-[[Denver International Airport|DEN]]-[[Albuquerque International Sunport|ABQ]]-[[Las Vegas McCarran International Airport|LAS]]-[[Bradley International Airport|BDL]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Science behind Flight Numbers |url=https://community.southwest.com/t5/Southwest-Stories/The-Science-behind-Flight-Numbers/ba-p/42760 |website=southwestaircommunity.com |accessdate=March 3, 2019 |language=en |date=June 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Flight designator==\nNote that, although 'flight number' is the term used colloquially, the official term as defined in the [[Standard Schedules Information Manual]] (SSIM) published annually by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) Schedules Information Standards Committee (SISC), is '''flight designator'''. Officially the term 'flight number' refers to the numeric part (up to four digits) of a flight code. For example, in the flight codes BA2490 and BA2491A, \"2490\" and \"2491\" are flight numbers. Even within the airline and airport industry, it is common to use the colloquial term rather than the official term.\n\n==Spacecraft==\nFlight numbers are also sometimes used for spacecraft, though a flight number for an expendable rocket (say, [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]]) might more reasonably be called the [[serial number]] of the vehicle used, since an expendable rocket can only be launched once.  Space Shuttle missions used numbers with the [[Space Shuttle program|STS]] prefix, for example, [[STS-93]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Airline call sign]]\n* [[Codeshare agreement]]\n* [[Change of gauge (aviation)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Civil aviation]]\n[[Category:Identifiers]]\n", "name_user": "Cpr1234", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eList of flight number 1 by airlines", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_number"}

Parents who want their children taught according to the principles of their church, can choose to send their children to such schools, but unless the school is subsidized by their church, or is part of a [[school choice]] or [[education voucher]] program funded by the government, they must pay tuition.  Some American Christian schools are large and well-funded, while others are small and rely on volunteers from the community.\n\nSome Christian schools, especially those sponsored by [[fundamentalist]] groups, do not accept government funding and subsidies because (in their opinion) they would put their school (and potentially their church) operations under more government scrutiny and legislation, which can lead to the government dictating their school's operation (and, possibly, the church's teachings on controversial subjects such as abortion or homosexuality). An example of this would be a requirement to adhere to a state [[Civil Rights]] law, in exchange for the subsidy, this would conflict with a Christian school that has mandatory religious requirements for admission, or does not allow its students to opt out of attending religious services. Even though a school may accept no government money, it still must adhere to the state education curriculum, student academic performance standards, and state-mandated [[standardized testing]] scores (if any). It is also subject to standard inspection by government regulators for in-classroom teaching quality and teacher qualifications, possibly including visiting classes. Not accepting government money avoids government management of a Christian school, but does not remove governmental oversight.\n\nAccording to the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the largest Protestant Christian school system in the world is the [[Seventh-day Adventist educational system]]. The Seventh-day Adventist Church has a total of 6,709 educational institutions operating in over 100 countries around the world with over 1.2 million students worldwide. The North American Division Office of Education oversees 1,049 schools with 65,000 students in the United States, Canada, and Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nadeducation.org |title=Adventist Education |website=Nadeducation.org |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\nAnother large association of Protestant Christian schools is the [[Association of Christian Schools International]] (ACSI). ACSI serves 5,300 member schools in approximately 100 countries with an enrollment of nearly 1.2 million students.<!-- how many in US? -->\n\nThe [[American Association of Christian Schools]], founded in 1972, brings together many conservative Protestant Christian schools.  Members subscribe to a ''Statement of Faith'' based on [[biblical literalism]], [[creationism]], and rejection of [[ecumenism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aacs.org/statement-of-faith/|title=Statement of Faith - American Association of Christian Schools|first=American Association of Christian|last=Schools|publisher=}}</ref> AACS member schools enroll over 100,000 students.  The AACS has an active [[lobbying]] program in Washington.\n\nAnother association of Protestant Christian schools is [[Christian Schools International]], with approximately 500 schools and 100,000 students.\n\nOne movement among Christian schools in the U.S. is the return to the traditional subjects and form of education known as [[traditional education|classical education]].  This growing movement is known as the Classical Christian School movement, represented by the [[Association of Classical & Christian Schools]], with over 230 schools and colleges, and about 34,000 students.\n\n=== Mennonites ===\n[[Conservative Mennonites]], [[Old Order Mennonites]], and [[Amish]] groups all operate their own private schools and have published their own curriculum since the early 1960s.\n\n=== Other ===\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also operate parochial private schools throughout the United States.\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute in Winnipeg, Manitoba.JPG|thumb|[[Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]]]\nIn [[Canada]], public funding of religious education is permitted and sometimes required. Many Christian schools in Canada are non-denominational, meaning they\u2019re not affiliated with a specific sect of Christianity. Other schools are denominational; they are affiliated with a particular sect. For instance, they might be Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, Baptist, Unitarian, Presbyterian, Methodist, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Quaker, Greek Orthodox, or follow some other denomination. Among these, Catholic schools receive the most funding from the government; many of them receive funding for both the secular and religious component of their curriculum.<ref>\"[http://www.ourkids.net/christian-schools.php Guide to Christian Education in Canada\"]. [http://www.ourkids.net/school/ Our Kids Media]. </ref>\n\nHistorically, ''Christian schools'' in Canada were run by private [[Protestant]] or [[Catholic]] organizations. As [[public education]] developed, the majority (Protestant) faith became represented by the public school, and the minority faith (usually [[Catholic]]) became represented by a separate school. Over time the public schools became increasingly secularized as Canadian society became increasingly [[Religious pluralism|pluralistic]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.\n\nMost provinces originally had separate school boards in each school district for Catholic and non-Catholic students. Many provinces have abolished this, but [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and the [[Northwest Territories]] retain the system. Where this occurs, the two schools are usually called the ''Catholic School Board'' and the ''Public School Board''.\n\nMany non-Catholics send their children to Separate Catholic schools, preferring the values and standards, despite not practicing the [[Catholic faith]]. Typically, such students are exempt from specific religious instruction classes{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.\n\nThe American model is also used on some private Christian schools, usually run by [[Protestant]] denominations.\n\nPublic school boards (as distinct from Catholic boards) in Canada normally have no religious affiliation in modern times but may still accommodate religious instruction for Christians within their community. They may do this by creating an individual special purpose Christian school, or they may offer religious instruction within an otherwise secular school. This practice has become so prevalent in [[Alberta]] that many private Christian schools have been absorbed by their local public districts as \"alternative Christian programs\" within the public system. They are presently permitted to retain their philosophy, curriculum, and staffing while operating as fully funded public schools. In this regard, they have achieved some equality with Catholic schools.\n\nThese private schools can be associated with a number of different organizations. Some are affiliated with the [[Association of Christian Schools International]], some with [[Christian Schools International]], and some with other organizations. There are also provincial organizations like the [[Ontario Alliance of Christian Schools]] a d the [[Prairie Association of Christian Schools]].\n\n'''See also:''' [[separate schools]]\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:Former School, Tintagel - geograph.org.uk - 1384188.jpg|thumb|The former church school, [[Tintagel]], Cornwall]]\nIn the United Kingdom, church schools are more generally referred to as [[faith school]]s.  In 2012, 33.75% of all maintained schools and 23.13% of all academies in [[England]] were faith schools, a total of 6,830 institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/maintained-faith-schools/maintained-faith-schools|title=Maintained faith schools|date=26 April 2012|website=Department for Education|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Church of England]] was historically a provider of many schools throughout England. Such schools (called 'Church of England schools') were partially absorbed into the state education system (in the [[Education Act 1944]]), with the church retaining an influence on the schools in return for its support in funding and staffing. Such schools are required to accept pupils regardless of religious background, though if they are oversubscribed, they can, and often do, give preference to applicants of the relevant faith. As of February 2017, there are 3,731 state schools and 906 academies in England that are church schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://churchofengland.org/education/church-schools-academies/types-of-church-school.aspx|title=Types of Church School|website=Church of England|year=2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref> Approximately one quarter of all primary schools in England are Church of England schools and 15 million people alive today went to a Church of England school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://churchofengland.org/education/church-schools-academies/church-schools-and-academies-information.aspx|title=Church Schools and Academies Information|website=Church of England|year=2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Aloysius College by Thomas Nugent Geograph 3906553.jpg|thumb|St Aloysius College, Glasgow (RC)]]\nBecause of the availability of church-run schools and the tolerance for religious activity in state schools, private Christian schools are a relative rarity, but do exist throughout the country. One of the larger ones, the Liverpool Christian Fellowship School, made national headlines in 2001 when they led a campaign backed by forty other schools, to retain their right to use [[caning]] and other corporal punishments, which was outlawed in 1999. They intended to halt what they felt was a decline of discipline within schools.<ref>{{Cite news |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1361220/Forty-private-schools-ask-judges-to-back-caning.html |date=2 Nov 2001 |title=Forty private schools ask judges to back caning |first=Victoria |last=Combe}}</ref> Other Christian schools include Kingsfold Christian School in Lancashire, Carmel Christian School in Bristol, Grangewood Independent School in London, Mannafields Christian School in Edinburgh, Emmanuel Christian School in Leicester, Derby & Walsall, & The River School in Worcester, among others.\n\n== Australia ==\n[[Parochial school]]s (Church schools) were established in [[Australia]] by both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] churches during the 19th century.  Many of these schools, many of which with long traditions, continue to form the bulk of the [[private school|private]] or [[independent school]] sector in Australia.\n\nThe modern Protestant Christian school movement began in Australia through the efforts of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Human migration|migrants]] who had enjoyed Christian schools for many decades in their home country.<ref>Deenick (ed.), J. (1991): ''A Church En Route: 40 Years Reformed Churches of Australia'', Reformed Churches Publishing: 240. {{ISBN|978-0-9590727-7-8}}</ref> Most belonged to one of the Australian reformed churches of Dutch origin (the [[Christian Reformed Churches of Australia]] or the [[Free Reformed Churches of Australia]], sometimes incorrectly called the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], which is a name used in the [[Netherlands]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] but never in the Australian context). During the 1950s these migrants founded associations of parents who wanted to start Christian schools,<ref>''A Church En Route'': 240-1</ref> and the first schools opened, at first without any government assistance, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe Free Reformed Church started the John Calvin School at [[Armadale, Western Australia]] which opened its doors on 2 December 1957 with 70 students. It was followed by schools in [[Albany, Western Australia]] (1962) and [[Launceston, Tasmania]] (1965). The Reformed Churches of Australia (which added 'Christian' to the beginning of their name only in the 1990s) opened their first school at [[Kingston, Tasmania]] in 1962.<ref>''A Church En Route'': 243</ref> Their first schools were affiliated with a national body known at that time as the National Union of Christian Parent-Controlled Schools,<ref>''A Church En Route'': 244</ref> which later became Christian Parent Controlled Schools Ltd. (CPCS), and in 2008 was again renamed to become Christian Education National.\n\nWhereas the [[Free Reformed]] schools enrolled only students from that particular denomination, the Reformed Church-initiated schools were operated by associations of parents who individually belonged to a variety of Protestant churches and who worked collectively for their common aim. These schools were established not because of innate dissatisfaction with [[Public school (government funded)|government schools]], but because these parents wanted schools which would actively integrate their Christian faith into the whole school curriculum. The schools were operated by parent bodies apart from supervision of churches.\n\nFrom the late 1970s, Christians from many other churches became increasingly concerned about standards and social change in government schools and started establishing Christian schools to provide an alternative education option.<ref>''A Church En Route'': 249</ref> In this phase, many such schools were commenced not by parent associations but by churches themselves, although several parent groups from outside the Reformed Churches studied and adopted the [[Parent-controlled school|parent-controlled model]] and have commenced schools which, while they have no Dutch or Reformed Church connections, have still affiliated themselves nationally with many schools which do.\n\nThe leading umbrella organizations include [[Anglican]] Schools Australia, Christian Schools Australia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.edu.au |title=Welcome - Christian Schools Australia |website=Csa.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref> Lutheran Education Australia (LEA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lutheran.edu.au/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910035035/http://www.lutheran.edu.au/index.aspx |archivedate=2009-09-10 }}</ref> Christian Education National (formerly Christian Parent Controlled Schools Ltd),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cen.edu.au |title=Home |website=Cen.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref> and the Australian Association of Christian Schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aacs.net.au/ |title=Home |website=Aacs.net.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>  This last body mainly functions as a political advisory and lobby group for Christian Education National as well as a number of Christian schools who are members independently.\n\n==The Netherlands==\nIn the [[Netherlands]] the question whether or not public schools should be Christian and in what way was subject of much debate between 1806 and 1917. During the second half of the 19th century this \"School-struggle\" reached its summit and dominated politics along with voting rights and the district system. In 1917 most of these 3 matters were resolved by the ''Pacification of 1917''. From now on both confessional (religious) and public schools would get equal funding. Schools grounded in a religious denomination are treated as a type of [[special school (Netherlands)|distinct education]] (bijzonder onderwijs) and governed by their own institutions separate from that for mainstream schools. \n\nIn the second half of 2006 there were 6,318 Christian schools in the Netherlands; 4,955 primary schools, 1,054 high schools and 309 colleges and universities.\n\n==Russia==\n[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] is the major form of Christianity practiced in Russia. The Orthodox Church began systemic participation in the elementary education field in Russia in 1884 under the \"Statute on Church-parish schools\". In the following two decades, many privately initiated, illegal \"literacy schools\" started by peasants were also regularised by placing them under the control of the Church.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Classroom and empire: the politics of schooling Russia's Eastern nationalities, 1860-1917|first=Wayne|last=Dowler|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7735-2099-8|pages=6\u20137|ref=harv|postscript=}}</ref> Privately founded Orthodox schools not under direct church control played an important role in the spread of Orthodoxy among Russian minorities, prominent examples being the Kazan Central Baptised Tatar School, founded in 1863,<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Dowler|2001|p=101}}</ref> or the Simbirsk Central Chuvash School, founded in 1868.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Dowler|2001|p=110}}</ref>\n\nThere are also Protestant-associated schools aimed at the children of expatriates, such as the [[International Academy of St. Petersburg, Russia]], founded in 1993.\n\n==Africa==\n[[File:Covenant University Halls of residence.jpg|thumb|Covenant University in Ota, [[Ogun State]], [[Nigeria]].]]\nIn many parts of [[Africa]] Christian missionary organisations have founded schools, often in places where no other schooling is available.

Parents who want their children taught according to the principles of their church, can choose to send their children to such schools, but unless the school is subsidized by their church, or is part of a [[school choice]] or [[education voucher]] program funded by the government, they must pay tuition.  Some American Christian schools are large and well-funded, while others are small and rely on volunteers from the community.\n\nSome Christian schools, especially those sponsored by [[fundamentalist]] groups, do not accept government funding and subsidies because (in their opinion) they would put their school (and potentially their church) operations under more government scrutiny and legislation, which can lead to the government dictating their school's operation (and, possibly, the church's teachings on controversial subjects such as abortion or homosexuality). An example of this would be a requirement to adhere to a state [[Civil Rights]] law, in exchange for the subsidy, this would conflict with a Christian school that has mandatory religious requirements for admission, or does not allow its students to opt out of attending religious services. Even though a school may accept no government money, it still must adhere to the state education curriculum, student academic performance standards, and state-mandated [[standardized testing]] scores (if any). It is also subject to standard inspection by government regulators for in-classroom teaching quality and teacher qualifications, possibly including visiting classes. Not accepting government money avoids government management of a Christian school, but does not remove governmental oversight.\n\nAccording to the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the largest Protestant Christian school system in the world is the [[Seventh-day Adventist educational system]]. The Seventh-day Adventist Church has a total of 6,709 educational institutions operating in over 100 countries around the world with over 1.2 million students worldwide. The North American Division Office of Education oversees 1,049 schools with 65,000 students in the United States, Canada, and Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nadeducation.org |title=Adventist Education |website=Nadeducation.org |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\nAnother large association of Protestant Christian schools is the [[Association of Christian Schools International]] (ACSI). ACSI serves 5,300 member schools in approximately 100 countries with an enrollment of nearly 1.2 million students.<!-- how many in US? -->\n\nThe [[American Association of Christian Schools]], founded in 1972, brings together many conservative Protestant Christian schools.  Members subscribe to a ''Statement of Faith'' based on [[biblical literalism]], [[creationism]], and rejection of [[ecumenism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aacs.org/statement-of-faith/|title=Statement of Faith - American Association of Christian Schools|first=American Association of Christian|last=Schools|publisher=}}</ref> AACS member schools enroll over 100,000 students.  The AACS has an active [[lobbying]] program in Washington.\n\nAnother association of Protestant Christian schools is [[Christian Schools International]], with approximately 500 schools and 100,000 students.\n\nOne movement among Christian schools in the US is the return to the traditional subjects and form of education known as [[traditional education|classical education]].  This growing movement is known as the Classical Christian School movement, represented by the [[Association of Classical & Christian Schools]], with over 230 schools and colleges, and about 34,000 students.\n\n=== Mennonites ===\n[[Conservative Mennonites]], [[Old Order Mennonites]], and [[Amish]] groups all operate their own private schools and publish their own curriculum since the early 1960s.\n\n=== Other ===\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also operate parochial private schools throughout the United States.\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute in Winnipeg, Manitoba.JPG|thumb|[[Mennonite Brethren Collegiate Institute]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]]]\nIn [[Canada]], public funding of religious education is permitted and sometimes required. Many Christian schools in Canada are non-denominational, meaning they\u2019re not affiliated with a specific sect of Christianity. Other schools are denominational; they are affiliated with a particular sect. For instance, they might be Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, Baptist, Unitarian, Presbyterian, Methodist, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Quaker, Greek Orthodox, or follow some other denomination. Among these, Catholic schools receive the most funding from the government; many of them receive funding for both the secular and religious component of their curriculum.<ref>\"[http://www.ourkids.net/christian-schools.php Guide to Christian Education in Canada\"]. [http://www.ourkids.net/school/ Our Kids Media]. </ref>\n\nHistorically, ''Christian schools'' in Canada were run by private [[Protestant]] or [[Catholic]] organizations. As [[public education]] developed, the majority (Protestant) faith became represented by the public school, and the minority faith (usually [[Catholic]]) became represented by a separate school. Over time the public schools became increasingly secularized as Canadian society became increasingly [[Religious pluralism|pluralistic]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.\n\nMost provinces originally had separate school boards in each school district for Catholic and non-Catholic students. Many provinces have abolished this, but [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and the [[Northwest Territories]] retain the system. Where this occurs the two schools are usually called the ''Catholic School Board'' and the ''Public School Board''.\n\nMany non-Catholics send their children to Separate Catholic schools, preferring the values and standards, despite not practicing the [[Catholic faith]]. Typically, such students are exempt from specific religious instruction classes{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.\n\nThe American model is also used on some private Christian schools, usually run by [[Protestant]] denominations.\n\nPublic school boards (as distinct from Catholic boards) in Canada, normally have no religious affiliation in modern times, but may still accommodate religious instruction for Christians within their community. They may do this by creating an individual special purpose Christian school, or they may offer religious instruction within an otherwise secular school. This practice has become so prevalent in [[Alberta]] that many private Christian schools have been absorbed by their local public districts as \"alternative Christian programs\" within the public system. They are presently permitted to retain their philosophy, curriculum, and staffing while operating as fully funded public schools. In this regard, they have achieved some equality with Catholic schools.\n\nThese private schools can be associated with a number of different organizations. Some are affiliated with the [[Association of Christian Schools International]], some with [[Christian Schools International]], and some with other organizations. There are also provincial organizations like the [[Ontario Alliance of Christian Schools]] a d the [[Prairie Association of Christian Schools]].\n\n'''See also:''' [[separate schools]]\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:Former School, Tintagel - geograph.org.uk - 1384188.jpg|thumb|The former church school, [[Tintagel]], Cornwall]]\nIn the United Kingdom, church schools are more generally referred to as [[faith school]]s.  In 2012, 33.75% of all maintained schools and 23.13% of all academies in [[England]] were faith schools, a total of 6,830 institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/maintained-faith-schools/maintained-faith-schools|title=Maintained faith schools|date=26 April 2012|website=Department for Education|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Church of England]] was historically a provider of many schools throughout England. Such schools (called 'Church of England schools') were partially absorbed into the state education system (in the [[Education Act 1944]]), with the church retaining an influence on the schools in return for its support in funding and staffing. Such schools are required to accept pupils regardless of religious background, though if they are oversubscribed, they can, and often do, give preference to applicants of the relevant faith. As of February 2017, there are 3,731 state schools and 906 academies in England that are church schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://churchofengland.org/education/church-schools-academies/types-of-church-school.aspx|title=Types of Church School|website=Church of England|year=2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref> Approximately one quarter of all primary schools in England are Church of England schools and 15 million people alive today went to a Church of England school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://churchofengland.org/education/church-schools-academies/church-schools-and-academies-information.aspx|title=Church Schools and Academies Information|website=Church of England|year=2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Aloysius College by Thomas Nugent Geograph 3906553.jpg|thumb|St Aloysius College, Glasgow (RC)]]\nBecause of the availability of church-run schools and the tolerance for religious activity in state schools, private Christian schools are a relative rarity, but do exist throughout the country. One of the larger ones, the Liverpool Christian Fellowship School, made national headlines in 2001 when they led a campaign backed by forty other schools, to retain their right to use [[caning]] and other corporal punishments, which was outlawed in 1999. They intended to halt what they felt was a decline of discipline within schools.<ref>{{Cite news |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1361220/Forty-private-schools-ask-judges-to-back-caning.html |date=2 Nov 2001 |title=Forty private schools ask judges to back caning |first=Victoria |last=Combe}}</ref> Other Christian schools include Kingsfold Christian School in Lancashire, Carmel Christian School in Bristol, Grangewood Independent School in London, Mannafields Christian School in Edinburgh, Emmanuel Christian School in Leicester, Derby & Walsall, & The River School in Worcester, among others.\n\n== Australia ==\n[[Parochial school]]s (Church schools) were established in [[Australia]] by both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] churches during the 19th century.  Many of these schools, many of which with long traditions, continue to form the bulk of the [[private school|private]] or [[independent school]] sector in Australia.\n\nThe modern Protestant Christian school movement began in Australia through the efforts of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Human migration|migrants]] who had enjoyed Christian schools for many decades in their home country.<ref>Deenick (ed.), J. (1991): ''A Church En Route: 40 Years Reformed Churches of Australia'', Reformed Churches Publishing: 240. {{ISBN|978-0-9590727-7-8}}</ref> Most belonged to one of the Australian reformed churches of Dutch origin (the [[Christian Reformed Churches of Australia]] or the [[Free Reformed Churches of Australia]], sometimes incorrectly called the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], which is a name used in the [[Netherlands]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] but never in the Australian context). During the 1950s these migrants founded associations of parents who wanted to start Christian schools,<ref>''A Church En Route'': 240-1</ref> and the first schools opened, at first without any government assistance, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe Free Reformed Church started the John Calvin School at [[Armadale, Western Australia]] which opened its doors on 2 December 1957 with 70 students. It was followed by schools in [[Albany, Western Australia]] (1962) and [[Launceston, Tasmania]] (1965). The Reformed Churches of Australia (which added 'Christian' to the beginning of their name only in the 1990s) opened their first school at [[Kingston, Tasmania]] in 1962.<ref>''A Church En Route'': 243</ref> Their first schools were affiliated with a national body known at that time as the National Union of Christian Parent-Controlled Schools,<ref>''A Church En Route'': 244</ref> which later became Christian Parent Controlled Schools Ltd. (CPCS), and in 2008 was again renamed to become Christian Education National.\n\nWhereas the Free Reformed schools enrolled only students from that particular denomination, the Reformed Church-initiated schools were operated by associations of parents who individually belonged to a variety of Protestant churches and who worked collectively for their common aim. These schools were established not because of innate dissatisfaction with [[Public school (government funded)|government schools]], but because these parents wanted schools which would actively integrate their Christian faith into the whole school curriculum. The schools were operated by parent bodies apart from supervision of churches.\n\nFrom the late 1970s, Christians from many other churches became increasingly concerned about standards and social change in government schools and started establishing Christian schools to provide an alternative education option.<ref>''A Church En Route'': 249</ref> In this phase, many such schools were commenced not by parent associations but by churches themselves, although several parent groups from outside the Reformed Churches studied and adopted the [[Parent-controlled school|parent-controlled model]] and have commenced schools which, while they have no Dutch or Reformed Church connections, have still affiliated themselves nationally with many schools which do.\n\nThe leading umbrella organizations include Anglican Schools Australia, Christian Schools Australia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.edu.au |title=Welcome - Christian Schools Australia |website=Csa.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref> Lutheran Education Australia (LEA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lutheran.edu.au/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910035035/http://www.lutheran.edu.au/index.aspx |archivedate=2009-09-10 }}</ref> Christian Education National (formerly Christian Parent Controlled Schools Ltd),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cen.edu.au |title=Home |website=Cen.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref> and the Australian Association of Christian Schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aacs.net.au/ |title=Home |website=Aacs.net.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>  This last body mainly functions as a political advisory and lobby group for Christian Education National as well as a number of Christian schools who are members independently.\n\n==The Netherlands==\nIn the Netherlands the question whether or not public schools should be Christian and in what way was subject of much debate between 1806 and 1917. During the second half of the 19th century this \"School-struggle\" reached its summit and dominated politics along with voting rights and the district system. In 1917 most of these 3 matters were resolved by the ''Pacification of 1917''. From now on both confessional (religious) and public schools would get equal funding. Schools grounded in a religious denomination are treated as a type of [[special school (Netherlands)|distinct education]] (bijzonder onderwijs) and governed by their own institutions separate from that for mainstream schools. \n\nIn the second half of 2006 there were 6,318 Christian schools in the Netherlands; 4,955 primary schools, 1,054 high schools and 309 colleges and universities.\n\n==Russia==\n[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] is the major form of Christianity practiced in Russia. The Orthodox Church began systemic participation in the elementary education field in Russia in 1884 under the \"Statute on Church-parish schools\". In the following two decades, many privately initiated, illegal \"literacy schools\" started by peasants were also regularised by placing them under the control of the Church.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Classroom and empire: the politics of schooling Russia's Eastern nationalities, 1860-1917|first=Wayne|last=Dowler|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7735-2099-8|pages=6\u20137|ref=harv|postscript=}}</ref> Privately founded Orthodox schools not under direct church control played an important role in the spread of Orthodoxy among Russian minorities, prominent examples being the Kazan Central Baptised Tatar School, founded in 1863,<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Dowler|2001|p=101}}</ref> or the Simbirsk Central Chuvash School, founded in 1868.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Dowler|2001|p=110}}</ref>\n\nThere are also Protestant-associated schools aimed at the children of expatriates, such as the [[International Academy of St. Petersburg, Russia]], founded in 1993.\n\n==Africa==\n[[File:Covenant University Halls of residence.jpg|thumb|Covenant University in Ota, [[Ogun State]], [[Nigeria]].]]\nIn many parts of [[Africa]] Christian missionary organisations have founded schools, often in places where no other schooling is available.
