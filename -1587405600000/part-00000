It was contested between the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion [[Anaheim Ducks]] and the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Ottawa Senators]]. It was the second appearance in the Final for Anaheim since [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]] (known at the time as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim), when they lost to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. It was the first appearance for the Senators since entering the NHL as an expansion team in 1992. Anaheim defeated Ottawa in five games and were awarded their first [[Stanley Cup]] becoming the eleventh post-1967 expansion team to win the NHL championship trophy, and the first Stanley Cup championship for a team from [[California]] (the [[Los Angeles Kings]] would eventually win Stanley Cups in [[2012 Stanley Cup Finals|2012]] and [[2014 Stanley Cup Finals|2014]]). This was also the most recent year that both teams that went to the finals had never won the Stanley Cup before until the [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\n==Paths to the Finals==\n{{details|2007 Stanley Cup playoffs}}\nPrior to the season, the Ducks had been the pick of many in the media to make it to the Final, and they did not disappoint. The second-seeded Anaheim Ducks defeated both the [[Minnesota Wild]] and [[Vancouver Canucks]] in five games before defeating their rivals the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in six games in the Western Conference Final. The Ducks had the most penalties out of any team during the post-season and had one suspension going into the final, but had a top penalty-kill percentage. They were led by two [[James Norris Memorial Trophy|Norris Trophy]] candidates captain [[Scott Niedermayer]] and [[Chris Pronger]], the scoring touches of [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]], [[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne|Teemu Selanne]], [[Ryan Getzlaf]], and the goaltending of [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]]. The Ducks were looking to shut down Ottawa's offense with the checking line of [[Rob Niedermayer]], [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]] and [[Travis Moen]], and overall team defense.\n\nThe fourth-seeded Ottawa Senators defeated the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], and upset both the [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]], all in five games apiece, en route to their first Eastern Conference championship. Ottawa was led by the top line of captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Dany Heatley]], and [[Jason Spezza]], who combined for 23 goals in the first three rounds, and the goaltending of [[Ray Emery]]. Other Senators who played pivotal roles were forwards [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] and [[Dean McAmmond]] and defensemen [[Chris Phillips]] and [[Anton Volchenkov]]. The Senators were looking to work past Anaheim's defense with their speed and higher-scoring offence, although both teams played a similar style of responsible team defence.\n\nAnaheim had [[home ice advantage]] for the series, as they finished the regular season with 110 points to Ottawa's 105. The attention leading into the finals was Ottawa being \"Canada's Team\" despite Anaheim having five more Canadian skaters than the Senators. Many fans were saying that the [[Stanley Cup]] needed to be brought back to Canada after a 14-year drought (up to that point, the last Canadian team to hoist the Stanley Cup was the [[1992\u201393 Montreal Canadiens season|1993 Montreal Canadiens]], who defeated the [[Los Angeles Kings]]).\n\n==Game summaries==\nOnly four players remained on the Ducks roster from 2003, including the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] winner, [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]]. The 2003 club's general manager, Bryan Murray, was now the Ottawa head coach.\n\nTwo Ottawa-area players were in the finals, playing for the Ducks.\n\nThe Senators and Ducks had never met in the playoffs before, and had not played each other since January 19, 2006, when the Ducks (then known as the Mighty Ducks) won 4\u20133 in a [[overtime (ice hockey)|shootout]] in Ottawa.\n\n===Historical facts===\nThis was the first time since the 1925 [[Victoria Cougars]] that a team from the west coast of North America won the Stanley Cup, and the first time an NHL team from the west coast had done so. The Ducks are the fourth west coast team to win the Cup, and the first from [[California]].\n\nSenators captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]], from Sweden, was the first European-born-and-raised [[captain (sports)|captain]] to lead his team to the final. Previously, only Canadians or an American had captained teams in the final. The Ducks were captained by a Canadian ([[Scott Niedermayer]]) and had more Canadian players than the Senators.\n\nAs of the end of the [[2019 Stanley Cup playoffs|2019 playoffs]], the Senators remain the only Canadian team to represent the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|East]] in the final since [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals|1993]].  This final marked the third straight in which a Canadian franchise lost against a franchise based in the southern half of the United States (previous Canadian teams in the last few Stanley Cup Finals were the 2004 [[Calgary Flames]] and the 2006 [[Edmonton Oilers]], and not counting the [[2004\u201305 NHL season]] lockout).\n\nThe series marked the first time that two teams from the early-'90s expansion era faced each other in the final. (Anaheim had started play in 1993, Ottawa in 1992)\n\nIt was the first final since 1999 where neither finalist had won the [[Stanley Cup]] previously (the NHL does not recognize the championships of the [[original Ottawa Senators]] as part of the current franchise's history).\n\nAs well, this was the third season in a row that the Cup was won by a team winning its first Cup after Tampa Bay in 2004 and Carolina in 2006.\nIt was also the 1st final since the [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals]], when Detroit defeated Carolina in 5 games, that didn't need a 7th game after New Jersey in 2003, Tampa Bay in 2004, and Carolina in 2006 all won in 7 games\n\nThe third game, in Ottawa on June 2, was attended by 91-year-old Russell Williams as a guest of the Senators. He had attended the last Finals game in Ottawa (April 13, 1927) versus the [[Boston Bruins]] in the old [[Ottawa Auditorium]]. His presence was a [[good-luck charm]], as Ottawa won the game he attended.\n\n===Sens Mile===\n[[Image:cithall2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ottawa City Hall]] before game three of the Stanley Cup Finals]]\nMuch like the [[Red Mile]] in [[Calgary]] during the [[Calgary Flames|Flames]]' [[2004 Stanley Cup playoffs|2004 cup run]] and the [[Blue Mile / Copper Kilometer|Blue Mile]] in [[Edmonton]] during the [[Edmonton Oilers|Oilers]]' [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 Cup run]], Ottawa Senators fans took to the streets to celebrate their team's success. The idea to have a Sens Mile began as a grassroots campaign on [[Facebook]] by Ottawa residents before game four of the Ottawa-[[Buffalo Sabres|Buffalo]] Eastern Conference Finals series.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=5f37beb9-e64b-4762-a467-cef15d0eb37c&k=89106 'Sens mile'<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017124241/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=5f37beb9-e64b-4762-a467-cef15d0eb37c&k=89106 |date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref>\nTheir idea was to use [[Elgin Street (Ottawa)|Elgin Street]] as a gathering place for Sens fans to celebrate after games won. Since Scotiabank Place (now [[Canadian Tire Centre]]) is located in suburban Ottawa, spontaneous celebration did not occur during the Senators' Cup run until that point, like it did in Calgary and Edmonton where the arenas are located more centrally.\n\nWhen the Senators beat the Sabres in game five of the Eastern Conference Final, people flocked to Elgin Street in celebration.\n\nFor the Stanley Cup Final, large video screens were installed at [[Ottawa City Hall]] for fans to view. After the Senators won game three of the final, fans celebrated on Elgin Street once again, and [[Ottawa Police]] closed the street down.\n\n===Game one===\n\n{{NHLPlayoffs\n|team1=Anaheim Ducks\n|team2=Ottawa Senators\n|stadium1=[[Honda Center]]\n|date1=May 28\n|score1=3\u20132\n|won1=1\n}}\n\nThe scene was festive at Honda Center in Anaheim with several Hollywood celebrities on hand, including former movie star and then California Governor, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who dropped the puck for the ceremonial face-off. As in their previous series, the Senators struck first. [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] started off the scoring in the series with a [[power play (sporting term)|power-play]] goal 1:38 into the first period that travelled high in the air, landed behind Giguere and trickled over the line. Although Ottawa scored first, Anaheim took over play during the course of the period. The Ducks replied nine minutes later with a goal from [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] at even strength. Ottawa was unable to get even one shot on goal in the last eleven minutes of the first, and the period ended with the score tied 1\u20131. The shots were 8\u20133 for Anaheim. Early into the second, [[Wade Redden]] scored the only goal of the period, another power-play goal for Ottawa from the blue line, putting the Senators up 2\u20131. Play was even for the most part, as indicated by the 10\u201310 shot total of the period. The Ducks dominated most of the play in the third, tying the game 2\u20132 at five minutes into the third on a goal from [[Ryan Getzlaf]], followed by a dramatic game-winning goal by [[Travis Moen]] with three minutes left in the third. The shots ended 32\u201320 in Anaheim's favour. In 2009, it was disclosed by Tom Molloy, hockey coach and friend of [[Dany Heatley]], that Heatley was injured by a cross-check of [[Chris Pronger]] in this game. Heatley would continue to play for the rest of the series and the injury was kept secret. Heatley would score only one goal in the series.<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=June 30, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-30 |author=Scanlan, Wayne |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/Sports/Everybody+crucifying+Dany/1746009/story.html|title='Everybody is crucifying Dany'}}</ref>\n\n;Summary\n'''First period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Ottawa: [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] ([[Andrej Mesz\u00e1ro\u0161|Andrej Meszaros]], [[Mike Comrie]]) PP 1:38.

Once again, Anaheim's checking line of Samuel Pahlsson, [[Travis Moen]], and [[Rob Niedermayer]] managed to shut down and out-score the Ottawa top line of [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Dany Heatley]], and [[Jason Spezza]]. Anaheim again led the shot count with 31 shots to Ottawa's 16.

The Senators hoped to regroup, being down 2\u20130, with two wins at home.\n\nAfter an energetic crowd took over the singing of [[O Canada]] from [[Ontario Provincial Police]] Constable [[Lyndon Slewidge]], the Senators came out tentative and Andy McDonald opened the scoring in game three to give Anaheim a 1\u20130 lead 5:39 into the first period. Ottawa replied 11 minutes later with a goal by [[Chris Neil]].\n\nCorey Perry scored to give Anaheim a 2\u20131 lead at 5:20 in the second; the lead was short-lived, as Mike Fisher scored 27 seconds later. Two minutes later, Ryan Getzlaf scored to once again give Anaheim a one-goal advantage. Ottawa then replied with a goal by Daniel Alfredsson.\n\nAlfredsson's goal was initially waved off by referees because the puck went in off his skate, appearing to have been kicked in. The NBC broadcasters thought the goal would be waved off. But the officials reviewing the goal ruled that there was no kicking motion and allowed the goal to stand, tying the game once again. NHL rules allow the redirection of a puck with the foot, as long as no kicking motion is involved, and this was the ruling.\n\nLater in the period, [[Dean McAmmond]] got credited with a goal that ricocheted off [[Chris Pronger]]'s stick. Near the beginning of the third period, McAmmond was injured after receiving an elbow to the head from Pronger, in what might have been retribution for the goal, as McAmmond's shot had appeared to have been aimed at Pronger, and not at the net. As in the previous series against Detroit (in which he delivered a similar blow to Detroit's [[Tomas Holmstr\u00f6m|Tomas Holmstrom]]), Pronger was not penalized during the game for his hit on McAmmond, but was later suspended for game four. Pronger claimed the elbow was accidental and the Ducks did not appeal the suspension. McAmmond did not return to play in the series, and this was a loss for the Senators as he had been an effective player.\n\n[[Anton Volchenkov]] scored midway through the third to give the Senators a two-goal lead. Neither team scored any goals through the balance of the period, and Ottawa won the game 5\u20133.\n\n;Summary\n'''First period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Anaheim: [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] ([[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne|Teemu Selanne]]) PP 5:39.

Once again, the Ducks had to deal with the loss of Pronger while the Senators were itching to win both home games and tie the series.\n\nAfter nearly a full period of scoreless play, [[Daniel Alfredsson]] scored at 19:59 (0.3 seconds remained) of the first to give the Senators a 1\u20130 lead on a powerplay goal. The momentum seemed to continue shifting from game three in Ottawa's favor as Anaheim could only get two shots the entire period.\n\nIn the second, the Ducks replied with two goals by [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] midway through the period to put them up 2\u20131. Ottawa came back with two minutes left in the period to tie the game 2\u20132 on a goal from [[Dany Heatley]], his only goal of the series.\n\nThe game's most controversial moment came in the final five seconds of the second period. With the puck at center ice, Alfredsson shot the puck, which hit [[Scott Niedermayer]]. The incident appeared intentional, although Alfredsson claimed after the game that it was not. Niedermayer was not injured, but the Ducks were furious, sparking a post-buzzer scrum next to the Anaheim bench before the teams left the ice for the intermission. To the surprise of NBC's broadcasters, Alfredsson was not penalized for his actions, but [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] and [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]] were each handed matching minors for roughing.\n\nThe Ducks responded to the incident on the score board as [[Dustin Penner]] scored at 4:07 of the third to provide the winning 3\u20132 Anaheim margin, putting them up 3\u20131 in the series and provided an opportunity for the Ducks to clinch the Cup in game five.\n\n;Summary\n'''First period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Ottawa: [[Daniel Alfredsson]] ([[Peter Schaefer (ice hockey)|Peter Schaefer]], Mike Fisher) PP 19:59.\n\nPenalties: [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]], Anaheim ([[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]]) \u2013 0:58; [[Corey Perry]], Anaheim ([[cross-checking]]) 3:54; [[Chris Neil]], Ottawa ([[interference (ice hockey)|interference]]) 6:13;  [[Corey Perry]], Anaheim ([[roughing]]) 17:11; [[Patrick Eaves]], Ottawa ([[holding (hockey)|holding]]) 17:11; [[Ryan Getzlaf]], Anaheim ([[goaltender interference]])  18:16\n\n'''Second period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Anaheim: [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] ([[Todd Marchant]], [[Corey Perry]]) 10:06; (2) Anaheim: [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] ([[Rob Niedermayer]], [[Sean O'Donnell]]) 11:06; (2) Ottawa: [[Dany Heatley]] ([[Patrick Eaves]], [[Jason Spezza]]) 18:00\n\nPenalties: [[Chris Neil]], Ottawa ([[interference (ice hockey)|interference]]) 4:29; [[Chris Phillips]] Ottawa ([[hooking (hockey)|hooking]]) 8:02; [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]], Anaheim ([[roughing]]) 20:00; Mike Fisher Ottawa ([[roughing]]) 20:00\n\n'''Third period'''\n\nScoring: (3) Anaheim: [[Dustin Penner]] ([[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne|Teemu Selanne]], [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]]) 4:07\n\nPenalties: [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]], Anaheim ([[holding (hockey)|holding]]) 1:02\n\n'''Shots'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, his play was the only bright spot on the night for the Senators.\n\nThe final game was marked by strong play by the Ducks, and mistakes and bad luck for the Senators, as they attempted to stave off elimination and seemed to try too hard, while the Ducks played with confidence and without mistakes. The game was played 'close-to-the-vest', with only 31 shots on goal by the two teams.\n\nIn the first period, [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] and [[Rob Niedermayer]] of Anaheim scored the first and second goals, respectively. McDonald's goal came on the power play on a penalty to Ottawa for obstruction; the call that the Senators had claimed was not being called against the Ducks. The goal went off the skate of Chris Phillips, the start of an unlucky night for the Ottawa defenceman. Niedermayer's goal deflated the Senators further as it appeared that Emery should have stopped it.\n\nIn the second period, Senators captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]] cut the lead to 2\u20131.  However, the turning point of the game came when Chris Phillips and [[Ray Emery]] were involved in a mix-up resulting in an [[own goal]], which was awarded to [[Travis Moen]], giving Anaheim a 3\u20131 lead.\n\nLater in the period, Alfredsson scored a 'highlight-reel' short-handed goal to close the gap to 3\u20132. It appeared that he was trying to carry the whole team on his back, but on the same power play, defenceman [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]] scored moments later to restore the Ducks two-goal lead, 4\u20132. Beauchemin's goal deflected off the shin pad of Ottawa defenceman [[Anton Volchenkov]], the NHL's leading shot blocker, who was attempting to block the shot, behind Emery.\n\nIn the third period, [[Travis Moen]] scored to give Anaheim a commanding 5\u20132 lead. The Senators kept trying, and [[Antoine Vermette]] was awarded a rare [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]; however the puck rolled off his stick at the last moment. [[Corey Perry]] scored the final goal off of a loose pass by Ottawa to provide the winning margin of 6\u20132, and, with the exception of [[Scott Niedermayer]], every member of the Ducks franchise won their first Stanley Cup.\n\n;Summary\n'''First period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Anaheim: [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] ([[Ryan Getzlaf]], [[Chris Pronger]]) PP 3:41;  (2) Anaheim: [[Rob Niedermayer]] ([[Corey Perry]]) 17:41\n\nPenalties: [[Tom Preissing]], Ottawa ([[interference (ice hockey)|interference]]) \u2013 1:40; [[Anton Volchenkov]], Ottawa ([[hooking (hockey)|hooking]]) \u2013 3:25; [[Jason Spezza]], Ottawa ([[holding the stick]]) \u2013 5:39; [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]], Anaheim ([[Elbowing]]) \u2013 10:14; [[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne|Teemu Selanne]], Anaheim ([[holding (hockey)|holding]]) \u2013 18:10\n\n'''Second period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Ottawa: [[Daniel Alfredsson]] (Peter Schaefer, Mike Fisher) 11:27; (3) Anaheim: [[Travis Moen]] 15:44; (2) Ottawa: [[Daniel Alfredsson]] SH 17:38; (4) Anaheim: [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]] ([[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]]) PP 18:28\n\nPenalties: [[Christoph Schubert]], Ottawa ([[Elbowing]]) 16:46\n\n'''Third period'''\n\nScoring: (5) Anaheim: [[Travis Moen]] ([[Scott Niedermayer]], [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]]) 4:01; (6) Anaheim [[Corey Perry]] 17:00\n\nPenalties: [[Christoph Schubert]], Ottawa ([[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]]) 5:48; [[Anton Volchenkov]], Ottawa ([[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]]) \u2013 12:27\n\n'''Shots'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Games one and two were carried by cable channel [[NHL on Versus|Versus]], then a new and little known player on the sports television scene. Game one produced a 0.5 national rating or 523,000 households. It was the 58th best rated program of that day. Game two produced a 0.4 national rating or 446,000 households, the 74th best rated program of that day, lower than the 2006 [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] All-Star Game on [[ESPN]] which drew 447,000 households.\n\nThe move to [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] for the remainder of the finals did little to compensate for the series' limited drawing power. A perennial last among the Big Four American television networks, NBC was at the time going through an intense period of ratings turmoil, setting lowest rated week records in several viewing categories over the course of Spring 2007.\n\nGame three's coverage on NBC garnered a mere 1.1 rating (approximately 1,205,600 households), making it the lowest rated prime-time broadcast in the network's history. For comparison, game six of the [[2007 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals: (1) Detroit Pistons vs. (2) Cleveland Cavaliers|NBA Eastern Conference Finals]], broadcast opposite game three on cable channel [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], achieved a 5.3 rating, approximately 5,808,800 households. Game four achieved a 1.9 rating (approximately 2,082,400 households), down 5 percent from game four the previous year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2894490|title=Game three equals NBC's lowest rating ever for prime-time program \u2013 NHL|work=ESPN.com|date=June 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-07-23|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Game five received slightly less, 1.8 (approximately 1,972,800 households).<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=June 7, 2007|accessdate=2009-07-23|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2897126|work=ESPN.com|title=Ratings for Stanley Cup Final down 20 percent}}</ref> As a whole, NBC's ratings for the championship series were down 20 percent from the previous season, making it the least watched final in the United States.\n\nAt the time, Versus was only available to 50 percent of cable-equipped homes in the Los Angeles area, which hurt the buzz around the Ducks' playoff run in a traditionally crowded sports and entertainment market.<ref>{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 27, 2007 |title=Ducks Aren't Hot Topic in Town|author=Wharton, David}}</ref> Versus was the fifth-most watched cable network in the Los Angeles market for game one, good only for a 1.7 local rating.\n\nLocal numbers did improve as the series moved to NBC. The Cup-clinching game five drew a 6.0 and a 12 share for an average audience of 496,000 viewers in the Los Angeles market, twice larger than a high-profile regular season game between baseball's [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[San Diego Padres]] on [[KCAL-TV|KCAL 9]] (3.0/5, 218,000 viewers). This symbolic, if short-lived, victory against one of the region's flagship teams allowed the Ducks to close the series on a relatively high note, with the [[Los Angeles Times]]' Larry Stewart calling their final ratings performance \"pretty good\".<ref>{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 8, 2007 |title=Ducks Up, Ratings Down|author=Stewart, Larry}}</ref>\n\nOn the CBC, [[Hockey Night in Canada]] pulled in 2,608,000, 2,378,000, and 2,553,000 viewers for games one, two and three respectively, slightly higher than their numbers for equivalent games the previous year. This was the last final that [[Bob Cole (announcer)|Bob Cole]] (play-by-player announcer) and [[Harry Neale]] (colour commentator) worked together.

It was contested between the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion [[Anaheim Ducks]] and the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Ottawa Senators]]. It was the second appearance in the Final for Anaheim since [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]] (known at the time as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim), when they lost to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. It was the first appearance for the Senators since entering the NHL as an expansion team in 1992. Anaheim defeated Ottawa in five games and were awarded their first [[Stanley Cup]] becoming the eleventh post-1967 expansion team to win the NHL championship trophy, and the first Stanley Cup championship for a team from [[California]] (the [[Los Angeles Kings]] would eventually win Stanley Cups in [[2012 Stanley Cup Finals|2012]] and [[2014 Stanley Cup Finals|2014]]). This was also the most recent year that both teams that went to the finals had never won the Stanley Cup before until the [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\n==Paths to the Finals==\n{{details|2007 Stanley Cup playoffs}}\nPrior to the season, the Ducks had been the pick of many in the media to make it to the Final, and they did not disappoint. The second-seeded Anaheim Ducks defeated both the [[Minnesota Wild]] and [[Vancouver Canucks]] in five games before defeating their rivals the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in six games in the Western Conference Final. The Ducks had the most penalties out of any team during the post-season and had one suspension going into the final, but had a top penalty-kill percentage. They were led by two [[James Norris Memorial Trophy|Norris Trophy]] candidates captain [[Scott Niedermayer]] and [[Chris Pronger]], the scoring touches of [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]], [[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne|Teemu Selanne]], [[Ryan Getzlaf]], and the goaltending of [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]]. The Ducks were looking to shut down Ottawa's offense with the checking line of [[Rob Niedermayer]], [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]] and [[Travis Moen]], and overall team defense.\n\nThe fourth-seeded Ottawa Senators defeated the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], and upset both the [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]], all in five games apiece, en route to their first Eastern Conference championship. Ottawa was led by the top line of captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Dany Heatley]], and [[Jason Spezza]], who combined for 23 goals in the first three rounds, and the goaltending of [[Ray Emery]]. Other Senators who played pivotal roles were forwards [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] and [[Dean McAmmond]] and defensemen [[Chris Phillips]] and [[Anton Volchenkov]]. The Senators were looking to work past Anaheim's defense with their speed and higher-scoring offence, although both teams played a similar style of responsible team defence.\n\nAnaheim had [[home ice advantage]] for the series, as they finished the regular season with 110 points to Ottawa's 105. The attention leading into the finals was Ottawa being \"Canada's Team\" despite Anaheim having five more Canadian skaters than the Senators. Many fans were saying that the [[Stanley Cup]] needed to be brought back to Canada after a 14-year drought (up to that point, the last Canadian team to hoist the Stanley Cup was the [[1992\u201393 Montreal Canadiens season|1993 Montreal Canadiens]], who defeated the [[Los Angeles Kings]]).\n\n==Game summaries==\nOnly four players remained on the Ducks roster from 2003, including the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] winner, [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]]. The 2003 club's general manager, Bryan Murray, was now the Ottawa head coach.\n\nTwo Ottawa-area players were in the finals, playing for the Ducks.\n\nThe Senators and Ducks had never met in the playoffs before, and had not played each other since January 19, 2006, when the Ducks (then known as the Mighty Ducks) won 4\u20133 in a [[overtime (ice hockey)|shootout]] in Ottawa.\n\n===Historical facts===\nThis was the first time since the 1925 [[Victoria Cougars]] that a team from the west coast of North America won the Stanley Cup, and the first time an NHL team from the west coast had done so. The Ducks are the fourth west coast team to win the Cup, and the first from [[California]].\n\nSenators captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]], from Sweden, was the first European-born-and-raised [[captain (sports)|captain]] to lead his team to the final. Previously, only Canadians or an American had captained teams in the final. The Ducks were captained by a Canadian ([[Scott Niedermayer]]) and had more Canadian players than the Senators.\n\nAs of the end of the [[2019 Stanley Cup playoffs|2019 playoffs]], the Senators remain the only Canadian team to represent the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|East]] in the final since [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals|1993]].  This final marked the third straight in which a Canadian franchise lost against a franchise based in the southern half of the United States (previous Canadian teams in the last few Stanley Cup Finals were the 2004 [[Calgary Flames]] and the 2006 [[Edmonton Oilers]], and not counting the [[2004\u201305 NHL season]] lockout).\n\nThe series marked the first time that two teams from the early-'90s expansion era faced each other in the final. (Anaheim had started play in 1993, Ottawa in 1992)\n\nIt was the first final since 1999 where neither finalist had won the [[Stanley Cup]] previously (the NHL does not recognize the championships of the [[original Ottawa Senators]] as part of the current franchise's history).\n\nAs well, this was the third season in a row that the Cup was won by a team winning its first Cup after Tampa Bay in 2004 and Carolina in 2006.\nIt was also the 1st final since the [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals]], when Detroit defeated Carolina in 5 games, that didn't need a 7th game after New Jersey in 2003, Tampa Bay in 2004, and Carolina in 2006 all won in 7 games\n\nThe third game, in Ottawa on June 2, was attended by 91-year-old Russell Williams as a guest of the Senators. He had attended the last Finals game in Ottawa (April 13, 1927) versus the [[Boston Bruins]] in the old [[Ottawa Auditorium]]. His presence was a [[good-luck charm]], as Ottawa won the game he attended.\n\n===Sens Mile===\n[[Image:cithall2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ottawa City Hall]] before game three of the Stanley Cup Finals]]\nMuch like the [[Red Mile]] in [[Calgary]] during the [[Calgary Flames|Flames]]' [[2004 Stanley Cup playoffs|2004 cup run]] and the [[Blue Mile / Copper Kilometer|Blue Mile]] in [[Edmonton]] during the [[Edmonton Oilers|Oilers]]' [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 Cup run]], Ottawa Senators fans took to the streets to celebrate their team's success. The idea to have a Sens Mile began as a grassroots campaign on [[Facebook]] by Ottawa residents before game four of the Ottawa-[[Buffalo Sabres|Buffalo]] Eastern Conference Finals series.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=5f37beb9-e64b-4762-a467-cef15d0eb37c&k=89106 'Sens mile'<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017124241/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=5f37beb9-e64b-4762-a467-cef15d0eb37c&k=89106 |date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref>\nTheir idea was to use [[Elgin Street (Ottawa)|Elgin Street]] as a gathering place for Sens fans to celebrate after games won. Since Scotiabank Place (now [[Canadian Tire Centre]]) is located in suburban Ottawa, spontaneous celebration did not occur during the Senators' Cup run until that point, like it did in Calgary and Edmonton where the arenas are located more centrally.\n\nWhen the Senators beat the Sabres in game five of the Eastern Conference Final, people flocked to Elgin Street in celebration.\n\nFor the Stanley Cup Final, large video screens were installed at [[Ottawa City Hall]] for fans to view. After the Senators won game three of the final, fans celebrated on Elgin Street once again, and [[Ottawa Police]] closed the street down.\n\n===Game one===\n\n{{NHLPlayoffs\n|team1=Anaheim Ducks\n|team2=Ottawa Senators\n|stadium1=[[Honda Center]]\n|date1=May 28\n|score1=3\u20132\n|won1=1\n}}\n\nThe scene was festive at Honda Center in Anaheim with several Hollywood celebrities on hand, including former movie star and then California Governor, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who dropped the puck for the ceremonial face-off. As in their previous series, the Senators struck first. [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] started off the scoring in the series with a [[power play (sporting term)|power-play]] goal 1:38 into the first period that travelled high in the air, landed behind Giguere and trickled over the line. Although Ottawa scored first, Anaheim took over play during the course of the period. The Ducks replied nine minutes later with a goal from [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] at even strength. Ottawa was unable to get even one shot on goal in the last eleven minutes of the first, and the period ended with the score tied 1\u20131. The shots were 8\u20133 for Anaheim. Early into the second, [[Wade Redden]] scored the only goal of the period, another power-play goal for Ottawa from the blue line, putting the Senators up 2\u20131. Play was even for the most part, as indicated by the 10\u201310 shot total of the period. The Ducks dominated most of the play in the third, tying the game 2\u20132 at five minutes into the third on a goal from [[Ryan Getzlaf]], followed by a dramatic game-winning goal by [[Travis Moen]] with three minutes left in the third. The shots ended 32\u201320 in Anaheim's favour. In 2009, it was disclosed by Tom Molloy, hockey coach and friend of [[Dany Heatley]], that Heatley was injured by a cross-check of [[Chris Pronger]] in this game. Heatley would continue to play for the rest of the series and the injury was kept secret. Heatley would score only one goal in the series.<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=June 30, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-30 |author=Scanlan, Wayne |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/Sports/Everybody+crucifying+Dany/1746009/story.html|title='Everybody is crucifying Dany'}}</ref>\n\n;Summary\n'''First period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Ottawa: [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] ([[Andrej Mesz\u00e1ro\u0161|Andrej Meszaros]], [[Mike Comrie]]) PP 1:38.

Once again, Anaheim's checking line of Samuel Pahlsson, [[Travis Moen]], and [[Rob Niedermayer]] managed to shut down and out-score the Ottawa top line of [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Dany Heatley]], and [[Jason Spezza]]. Anaheim again led the shot count with 31 shots to Ottawa's 16.

The Senators hoped to regroup, being down 2\u20130, with two wins at home.\n\nAfter an energetic crowd took over the singing of [[O Canada]] from [[Ontario Provincial Police]] Constable [[Lyndon Slewidge]], the Senators came out tentative and Andy McDonald opened the scoring in game three to give Anaheim a 1\u20130 lead 5:39 into the first period. Ottawa replied 11 minutes later with a goal by [[Chris Neil]].\n\nCorey Perry scored to give Anaheim a 2\u20131 lead at 5:20 in the second; the lead was short-lived, as Mike Fisher scored 27 seconds later. Two minutes later, Ryan Getzlaf scored to once again give Anaheim a one-goal advantage. Ottawa then replied with a goal by Daniel Alfredsson.\n\nAlfredsson's goal was initially waved off by referees because the puck went in off his skate, appearing to have been kicked in. The NBC broadcasters thought the goal would be waved off. But the officials reviewing the goal ruled that there was no kicking motion and allowed the goal to stand, tying the game once again. NHL rules allow the redirection of a puck with the foot, as long as no kicking motion is involved, and this was the ruling.\n\nLater in the period, [[Dean McAmmond]] got credited with a goal that ricocheted off [[Chris Pronger]]'s stick. Near the beginning of the third period, McAmmond was injured after receiving an elbow to the head from Pronger, in what might have been retribution for the goal, as McAmmond's shot had appeared to have been aimed at Pronger, and not at the net. As in the previous series against Detroit (in which he delivered a similar blow to Detroit's [[Tomas Holmstr\u00f6m|Tomas Holmstrom]]), Pronger was not penalized during the game for his hit on McAmmond, but was later suspended for game four. Pronger claimed the elbow was accidental and the Ducks did not appeal the suspension. McAmmond did not return to play in the series, and this was a loss for the Senators as he had been an effective player.\n\n[[Anton Volchenkov]] scored midway through the third to give the Senators a two-goal lead. Neither team scored any goals through the balance of the period, and Ottawa won the game 5\u20133.\n\n;Summary\n'''First period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Anaheim: [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] ([[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne|Teemu Selanne]]) PP 5:39.

Once again, the Ducks had to deal with the loss of Pronger while the Senators were itching to win both home games and tie the series.\n\nAfter nearly a full period of scoreless play, [[Daniel Alfredsson]] scored at 19:59 (0.3 seconds remained) of the first to give the Senators a 1\u20130 lead on a powerplay goal. The momentum seemed to continue shifting from game three in Ottawa's favor as Anaheim could only get two shots the entire period.\n\nIn the second, the Ducks replied with two goals by [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] midway through the period to put them up 2\u20131. Ottawa came back with two minutes left in the period to tie the game 2\u20132 on a goal from [[Dany Heatley]], his only goal of the series.\n\nThe game's most controversial moment came in the final five seconds of the second period. With the puck at center ice, Alfredsson shot the puck, which hit [[Scott Niedermayer]]. The incident appeared intentional, although Alfredsson claimed after the game that it was not. Niedermayer was not injured, but the Ducks were furious, sparking a post-buzzer scrum next to the Anaheim bench before the teams left the ice for the intermission. To the surprise of NBC's broadcasters, Alfredsson was not penalized for his actions, but [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] and [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]] were each handed matching minors for roughing.\n\nThe Ducks responded to the incident on the score board as [[Dustin Penner]] scored at 4:07 of the third to provide the winning 3\u20132 Anaheim margin, putting them up 3\u20131 in the series and provided an opportunity for the Ducks to clinch the Cup in game five.\n\n;Summary\n'''First period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Ottawa: [[Daniel Alfredsson]] ([[Peter Schaefer (ice hockey)|Peter Schaefer]], Mike Fisher) PP 19:59.\n\nPenalties: [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]], Anaheim ([[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]]) \u2013 0:58; [[Corey Perry]], Anaheim ([[cross-checking]]) 3:54; [[Chris Neil]], Ottawa ([[interference (ice hockey)|interference]]) 6:13;  [[Corey Perry]], Anaheim ([[roughing]]) 17:11; [[Patrick Eaves]], Ottawa ([[holding (hockey)|holding]]) 17:11; [[Ryan Getzlaf]], Anaheim ([[goaltender interference]])  18:16\n\n'''Second period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Anaheim: [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] ([[Todd Marchant]], [[Corey Perry]]) 10:06; (2) Anaheim: [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] ([[Rob Niedermayer]], [[Sean O'Donnell]]) 11:06; (2) Ottawa: [[Dany Heatley]] ([[Patrick Eaves]], [[Jason Spezza]]) 18:00\n\nPenalties: [[Chris Neil]], Ottawa ([[interference (ice hockey)|interference]]) 4:29; [[Chris Phillips]] Ottawa ([[hooking (hockey)|hooking]]) 8:02; [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]], Anaheim ([[roughing]]) 20:00; Mike Fisher Ottawa ([[roughing]]) 20:00\n\n'''Third period'''\n\nScoring: (3) Anaheim: [[Dustin Penner]] ([[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne|Teemu Selanne]], [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]]) 4:07\n\nPenalties: [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]], Anaheim ([[holding (hockey)|holding]]) 1:02\n\n'''Shots'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, his play was the only bright spot on the night for the Senators.\n\nThe final game was marked by strong play by the Ducks, and mistakes and bad luck for the Senators, as they attempted to stave off elimination and seemed to try too hard, while the Ducks played with confidence and without mistakes. The game was played 'close-to-the-vest', with only 31 shots on goal by the two teams.\n\nIn the first period, [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] and [[Rob Niedermayer]] of Anaheim scored the first and second goals, respectively. McDonald's goal came on the power play on a penalty to Ottawa for obstruction; the call that the Senators had claimed was not being called against the Ducks. The goal went off the skate of Chris Phillips, the start of an unlucky night for the Ottawa defenceman. Niedermayer's goal deflated the Senators further as it appeared that Emery should have stopped it.\n\nIn the second period, Senators captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]] cut the lead to 2\u20131.  However, the turning point of the game came when Chris Phillips and [[Ray Emery]] were involved in a mix-up resulting in an [[own goal]], which was awarded to [[Travis Moen]], giving Anaheim a 3\u20131 lead.\n\nLater in the period, Alfredsson scored a 'highlight-reel' short-handed goal to close the gap to 3\u20132. It appeared that he was trying to carry the whole team on his back, but on the same power play, defenceman [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]] scored moments later to restore the Ducks two-goal lead, 4\u20132. Beauchemin's goal deflected off the shin pad of Ottawa defenceman [[Anton Volchenkov]], the NHL's leading shot blocker, who was attempting to block the shot, behind Emery.\n\nIn the third period, [[Travis Moen]] scored to give Anaheim a commanding 5\u20132 lead. The Senators kept trying, and [[Antoine Vermette]] was awarded a rare [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]; however the puck rolled off his stick at the last moment. [[Corey Perry]] scored the final goal off of a loose pass by Ottawa to provide the winning margin of 6\u20132, and, with the exception of [[Scott Niedermayer]], every member of the Ducks franchise won their first Stanley Cup.\n\n;Summary\n'''First period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Anaheim: [[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]] ([[Ryan Getzlaf]], [[Chris Pronger]]) PP 3:41;  (2) Anaheim: [[Rob Niedermayer]] ([[Corey Perry]]) 17:41\n\nPenalties: [[Tom Preissing]], Ottawa ([[interference (ice hockey)|interference]]) \u2013 1:40; [[Anton Volchenkov]], Ottawa ([[hooking (hockey)|hooking]]) \u2013 3:25; [[Jason Spezza]], Ottawa ([[holding the stick]]) \u2013 5:39; [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]], Anaheim ([[Elbowing]]) \u2013 10:14; [[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne|Teemu Selanne]], Anaheim ([[holding (hockey)|holding]]) \u2013 18:10\n\n'''Second period'''\n\nScoring: (1) Ottawa: [[Daniel Alfredsson]] (Peter Schaefer, Mike Fisher) 11:27; (3) Anaheim: [[Travis Moen]] 15:44; (2) Ottawa: [[Daniel Alfredsson]] SH 17:38; (4) Anaheim: [[Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin|Francois Beauchemin]] ([[Andy McDonald (ice hockey)|Andy McDonald]]) PP 18:28\n\nPenalties: [[Christoph Schubert]], Ottawa ([[Elbowing]]) 16:46\n\n'''Third period'''\n\nScoring: (5) Anaheim: [[Travis Moen]] ([[Scott Niedermayer]], [[Samuel P\u00e5hlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]]) 4:01; (6) Anaheim [[Corey Perry]] 17:00\n\nPenalties: [[Christoph Schubert]], Ottawa ([[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]]) 5:48; [[Anton Volchenkov]], Ottawa ([[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]]) \u2013 12:27\n\n'''Shots'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They were included in the team picture.  Anaheim did not include any non-players in their place. Only 47 out of the maximum 52 names were included on the Stanley Cup in 2007.\n* #29 [[S\u00e9bastien Caron|Sebastien Caron]], G, played in one regular season game and none in the playoffs.

The Ducks did not request to have his name on the Stanley Cup, and he was left out of the team picture.\n}}\n\n==Television and ratings==\nThe 2007 Stanley Cup Finals was also notable for its exceptionally poor television ratings in the United States. Games one and two were carried by cable channel [[NHL on Versus|Versus]], then a new and little known player on the sports television scene. Game one produced a 0.5 national rating or 523,000 households. It was the 58th best rated program of that day. Game two produced a 0.4 national rating or 446,000 households, the 74th best rated program of that day, lower than the 2006 [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] All-Star Game on [[ESPN]] which drew 447,000 households.\n\nThe move to [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] for the remainder of the finals did little to compensate for the series' limited drawing power. A perennial last among the Big Four American television networks, NBC was at the time going through an intense period of ratings turmoil, setting lowest rated week records in several viewing categories over the course of Spring 2007.\n\nGame three's coverage on NBC garnered a mere 1.1 rating (approximately 1,205,600 households), making it the lowest rated prime-time broadcast in the network's history. For comparison, game six of the [[2007 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals: (1) Detroit Pistons vs. (2) Cleveland Cavaliers|NBA Eastern Conference Finals]], broadcast opposite game three on cable channel [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], achieved a 5.3 rating, approximately 5,808,800 households. Game four achieved a 1.9 rating (approximately 2,082,400 households), down 5 percent from game four the previous year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2894490|title=Game three equals NBC's lowest rating ever for prime-time program \u2013 NHL|work=ESPN.com|date=June 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-07-23|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Game five received slightly less, 1.8 (approximately 1,972,800 households).<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=June 7, 2007|accessdate=2009-07-23|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2897126|work=ESPN.com|title=Ratings for Stanley Cup Final down 20 percent}}</ref> As a whole, NBC's ratings for the championship series were down 20 percent from the previous season, making it the least watched final in the United States.\n\nAt the time, Versus was only available to 50 percent of cable-equipped homes in the Los Angeles area, which hurt the buzz around the Ducks' playoff run in a traditionally crowded sports and entertainment market.<ref>{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 27, 2007 |title=Ducks Aren't Hot Topic in Town|author=Wharton, David}}</ref> Versus was the fifth-most watched cable network in the Los Angeles market for game one, good only for a 1.7 local rating.\n\nLocal numbers did improve as the series moved to NBC. The Cup-clinching game five drew a 6.0 and a 12 share for an average audience of 496,000 viewers in the Los Angeles market, twice larger than a high-profile regular season game between baseball's [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[San Diego Padres]] on [[KCAL-TV|KCAL 9]] (3.0/5, 218,000 viewers). This symbolic, if short-lived, victory against one of the region's flagship teams allowed the Ducks to close the series on a relatively high note, with the [[Los Angeles Times]]' Larry Stewart calling their final ratings performance \"pretty good\".<ref>{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 8, 2007 |title=Ducks Up, Ratings Down|author=Stewart, Larry}}</ref>\n\nOn the CBC, [[Hockey Night in Canada]] pulled in 2,608,000, 2,378,000, and 2,553,000 viewers for games one, two and three respectively, slightly higher than their numbers for equivalent games the previous year. This was the last final that [[Bob Cole (announcer)|Bob Cole]] (play-by-player announcer) and [[Harry Neale]] (colour commentator) worked together. [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals|The following year]], Cole worked with [[Greg Millen]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[2007 in ice hockey]]\n*[[2006\u201307 Anaheim Ducks season]]\n*[[2006\u201307 Ottawa Senators season]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |title=Total Stanley Cup |year=2008 |publisher=Dan Diamond & Associates, Inc. |last=Diamond |first=Dan |url=http://www.stanleycupplayoffs2008.com/assets/pdfs/totalstanleycup2008.pdf |format=pdf |access-date=2009-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326001907/http://www.stanleycupplayoffs2008.com/assets/pdfs/totalstanleycup2008.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-26 |url-status=dead }}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Wikinews|Portal:Hockey/2007 Stanley Cup|2007 Stanley Cup}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box |\n  before = [[2006 Stanley Cup Finals|Carolina Hurricanes<br>2006]] |\n  after = [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals|Detroit Red Wings<br>2008]] |\n  title = [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Anaheim Ducks<br>Stanley Cup Champions]] |\n  years = 2007|\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Navboxes|\nlist1=\n{{Stanley Cup Finals}}\n{{Anaheim Ducks}}\n{{Ottawa Senators}}\n{{NHL on NBC}}\n{{NHL on Versus}}\n{{Hockey Night in Canada}}\n{{NHL on RDS}}\n{{Orange County Sports}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:2007 Stanley Cup| ]]\n[[Category:2006\u201307 NHL season|Stanley Cup]]\n[[Category:Anaheim Ducks games]]\n[[Category:Ottawa Senators games]]\n[[Category:Stanley Cup Finals]]\n[[Category:2007 in sports in California]]\n[[Category:21st century in Anaheim, California]]\n[[Category:2000s in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:2007 in Ontario|Stanley Cup]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Anaheim, California]]\n", "name_user": "KingSkyLord", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Stanley_Cup_Finals"}
