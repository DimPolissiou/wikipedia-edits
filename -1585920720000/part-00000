When he refuses, she reveals her identity. As punishment for the prince's lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, himself and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, or he will remain a beast forever.\n\nSome years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an inventor named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier, as he is not the type of man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to a convention and lost in the forest, he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. Belle tricks both her father and the Beast by asking for a simple hug goodbye from her father, she pushes him out and locks herself in the dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take her father's place and forces Maurice to leave immediately.\n\nBelle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a [[Plague doctor costume|plague doctor mask]] and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nIn Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.\n\nAfter sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.\n\nDuring the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapsed as the castle began to crumble, leading Gaston to fall to his death. The Beast then dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. \n\nAs Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and restoring the Beast and servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Belle (Beauty and the Beast)|Belle]], a young benevolent [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] who develops feelings for the Beast and begins to see the humanity within him.\n** Daisy Duczmal portrays an infant Belle. \n* [[Dan Stevens]] as [[Beast (Beauty and the Beast)|Beast]], a cold-hearted, selfish, unkind prince who is transformed into a beast and forced to earn back his humanity by learning to truly love and be loved in return, as well as to give rather than take.

The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to \"communicate the subtleties of the human face\" and \"[capture the] thought that occurs to him\" which gets \"through [to] the eyes, which are the last human element in the Beast.\" The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with [[computer animation|CGI animation]].<ref name=\"Penske Business Media\"/>\n\nBefore the release of the film, Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the \"Days of the Sun\" number, due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones, who looked similar to [[Hattie Morahan]], who portrayed Agathe.

In [[Bill Condon]]'s opinion, that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live-action version of the movie. \"That score had more to reveal\", he says, \"You look at the songs and there's not a clunker in the group. In fact, [[Frank Rich]] described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991. The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairy-tales.

When he refuses, she reveals her identity. As punishment for the prince's lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, himself and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, or he will remain a beast forever.\n\nSome years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an inventor named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier, as he is not the type of man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to a convention and lost in the forest, he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. Belle tricks both her father and the Beast by asking for a simple hug goodbye from her father, she pushes him out and locks herself in the dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take her father's place and forces Maurice to leave immediately.\n\nBelle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a [[Plague doctor costume|plague doctor mask]] and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nIn Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.\n\nAfter sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.\n\nDuring the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapsed as the castle began to crumble, leading Gaston to fall to his death. The Beast then dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. \n\nAs Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and restoring the Beast and servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Belle (Beauty and the Beast)|Belle]], a young benevolent [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] who develops feelings for the Beast and begins to see the humanity within him.\n** Daisy Duczmal portrays an infant Belle. \n* [[Dan Stevens]] as [[Beast (Beauty and the Beast)|Beast]], a cold-hearted, selfish, unkind prince who is transformed into a beast and forced to earn back his humanity by learning to truly love and be loved in return, as well as to give rather than take.

on stilts for much of the film\". The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to \"communicate the subtleties of the human face\" and \"[capture the] thought that occurs to him\" which gets \"through [to] the eyes, which are the last human element in the Beast.\" The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with [[computer animation|CGI animation]].<ref name=\"Penske Business Media\"/>\n\nBefore the release of the film, Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the \"Days of the Sun\" number, due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones, who looked similar to [[Hattie Morahan]], who portrayed Agathe. In the original version of the scene, it was Jones's character, the Prince's mother, who sings the first verse of the song, with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and [[Henry Garrett (actor)|Henry Garrett]] playing his father; but in the reshot version of the scene, the singing part is given to the Prince (now played by Adam Mitchell). The King was also recast to Tom Turner, although Harriet Jones was still the Queen, albeit with dark hair.

In [[Bill Condon]]'s opinion, that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live-action version of the movie. \"That score had more to reveal\", he says, \"You look at the songs and there's not a clunker in the group. In fact, [[Frank Rich]] described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991. The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairy-tales. Take that vision, put it into a new medium, make it a radical reinvention, something not just for the stage because it's not just being literal, now other elements come into play.

His best work is to be found in his ''Shorter Poems'' (1890), and a complete edition (to date) of his ''Poetical Works'' (6 vols.) was published in 1898\u20131905.\n\nDespite being made poet laureate in 1913, Bridges was never a very well-known poet and only achieved his great popularity shortly before his death with ''The Testament of Beauty''. However, his verse evoked response in many great British composers of the time. Among those to set his poems to music were [[Hubert Parry]], [[Gustav Holst]] and later [[Gerald Finzi]].<ref>Gerald Finzi, ''Seven Poems of Robert Bridges for mixed voices'' a capella, Boosey and Hawkes, 1939</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Bridges joined the group of writers assembled by [[Charles Masterman]] as part of Britain's War Propaganda Bureau at [[Wellington House]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marlin|first1=Randal|title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion|date=2002|publisher=Broadview Press|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&dq=wellington+house+robert+bridges|accessdate=24 April 2016|isbn=9781551113760}}</ref>\n\nAt Oxford, Bridges befriended [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], who is now considered a superior poet but who owes his present fame to Bridges' efforts in arranging the posthumous publication (1918) of his verse.\n\nBridges received advice from the young phonetician [[David Abercrombie (linguist)|David Abercrombie]] on the reformed spelling system he was devising for the publication of his collected essays (later published in seven volumes by [[Oxford University Press]], with the help of the distinguished typographer [[Stanley Morison]], who designed the new letters). Thus Robert Bridges contributed to phonetics and he was also a founder member of the Society for Pure English.<ref>Horsley E M, ''Hutchinson's New Twentieth Century Encyclopedia'', London 1964</ref>\n\n===Hymnody===\nBridges made an important contribution to hymnody with the publication in 1899 of his ''[[Yattendon Hymnal]]'', which he created specifically for musical reasons. This collection of hymns, although not a financial success, became a bridge between the Victorian hymnody of the last half of the 19th century and the modern hymnody of the early 20th century.\n \nBridges wrote and also translated historic hymns, and many of these were included in ''[[Songs of Syon]]'' (1904) and the later [[English Hymnal]] (1906).

He also wrote verse plays, with limited success, and [[literary criticism]], including a study of the work of [[John Keats]].\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\n'''\"Melancholia\"'''\nThe sickness of desire, that in dark days \nLooks on the imagination of despair, \nForgetteth man, and stinteth God his praise; \nNor but in sleep findeth a cure for care. \nIncertainty that once gave scope to dream \nOf laughing enterprise and glory untold, \nIs now a blackness that no stars redeem, \nA wall of terror in a night of cold.\n\nFool! thou that hast impossibly desired \nAnd now impatiently despairest, see \nHow nought is changed: Joy's wisdom is attired \nSplended for others' eyes if not for thee: \nNot love or beauty or youth from earth is fled: \nIf they delite thee not, 'tis thou art dead.\n</poem>}}\nBridges' poetry was privately printed in the first instance, and was slow in making its way beyond a comparatively small circle of his admirers. His best work is to be found in his ''Shorter Poems'' (1890), and a complete edition (to date) of his ''Poetical Works'' (6 vols.) was published in 1898\u20131905.\n\nDespite being made poet laureate in 1913, Bridges was never a very well-known poet and only achieved his great popularity shortly before his death with ''The Testament of Beauty''. However, his verse evoked response in many great British composers of the time. Among those to set his poems to music were [[Hubert Parry]], [[Gustav Holst]] and later [[Gerald Finzi]].<ref>Gerald Finzi, ''Seven Poems of Robert Bridges for mixed voices'' a capella, Boosey and Hawkes, 1939</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Bridges joined the group of writers assembled by [[Charles Masterman]] as part of Britain's War Propaganda Bureau at [[Wellington House]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marlin|first1=Randal|title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion|date=2002|publisher=Broadview Press|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&dq=wellington+house+robert+bridges|accessdate=24 April 2016|isbn=9781551113760}}</ref>\n\nAt Oxford, Bridges befriended [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], who is now considered a superior poet but who owes his present fame to Bridges' efforts in arranging the posthumous publication (1918) of his verse.\n\nBridges received advice from the young phonetician [[David Abercrombie (linguist)|David Abercrombie]] on the reformed spelling system he was devising for the publication of his collected essays (later published in seven volumes by [[Oxford University Press]], with the help of the distinguished typographer [[Stanley Morison]], who designed the new letters). Thus Robert Bridges contributed to phonetics and he was also a founder member of the Society for Pure English.<ref>Horsley E M, ''Hutchinson's New Twentieth Century Encyclopedia'', London 1964</ref>\n\n===Hymnody===\nBridges made an important contribution to hymnody with the publication in 1899 of his ''[[Yattendon Hymnal]]'', which he created specifically for musical reasons. This collection of hymns, although not a financial success, became a bridge between the Victorian hymnody of the last half of the 19th century and the modern hymnody of the early 20th century.\n \nBridges wrote and also translated historic hymns, and many of these were included in ''[[Songs of Syon]]'' (1904) and the later [[English Hymnal]] (1906). Several of Bridges' hymns and translations are still in use today:\n\n*\"Thee will I love, my God and King\"\n*\"Happy are they that love God\"\n*\"Rejoice, O land, in God thy might\"\n**The Baptist Hymn Book, University Press, Oxford 1962\n*\"Ah, Holy Jesus\" ([[Johann Heermann]], 1630)\n*\"[[All My Hope on God is Founded|All my hope on God is founded]]\" ([[Joachim Neander]], c. 1680)\n*\"[[Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring]]\" (Martin Jahn, 1661)\n*\"O Gladsome Light\" ([[Phos Hilaron]])\n*\"O Sacred Head, sore wounded\" (Paulus Gerhardt, 1656)\n*\"O Splendour of God's Glory Bright\" (Ambrose, 4th century)\n*\"When morning gilds the skies\" (stanza 3; Katholisches Gesangbuch, 1744)\n\n==Major works==\nDates given are of first publication and significant revisions.\n\n===Poetry collections===\n*The Growth of Love (1876; 1889; 1898), a sequence of (24; 79; 69) sonnets\n*Prometheus the Firegiver: A Mask in the Greek Manner (1883)\n*[[Eros and Psyche (Robert Bridges)|Eros and Psyche: A Narrative Poem in Twelve Measures]] (1885; 1894), a story from the Latin of Apuleius\n*Shorter Poems, Books I\u2013IV (1890)\n*Shorter Poems, Books I\u2013V (1894)\n*New Poems (1899)\n*Demeter: A Mask (1905), performed in 1904 at the opening of the [[Somerville College Library]]\n*Ibant Obscuri: An Experiment in the Classical Hexameter (1916), with reprint of summary of Stone's Prosody, accompanied by 'later observations & modifications'\n*October and Other Poems (1920)\n*The Tapestry: Poems (1925), in [[neo-Miltonic syllabics]]\n*New Verse (1926), includes verse of ''The Tapestry''\n*The Testament of Beauty (1929)\n\n===Verse drama===\n*Nero (1885), an historical tragedy; called ''The First Part of Nero'' subsequent to the publication of ''Nero: Part II''\n*The Feast of Bacchus (1889); partly translated from the ''Heauton-Timoroumenos'' of [[Terence]]\n*Achilles in Scyros (1890), a drama in a mixed manner\n*Palicio (1890), a romantic drama in five acts in the Elizabethan manner\n*The Return of Ulysses (1890), a drama in five acts in a mixed manner\n*The Christian Captives (1890), a tragedy in five acts in a mixed manner; on the same subject as [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]]'s ''El Principe Constante''\n*The Humours of the Court (1893), a comedy in three acts; founded on Calder\u00f3n's ''El secreto \u00e1 voces'' and on [[Lope de Vega]]'s ''El Perro del hortelano''\n*Nero, Part II (1894)\n\n===Prose===\n*[[Milton's Prosody (book)|Milton's Prosody, With a Chapter on Accentual Verse]] (1893; 1901; 1921), based on essays published in 1887 and 1889\n*Keats (1895)\n*Hymns from the Yattendon Hymnal (1899)\n*The Spirit of Man (1916)\n*Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins (1918), edited with notes by R.B.\n*The Necessity of Poetry (1918)\n*Collected Essays, Papers, Etc.

It has been played annually since 1927, making it the longest uninterrupted intersectional rivalry in college football,<ref name=\"ND Navy Renewal\"/> and the third-longest never-interrupted college football rivalry overall, after only Minnesota vs. Wisconsin (uninterrupted since 1907) and Kansas State vs. Iowa State (uninterrupted since 1917).\n\nNotre Dame leads the series 77\u201313\u20131.<ref>https://und.com/16-irish-cruise-to-52-20-victory-over-23-navy/</ref> Before Navy won a 46\u201344 triple-overtime contest in 2007, Notre Dame had a 43-game winning streak that was the [[Most consecutive wins over one opponent (NCAA football)|longest series win streak]] between two annual opponents in the history of Division I FBS football.<ref name=\"ND 44 Navy 46\">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273070087|title=Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak over Navy ends|publisher=espn.com|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref> Navy's previous win came in 1963, 35\u201314 with future [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and NFL QB [[Roger Staubach]] at the helm. Navy had come close to winning on numerous occasions before 2007. The Midshipmen subsequently won again in 2009, 2010 and 2016.\n\nThough the game is often played at [[Notre Dame Stadium]] in South Bend, it has never been played at [[Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]], due to its relatively small size. Instead, Navy usually hosts the game at larger facilities such as Baltimore's old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] or current [[M&T Bank Stadium]], [[FedExField]] in [[Landover, Maryland]], or at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. From 1960 to 1970, the Midshipmen hosted the game at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in Philadelphia, and they hosted the 1972, 1974 and 1993 games at Philadelphia's [[Veterans Stadium]].

Both schools have strong football traditions going back to the beginnings of the sport. Notre Dame, like many colleges, faced severe financial difficulties during World War II, which were exacerbated by the fact that it was then still an all-male institution. The US Navy made Notre Dame [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|a training center for V-12 candidates]] and paid enough for usage of the facilities to keep the University afloat. Notre Dame has since extended an open invitation for Navy to play the Fighting Irish in football and considers the game annual repayment on a debt of honor. The series is marked by mutual respect, as evidenced by each team standing at attention during the playing of the other's alma mater after the game, a tradition that started in 2005. Navy's athletic director, on renewing the series through 2016, remarked \"...it is of great interest to our collective national audience of Fighting Irish fans, Naval Academy alumni, and the Navy family at large.\"<ref name=\"ND Navy Renewal\">{{cite web| url=http://und.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111005aac.html |title=Notre Dame And Navy Extend Series 10 More Years |publisher=und.cstv.com |date=2005-11-10 |accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref> The series is scheduled to continue indefinitely; renewals are a mere formality.<ref name=\"ND Navy Renewal\"/>\n\n===The Streak===\nNotre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak against Navy began in 1964:\n* 1964 \u2013 Notre Dame 40, Navy 0: Notre Dame came in at 5\u20130 under first year coach [[Ara Parseghian]] and  shut out the Midshipmen in a game that pitted 1963 Heisman Trophy winner Roger Staubach against 1964 winner John Huarte.\n* 1969 \u2013 Notre Dame 47, Navy 0: The Irish set a still-standing, single-game school record of 720 total offensive yards.\n* 1974 \u2013 Notre Dame 14, Navy 6: For three quarters, Navy kept the Fighting Irish offense in check with its punting game and led 6\u20130 going into the fourth quarter. Notre Dame quarterback Tom Clements threw a touchdown pass to Pete Demmerle to put the Fighting Irish in front, then Randy Harrison added an insurance touchdown with an interception return.  Unbeknownst to anyone at the time, Irish coach Ara Parseghian privately decided to resign at the end of the season after this game.\n* 1976 \u2013 Notre Dame 27, Navy 21: Irish defensive back Dave Waymer tipped away a fourth down pass in the end zone late in the game to preserve the win for Notre Dame.\n* 1984 \u2013 Notre Dame 18, Navy 17: John Carney's field goal with 14 seconds left erased a 17\u20137 deficit.

They failed to convert but an errant spot allowed the Irish to keep possession and eventually score to escape with a 28\u201324 win.\n* 2002 \u2013 Notre Dame 30, Navy 23: Notre Dame, coming off a 14\u20137 upset loss to Boston College, scored 15 unanswered points late in the fourth quarter to win under first-year head coach Tyrone Willingham.\n* 2003 \u2013 Notre Dame 27, Navy 24: D.

Academy]] and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football]] team of the [[University of Notre Dame]]. It has been played annually since 1927, making it the longest uninterrupted intersectional rivalry in college football,<ref name=\"ND Navy Renewal\"/> and the third-longest never-interrupted college football rivalry overall, after only Minnesota vs. Wisconsin (uninterrupted since 1907) and Kansas State vs. Iowa State (uninterrupted since 1917).\n\nNotre Dame leads the series 77\u201313\u20131.<ref>https://und.com/16-irish-cruise-to-52-20-victory-over-23-navy/</ref> Before Navy won a 46\u201344 triple-overtime contest in 2007, Notre Dame had a 43-game winning streak that was the [[Most consecutive wins over one opponent (NCAA football)|longest series win streak]] between two annual opponents in the history of Division I FBS football.<ref name=\"ND 44 Navy 46\">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273070087|title=Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak over Navy ends|publisher=espn.com|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref> Navy's previous win came in 1963, 35\u201314 with future [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and NFL QB [[Roger Staubach]] at the helm. Navy had come close to winning on numerous occasions before 2007. The Midshipmen subsequently won again in 2009, 2010 and 2016.\n\nThough the game is often played at [[Notre Dame Stadium]] in South Bend, it has never been played at [[Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]], due to its relatively small size. Instead, Navy usually hosts the game at larger facilities such as Baltimore's old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] or current [[M&T Bank Stadium]], [[FedExField]] in [[Landover, Maryland]], or at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. From 1960 to 1970, the Midshipmen hosted the game at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in Philadelphia, and they hosted the 1972, 1974 and 1993 games at Philadelphia's [[Veterans Stadium]]. The game has been played twice in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\u2014in 1996 at [[Croke Park]] and 2012 at [[Aviva Stadium]].<ref name=\"Aviva Host Navy ND\">{{cite web| url=http://www.navysports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/092110aaa.html |title=Aviva Stadium To Host The 2012 Navy-Notre Dame Game |publisher=navysports.com |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> The game was also occasionally played at old [[Cleveland Stadium]].

Both schools have strong football traditions going back to the beginnings of the sport. Notre Dame, like many colleges, faced severe financial difficulties during World War II, which were exacerbated by the fact that it was then still an all-male institution. The US Navy made Notre Dame [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|a training center for V-12 candidates]] and paid enough for usage of the facilities to keep the University afloat. Notre Dame has since extended an open invitation for Navy to play the Fighting Irish in football and considers the game annual repayment on a debt of honor. The series is marked by mutual respect, as evidenced by each team standing at attention during the playing of the other's alma mater after the game, a tradition that started in 2005. Navy's athletic director, on renewing the series through 2016, remarked \"...it is of great interest to our collective national audience of Fighting Irish fans, Naval Academy alumni, and the Navy family at large.\"<ref name=\"ND Navy Renewal\">{{cite web| url=http://und.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111005aac.html |title=Notre Dame And Navy Extend Series 10 More Years |publisher=und.cstv.com |date=2005-11-10 |accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref> The series is scheduled to continue indefinitely; renewals are a mere formality.<ref name=\"ND Navy Renewal\"/>\n\n===The Streak===\nNotre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak against Navy began in 1964:\n* 1964 \u2013 Notre Dame 40, Navy 0: Notre Dame came in at 5\u20130 under first year coach [[Ara Parseghian]] and  shut out the Midshipmen in a game that pitted 1963 Heisman Trophy winner Roger Staubach against 1964 winner John Huarte.\n* 1969 \u2013 Notre Dame 47, Navy 0: The Irish set a still-standing, single-game school record of 720 total offensive yards.\n* 1974 \u2013 Notre Dame 14, Navy 6: For three quarters, Navy kept the Fighting Irish offense in check with its punting game and led 6\u20130 going into the fourth quarter. Notre Dame quarterback Tom Clements threw a touchdown pass to Pete Demmerle to put the Fighting Irish in front, then Randy Harrison added an insurance touchdown with an interception return.  Unbeknownst to anyone at the time, Irish coach Ara Parseghian privately decided to resign at the end of the season after this game.\n* 1976 \u2013 Notre Dame 27, Navy 21: Irish defensive back Dave Waymer tipped away a fourth down pass in the end zone late in the game to preserve the win for Notre Dame.\n* 1984 \u2013 Notre Dame 18, Navy 17: John Carney's field goal with 14 seconds left erased a 17\u20137 deficit.  The officials failed to notice that the play clock had expired before the ball was snapped.\n* 1991 \u2013 Notre Dame 38, Navy 0:  Notre Dame's 700th victory.\n* 1997 \u2013 Notre Dame 21, Navy 17: Allen Rossum saved the day for the Fighting Irish, knocking Navy receiver Pat McGrew out of bounds at the 1-yard line on a 69-yard pass as time ran out.\n* 1999 \u2013 Notre Dame 28, Navy 24: Notre Dame needed a 1st down on 4th and 9 with 1:37 left. They failed to convert but an errant spot allowed the Irish to keep possession and eventually score to escape with a 28\u201324 win.\n* 2002 \u2013 Notre Dame 30, Navy 23: Notre Dame, coming off a 14\u20137 upset loss to Boston College, scored 15 unanswered points late in the fourth quarter to win under first-year head coach Tyrone Willingham.\n* 2003 \u2013 Notre Dame 27, Navy 24: D. J. Fitzpatrick's 40-yard field goal as time expired lifted the Fighting Irish over Navy.\n* 2007 \u2013 [[2007 Navy vs. Notre Dame football game|Navy 46, Notre Dame 44 (3OT)]] \u2013 After 43 years, Navy beat Notre Dame in triple overtime.\n\n==Game results==\n{{Sports rivalry series table\n| format = compact | cols = 2 | series_summary = yes\n| team1 = Navy\n| team1style = {{NCAA secondary color cell|Navy Midshipmen}}\n| team2 = Notre Dame\n| team2style = {{NCAA color cell|Notre Dame Fighting Irish}}\n| legend_forfeit_text = Vacated wins{{#tag:ref|Notre Dame's wins in 2012 and 2013 were vacated as a result of NCAA sanctions against the Notre Dame football program issued on November 22, 2016 after the NCAA found that a student-trainer committed academic misconduct for two football players and provided six other players with impermissible academic extra benefits.

Paul's nascent congregation there was made up of pagan, not Jewish, converts ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:2}}). All first-generation Christians were necessarily converts, either pagan or Jewish.  They had written him regarding numerous matters of concern ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:1}}).  Criticizing what he had heard of their meetings, at which they had communal meals, one paragraph in Paul's response reminded them about what he asserted he had \"received from the Lord\" and had \"passed on\" about Jesus' actions and directives at his Last Supper. The ambiguities some find in that wording has generated reams of books, articles and opinions about the Origins of  Eucharist. \n\nIn his 1994 book, ''A Feast of Meanings: Eucharistic Theologies from Jesus through Johannine Circles'', [[Bruce Chilton]] wrote that Paul \"indeed 'received from the Lord' (1 Corinthians 11:23), through Cephas (Galatians 1:18), what he 'handed over' (1 Corinthians 11:23) to his hearers. \u2026 He reminds his hearers of what he already had taught as authoritative, a teaching 'from the Lord' and presumably warranted by the earliest 'pillars': in that sense, what he hands on is not his own, but derives from his highest authority, 'the Lord' (11:23).\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yTQZ__LDiJ4C A Feast of Meanings: Eucharistic Theologies from Jesus through Johannine Circles, by Bruce Chilton 1994] {{ISBN|9004099492}} p. 110</ref>  Eugene LaVerdiere wrote: \"That is how Paul introduced the tradition, presenting himself as a link in the chain of Eucharistic tradition.

At first, they spread through word of mouth, but within a generation Christians had begun writing about Jesus and about Christian practice, the Eucharist included. The theology of the Eucharist and its role as a sacrament developed during this period.\n\nBasing himself on the ''First Apology'' and the ''Dialogue with Trypho'' of [[Justin Martyr]] writing around 150 AD, K.W. Noakes deduces the following liturgical structure was in use at that time:\n# Scripture Readings and Homily.\n# Intercessions and Kiss-of-Peace.\n# Bread and Cup are brought to the Celebrant.\n# Eucharistic Prayer (flexible) but following a fixed pattern with congregational \u201cAmen\u201d\n# Distribution of the elements by the deacons to those present and absent.\n# Collection.\nThis corresponds in general outline to the structure of the rite as used today and is the earliest known example. The theology is as follows: the bread and wine are transformed into the Flesh and Blood of Jesus; they are the pure sacrifice spoken of by Malachi (1:11) and the eucharistic prayer itself is both a thanksgiving for creation and redemption and an ''[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]]'' (Greek: memorial) of the passion (and possibly the incarnation).<ref name=\"Noakes 1979 171f\"/>\n\nInformation from the intervening period is scanty.<ref>{{citation | last=Noakes | first=K.W. |contribution= The Eucharist: 2 From the Apostolic Fathers to Irenaeus| title=The Study of Liturgy | editor-last=Jones |editor-first= Cheslyn| location= London| publisher=SPCK | year=1979|page=170}}</ref>  Both the author of 1 Clement (about 96) and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (about 108) are concerned that due order be maintained;<ref>\"Let that eucharist alone be considered valid which is celebrated in the presence of the bishop, or of him to whom he shall have entrusted it. ...

London: SPCK (1970) p. vii</ref>  They therefore try to decide where the distinct components of the later rite originated by examining possible cultural elements, both Jewish and Hellenic, which already existed in the period under study.  The underlying debate is over the relative contributions of Paul and Jesus and the possible intervention of other factors.  One key consideration in this is the problem of the Jewish prohibition of drinking blood (see below).\n\nProfessor Robert J. Daly, S.J., argues that Jesus did indeed institute the Eucharist, though it took generations and centuries of guidance from the Holy Spirit for the Eucharist to reach its current form. \"What Jesus did at the Last Supper is obviously at least the generative moment of the institution of the Eucharist.\"  But it was not the Eucharist as we know it. \"The Eucharist that Christians now celebrate is what the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit of the risen Jesus, and over the course of generations and centuries, learned to do as it celebrated table fellowship with its risen Lord.\"<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March, 2005</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Bruce Chilton suggests that we can find in the New Testament six different ways of celebrating what Christians came to call the Eucharist, and can locate each of these in its own specific socio-religio-political setting. This would seem to make irrelevant a number of time-honored scholarly approaches, fundamental to which were, first, the \"literally true\" vs. \"literary fictions\" debate, and, second, the assumption that there was a unified line of development from the established Eucharist of later centuries back close to the time of the historical Jesus.<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March 2005</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The six Eucharists in the New Testament, according to Bruce Chilton\n|-\n!width=\"16%\"| Jesus' Table Fellowship\n!width=\"16%\"| The \"Last Supper\"\n!width=\"20%\"| Petrine Christianity\n!width=\"16%\"| The Circle of James\n!width=\"16%\"| Paul and the Synoptics\n!width=\"16%\"| John\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus joined with his followers in meals that were designed to anticipate the coming of God's kingdom. The meals were characterized by a readiness to accept the hospitality and the produce of Israel at large. A willingness to provide for the meals, to join in the fellowship, to forgive and to be forgiven, was seen by Jesus as a sufficient condition for eating in his company and for entry into the kingdom.  Jesus' approach to purity qualification was distinctive in its inclusiveness. For Jesus, the primary markers of purity, the primary requirements for table fellowship in the kingdom were: Israel as forgiven and willing to provide of its own produce.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus sought to influence or reform purity practices associated with the Temple. In his meals, as he shared wine, he started referring to it as the equivalent of the blood of an animal shed in sacrifice, and in sharing bread, claiming that its value was that of sacrificial flesh. \"Here was a sacrifice of sharings which the authorities could not control, and which the nature of Jesus' movement made it impossible for them to ignore. Jesus' meals after his failed occupation of the Temple became a surrogate of sacrifice, the second type of Eucharist.\"\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| In this stage of Eucharistic development, the berakhah prayer of Judaism seems to have become a principal model of Eucharist. Bread took precedence over wine, and, as Acts 1:12-26, 2:46, and 3:14:37 clearly describe, a double domestication took place. Instead of seeking the hospitality of others, as the itinerant Jesus seemed to do, adherents of the movement, under the leadership of Peter and/or the Twelve, gathered in the homes of colleagues where they \"broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people\" (Acts 2:46\u201347). In addition, apparently they also acknowledged the validity of sacrifice in the Temple. In doing this they changed the nature of the meal and the memory of what Jesus had said at that meal. For example, there is no mention of wine, nor does there, in this account of the earliest Christian gatherings, seem to have been any sense of being in tension with the officials of Judaism or its religious practices.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| The tendency to domestication is here pursued further, for the Eucharist is now seen as a Seder meal, open only to Jews in a state of purity, and to be celebrated only once a year, at Passover, in Jerusalem, as prescribed in Exodus 12:48. The effect of this Jacobean program\u2014a possible antecedent to the later Quartodeciman practice?\u2014\"was to integrate Jesus' movement fully within the liturgical institutions of Judaism, to insist upon the Judaic identity of the movement and upon Jerusalem as its governing center,\" but without actually replacing Israel's Seder.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Paul vehemently resisted Jacobean claims. He also emphasized the link between Jesus' death and the Eucharist, and he accepts what Chilton calls the Hellenistic refinement of the Petrine type that presented the Eucharist as a sacrifice for sin. This is also what we find in the Synoptic Gospels which use words to suggest that Jesus' blood is shed in the interests of the communities for which those Gospels were composed: for the \"many\" (in Damascus?) Matthew 26:28 and (in Rome?) Mark 14:24: on behalf of \"you\" (in Antioch?) Luke 22:20.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus identifies himself in John 6 as the manna, now developed to construe the Eucharist as a mystery in which Jesus, not literally but sacramentally, offers/gives his own personal body and blood in Eucharist. This would probably not be a totally new idea to Hellenistic Christians who followed synoptic practice. But Johannine practice now makes this meaning explicit. It was, as is characteristic of the Fourth Gospel, an unambiguous, clear break with Judaism. For with this development, Eucharist has become a \"sacrament\" understandable only in Hellenistic terms, and involving \"a knowing conflict with the ordinary understanding of what Judaism might and might not include.\"\n|}\n\n===Eucharist and its relation to the Last Supper===\n[[Paul F. Bradshaw]] argues in ''Eucharistic Origins'' that it is not until after the 1st century and much later in some areas that the Eucharist and the Last Supper became placed in a relation of dependence: many Eucharists did not relate to the Paschal mystery and/or the Last Supper.<ref>Bradshaw, Paul, ''Eucharistic Origins'' (London, SPCK, 2004) {{ISBN|0281056153}}, p. 10.</ref> On the other hand, in the middle of the 1st century Paul the Apostle explicitly placed the celebration of the Lord's Supper in relation to what Jesus did on the night he was handed over, in giving his disciples bread with the words \"This is my body\" and, after the supper, giving them the cup with a similar declaration about his blood.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201325}}</ref><ref>\"The earliest reference to the Eucharist is in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:23\u201324) where he attributes its institution to the actions and words of Jesus at the Last Supper\" ([http://www.culham.ac.uk/christiancontent/aspects/c2d3.php Culham Institute: Knowledge Content in Religious Education: Christianity \u2013 A Guide For Teachers New To Religious Education])</ref>\n\n[[John Dominic Crossan]] suggests that there are two traditions \"as old as we can trace them\" of the eucharist, that of Paul, reflecting the Antioch Church's tradition, and that of the [[Didache]], the first document to give explicit instruction regarding prayers to be said at a celebration that it called the Eucharist.\n\nThe cup/bread liturgy of the Didache, from the Jerusalem tradition, does not mention Passover, or Last Supper, or Death of Jesus/blood/body, and the sequence is meal + thanksgiving ritual.  For Crossan, it is dispositive that <blockquote>even late in the first century C.E., at least some (southern?) Syrian Christians could celebrate a Eucharist of bread and wine with absolutely no hint of Passover meal, Last Supper or passion symbolism built into its origins or development.

The sound of scholarly silence]''</ref> in the Biblical Theology Bulletin, Michael J. Cahill surveyed the state of scholarly literature from some seventy cited sources, dating from the 1950s to the present, on the question of the likelihood of a Jewish Jesus proposing the drinking of blood in the Eucharist.<ref>For instance, [[Hyam Maccoby]] proposes that \"Paul, not Jesus, was the originator of the eucharist, and that the eucharist itself is not a Jewish, but an essentially Hellenistic rite, showing principal affinities not with the Jewish qiddush, but with the ritual meal of the mystery religions.\" John M. G. Barclay \"stresses the anomalous nature of Paul. If Paul's status were to be determined on the single issue of the drinking of blood, it would have to be conceded that Paul simply moves off the scale.\" [[A. N. Wilson]], whose work, Cahill says, synthesizes scholarly trends, distinguishes between the Jewishness of Jesus and Paul: \"... the idea that a pious Jew such as Jesus would have spent his last evening on earth asking his disciples to drink a cup of blood, even symbolically, is unthinkable\". He sees no problem, however, in proposing \"the genius of Paul,\" \"Paul's fertile brain,\" as the source of the Christian Eucharist incorporating the blood-drinking element.\nCahill writes: \"It is instructive to recall the context in which the drinking of blood was acceptable. First-century folk who participated in mystery cult rituals were no more tolerant of cannibalism than we are. There is no evidence that, in itself, drinking of blood was not revolting for them, generally speaking. Yet, we find it in religious ritual. The reason is that they were drinking the blood of an animal that had been numinized in some way and had come to be identified with the god. Drinking the blood of a god was acceptable.\" Otfried Hofius, argues for the authenticity of the passage in 1 Corinthians where Paul speaks of the Eucharist, writing: \"A convincing proof that the Apostle has himself encroached on the wording of the tradition delivered to him has not thus far been adduced.\" David Wenham writes: \"Jesus typically uses vivid, almost shocking metaphors (e.g., Matt 18:8\u20139; Mark 9:43\u201348). Furthermore, that the shocking eucharistic words came to be accepted by Jewish Christians (including Matthew) may suggest that they were not quite as unacceptable as Vermes supposes or that they had a strong claim to authenticity, since they would not easily have been accepted if they were not in the Jewish Christian tradition.\" John Meier, too, insists on Jesus' propensity to use \"shocking symbols\", in reference to the words of the institution narrative and in his \"deliberate flouting of certain social conventions\". He gives particular attention to \"a subversive aphorism of Jesus,\" referring to \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"</ref> After examining the various theories that have been suggested, he concludes:\n<blockquote>\nThe survey of opinion, old and new, reveals wide disagreement with a fundamental divide between those who can accept that the notion of drinking blood could have a Jewish origin and those who insist that this is a later development to be located in the Hellenistic world. What both sides share is an inability to proffer a rationally convincing argument that can provide a historical explanation for the presence of this particular component of the Eucharistic rite. Those who hold for the literal institution by Jesus have not been able to explain plausibly how the drinking of blood could have arisen in a Jewish setting. In fact, this difficulty has been turned into an argument for authenticity. For example, Jeremiah ''[sic]'' quotes Dalman: \"Exactly that which seems scandalous will be historical\" (170\u201371). [[W. D. Davies]] draws attention to the fact that Dalman also argued that the Pauline version of the institution arose in a gentile environment to eliminate the difficulties presented by the more direct Markan form (246). It would appear to be obvious that the difficulties would have been greater in a Jewish environment. Davies' conclusion is apt: \"When such divergent conclusons ''[sic]'' have been based upon the same evidence any dogmatism would be foolish\" (246). On the other hand, I have earlier argued that previous suggestions supporting the non-Jewish source have been vitiated by vague generalities or by association with inappropriate pagan rituals.\n</blockquote>\nIn the account of the [[Last Supper]] in Luke chapter 22, the wine that is consumed at the [[passover]] meal is shown to not be literally blood, but represents the blood that Jesus will shed by his death on the cross. It was a deliberate act of tying the Passover story from the [[Book of Exodus]] to the [[Crucifixion]], and the shed blood of the passover lamb being painted on the lintels of the Hebrews' doors, to Jesus \"...the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\" and his sacrifice at the time of passover.\n<blockquote>\n'And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u201cThis is my body given for you; do this ''in remembrance of me''.\u201d In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\"' (Luke 22:19-20)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Possible cultural influences==\n\n===Jewish ritual meal practice===\nScholars have associated Jesus' Last Supper and the 1st-century Eucharist practices with three  [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jewish]] meal practices: the [[kiddush]] blessing with wine, and the chaburah fellowship and the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] meal.\n\n====Kiddush====\nThe Johannine Supper, Ratcliff has suggested,<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\">Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [13th edition] (1926), Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref> was the Jewish ordinance known as ''Kiddush'', the details of which involved the leader of the mixed-sex ceremony taking a cup of wine, sanctifying it by reciting a thanksgiving blessing, and passing it around. There was a similar blessing and breaking of bread.<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\nKiddush is the \"Jewish benediction and prayer recited over a cup of wine immediately before the meal on the eve of the sabbath or of a festival.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-317334/Kiddush Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online].</ref> After reciting the kiddush the master of the house sips from the cup, and then passes it to his wife and to the others at the table; then all wash their hands, and the master of the house blesses the bread, cuts it, and passes a morsel to each person at the table.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=204&letter=K Adler, Cyrus & Dembitz, Lewis N., The Jewish Encyclopedia (1911) \u1e32IDDUSH]</ref>\n\nRatcliff wrote: \"Though the kiddush accounts for the '[Johannine]' Last Supper, it affords no explanation on the origin of the eucharist ... the Last Supper and the Sabbath-Passover Kiddush was therefore no unusual occurrence.  It represented consistent practice since Jesus had first formed the group. It is from this practice, rather than from any direct institution from Jesus, that the eucharist derives its origin. The practice was too firmly established for the group to abandon it, when its Master had been taken away; the primitive apostolic eucharist is no other than the continuation of Jesus's chaburah meal. This is the 'breaking of bread' of  Acts ii. 42.\"<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\n\nJoachim Jeremias disputed the view that the Last Supper was kiddush,<ref>Joachim Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref> because the Kiddush was always associated with the Sabbath, and even if there was a Passover kiddush, it would have taken place immediately before the seder, not the day before.\n\n====Chaburah====\nThe chaburah (also 'haburah', pl 'chaburoth') is not the name of a rite, rather it was the name of a group of male friends who met at regular intervals (weekly for Dix) for conversation and a formal meal appurtenant to that meeting.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5hEnxn3QPsC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=chaburoth&source=web&ots=EkvA9vjpU-&sig=fX4q8msCyu3rm_g483lO7hW4unk Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 50]</ref><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\">[http://www.stmarksottawa.ca/info.html#special Rev.

The corporate meeting of a chaburah usually took the form of a supper, held at regular intervals, often on the eve of sabbaths or holy days. Each member of the society contributed towards the provision of this common meal.\n\nThe form of the supper was largely the same as the chief meal of the day in every pious Jewish household. Each kind of food was blessed when it was first brought to the table. At the end of the meal came the grace after meals \u2013 the Blessing or Benediction as it was called. This long prayer was said by the host or father of the family in the name of all who had eaten the meal. On important occasions, and at a chaburah supper, it was recited over a special cup of wine known quite naturally as \"the cup of blessing.\" At the end of the Thanksgiving prayer this cup was sipped by the leader and then by each of those present. The chaburah supper was concluded by the singing of a psalm, after which the meeting broke up.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\"/>\n\nJeremias also disputed that the Last Supper was a chaburah meal, interposing the objection that the chaburah was a \"duty\" meal, held appurtenant to a formal occasion such as a 'bris' or a betrothal.<ref>Jeremias, Joachim, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref>\n\n====Passover Seder====\nPassover commemorates God's saving of his chosen people, the Israelites, who, according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:1\u201329}}, were spared death through the blood of lambs. The [[Passover Seder]] involves [[Passover Seder#The Four Cups|four cups of wine]].\n\nWhether the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover Meal (as the chronology of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] would suggest) or not (as [[Gospel of John|St John]]), it is clear that the Eucharist was instituted at Passover time, and Christian writers from Saint Paul ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7}}) onwards have stressed that the death of Christ was the fulfilment of the sacrifice foreshadowed by the Passover.\"<ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}), article ''Passover''</ref>\n\nEnrico Mazza has argued that the view that the Last Supper was a Passover meal \"remains a theological interpretation. The historical fact is that the Last Supper was not a Passover celebration and, consequently, that its liturgy was not that of the Jewish Passover.\"<ref>The Celebration of the Eucharist: The Origin of the Rite and the Development of Its Interpretation [Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999] pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nJoachim Jeremias, having rejected the previous two possible backgrounds for the Last Supper argues forcibly that it was a ''Passover Seder'' while recognising that there are difficulties.  His case may be summed as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Was the Last Supper a Passover Seder?  according to Joachim Jeremias<ref>[http://www.abcog.org/green1.htm Eucharistic Sacrifice in the New Testament]</ref>\n|-\n!

By the 2nd century BC, [[Ben Sira|Jesus Ben Sirach]] described Jewish feasting, with numerous parallels to Hellenic practice, without disapproval.<ref>{{bibleverse||Sirach|31:12-32:13|NAB}}</ref><ref name=Smith/> Gentile and Jewish practice was that the all-male participants reclined at table on their left elbows, and after a benediction given by the host (in the case of a Jewish meal), would have a ''deipnon'' (late afternoon or evening meal) of bread with various vegetables, perhaps some fish or even meat if the meal was extravagant.\n\nAmong the Greeks, a ritual libation, or sacrificial pouring out of wine, followed, with another benediction or blessing, leading to the 'symposion' (as in Plato's Symposium) or wine-drinking course and entertainment.  Thus was established an order of breaking bread and drinking wine. Cups of wine were even passed from diner to diner as a way to pass responsibility for speaking next.  \"Plutarch spoke in the highest terms of the bonds created by the shared wine bowl. His words are echoed by Paul who spoke of the sharing of bread and wine as the act that created the one body, that is to say, it was a community-creating ritual.\"<ref>[http://www.philipharland.com/meals/2003%20Smith%20Paper.pdf Smith, Dennis (2003).

Upper Saddle River, New Jersey:  Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998.</ref> In contrast, the ancient Greek tragedy, [[The Bacchae]], a ritual involving the wine of Dionysus is not drunk, but poured out as a libation. In the Greek novel, [[Leucippe and Clitophon]] by [[Achilles Tatius]], Dionysus is said to have given a sheperd of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] his first wine.

He concluded: \"These few instances are sufficient to show the extraordinarily wide diffusion of Totem-sacraments and Eucharistic rites all over the world.\"<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/pcc/index.htm Edward Carpenter, ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'' (1920), pp. 54\u201368]</ref>\n\n===Pre-Pauline confluence of Greek and Jewish traditions and ''agap\u0113''===\n\nBy the time of the Roman conquest, Jews practiced festive dining in essentially the same form as the Greeks, with a dinner (deipnon) followed by the symposium proper, where guests drank wine and enjoyed entertainment or conversation. There were, to be sure, cultic differences, such as a [[berakhah]] over the wine cup instead of the Greeks' libation to Dionysus. But eating together was a central activity for Jewish religious groups such as Pharisees and Essenes.\n\n\"Thanksgiving\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\" [eucharistia]) is probably to be regarded as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew \"\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4\" [berakhah, berakah], the Jewish \"blessing\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\" [eulogia]) \"addressed to God at meals for and over the food and drink.

These were often called [[agape feast]]s, although terminology varied in the first few centuries along with other aspects of practice. ''[[Agape]]'' is one of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''love,'' and so \"agape feasts\" are also referred to in English as \"love-feasts\".\n\nThis Hellenic ritual was apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing a contribution to the meal according to their means. Perhaps predictably enough, it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking, or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community of the type criticised by Paul in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:20\u201322}}.\n<!-- The [[Councils of Carthage|Third Council of Carthage]] (393) and the [[Council of Orl\u00e9ans|Second Council of Orleans]] (541)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EeoAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22&hl=en&ei=MuvlTaSJHY-6hAeK7aHbCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q=%22second%20council%20of%20orleans%22&f=false The Gospel Advocate, volume 3 (1823),] Richard Lee Cole, ''Love-feasts: A History of the Christian Agape'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBdnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&hl=en&ei=gt_lTYitJMS5hAfCw-TLCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ The Antiquaries Journal (Oxford University Press 1975)] and several other books mention a prohibition of the Agape by the Second Council of Orleans in AD 541.

Many Christians today after celebrating the Eucharist or another liturgy, now routinely participate in an informal sharing of light refreshments and conversation. This post-Eucharistic gathering is often called \"fellowship hour\" or \"coffee hour\" and is regarded by many clergy as a particularly opportune time for engaging adults in Christian education.

Paul's nascent congregation there was made up of pagan, not Jewish, converts ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:2}}). All first-generation Christians were necessarily converts, either pagan or Jewish.  They had written him regarding numerous matters of concern ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:1}}).  Criticizing what he had heard of their meetings, at which they had communal meals, one paragraph in Paul's response reminded them about what he asserted he had \"received from the Lord\" and had \"passed on\" about Jesus' actions and directives at his Last Supper. The ambiguities some find in that wording has generated reams of books, articles and opinions about the Origins of  Eucharist. \n\nIn his 1994 book, ''A Feast of Meanings: Eucharistic Theologies from Jesus through Johannine Circles'', [[Bruce Chilton]] wrote that Paul \"indeed 'received from the Lord' (1 Corinthians 11:23), through Cephas (Galatians 1:18), what he 'handed over' (1 Corinthians 11:23) to his hearers. \u2026 He reminds his hearers of what he already had taught as authoritative, a teaching 'from the Lord' and presumably warranted by the earliest 'pillars': in that sense, what he hands on is not his own, but derives from his highest authority, 'the Lord' (11:23).\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yTQZ__LDiJ4C A Feast of Meanings: Eucharistic Theologies from Jesus through Johannine Circles, by Bruce Chilton 1994] {{ISBN|9004099492}} p. 110</ref>  Eugene LaVerdiere wrote: \"That is how Paul introduced the tradition, presenting himself as a link in the chain of Eucharistic tradition.

At first, they spread through word of mouth, but within a generation Christians had begun writing about Jesus and about Christian practice, the Eucharist included. The theology of the Eucharist and its role as a sacrament developed during this period.\n\nBasing himself on the ''First Apology'' and the ''Dialogue with Trypho'' of [[Justin Martyr]] writing around 150 AD, K.W. Noakes deduces the following liturgical structure was in use at that time:\n# Scripture Readings and Homily.\n# Intercessions and Kiss-of-Peace.\n# Bread and Cup are brought to the Celebrant.\n# Eucharistic Prayer (flexible) but following a fixed pattern with congregational \u201cAmen\u201d\n# Distribution of the elements by the deacons to those present and absent.\n# Collection.\nThis corresponds in general outline to the structure of the rite as used today and is the earliest known example. The theology is as follows: the bread and wine are transformed into the Flesh and Blood of Jesus; they are the pure sacrifice spoken of by Malachi (1:11) and the eucharistic prayer itself is both a thanksgiving for creation and redemption and an ''[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]]'' (Greek: memorial) of the passion (and possibly the incarnation).<ref name=\"Noakes 1979 171f\"/>\n\nInformation from the intervening period is scanty.<ref>{{citation | last=Noakes | first=K.W. |contribution= The Eucharist: 2 From the Apostolic Fathers to Irenaeus| title=The Study of Liturgy | editor-last=Jones |editor-first= Cheslyn| location= London| publisher=SPCK | year=1979|page=170}}</ref>  Both the author of 1 Clement (about 96) and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (about 108) are concerned that due order be maintained;<ref>\"Let that eucharist alone be considered valid which is celebrated in the presence of the bishop, or of him to whom he shall have entrusted it. ...

London: SPCK (1970) p. vii</ref>  They therefore try to decide where the distinct components of the later rite originated by examining possible cultural elements, both Jewish and Hellenic, which already existed in the period under study.  The underlying debate is over the relative contributions of Paul and Jesus and the possible intervention of other factors.  One key consideration in this is the problem of the Jewish prohibition of drinking blood (see below).\n\nProfessor Robert J. Daly, S.J., argues that Jesus did indeed institute the Eucharist, though it took generations and centuries of guidance from the Holy Spirit for the Eucharist to reach its current form. \"What Jesus did at the Last Supper is obviously at least the generative moment of the institution of the Eucharist.\"  But it was not the Eucharist as we know it. \"The Eucharist that Christians now celebrate is what the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit of the risen Jesus, and over the course of generations and centuries, learned to do as it celebrated table fellowship with its risen Lord.\"<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March, 2005</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Bruce Chilton suggests that we can find in the New Testament six different ways of celebrating what Christians came to call the Eucharist, and can locate each of these in its own specific socio-religio-political setting. This would seem to make irrelevant a number of time-honored scholarly approaches, fundamental to which were, first, the \"literally true\" vs. \"literary fictions\" debate, and, second, the assumption that there was a unified line of development from the established Eucharist of later centuries back close to the time of the historical Jesus.<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March 2005</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The six Eucharists in the New Testament, according to Bruce Chilton\n|-\n!width=\"16%\"| Jesus' Table Fellowship\n!width=\"16%\"| The \"Last Supper\"\n!width=\"20%\"| Petrine Christianity\n!width=\"16%\"| The Circle of James\n!width=\"16%\"| Paul and the Synoptics\n!width=\"16%\"| John\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus joined with his followers in meals that were designed to anticipate the coming of God's kingdom. The meals were characterized by a readiness to accept the hospitality and the produce of Israel at large. A willingness to provide for the meals, to join in the fellowship, to forgive and to be forgiven, was seen by Jesus as a sufficient condition for eating in his company and for entry into the kingdom.  Jesus' approach to purity qualification was distinctive in its inclusiveness. For Jesus, the primary markers of purity, the primary requirements for table fellowship in the kingdom were: Israel as forgiven and willing to provide of its own produce.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus sought to influence or reform purity practices associated with the Temple. In his meals, as he shared wine, he started referring to it as the equivalent of the blood of an animal shed in sacrifice, and in sharing bread, claiming that its value was that of sacrificial flesh. \"Here was a sacrifice of sharings which the authorities could not control, and which the nature of Jesus' movement made it impossible for them to ignore. Jesus' meals after his failed occupation of the Temple became a surrogate of sacrifice, the second type of Eucharist.\"\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| In this stage of Eucharistic development, the berakhah prayer of Judaism seems to have become a principal model of Eucharist. Bread took precedence over wine, and, as Acts 1:12-26, 2:46, and 3:14:37 clearly describe, a double domestication took place. Instead of seeking the hospitality of others, as the itinerant Jesus seemed to do, adherents of the movement, under the leadership of Peter and/or the Twelve, gathered in the homes of colleagues where they \"broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people\" (Acts 2:46\u201347). In addition, apparently they also acknowledged the validity of sacrifice in the Temple. In doing this they changed the nature of the meal and the memory of what Jesus had said at that meal. For example, there is no mention of wine, nor does there, in this account of the earliest Christian gatherings, seem to have been any sense of being in tension with the officials of Judaism or its religious practices.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| The tendency to domestication is here pursued further, for the Eucharist is now seen as a Seder meal, open only to Jews in a state of purity, and to be celebrated only once a year, at Passover, in Jerusalem, as prescribed in Exodus 12:48. The effect of this Jacobean program\u2014a possible antecedent to the later Quartodeciman practice?\u2014\"was to integrate Jesus' movement fully within the liturgical institutions of Judaism, to insist upon the Judaic identity of the movement and upon Jerusalem as its governing center,\" but without actually replacing Israel's Seder.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Paul vehemently resisted Jacobean claims. He also emphasized the link between Jesus' death and the Eucharist, and he accepts what Chilton calls the Hellenistic refinement of the Petrine type that presented the Eucharist as a sacrifice for sin. This is also what we find in the Synoptic Gospels which use words to suggest that Jesus' blood is shed in the interests of the communities for which those Gospels were composed: for the \"many\" (in Damascus?) Matthew 26:28 and (in Rome?) Mark 14:24: on behalf of \"you\" (in Antioch?) Luke 22:20.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus identifies himself in John 6 as the manna, now developed to construe the Eucharist as a mystery in which Jesus, not literally but sacramentally, offers/gives his own personal body and blood in Eucharist. This would probably not be a totally new idea to Hellenistic Christians who followed synoptic practice. But Johannine practice now makes this meaning explicit. It was, as is characteristic of the Fourth Gospel, an unambiguous, clear break with Judaism. For with this development, Eucharist has become a \"sacrament\" understandable only in Hellenistic terms, and involving \"a knowing conflict with the ordinary understanding of what Judaism might and might not include.\"\n|}\n\n===Eucharist and its relation to the Last Supper===\n[[Paul F. Bradshaw]] argues in ''Eucharistic Origins'' that it is not until after the 1st century and much later in some areas that the Eucharist and the Last Supper became placed in a relation of dependence: many Eucharists did not relate to the Paschal mystery and/or the Last Supper.<ref>Bradshaw, Paul, ''Eucharistic Origins'' (London, SPCK, 2004) {{ISBN|0281056153}}, p. 10.</ref> On the other hand, in the middle of the 1st century Paul the Apostle explicitly placed the celebration of the Lord's Supper in relation to what Jesus did on the night he was handed over, in giving his disciples bread with the words \"This is my body\" and, after the supper, giving them the cup with a similar declaration about his blood.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201325}}</ref><ref>\"The earliest reference to the Eucharist is in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:23\u201324) where he attributes its institution to the actions and words of Jesus at the Last Supper\" ([http://www.culham.ac.uk/christiancontent/aspects/c2d3.php Culham Institute: Knowledge Content in Religious Education: Christianity \u2013 A Guide For Teachers New To Religious Education])</ref>\n\n[[John Dominic Crossan]] suggests that there are two traditions \"as old as we can trace them\" of the eucharist, that of Paul, reflecting the Antioch Church's tradition, and that of the [[Didache]], the first document to give explicit instruction regarding prayers to be said at a celebration that it called the Eucharist.\n\nThe cup/bread liturgy of the Didache, from the Jerusalem tradition, does not mention Passover, or Last Supper, or Death of Jesus/blood/body, and the sequence is meal + thanksgiving ritual.  For Crossan, it is dispositive that <blockquote>even late in the first century C.E., at least some (southern?) Syrian Christians could celebrate a Eucharist of bread and wine with absolutely no hint of Passover meal, Last Supper or passion symbolism built into its origins or development.  I cannot believe that they knew about those elements and studiously avoided them.  I can only presume that they were not there for everyone from the beginning, that is, from solemn formal and final institution by Jesus himself.<ref>Crossan, John Dominic, \"The Historical Jesus\" HarperCollins 1992 p. 364</ref></blockquote>\nPaul's first letter to the Corinthians, in the context of correcting the habits of the Corinthians serves to reestablish \"the Pre-Pauline tradition, ritual of bread/body + meal + ritual of cup/blood.\" <ref>Crossan, John Dominic \"The Birth of Christianity, Harper/Collins, 2002, p. 436</ref>  Hellenized Jew Paul references a Greek weekly Lord's Supper, which is not an annual Jewish Passover meal, and does not have the participants giving thanks (\"Eucharistia\"), rather the purpose is to proclaim Jesus' death until he comes again, in the manner of Hellenic societies formed \"to hold meals in remembrance of those who had died and to drink a cup in honor of some god.\"<ref>Funk, ibid. at 139\u2013140</ref> Some authors would consider Paul to be the \"Founder\" of the Eucharist in a pagan context appealing to the Jewish prohibition against drinking blood, the pervasive history of Greek memorial dining societies, and Paul's own hellenistic background.\"<ref>Funk, Robert, and the Jesus Seminar, \"The Acts of Jesus\" Harper Collins, 1998, p. 139</ref> Paul, however, explicitly stated that he was rehearsing a Christian tradition, something that he himself had \"received\" and had already \"handed on\" to the Corinthians.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QaFu25KmgiIC&pg=PA425&dq=paul+eucharist+corinthians&hl=en&ei=I58eTtnEH4exhQeYk_WnAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=paul%20eucharist%20corinthians&f=false Raymond F.

Crossan maintains that table fellowship was central to Jesus' ministry in that was infamous for violating codes of honor to eat freely with outsiders, termed \"sinners and tax collectors\" in the Gospels. Jesus presumably taught at the table, as was customary. This emphasis on table fellowship is reflected in the large number of eating scenes in early Christian art.<ref name=\"EJ\">Crossan, John Dominic. The essential Jesus.

The sound of scholarly silence]''</ref> in the Biblical Theology Bulletin, Michael J. Cahill surveyed the state of scholarly literature from some seventy cited sources, dating from the 1950s to the present, on the question of the likelihood of a Jewish Jesus proposing the drinking of blood in the Eucharist.<ref>For instance, [[Hyam Maccoby]] proposes that \"Paul, not Jesus, was the originator of the eucharist, and that the eucharist itself is not a Jewish, but an essentially Hellenistic rite, showing principal affinities not with the Jewish qiddush, but with the ritual meal of the mystery religions.\" John M. G. Barclay \"stresses the anomalous nature of Paul. If Paul's status were to be determined on the single issue of the drinking of blood, it would have to be conceded that Paul simply moves off the scale.\" [[A. N. Wilson]], whose work, Cahill says, synthesizes scholarly trends, distinguishes between the Jewishness of Jesus and Paul: \"... the idea that a pious Jew such as Jesus would have spent his last evening on earth asking his disciples to drink a cup of blood, even symbolically, is unthinkable\". He sees no problem, however, in proposing \"the genius of Paul,\" \"Paul's fertile brain,\" as the source of the Christian Eucharist incorporating the blood-drinking element.\nCahill writes: \"It is instructive to recall the context in which the drinking of blood was acceptable. First-century folk who participated in mystery cult rituals were no more tolerant of cannibalism than we are. There is no evidence that, in itself, drinking of blood was not revolting for them, generally speaking. Yet, we find it in religious ritual. The reason is that they were drinking the blood of an animal that had been numinized in some way and had come to be identified with the god. Drinking the blood of a god was acceptable.\" Otfried Hofius, argues for the authenticity of the passage in 1 Corinthians where Paul speaks of the Eucharist, writing: \"A convincing proof that the Apostle has himself encroached on the wording of the tradition delivered to him has not thus far been adduced.\" David Wenham writes: \"Jesus typically uses vivid, almost shocking metaphors (e.g., Matt 18:8\u20139; Mark 9:43\u201348). Furthermore, that the shocking eucharistic words came to be accepted by Jewish Christians (including Matthew) may suggest that they were not quite as unacceptable as Vermes supposes or that they had a strong claim to authenticity, since they would not easily have been accepted if they were not in the Jewish Christian tradition.\" John Meier, too, insists on Jesus' propensity to use \"shocking symbols\", in reference to the words of the institution narrative and in his \"deliberate flouting of certain social conventions\". He gives particular attention to \"a subversive aphorism of Jesus,\" referring to \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"</ref> After examining the various theories that have been suggested, he concludes:\n<blockquote>\nThe survey of opinion, old and new, reveals wide disagreement with a fundamental divide between those who can accept that the notion of drinking blood could have a Jewish origin and those who insist that this is a later development to be located in the Hellenistic world. What both sides share is an inability to proffer a rationally convincing argument that can provide a historical explanation for the presence of this particular component of the Eucharistic rite. Those who hold for the literal institution by Jesus have not been able to explain plausibly how the drinking of blood could have arisen in a Jewish setting. In fact, this difficulty has been turned into an argument for authenticity. For example, Jeremiah ''[sic]'' quotes Dalman: \"Exactly that which seems scandalous will be historical\" (170\u201371). [[W. D. Davies]] draws attention to the fact that Dalman also argued that the Pauline version of the institution arose in a gentile environment to eliminate the difficulties presented by the more direct Markan form (246). It would appear to be obvious that the difficulties would have been greater in a Jewish environment. Davies' conclusion is apt: \"When such divergent conclusons ''[sic]'' have been based upon the same evidence any dogmatism would be foolish\" (246). On the other hand, I have earlier argued that previous suggestions supporting the non-Jewish source have been vitiated by vague generalities or by association with inappropriate pagan rituals.\n</blockquote>\nIn the account of the [[Last Supper]] in Luke chapter 22, the wine that is consumed at the [[passover]] meal is shown to not be literally blood, but represents the blood that Jesus will shed by his death on the cross. It was a deliberate act of tying the Passover story from the [[Book of Exodus]] to the [[Crucifixion]], and the shed blood of the passover lamb being painted on the lintels of the Hebrews' doors, to Jesus \"...the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\" and his sacrifice at the time of passover.\n<blockquote>\n'And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u201cThis is my body given for you; do this ''in remembrance of me''.\u201d In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\"' (Luke 22:19-20)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Possible cultural influences==\n\n===Jewish ritual meal practice===\nScholars have associated Jesus' Last Supper and the 1st-century Eucharist practices with three  [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jewish]] meal practices: the [[kiddush]] blessing with wine, and the chaburah fellowship and the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] meal.\n\n====Kiddush====\nThe Johannine Supper, Ratcliff has suggested,<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\">Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [13th edition] (1926), Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref> was the Jewish ordinance known as ''Kiddush'', the details of which involved the leader of the mixed-sex ceremony taking a cup of wine, sanctifying it by reciting a thanksgiving blessing, and passing it around. There was a similar blessing and breaking of bread.<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\nKiddush is the \"Jewish benediction and prayer recited over a cup of wine immediately before the meal on the eve of the sabbath or of a festival.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-317334/Kiddush Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online].</ref> After reciting the kiddush the master of the house sips from the cup, and then passes it to his wife and to the others at the table; then all wash their hands, and the master of the house blesses the bread, cuts it, and passes a morsel to each person at the table.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=204&letter=K Adler, Cyrus & Dembitz, Lewis N., The Jewish Encyclopedia (1911) \u1e32IDDUSH]</ref>\n\nRatcliff wrote: \"Though the kiddush accounts for the '[Johannine]' Last Supper, it affords no explanation on the origin of the eucharist ... the Last Supper and the Sabbath-Passover Kiddush was therefore no unusual occurrence.  It represented consistent practice since Jesus had first formed the group. It is from this practice, rather than from any direct institution from Jesus, that the eucharist derives its origin. The practice was too firmly established for the group to abandon it, when its Master had been taken away; the primitive apostolic eucharist is no other than the continuation of Jesus's chaburah meal. This is the 'breaking of bread' of  Acts ii. 42.\"<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\n\nJoachim Jeremias disputed the view that the Last Supper was kiddush,<ref>Joachim Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref> because the Kiddush was always associated with the Sabbath, and even if there was a Passover kiddush, it would have taken place immediately before the seder, not the day before.\n\n====Chaburah====\nThe chaburah (also 'haburah', pl 'chaburoth') is not the name of a rite, rather it was the name of a group of male friends who met at regular intervals (weekly for Dix) for conversation and a formal meal appurtenant to that meeting.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5hEnxn3QPsC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=chaburoth&source=web&ots=EkvA9vjpU-&sig=fX4q8msCyu3rm_g483lO7hW4unk Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 50]</ref><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\">[http://www.stmarksottawa.ca/info.html#special Rev. Dr. Frank Peake, Manual: The Evolution of the Eucharist]</ref> Nothing is said about them in the Bible but scholars have been able to discover some things about them from other sources. The corporate meeting of a chaburah usually took the form of a supper, held at regular intervals, often on the eve of sabbaths or holy days. Each member of the society contributed towards the provision of this common meal.\n\nThe form of the supper was largely the same as the chief meal of the day in every pious Jewish household. Each kind of food was blessed when it was first brought to the table. At the end of the meal came the grace after meals \u2013 the Blessing or Benediction as it was called. This long prayer was said by the host or father of the family in the name of all who had eaten the meal. On important occasions, and at a chaburah supper, it was recited over a special cup of wine known quite naturally as \"the cup of blessing.\" At the end of the Thanksgiving prayer this cup was sipped by the leader and then by each of those present. The chaburah supper was concluded by the singing of a psalm, after which the meeting broke up.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\"/>\n\nJeremias also disputed that the Last Supper was a chaburah meal, interposing the objection that the chaburah was a \"duty\" meal, held appurtenant to a formal occasion such as a 'bris' or a betrothal.<ref>Jeremias, Joachim, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref>\n\n====Passover Seder====\nPassover commemorates God's saving of his chosen people, the Israelites, who, according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:1\u201329}}, were spared death through the blood of lambs. The [[Passover Seder]] involves [[Passover Seder#The Four Cups|four cups of wine]].\n\nWhether the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover Meal (as the chronology of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] would suggest) or not (as [[Gospel of John|St John]]), it is clear that the Eucharist was instituted at Passover time, and Christian writers from Saint Paul ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7}}) onwards have stressed that the death of Christ was the fulfilment of the sacrifice foreshadowed by the Passover.\"<ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}), article ''Passover''</ref>\n\nEnrico Mazza has argued that the view that the Last Supper was a Passover meal \"remains a theological interpretation. The historical fact is that the Last Supper was not a Passover celebration and, consequently, that its liturgy was not that of the Jewish Passover.\"<ref>The Celebration of the Eucharist: The Origin of the Rite and the Development of Its Interpretation [Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999] pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nJoachim Jeremias, having rejected the previous two possible backgrounds for the Last Supper argues forcibly that it was a ''Passover Seder'' while recognising that there are difficulties.  His case may be summed as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Was the Last Supper a Passover Seder?  according to Joachim Jeremias<ref>[http://www.abcog.org/green1.htm Eucharistic Sacrifice in the New Testament]</ref>\n|-\n! Ten factors substantiating Passover\n! Nine factors in objection to Passover actions that would be in violation of ritual regulations\n! Two further objections\n|-\n|\n* The Last Supper took place in Jerusalem\n* it extended into the night\n* it was a small gathering\n* they reclined instead of sitting at table\n* a dish preceded the breaking of bread\n* red wine was drunk\n* when Judas went out, the disciples thought he was going to distribute money to the poor, a Passover custom\n* the meal closed with a hymn - the Paschal Hallel\n* the interpretative words spoken over the bread and wine look like an extension of the Passover Haggadah\n* and the fact that, Jesus did not go to Bethany for the night, but stayed within the area of Greater Jerusalem and made His way to Gethsemane -\n|\n* the walk to Gethsemane\n* the carrying of arms\n* the night session of the Sanhedrin and the condemnation\n* the rending of the High Priest's garments\n* the participation of the Jews in the Roman trial\n* the coming of Simon of Cyrene from the country\n* the execution itself\n* the purchase of linen\n* the preparation of spices and the burial\n|\n* The absence of any reference to the lamb in the accounts of the Supper.\n* The problem of how the annual Passover of the Jews changed into the weekly Eucharist [Holy Communion] of the Christians\n|}\n\n===Greek and other ritual meal practice===\nThe spread of Christianity outside the Jewish communities has led some scholars to investigate whether Hellenistic practices influenced the development of Eucharistic rites, especially in view of the Jewish prohibition of drinking blood (see above).\n\n====Deipnon, libation and symposion====\nDuring the [[Second Temple period]], Hellenic practices were adopted by Jews after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]]. By the 2nd century BC, [[Ben Sira|Jesus Ben Sirach]] described Jewish feasting, with numerous parallels to Hellenic practice, without disapproval.<ref>{{bibleverse||Sirach|31:12-32:13|NAB}}</ref><ref name=Smith/> Gentile and Jewish practice was that the all-male participants reclined at table on their left elbows, and after a benediction given by the host (in the case of a Jewish meal), would have a ''deipnon'' (late afternoon or evening meal) of bread with various vegetables, perhaps some fish or even meat if the meal was extravagant.\n\nAmong the Greeks, a ritual libation, or sacrificial pouring out of wine, followed, with another benediction or blessing, leading to the 'symposion' (as in Plato's Symposium) or wine-drinking course and entertainment.  Thus was established an order of breaking bread and drinking wine. Cups of wine were even passed from diner to diner as a way to pass responsibility for speaking next.  \"Plutarch spoke in the highest terms of the bonds created by the shared wine bowl. His words are echoed by Paul who spoke of the sharing of bread and wine as the act that created the one body, that is to say, it was a community-creating ritual.\"<ref>[http://www.philipharland.com/meals/2003%20Smith%20Paper.pdf Smith, Dennis (2003).

Still more important in the present context is the fact that [[Tertullian]] speaks of the Lord's Supper (the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] \"\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd ''\u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd''\") precisely as the \"dominicum ''convivium''\" (see [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tertullian/tertullian.uxor2.shtml Ad uxorem 2:4:2], and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.v.ii.iv.html translation]).</ref> The number of participants at such meals in private houses, as opposed to other specially designated places, would be at most a dozen.<ref>\"The term ''convivium'' labels a late afternoon or evening meal taking place in a domestic dining room or garden, hosted by the proprietor of the residence, involving some combination of family members and guests numbering anywhere from a very few up to perhaps a dozen (nine is an ideal but not necessarily standard number), and ordinarily employing a single ''triclinium'', the three-sided arrangement of couches commonly used for dining during the period of this study. ... \"civic\" dining, which occurred on special occasions such as festivals, was publicly sponsored or paid for by a single donor, and might involve large numbers of people spread over many triclinia in the public spaces of cities and towns; or, alternatively, involved a college of priests or magistrates whose meals might be paid for publicly or by an endowment, and might occur in specially designated spaces.\" ([http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8190.html Matthew B.

Jewish feast practices had taken on Hellenic forms as noted above. [[Dionysus]] was \"god of 'the vine' - representing wine, the most universally popular beverage in the ancient world.\" <ref>Harris, Stephen L., ''Understanding the Bible.'' (Mayfield Publishing Company 4th ed.) p. 287.{{ISBN|1559346558}}</ref> [[Barry B.

With new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe.  Upper Saddle River, New Jersey:  Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998.</ref> In contrast, the ancient Greek tragedy, [[The Bacchae]], a ritual involving the wine of Dionysus is not drunk, but poured out as a libation. In the Greek novel, [[Leucippe and Clitophon]] by [[Achilles Tatius]], Dionysus is said to have given a sheperd of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] his first wine. When Dionysus shows the grape cluster where he got the wine from, Tatius parodies the Christian eucharist rite.<ref>Reardon, B.P., ''Collected Ancient Greek Novels'' (University of California Press 2nd ed.) p. 192.</ref>\n\n====Totem-sacrifices====\nIn the chapter \"Totem-Sacrifices and Eucharists\" of his 1920 book ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'', [[Edward Carpenter]] advanced the theory that the Christian Eucharist arose from an almost universal practice of a tribe occasionally eating the animal that it identified with, a practice that he saw as developing into ceremonial eatings of shared food by lamas in Nepal and Tibet, ancient Egyptians, Aztecs, Peruvians, Chinese and Tartars. He concluded: \"These few instances are sufficient to show the extraordinarily wide diffusion of Totem-sacraments and Eucharistic rites all over the world.\"<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/pcc/index.htm Edward Carpenter, ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'' (1920), pp. 54\u201368]</ref>\n\n===Pre-Pauline confluence of Greek and Jewish traditions and ''agap\u0113''===\n\nBy the time of the Roman conquest, Jews practiced festive dining in essentially the same form as the Greeks, with a dinner (deipnon) followed by the symposium proper, where guests drank wine and enjoyed entertainment or conversation. There were, to be sure, cultic differences, such as a [[berakhah]] over the wine cup instead of the Greeks' libation to Dionysus. But eating together was a central activity for Jewish religious groups such as Pharisees and Essenes.\n\n\"Thanksgiving\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\" [eucharistia]) is probably to be regarded as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew \"\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4\" [berakhah, berakah], the Jewish \"blessing\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\" [eulogia]) \"addressed to God at meals for and over the food and drink.  It is in this sense that the term was originally used in connection with the common meal of the early Christian community, at which the 'blessing' or 'thanksgiving' had special reference to Jesus Christ.\"<ref>Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [1944 (13th) edition], Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref>\n\nOne formulation had it that \"(t)he eucharistia was the berakhah without the chaburah supper, and the agape is the chaburah meal without the berakhah.<ref>Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 99</ref>\n\n;[[Agape feast]]\nThe Eucharistic celebrations of the early Christians were embedded in, or simply took the form of, a meal. These were often called [[agape feast]]s, although terminology varied in the first few centuries along with other aspects of practice. ''[[Agape]]'' is one of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''love,'' and so \"agape feasts\" are also referred to in English as \"love-feasts\".\n\nThis Hellenic ritual was apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing a contribution to the meal according to their means. Perhaps predictably enough, it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking, or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community of the type criticised by Paul in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:20\u201322}}.\n<!-- The [[Councils of Carthage|Third Council of Carthage]] (393) and the [[Council of Orl\u00e9ans|Second Council of Orleans]] (541)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EeoAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22&hl=en&ei=MuvlTaSJHY-6hAeK7aHbCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q=%22second%20council%20of%20orleans%22&f=false The Gospel Advocate, volume 3 (1823),] Richard Lee Cole, ''Love-feasts: A History of the Christian Agape'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBdnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&hl=en&ei=gt_lTYitJMS5hAfCw-TLCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ The Antiquaries Journal (Oxford University Press 1975)] and several other books mention a prohibition of the Agape by the Second Council of Orleans in AD 541.

In the 18th century, ''[[Pietism|Pietist]]'' Christians began to hold [[Agape feast|''Love Feasts'']] that looked back to the ancient ''Agape''. Many Christians today after celebrating the Eucharist or another liturgy, now routinely participate in an informal sharing of light refreshments and conversation. This post-Eucharistic gathering is often called \"fellowship hour\" or \"coffee hour\" and is regarded by many clergy as a particularly opportune time for engaging adults in Christian education. Others hold ritual Agape meals.<ref>Sample services can be consulted at [http://thebillabong.info/otm_lent/otm07_p19.html An Agape for Easter] and [http://thebillabong.info/otm_pcost/otm47_p22.html A Pentecost Agape]</ref> -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Paintings of the Last Supper}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=xhUY2AslyF4C Enrico Mazza: \"The Eucharist in the First Four Centuries\", in Anscar J.
