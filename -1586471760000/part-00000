Grid squares are 1km.]]\n\n'''Wroughton''' is a large village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in northeast [[Wiltshire]], England. It is part of the [[Borough of Swindon]] and lies along the [[A4361 road]] between [[Swindon]] and [[Avebury]]; the road into Swindon crosses the [[M4 motorway]] between junctions 15 and 16. The village is about {{convert|2.2|mi|km|1}} south of Swindon town centre on the edge of the [[Marlborough Downs]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The town of [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] is about {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} to the south via the [[B roads in Zone 4 of the Great Britain numbering scheme#4 digits (40xx)|B4005]] at [[Chiseldon]] and the [[A346 road]]. The [[World Heritage Site]] at Avebury is about {{convert|7|mi|km|1}} to the south.\n\nThe parish includes '''North Wroughton''', formerly a small settlement on the road towards Swindon but now part of the built-up area; and the hamlets of '''Elcombe''' and '''Overtown'''.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest evidence of human presence in the area is from the [[Mesolithic]] period, although this is fairly limited.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/community/neighbourhood/wroughton/guide/ | title=Guide to Wroughton | newspaper=[[Swindon Advertiser]]}}</ref> More significant evidence of settlement and occupation in the area is available for the [[Neolithic]] period, most notably due to the extensive ritual complex at Avebury and scattered finds in the locality. The earliest archaeological evidence from within Wroughton dates from the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman period]] (AD 43\u2013410), showing a period of intensive settlement and farming in the area. Occupation of the area continued into the [[early Middle Ages]] (AD 410\u20131066) when two battles are understood to have taken place in the area: Breahburh (AD 567), thought to have been fought by [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] on the slopes of [[Barbury Castle|Barbury Hill]], and [[Ellandun]] (AD 825) at Elcombe Hall by [[Egbert of Wessex]]. However, there is no agreement that the latter was here (it is known to have been south of Swindon). Burial sites in the vicinity are believed to be associated with these battles.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/archaeology/arch-Experimental.pdf | title=Experimental archaeology | work=School of Human & Environmental Sciences | publisher=[[University of Reading]] | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century it was just a country village. Wroughton is close to [[The Ridgeway]], a national path which is connected to the ancient [[Uffington White Horse]]. In the 20th century the village grew but largely avoided the effects of suburbanisation while its larger neighbour Swindon expanded rapidly to the immediate north. The construction of the M4 motorway prevented Swindon from enveloping Wroughton, which has retained a village identity, albeit with the population of a small market town (approximately 8,000 residents) in the early 21st century.\n\nIn 1874, the village celebrated for two days after the horse ''[[George Frederick (horse)|George Frederick]]'' which was stabled in the High Street, won [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/archive/2003/11/24/7295606.Fledgling_flats_with_a_pedigree/ | title=Fledgling flats with a pedigree | newspaper=[[Gazette and Herald]] | date=24 November 2003 | author=Shirley Mathias}}</ref> The horse and its trainer, Tom Leader, who was born in Wroughton, were escorted from [[Swindon railway station]] by a brass band and received in the village which had declared all of its pubs to be open houses and provided free beer for the occasion.<ref name=retro>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JugAAAAMAAJ&q=%22George+Frederick%22 | title=A Swindon Retrospect 1855\u20131930 | author=Frederick Large | publisher=S.R.

The event was held at the rear of the Three Tuns [[public house|pub]] with other local fairs and a [[grandstand]] was built in the field. The main event was the \"Champion Gip Fight\", a bare-knuckle boxing competition between a [[Romnichal|Gypsy]] champion and a challenger.<ref name=retro/>\n\nFrederick Large, in his book ''A Swindon Retrospect 1855\u20131930'' comments: \n''\"At Wroughton Feast, an annual festival lasting a week, it was the custom for many years for \"the champion gip\" to fight the best man who could be produced, for a purse of gold. The venue was the paddock at the back of the Three Tuns tavern, where the usual paraphernalia of fairs used to congregate in full force. The Feast always took place in the summer at a time which included a week of our school holidays. I was not more than seven or eight years of age when, without my parents' consent, I wandered over to Wroughton&nbsp;... This annual event always commenced on a Sunday evening by friends and neighbours from Swindon, Wroughton and neighbouring villages congregating at the Three Tuns, where, crowded inside and out, large quantities of beer and spirits were consumed. A miniature grand stand was erected for Feast Week in an orchard adjoining the paddock, upon which many of the elite of the neighbourhood, both ladies and gentlemen, occupied seats, and indulged freely in choice fruits and refreshments.\"''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.localhistory.co.uk/ambra/txtwi/wi0005.htm | title=A Swindon Retrospect 1855\u20131930 (extract) | website=Ambra Books | year=1931 | author=Frederick Large}}</ref>\n\n==Buildings and amenities==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Schools===\n[[The Ridgeway School and Sixth Form College]] opened in 1967 as Wiltshire's first purpose-built comprehensive school.

Grid squares are 1km.]]\n\n'''Wroughton''' is a large village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in northeast [[Wiltshire]], England. It is part of the [[Borough of Swindon]] and lies along the [[A4361 road]] between [[Swindon]] and [[Avebury]]; the road into Swindon crosses the [[M4 motorway]] between junctions 15 and 16. The village is about {{convert|2.2|mi|km|1}} south of Swindon town centre on the edge of the [[Marlborough Downs]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The town of [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] is about {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} to the south via the [[B roads in Zone 4 of the Great Britain numbering scheme#4 digits (40xx)|B4005]] at [[Chiseldon]] and the [[A346 road]]. The [[World Heritage Site]] at Avebury is about {{convert|7|mi|km|1}} to the south.\n\nThe parish includes '''North Wroughton''', formerly a small settlement on the road towards Swindon but now part of the built-up area; and the hamlets of '''Elcombe''' and '''Overtown'''.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest evidence of human presence in the area is from the [[Mesolithic]] period, although this is fairly limited.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/community/neighbourhood/wroughton/guide/ | title=Guide to Wroughton | newspaper=[[Swindon Advertiser]]}}</ref> More significant evidence of settlement and occupation in the area is available for the [[Neolithic]] period, most notably due to the extensive ritual complex at Avebury and scattered finds in the locality. The earliest archaeological evidence from within Wroughton dates from the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman period]] (AD 43\u2013410), showing a period of intensive settlement and farming in the area. Occupation of the area continued into the [[early Middle Ages]] (AD 410\u20131066) when two battles are understood to have taken place in the area: Breahburh (AD 567), thought to have been fought by [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] on the slopes of [[Barbury Castle|Barbury Hill]], and [[Ellandun]] (AD 825) at Elcombe Hall by [[Egbert of Wessex]]. However, there is no agreement that the latter was here (it is known to have been south of Swindon). Burial sites in the vicinity are believed to be associated with these battles.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/archaeology/arch-Experimental.pdf | title=Experimental archaeology | work=School of Human & Environmental Sciences | publisher=[[University of Reading]] | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century it was just a country village. Wroughton is close to [[The Ridgeway]], a national path which is connected to the ancient [[Uffington White Horse]]. In the 20th century the village grew but largely avoided the effects of suburbanisation while its larger neighbour Swindon expanded rapidly to the immediate north. The construction of the M4 motorway prevented Swindon from enveloping Wroughton, which has retained a village identity, albeit with the population of a small market town (approximately 8,000 residents) in the early 21st century.\n\nIn 1874, the village celebrated for two days after the horse ''[[George Frederick (horse)|George Frederick]]'' which was stabled in the High Street, won [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/archive/2003/11/24/7295606.Fledgling_flats_with_a_pedigree/ | title=Fledgling flats with a pedigree | newspaper=[[Gazette and Herald]] | date=24 November 2003 | author=Shirley Mathias}}</ref> The horse and its trainer, Tom Leader, who was born in Wroughton, were escorted from [[Swindon railway station]] by a brass band and received in the village which had declared all of its pubs to be open houses and provided free beer for the occasion.<ref name=retro>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JugAAAAMAAJ&q=%22George+Frederick%22 | title=A Swindon Retrospect 1855\u20131930 | author=Frederick Large | publisher=S.R.

Events included \"A Programme of Horse, Pony, Donkey and Foot racing; climbing the [[greasy pole]]&nbsp;...\" the prize being a leg of [[Lamb (food)|mutton]] at the end. The event was held at the rear of the Three Tuns [[public house|pub]] with other local fairs and a [[grandstand]] was built in the field. The main event was the \"Champion Gip Fight\", a bare-knuckle boxing competition between a [[Romnichal|Gypsy]] champion and a challenger.<ref name=retro/>\n\nFrederick Large, in his book ''A Swindon Retrospect 1855\u20131930'' comments: \n''\"At Wroughton Feast, an annual festival lasting a week, it was the custom for many years for \"the champion gip\" to fight the best man who could be produced, for a purse of gold. The venue was the paddock at the back of the Three Tuns tavern, where the usual paraphernalia of fairs used to congregate in full force. The Feast always took place in the summer at a time which included a week of our school holidays. I was not more than seven or eight years of age when, without my parents' consent, I wandered over to Wroughton&nbsp;... This annual event always commenced on a Sunday evening by friends and neighbours from Swindon, Wroughton and neighbouring villages congregating at the Three Tuns, where, crowded inside and out, large quantities of beer and spirits were consumed. A miniature grand stand was erected for Feast Week in an orchard adjoining the paddock, upon which many of the elite of the neighbourhood, both ladies and gentlemen, occupied seats, and indulged freely in choice fruits and refreshments.\"''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.localhistory.co.uk/ambra/txtwi/wi0005.htm | title=A Swindon Retrospect 1855\u20131930 (extract) | website=Ambra Books | year=1931 | author=Frederick Large}}</ref>\n\n==Buildings and amenities==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Schools===\n[[The Ridgeway School and Sixth Form College]] opened in 1967 as Wiltshire's first purpose-built comprehensive school.

He was, though, at least equally strongly influenced  by his study of the works of other contemporary artists such as [[Sebastiano Ricci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] and those of his Venetian predecessors, especially [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}} A biography of his teacher, published in 1732, says that Tiepolo \"departed from [Lazzarini's] studied manner of painting, and, all spirit and fire, embraced a quick and resolute style\".{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}} His earliest known works are depictions of the apostles, painted in spandrels as part of the decoration of the church of the Ospedoletto in Venice in 1715\u20136.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37\u20138}} At about the same time he became painter to the Doge, Giovanni II Cornaro, and oversaw the hanging of pictures at his palace, as well as painting many works himself, of which only two portraits have been identified.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=57}}  He painted his first fresco in 1716,  on the ceiling of a church at [[Biadene]], near [[Treviso]].{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=39}}   He probably left Lazzarini's studio in 1717, the year he  was received into the [[Fraglia]] or guild of painters.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}}\n\nIn around 1719\u201320 he painted a scheme of frescoes for the wealthy, and recently ennobled, publisher Giambattista Baglione in the hall of  his villa at [[Massanzago]] near Padua. Tiepolo depicted the ''Triumph of Aurora'' on the ceiling, and the ''Myth of Phaethon'' on the walls, creating the kind of fluid spatial illusion which was to become a recurring theme in his work.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=40\u20131}}\n\nIn 1722 he was one of twelve artists commissioned  to contribute a painting   on canvas  of one of the apostles as part of a decorative scheme for the nave of [[San Stae]] in Venice. The other artists involved included Ricci, Piazetta, and Pellegrini.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=41}}\n\n===Marriage and children===\n\nIn 1719, Tiepolo married noblewoman Maria Cecilia Guardi, sister of two contemporary Venetian painters [[Francesco Guardi|Francesco]] and [[Giovanni Antonio Guardi]]. Together, Tiepolo and his wife had nine children. Four daughters and three sons survived childhood. Two of his sons, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo|Domenico]] and [[Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo|Lorenzo]], painted with him as his assistants and later achieved some independent recognition, in particular [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]]. His children painted figures with a design similar to that of their father, but with distinctive, including genre, styles. His third son became a priest. [[Fabio Canal]], [[Francesco Lorenzi]], [[Domenico Pasquini]] were among his pupils.\n\n===Early mature work (1726\u20131750)===\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| |''Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida'', 1742 until 1745]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Juno and Luna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''Juno and Luna'',  between 1735 and 1745]]\n[[File:Tiepolo - Perseus and Andromeda, ca. 1730\u201331.jpg|thumbnail|''Perseus and Andromeda'', between 1730 and 1731]]\nSome major commissions came from the patrician  Dolfin family. Dioniso Dolfin, the Archbishop of [[Udine]] in [[Friuli]] employed him to decorate a chapel in the cathedral at Udine, and then to paint another cycle depicting episodes from the lives of Abraham and his descendants from the book of Genesis at his archiepiscopal palace (the \"Arcivescovado\"){{sfn|Levey|1980|p=193}}\n(completed 1726\u20131728). Despite their elevated subject matter, they are bright in colour, and light-hearted in mood: Michael Levey describes the paintings at the palace  as \"a shimmering set of tableaux, full of wit and elegance. {{sfn|Levey|1980|p=198\u20139}} Tiepolo used a much [[colour temperature|cooler]]  palette than previous Venetian painters, in order to create a convincing effect of daylight.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=490}}  His first masterpieces in Venice were a cycle of ten enormous canvases painted to decorate a large reception room of [[Ca' Dolfin]] on the Grand Canal of Venice (ca. 1726\u20131729), depicting  battles and triumphs from the history of ancient Rome.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=41}}\n\n[[Ca' Dolfin Tiepolos|These early masterpieces]], innovative amongst Venetian frescoes for their luminosity, brought him many commissions. He painted canvases for churches such as that of [[Verolanuova]] (1735\u20131740), for the Scuola dei [[Carmini]] (1740\u20131747), and the [[Scalzi (Venice)|Chiesa degli Scalzi]] (1743\u20131744; now destroyed) in [[Cannaregio]], a ceiling for the Palazzi Archinto and Casati-Dugnani in Milan (1731), the [[Colleoni Chapel]] in [[Bergamo]] (1732\u20131733), a ceiling for the [[Gesuati]] (Santa Maria del Rosario) in Venice of ''St. Dominic Instituting the Rosary'' (1737\u20131739), Palazzo Clerici, Milan (1740), decorations for Villa Cordellini at [[Montecchio Maggiore]] (1743\u20131744) and for the ballroom of the [[Palazzo Labia]] in Venice (now a television studio), showing the ''Story of [[Cleopatra]]'' (1745\u20131750).\n\n===Etchings===\nTiepolo produced two sets of etchings, the ''Capricci'' (c. 1740\u20131742) and the ''Scherzi di  fantasia'' (c. 1743\u20131757). The ten ''[[Capriccio (painting)|capricci]]'' were first published by [[Anton Maria Zanetti]], incorporated into the third edition of  a  compilation  of woodcuts after Parmigiano. They were not published separately until 1785. The subject matter is often bizarre and fantastical, and the works owe a lot to the example of [[Salvator Rosa]] and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].{{sfn|Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770|1996|pp=349\u2013 50}} The 23 Scherzi were etched over more than ten years and privately circulated, only being commercially published after Tiepolo's death, with numbers and titles added by his son, Giandomenico. Subjects include  mysterious Eastern figures, and, in  some of the later prints, scenes of [[necromancy]].{{sfn|Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770|1996|pp=358\u2013 9}}\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 034.jpg|thumb|''Apotheosis of Spain'' (1762-1766) in [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Wealth and Benefits of the Spanish Monarchy under Charles III, 1762, NGA 12137.jpg|thumb|''Wealth and Benefits of the Spanish Monarchy under Charles III'', 1762, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n\n===W\u00fcrzburg Residenz (1750\u20131753)===\n\nBy 1750, Tiepolo's reputation was firmly established throughout Europe, with the help of his friend [[Francesco Algarotti]], an art dealer, critic and collector. That year, at the behest of Prince Bishop Karl Philip von Greiffenklau, he traveled to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] where he arrived in November 1750. He remained there for three years during which he executed ceiling paintings in the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence|New Residenz]] palace (completed 1744). He frescoed the Kaisersaal salon in collaboration with his sons Giandomenico and Lorenzo and was then invited to deliver a design for the grandiose entrance staircase (''Treppenhaus'') designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]]. It is a massive ceiling [[fresco]] at {{gaps|7|287 square feet}} {{nowrap|(677 m<sup>2</sup>)}}, and was completed in November 1753.{{sfn|Levey|1980|pp=225\u2013230}} His ''Allegory of the Planets and Continents'' depicts Apollo embarking on his daily course; deities around him symbolize the planets; allegorical figures (on the cornice) represent the four continents. He included several portraits in the Europe section of this fresco, including a self-portrait; one of his son Giandomenico; one of the prince-bishop von Greiffenklau; one of the painter Antonio Bossi; and one of the architect, [[Balthasar Neumann]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/treppe05.htm |title=Residenz staircase |publisher=Wurzburg Residenz |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629135139/http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/treppe05.htm |archivedate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Return to Venice and the Veneto (1753\u20131770)===\n[[File:The Immaculate Conception, by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|[[The Immaculate Conception (Tiepolo)|''The Immaculate Conception'']], painted between 1767 and 1768]]\nTiepolo returned to Venice in 1753. He  was now in demand locally, as well as abroad where he was elected President of the Academy of [[Padua]]. He went on to complete theatrical frescoes for churches; the ''Triumph of Faith'' for the [[Chiesa della Piet\u00e0, Venice|Chiesa della Piet\u00e0]]; panel frescos for [[Ca' Rezzonico]] (which now also houses his ceiling fresco from the [[Palazzo Barbarigo]]); and paintings for patrician villas in the Venetian countryside, such as [[Villa Valmarana \"Ai Nani\"|Villa Valmarana]] in [[Vicenza]] and an elaborate panegyric ceiling for the [[Villa Pisani]] in [[Stra]].\n\nIn some  celebrated frescoes at the [[Palazzo Labia]], he depicted two scenes from the life of Cleopatra: ''Meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra''[http://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/4labia/1meetin.html] and ''Banquet of Cleopatra'',[http://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/4labia/2banquze.html] as well as, in a central ceiling fresco, the ''Triumph of Bellerophon over Time''. Here he  collaborated with  [[Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna]]. This connection with Colonna, who also designed sets for opera, highlights the increasing tendency towards composition as a staged fiction in Tiepolo's frescoes. The architecture of the ''Banquet'' fresco  also recalls that of  Veronese's ''Wedding at Cana''. In 1757, he painted an altar piece for the Thiene family, representing the apotheosis of [[Saint Cajetan]]. It is in the church of hamlet of Rampazzo in the [[Camisano Vicentino]].\n\n===Madrid===\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Apollo Pursuing Daphne, 1755-1760.jpg|thumbnail|''Apollo Pursuing Daphne'', 1755\u20131760]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Los hebreos recogiendo el man\u00e1 en el desierto (boceto) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| ''[[Manna]] in the desert'']]\nIn 1761, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] commissioned Tiepolo to create a ceiling fresco to decorate the throne room of the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. The [[panegyric]] theme is the ''Apotheosis of Spain'' and has allegorical depictions recalling the dominance of Spain in the Americas and across the globe.\n\nHe also painted two other ceilings in the palace, and carried out many private commissions in Spain.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=486}}However he suffered from  the jealousy and the bitter opposition of the rising champion of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]; at the instigation of Mengs' supporter, the King's confessor [[Joaquim de Electa]], had Tiepolo's series of canvases for the church of S. Pascual at [[Aranjuez]] replaced by works by his favourite.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=486}}\n\nTiepolo died in Madrid on March 27, 1770.\n\nAfter his death, the rise of a stern Neoclassicism and the post-revolutionary decline of absolutism led to the slow decline of the Rococo style associated with his name, but failed to dent his reputation. In 1772, Tiepolo's son was sufficiently respected to be  painter to Doge [[Giovanni II Cornaro]], in charge of the decoration of [[Palazzo Mocenigo]] in the ''sestiere'' of [[San Polo]], [[Venice]].\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Paintings before 1740===\n{|  class=wikitable\n!  width=\"40%\" | Work\n!  width=\"10%\" | Date\n!  width=\"40%\" | Location\n!  width=\"10%\" | Link\n|-

He was prolific, and worked not only in Italy, but also in Germany and Spain.\n\nGiovan Battista Tiepolo, together with [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Canaletto]], [[Giovan Battista Piazzetta]], [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] and [[Francesco Guardi]] are considered the traditional [[Old Masters]] of that period.\n\nSuccessful from the beginning of his career, he has been described by [[Michael Levey]] as \"the greatest decorative painter of eighteenth-century Europe, as well as its most able craftsman.\"{{sfn|Levey|1980|p=193}}\n\n==Biography==\n[[file:Accademia - Giambattista Tiepolo, San Domenico in gloria 1723.jpg|thumb|''The Glory of St. Dominic'' 1723]]\n[[Image:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Scipio Africanus Freeing Massiva - Walters 37657.jpg|thumb|''Scipio Africanus Freeing Massiva'' shows Massiva, the nephew of a prince of Numidia, being released after capture by [[Scipio Africanus]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher= |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/19755 |title=Scipio Africanus Freeing Massiva }}</ref> [[Walters Art Museum]].]]\n\n[[File:Giambattista Tiepolo - The Banquet of Cleopatra - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''[[The Banquet of Cleopatra (Tiepolo)|The Banquet of Cleopatra]]'']]\n\n===Early life (1696\u20131726)===\nBorn in Venice, he was the youngest of six children of Domenico and Orsetta Tiepolo.<ref name=OxfordArtOnline-Tiepolo>{{cite encyclopedia | last=Barcham | first=William L | title=Tiepolo |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T084951 | encyclopedia=[[Grove Art Online]] | publisher=[[Oxford Art Online]], Oxford University Press | accessdate=3 May 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref> His father was a small shipping merchant<ref name=treccani>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=[[Treccani]] | title=Ti\u00e8polo, Giambattista | language=Italian| url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giambattista-tiepolo/ | publisher=Treccani | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> who belonged to a family that bore the prestigious [[Jacopo Tiepolo|patrician name of Tiepolo]] without claiming any noble descent. Some of the children acquired noble godparents, and Giambattista was originally named after his godfather, a Venetian nobleman called Giovanni Battista Dori\u00e0. He was baptised on 16 April 1696 in the local church, [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]] (then still officially the cathedral of Venice). His father died about a year later, leaving his mother to bring up a family of young children, presumably in somewhat difficult circumstances.<ref name=OxfordArtOnline-Tiepolo/>\n\nIn  1710 he became a pupil of [[Gregorio Lazzarini]], a successful painter with an eclectic style. He was, though, at least equally strongly influenced  by his study of the works of other contemporary artists such as [[Sebastiano Ricci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] and those of his Venetian predecessors, especially [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}} A biography of his teacher, published in 1732, says that Tiepolo \"departed from [Lazzarini's] studied manner of painting, and, all spirit and fire, embraced a quick and resolute style\".{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}} His earliest known works are depictions of the apostles, painted in spandrels as part of the decoration of the church of the Ospedoletto in Venice in 1715\u20136.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37\u20138}} At about the same time he became painter to the Doge, Giovanni II Cornaro, and oversaw the hanging of pictures at his palace, as well as painting many works himself, of which only two portraits have been identified.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=57}}  He painted his first fresco in 1716,  on the ceiling of a church at [[Biadene]], near [[Treviso]].{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=39}}   He probably left Lazzarini's studio in 1717, the year he  was received into the [[Fraglia]] or guild of painters.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}}\n\nIn around 1719\u201320 he painted a scheme of frescoes for the wealthy, and recently ennobled, publisher Giambattista Baglione in the hall of  his villa at [[Massanzago]] near Padua. Tiepolo depicted the ''Triumph of Aurora'' on the ceiling, and the ''Myth of Phaethon'' on the walls, creating the kind of fluid spatial illusion which was to become a recurring theme in his work.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=40\u20131}}\n\nIn 1722 he was one of twelve artists commissioned  to contribute a painting   on canvas  of one of the apostles as part of a decorative scheme for the nave of [[San Stae]] in Venice. The other artists involved included Ricci, Piazetta, and Pellegrini.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=41}}\n\n===Marriage and children===\n\nIn 1719, Tiepolo married noblewoman Maria Cecilia Guardi, sister of two contemporary Venetian painters [[Francesco Guardi|Francesco]] and [[Giovanni Antonio Guardi]]. Together, Tiepolo and his wife had nine children. Four daughters and three sons survived childhood. Two of his sons, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo|Domenico]] and [[Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo|Lorenzo]], painted with him as his assistants and later achieved some independent recognition, in particular [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]]. His children painted figures with a design similar to that of their father, but with distinctive, including genre, styles. His third son became a priest. [[Fabio Canal]], [[Francesco Lorenzi]], [[Domenico Pasquini]] were among his pupils.\n\n===Early mature work (1726\u20131750)===\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| |''Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida'', 1742 until 1745]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Juno and Luna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''Juno and Luna'',  between 1735 and 1745]]\n[[File:Tiepolo - Perseus and Andromeda, ca. 1730\u201331.jpg|thumbnail|''Perseus and Andromeda'', between 1730 and 1731]]\nSome major commissions came from the patrician  Dolfin family. Dioniso Dolfin, the Archbishop of [[Udine]] in [[Friuli]] employed him to decorate a chapel in the cathedral at Udine, and then to paint another cycle depicting episodes from the lives of Abraham and his descendants from the book of Genesis at his archiepiscopal palace (the \"Arcivescovado\"){{sfn|Levey|1980|p=193}}\n(completed 1726\u20131728). Despite their elevated subject matter, they are bright in colour, and light-hearted in mood: Michael Levey describes the paintings at the palace  as \"a shimmering set of tableaux, full of wit and elegance. {{sfn|Levey|1980|p=198\u20139}} Tiepolo used a much [[colour temperature|cooler]]  palette than previous Venetian painters, in order to create a convincing effect of daylight.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=490}}  His first masterpieces in Venice were a cycle of ten enormous canvases painted to decorate a large reception room of [[Ca' Dolfin]] on the Grand Canal of Venice (ca. 1726\u20131729), depicting  battles and triumphs from the history of ancient Rome.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=41}}\n\n[[Ca' Dolfin Tiepolos|These early masterpieces]], innovative amongst Venetian frescoes for their luminosity, brought him many commissions. He painted canvases for churches such as that of [[Verolanuova]] (1735\u20131740), for the Scuola dei [[Carmini]] (1740\u20131747), and the [[Scalzi (Venice)|Chiesa degli Scalzi]] (1743\u20131744; now destroyed) in [[Cannaregio]], a ceiling for the Palazzi Archinto and Casati-Dugnani in Milan (1731), the [[Colleoni Chapel]] in [[Bergamo]] (1732\u20131733), a ceiling for the [[Gesuati]] (Santa Maria del Rosario) in Venice of ''St. Dominic Instituting the Rosary'' (1737\u20131739), Palazzo Clerici, Milan (1740), decorations for Villa Cordellini at [[Montecchio Maggiore]] (1743\u20131744) and for the ballroom of the [[Palazzo Labia]] in Venice (now a television studio), showing the ''Story of [[Cleopatra]]'' (1745\u20131750).\n\n===Etchings===\nTiepolo produced two sets of etchings, the ''Capricci'' (c. 1740\u20131742) and the ''Scherzi di  fantasia'' (c. 1743\u20131757). The ten ''[[Capriccio (painting)|capricci]]'' were first published by [[Anton Maria Zanetti]], incorporated into the third edition of  a  compilation  of woodcuts after Parmigiano. They were not published separately until 1785. The subject matter is often bizarre and fantastical, and the works owe a lot to the example of [[Salvator Rosa]] and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].{{sfn|Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770|1996|pp=349\u2013 50}} The 23 Scherzi were etched over more than ten years and privately circulated, only being commercially published after Tiepolo's death, with numbers and titles added by his son, Giandomenico. Subjects include  mysterious Eastern figures, and, in  some of the later prints, scenes of [[necromancy]].{{sfn|Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770|1996|pp=358\u2013 9}}\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 034.jpg|thumb|''Apotheosis of Spain'' (1762-1766) in [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Wealth and Benefits of the Spanish Monarchy under Charles III, 1762, NGA 12137.jpg|thumb|''Wealth and Benefits of the Spanish Monarchy under Charles III'', 1762, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n\n===W\u00fcrzburg Residenz (1750\u20131753)===\n\nBy 1750, Tiepolo's reputation was firmly established throughout Europe, with the help of his friend [[Francesco Algarotti]], an art dealer, critic and collector. That year, at the behest of Prince Bishop Karl Philip von Greiffenklau, he traveled to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] where he arrived in November 1750. He remained there for three years during which he executed ceiling paintings in the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence|New Residenz]] palace (completed 1744). He frescoed the Kaisersaal salon in collaboration with his sons Giandomenico and Lorenzo and was then invited to deliver a design for the grandiose entrance staircase (''Treppenhaus'') designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]]. It is a massive ceiling [[fresco]] at {{gaps|7|287 square feet}} {{nowrap|(677 m<sup>2</sup>)}}, and was completed in November 1753.{{sfn|Levey|1980|pp=225\u2013230}} His ''Allegory of the Planets and Continents'' depicts Apollo embarking on his daily course; deities around him symbolize the planets; allegorical figures (on the cornice) represent the four continents. He included several portraits in the Europe section of this fresco, including a self-portrait; one of his son Giandomenico; one of the prince-bishop von Greiffenklau; one of the painter Antonio Bossi; and one of the architect, [[Balthasar Neumann]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/treppe05.htm |title=Residenz staircase |publisher=Wurzburg Residenz |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629135139/http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/treppe05.htm |archivedate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Return to Venice and the Veneto (1753\u20131770)===\n[[File:The Immaculate Conception, by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|[[The Immaculate Conception (Tiepolo)|''The Immaculate Conception'']], painted between 1767 and 1768]]\nTiepolo returned to Venice in 1753. He  was now in demand locally, as well as abroad where he was elected President of the Academy of [[Padua]]. He went on to complete theatrical frescoes for churches; the ''Triumph of Faith'' for the [[Chiesa della Piet\u00e0, Venice|Chiesa della Piet\u00e0]]; panel frescos for [[Ca' Rezzonico]] (which now also houses his ceiling fresco from the [[Palazzo Barbarigo]]); and paintings for patrician villas in the Venetian countryside, such as [[Villa Valmarana \"Ai Nani\"|Villa Valmarana]] in [[Vicenza]] and an elaborate panegyric ceiling for the [[Villa Pisani]] in [[Stra]].\n\nIn some  celebrated frescoes at the [[Palazzo Labia]], he depicted two scenes from the life of Cleopatra: ''Meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra''[http://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/4labia/1meetin.html] and ''Banquet of Cleopatra'',[http://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/4labia/2banquze.html] as well as, in a central ceiling fresco, the ''Triumph of Bellerophon over Time''. Here he  collaborated with  [[Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna]]. This connection with Colonna, who also designed sets for opera, highlights the increasing tendency towards composition as a staged fiction in Tiepolo's frescoes. The architecture of the ''Banquet'' fresco  also recalls that of  Veronese's ''Wedding at Cana''. In 1757, he painted an altar piece for the Thiene family, representing the apotheosis of [[Saint Cajetan]]. It is in the church of hamlet of Rampazzo in the [[Camisano Vicentino]].\n\n===Madrid===\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Apollo Pursuing Daphne, 1755-1760.jpg|thumbnail|''Apollo Pursuing Daphne'', 1755\u20131760]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Los hebreos recogiendo el man\u00e1 en el desierto (boceto) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| ''[[Manna]] in the desert'']]\nIn 1761, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] commissioned Tiepolo to create a ceiling fresco to decorate the throne room of the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. The [[panegyric]] theme is the ''Apotheosis of Spain'' and has allegorical depictions recalling the dominance of Spain in the Americas and across the globe.\n\nHe also painted two other ceilings in the palace, and carried out many private commissions in Spain.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=486}}However he suffered from  the jealousy and the bitter opposition of the rising champion of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]; at the instigation of Mengs' supporter, the King's confessor [[Joaquim de Electa]], had Tiepolo's series of canvases for the church of S. Pascual at [[Aranjuez]] replaced by works by his favourite.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=486}}\n\nTiepolo died in Madrid on March 27, 1770.\n\nAfter his death, the rise of a stern Neoclassicism and the post-revolutionary decline of absolutism led to the slow decline of the Rococo style associated with his name, but failed to dent his reputation. In 1772, Tiepolo's son was sufficiently respected to be  painter to Doge [[Giovanni II Cornaro]], in charge of the decoration of [[Palazzo Mocenigo]] in the ''sestiere'' of [[San Polo]], [[Venice]].\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Paintings before 1740===\n{|  class=wikitable\n!  width=\"40%\" | Work\n!  width=\"10%\" | Date\n!  width=\"40%\" | Location\n!  width=\"10%\" | Link\n|-
