Its secondary function was to generate electrical power from the irrigation releases at the artificial head of the reservoir. The project, though not initially designed as one, also works as a flood control structure by retaining water during the flood-prone season of [[Monsoon]].<ref name=eng/>\n\nOn December 5, 1971, the dam was damaged due to a bombing raid conducted by the [[Indian Air Force]] during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. This was against the international convention that large water reservoirs would not be targeted in war. As a consequence, the hydro project was temporarily out of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/hunter.htm|title=Hunter Aircraft|work=Global Security.org|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mangla Dam|url=http://www.pakistanpaedia.com/mega/mangla_dam.html|work=Pakistanpaedia|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom the data available in 2009, the project had generated 183.551 billion units of low cost Hydel energy since its commissioning.

Each of these turbines has an output of 138,00 [[Horsepower|bhp]] with a rated head of 295 feet of water. The first four turbines were manufactured by [[Mitsubishi Electric]], Japan and were installed in 1969, turbines 5 and 6 are manufactured by [[:cz:\u010cKD Blansko|\u010cKD Blansko]], Czech Republic and were installed in 1974, turbines 7-8 were manufactured by [[Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi|ACEC]], Belgium and were installed in 1981, while the remaining two turbines are a make of [[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]], Czech Republic and were commissioned in 1994.<ref name=up&refur/><ref name=wapda_m/>\n\nThese turbines are connected to umbrella-type generators which have a generation capacity of 100 MW.

At the time, many took up work in the textile and steel mills, due to the acute shortage of workers in England.\n\n==Operation==\nThe project was designed primarily to increase the amount of water that could be used for irrigation from the flow of the Jhelum and its tributaries. Its secondary function was to generate electrical power from the irrigation releases at the artificial head of the reservoir. The project, though not initially designed as one, also works as a flood control structure by retaining water during the flood-prone season of [[Monsoon]].<ref name=eng/>\n\nOn December 5, 1971, the dam was damaged due to a bombing raid conducted by the [[Indian Air Force]] during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. This was against the international convention that large water reservoirs would not be targeted in war. As a consequence, the hydro project was temporarily out of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/hunter.htm|title=Hunter Aircraft|work=Global Security.org|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mangla Dam|url=http://www.pakistanpaedia.com/mega/mangla_dam.html|work=Pakistanpaedia|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom the data available in 2009, the project had generated 183.551 billion units of low cost Hydel energy since its commissioning.

He earned his B.A and M.A from the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem and PhD in Geography from [[Durham University]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gazette, 1982/83 |url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=bookreader/DU_Gazettes/DUGazette1982-3/DUGazette19823METS.xml#page/92/mode/2up |website=Durham University |accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref> After completing his doctorate in 1982, Dr. Falah taught geography for a short period at [[Tel Aviv University]], [[An-Najah University]] and in [[Hebron]].\n\nIn 1987, he established the [[Galilee]] Center for Social Research in [[Nazareth]], a research institute focused on Arab communities living in Israel, and he served as its first Executive Director until relocating to North America in 1991. There he was appointed as [[Fulbright]] Scholar and Visiting Associate Professor of Geography at the University of Northern Iowa.\n\n===Canada===\nIn 1993, Falah migrated to Canada and subsequently became a Canadian citizen. He started a new chapter in his academic career in Toronto, with a grant from the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and was based at the [[University of Toronto]] as Visiting Associate Professor in the Department of Geography and Planning. During that same period, he was also a visiting scholar for five months at the University of Paris, [[Sorbonne]], supported by a French CNRS research grant. His research has included studies of the differential distribution of facilities in Israeli Jewish and Arab areas.\n\nHe joined the University of Toronto Centre for Urban and Community Studies in 1995 as Research Associate, remaining there until 2001. While working on his research in Toronto, Falah also served, 1995-1997, as Lecturer at the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]], a center for studies on the Muslim world. He then returned to the U.S., and accepted a position in the Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Akron in Ohio.\n\n===Detention and release===\nHe was held for over three weeks in an Israeli jail after he was arrested on suspicion of espionage on July 8, 2006, while touring near the Lebanon border. The arrest occurred one week before the [[2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict]]. He was denied access to a lawyer for the first 18 days of his detention.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-07-27T165257Z_01_N27161586_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-MIDEAST-CANADA-ISRAEL-COL.XML&archived=False| title=Canadian arrested in Israel not a spy, says son| date=July 27, 2006| publisher=Reuters Canada| accessdate=2006-07-27}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"accused\">{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/744297.html |title=Geographer Accused of Espionage for Hizbullah Released |date=July 30, 2006 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605054321/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/744297.html |archivedate=June 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn July 30, 2006, the Israeli [[Shin Bet]] security service and the Israeli police released Dr. Falah without filing charges against him.<ref name=\"accused\"/><ref name=\"between\">{{Cite news | last =Gravois | first =John | title =An Arrest on the Border | work =The Chronicle of Higher Education | date =2007-11-23 | url =http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i13/13a00101.htm|url-access=subscription }} (Free version available at [http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/4474 [[Campus Watch]]])</ref>\n\n===Recent activities===\nIn recent years, Ghazi Falah has broadened his interests to include the geography of the media, focusing on the representation of Arabs and Muslims in daily newspapers in the U.S. His professional visits to Arab and Muslim countries include Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon, Syria, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Iran.\n\nAt present, Ghazi Falah is a tenured Full Professor at the [[University of Akron]] and engaged in research on American bilateral relations with the Arab world.

It differs from the UK's intelligence agencies ([[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[GCHQ]] and [[MI5]]) in that it is an integral part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) rather than a stand-alone organisation. The organisation employs a mixture of civilian and military staff and is funded within the UK's defence budget. The organisation was formerly known as the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), but changed its name in 2009.\n\nThe primary role of Defence Intelligence is that of '[[All-source intelligence|all-source]]' [[intelligence analysis]]. This discipline draws information from a variety of overt and covert sources to provide the intelligence needed to support military operations, contingency planning, and to inform defence policy and procurement decisions. The maintenance of the ability to give timely strategic warning of politico-military and scientific and technical developments with the potential to affect UK interests is a vital part of the process. DI's assessments are used outside the MoD to support the work of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC)]] and to assist the work of other Government departments (OGDs) and international partners (such as [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]). It is this 'all-source' function which distinguishes Defence Intelligence from other organisations such as SIS and GCHQ which focus on the collection of 'single-source' Human Intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) and Signals Intelligence ([[SIGINT]]) respectively. As such Defence Intelligence occupies a unique position within the UK intelligence community.\n\n==History==\nDefence Intelligence can trace its history back to 1873 and the formation Intelligence Branch of the British [[War Office]], which later became the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wade|first1=Stephen|title=Spies in the Empire: Victorian Military Intelligence|date=2007|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9780857287014|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-sk68pAvB14C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Intelligence+Branch%22+British+Army#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref> The [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], established in 1902, was responsible for co-ordination between the different armed services of on issues of [[military strategy]] intelligence assessments and estimates.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/national-security-council |title=The National Security Council: national security at the centre of government |journal=The Institute for Government |author=Dr Joe Devanny & Josh Harris |publisher=Institute for Government & King's College London |accessdate=6 November 2014|date=4 November 2014 }}</ref> During [[World War I]], British [[Secret service|secret services]] were divided into numbered sections named ''Military Intelligence'' together with a department number, such as MI1 for the secretariat of the Director of Military Intelligence.

It was not loved by the armed services, where its mingling of services and uniformed and civilian experts was seen as a threat to the traditional forms of service intelligence but it represented a first step in the direction of full integration of defence intelligence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Craddock|first=Percy|title=Know Your Enemy: How the Joint Intelligence Committee Saw the World.|publisher=John Murray Ltd|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=261}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] was formed in 1964, [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence]], [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Military Intelligence]] and [[RAF Intelligence|Air Intelligence]] were combined to form the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS).<ref>Dylan, p. 184</ref> Although the DIS focussed initially on Cold War issues, more recently its attention has moved to support for overseas operations, weapons of mass destruction and international counter-terrorism activities.<ref name=\"DIS\">{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/defence-intelligence-services |title=Defence Intelligence: Roles |work=Ministry of Defence |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> Like the rest of the MOD, Defence Intelligence was subject to the 2008 'Streamlining' initiative in which 20\u201325 percent of Central London staff were cut and it has had to continue to find additional savings since.

Examples of the support DI has provided to operations are:<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n* Coalition action in Iraq\n* NATO led forces in Afghanistan and Bosnia\n* UN humanitarian and peace-support operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cyprus, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo\nDI has deployed intelligence analysts, linguists and reservists overseas, and provide geographic support by supplying both standard and specialised mapping to overseas theatres.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Support to contingency planning for operations''': DI provides intelligence data and all source assessments that assist in preparations for future situations with the potential to require the commitment of UK Armed Forces. These products, which cover political and military developments, country and cultural information, critical infrastructure and internal security, all aid contingency planning.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of early warning''': A fundamental responsibility of Defence Intelligence is to alert ministers, chiefs of staff, senior officials and defence planners to impending crises around the world. Such warning is vital for short and medium term planning. DI meets this responsibility by focusing on current areas and topics of concern, highlighting the effects of changing circumstances, predicting security and stability trends, and assessing how these trends may develop. The assessments are distributed to decision-makers throughout the MOD, the Armed Forces, other government departments, allies, and UK Embassies and High Commissions.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of longer-term analysis of emerging threats''': Defence Intelligence provides longer-term assessments of likely scenarios around the world where UK Armed Forces might need to operate and of the equipment that they might face. It also provides technical support to the development of future military equipment and to the development of countermeasures against potentially hostile systems.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n==How Defence Intelligence carries out its work==\n'''Direction''': The Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) receives direction from the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) on MOD's Intelligence needs and draws national guidance from the Cabinet Office Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).\n\n'''Analysis and production''': Intelligence assessments are written to meet the needs of customers and must be timely and relevant. The assessment process involves judging the authenticity and reliability of new information and its relevance to existing intelligence.

It differs from the UK's intelligence agencies ([[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[GCHQ]] and [[MI5]]) in that it is an integral part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) rather than a stand-alone organisation. The organisation employs a mixture of civilian and military staff and is funded within the UK's defence budget. The organisation was formerly known as the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), but changed its name in 2009.\n\nThe primary role of Defence Intelligence is that of '[[All-source intelligence|all-source]]' [[intelligence analysis]]. This discipline draws information from a variety of overt and covert sources to provide the intelligence needed to support military operations, contingency planning, and to inform defence policy and procurement decisions. The maintenance of the ability to give timely strategic warning of politico-military and scientific and technical developments with the potential to affect UK interests is a vital part of the process. DI's assessments are used outside the MoD to support the work of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC)]] and to assist the work of other Government departments (OGDs) and international partners (such as [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]). It is this 'all-source' function which distinguishes Defence Intelligence from other organisations such as SIS and GCHQ which focus on the collection of 'single-source' Human Intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) and Signals Intelligence ([[SIGINT]]) respectively. As such Defence Intelligence occupies a unique position within the UK intelligence community.\n\n==History==\nDefence Intelligence can trace its history back to 1873 and the formation Intelligence Branch of the British [[War Office]], which later became the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wade|first1=Stephen|title=Spies in the Empire: Victorian Military Intelligence|date=2007|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9780857287014|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-sk68pAvB14C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Intelligence+Branch%22+British+Army#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref> The [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], established in 1902, was responsible for co-ordination between the different armed services of on issues of [[military strategy]] intelligence assessments and estimates.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/national-security-council |title=The National Security Council: national security at the centre of government |journal=The Institute for Government |author=Dr Joe Devanny & Josh Harris |publisher=Institute for Government & King's College London |accessdate=6 November 2014|date=4 November 2014 }}</ref> During [[World War I]], British [[Secret service|secret services]] were divided into numbered sections named ''Military Intelligence'' together with a department number, such as MI1 for the secretariat of the Director of Military Intelligence.

It was not loved by the armed services, where its mingling of services and uniformed and civilian experts was seen as a threat to the traditional forms of service intelligence but it represented a first step in the direction of full integration of defence intelligence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Craddock|first=Percy|title=Know Your Enemy: How the Joint Intelligence Committee Saw the World.|publisher=John Murray Ltd|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=261}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] was formed in 1964, [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence]], [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Military Intelligence]] and [[RAF Intelligence|Air Intelligence]] were combined to form the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS).<ref>Dylan, p. 184</ref> Although the DIS focussed initially on Cold War issues, more recently its attention has moved to support for overseas operations, weapons of mass destruction and international counter-terrorism activities.<ref name=\"DIS\">{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/defence-intelligence-services |title=Defence Intelligence: Roles |work=Ministry of Defence |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> Like the rest of the MOD, Defence Intelligence was subject to the 2008 'Streamlining' initiative in which 20\u201325 percent of Central London staff were cut and it has had to continue to find additional savings since. It changed its name to Defence Intelligence (DI) in 2009.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n==Organisation==\nDefence Intelligence is headed by the Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) who is a serving [[three-star rank|three-star military officer]] and who, as the MOD's 'intelligence process owner', is also responsible for the overall co-ordination of intelligence activities throughout the Armed Forces and single Service Commands.

Examples of the support DI has provided to operations are:<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n* Coalition action in Iraq\n* NATO led forces in Afghanistan and Bosnia\n* UN humanitarian and peace-support operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cyprus, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo\nDI has deployed intelligence analysts, linguists and reservists overseas, and provide geographic support by supplying both standard and specialised mapping to overseas theatres.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Support to contingency planning for operations''': DI provides intelligence data and all source assessments that assist in preparations for future situations with the potential to require the commitment of UK Armed Forces. These products, which cover political and military developments, country and cultural information, critical infrastructure and internal security, all aid contingency planning.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of early warning''': A fundamental responsibility of Defence Intelligence is to alert ministers, chiefs of staff, senior officials and defence planners to impending crises around the world. Such warning is vital for short and medium term planning. DI meets this responsibility by focusing on current areas and topics of concern, highlighting the effects of changing circumstances, predicting security and stability trends, and assessing how these trends may develop. The assessments are distributed to decision-makers throughout the MOD, the Armed Forces, other government departments, allies, and UK Embassies and High Commissions.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of longer-term analysis of emerging threats''': Defence Intelligence provides longer-term assessments of likely scenarios around the world where UK Armed Forces might need to operate and of the equipment that they might face. It also provides technical support to the development of future military equipment and to the development of countermeasures against potentially hostile systems.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n==How Defence Intelligence carries out its work==\n'''Direction''': The Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) receives direction from the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) on MOD's Intelligence needs and draws national guidance from the Cabinet Office Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).\n\n'''Analysis and production''': Intelligence assessments are written to meet the needs of customers and must be timely and relevant. The assessment process involves judging the authenticity and reliability of new information and its relevance to existing intelligence. Assessments focus on probable and possible outcomes, to provide the best available advice for developing a response or resolution. They are continually adjusted in light of new intelligence or events.\n\n==Chiefs of Defence Intelligence==\nThe Chiefs have been as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |title=Ministry of Defence Senior Posts |accessdate=7 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033054/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2015 }}</ref><br>\n'''Director-General Intelligence'''\n* Major-General Sir [[Kenneth Strong]], 1964\u20131966\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Alfred Earle]], rtd 1966\u20131968\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Harold Maguire]], rtd 1968\u20131972\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Louis Le Bailly]] rtd 1972\u20131975\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[David Willison]], rtd 1975\u20131978\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[John Aiken (RAF officer)|John Aiken]], rtd 1978\u20131981\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Roy Halliday]], rtd 1981\u20131984\n\n'''Chiefs of Defence Intelligence'''\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Michael Armitage (RAF officer)|Michael Armitage]] 1984\u20131986\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Derek Boorman]] 1986\u20131988\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[John Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|John Kerr]] 1988\u20131991\n* Air Marshal Sir [[John Walker (RAF officer)|John Walker]], 1991\u20131994\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[John Foley (British Army general)|John Foley]], 1994\u20131997\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan West, Baron West of Spithead|Sir Alan West]], 1997\u20132000\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Joe French]], 2000\u20132003\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Andrew Ridgway]], 2003\u20132006\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Stuart Peach]] 2006\u20132009\n* Air Marshal [[Chris Nickols|Christopher Nickols]] 2009\u20132012\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan Richards]] 2012\u20132015\n* Air Marshal [[Philip Osborn]] 2015\u20132018\n* Lieutenant-General [[James Hockenhull]] 2018\u2013present\n\n==See also==\n* [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] \u2013 United States counterpart\n* [[JARIC]]\n* [[List of intelligence agencies]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]\n* [[Operation Rockingham]]\n* [[RAF Intelligence]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Dylan|first=Huw |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sSTSBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=twopage&q&f=false|title=Defence Intelligence and the Cold War: Britain's Joint Intelligence Bureau 1945\u20131964|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0199657025}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/defence-intelligence#defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence Staff] (last updated 2012)\n* [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/nim/0114301808.pdf/ National Intelligence Machinery]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence-services#defence-geospatial-intelligence-fusion-centre/ Defence Intelligence] (last updated 2012; withdrawn 2014)\n\n{{Military intelligence agencies}}\n{{UK_Intelligence_Agencies}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:British intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Huntingdonshire]]\n[[Category:Military communications of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Military intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1964]]\n[[Category:Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Cambridgeshire]]\n", "name_user": "Kenstrong", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated logo with new Strategic Command livery", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Intelligence"}

On lap nine, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Maldonado incurred a five-second stop-and-go penalty for his contact with Ericsson on lap three and had to serve it at his first pit stop.<ref name=\"STRace\" />\n\nButton ran wide on lap 12 and held off Vettel, who was called by Red Bull into the pit lane for the first of three pit stops at the end of the lap.<ref name=\"STRace\" /> He had the hard compound tyres installed onto his car and emerged in 21st, behind Chilton and ahead of Ericsson with less congestion.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /><ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> Ricciardo entered the pit lane for the medium compound tyres at the conclusion of lap 14 in an attempt to pass Bottas and remain on a two-stop strategy. Williams elected not to bring Bottas into the pit lane in response and he remained on track to keep a consistent pace without sustaining rear tyre degradation.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> On the 16th lap, Kobayashi blocked an attempted pass from Vettel before turn nine for 19th. Vettel tried again at the following corner and was successful this time round.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> After Massa had made his pit stop the lap before, Alonso asked Ferrari to bring him into the pit lane as his rear tyres were worn after the battle with his teammate R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. The team refused until lap 16 since there were no significant gaps in traffic. That meant R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen entered the pit lane a lap later than Alonso and remained narrowly in front of him \u2013 partly because Alonso was baulked by Sutil.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" />\n\n[[File:Daniel Ricciardo (14191204502).jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Ricciardo]] finished in third to take the first podium of his career.]]\n\nRosberg lowered the deficit to Hamilton to 1.6 seconds by the time of his teammate's first pit stop at the end of lap 18 for the medium compound tyres and a minor front wing angle adjustment.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> Ricciardo drew to within 12 seconds of Bottas, and when the latter made his first stop two laps later, Ricciardo moved past Bottas, who rejoined the track narrowly ahead of Grosjean.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /> Rosberg was confused when his engineer Tony Ross called him into the pit lane at the end of lap 21 for the hard compound tyres because he believed he would have a new set of the medium compound tyres. He rejoined almost four seconds behind his teammate Hamilton, who was told over the radio to increase the gap over the next 20 laps.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> On lap 24, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen attempted to pass Grosjean on the right into the first corner for fifth but he ran deep and Grosjean kept the place.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> He tried again approaching the same turn on the next lap and got ahead as Grosjean had a partial [[Motor\u2013generator|motor\u2013generator unit kinetic]] failure.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> On lap 25, Vergne retired in the pit lane with a broken exhaust. During the same lap, Grosjean locked his tyres into turn ten and allowed Alonso to challenge him. Alonso used DRS to pass Grosjean on the inside for sixth before turn one on lap 26.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" />\n\nAt the front, Hamilton struggled with first over- then understeer on his car. Massa made his second pit stop for the hard compound tyres on lap 28, meaning Vettel's aerodynamics could not be affected by other's cars negatively.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> Vettel caught Grosjean by lap 32 but entered the pit lane for his second pit stop to switch onto the medium compound tyres because he believed he could not pass the latter on the track.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> He rejoined the race in 14th.<ref name=\"STRace\" /> Two laps later, a front-left brake failure put Kobayashi onto the turn one run-off area but he avoided hitting the wall. He rejoined the circuit and returned to the pit lane to retire from the event.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> Ferrari brought Alonso into the pit lane on the 35th lap in response to Vettel's earlier pit stop. He emerged in tenth, just ahead of Massa.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /><ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> Alonso overtook Magnussen into turn one with DRS for ninth on lap 36 and Vettel passed Massa for eleventh on the next lap. On lap 40, Massa used DRS to pass Magnussen for tenth before the first turn.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /><ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" />\n\n[[File:Lewis Hamilton (14007100330).jpg|left|thumb|[[Lewis Hamilton]] started from pole position and held off his teammate [[Nico Rosberg]] to claim his fourth successive win of the season and the 26th of his career.]]\n\nAt the end of lap 42, Hamilton ignored an instruction from Mercedes to enter the pit lane and asked for further adjustments to his car's front wing to counter a possible oversteer with a new set of tyres. He entered the pit lane on the following lap for the hard compound tyres but the stop was problematic: Hamilton's pit crew had difficulty installing the right-rear wheel and he was stationary for 4.3 seconds. Rosberg led for two laps before his second pit stop for the medium compound tyres on the 45th lap.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> He began drawing closer to his teammate Hamilton, who questioned the decision to bring him into the pit lane before Rosberg. On lap 49, P\u00e9rez passed his teammate H\u00fclkenberg for ninth.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /> Three laps later, Vettel entered the pit lane for his second pit stop. Alonso did the same in response for the medium-compound tyres the lap after. As Alonso exited the pit lane, Vettel overtook him on the outside for sixth into turn one. An oversteer for R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen leaving turn nine slowed him on the back straight and allowed Vettel to pass him in the act of braking at the turn ten hairpin for fifth.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" />\n\nRosberg was less than a second behind his teammate Hamilton by lap 59 and used DRS. However, Hamilton was within a second of Button entering the final corner and used DRS to cancel out Rosberg's pace.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> It was around this point that Hamilton switched to higher-powered engine mode that was forbidden for use by Mercedes to improve his performance and keep Rosberg behind.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/10857150/Monaco-Grand-Prix-2014-Lewis-Hamiltons-feud-with-Nico-Rosberg-began-at-the-Spanish-Grand-Prix.html|title=Monaco Grand Prix 2014: Lewis Hamilton's feud with Nico Rosberg began at the Spanish Grand Prix|last=Johnson|first=Daniel|date=26 May 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=3 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620174226/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/10857150/Monaco-Grand-Prix-2014-Lewis-Hamiltons-feud-with-Nico-Rosberg-began-at-the-Spanish-Grand-Prix.html|archivedate=20 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> As Rosberg returned to DRS range on lap 62, Alonso overtook his teammate R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen between turns three and four for sixth after a short duel.

further five seconds covering Bottas in third and the fourth-placed Ricciardo.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> In the meantime, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen defended from his teammate Alonso. Maldonado and Ericsson made contact. On lap six, Red Bull advised Ricciardo to drop back from Bottas so that he did not put additional stress on his tyres by driving in the aerodynamic turbulence created by the airflow of other cars for a long period of time.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> He used DRS and turned right to attempt a pass on Bottas into turn one on the next lap. Bottas had enough momentum to hold third position.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> Ricciardo told his team over the radio on lap eight that he had decided that their suggestion was correct and he fell back from Bottas. On lap nine, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Maldonado incurred a five-second stop-and-go penalty for his contact with Ericsson on lap three and had to serve it at his first pit stop.<ref name=\"STRace\" />\n\nButton ran wide on lap 12 and held off Vettel, who was called by Red Bull into the pit lane for the first of three pit stops at the end of the lap.<ref name=\"STRace\" /> He had the hard compound tyres installed onto his car and emerged in 21st, behind Chilton and ahead of Ericsson with less congestion.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /><ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> Ricciardo entered the pit lane for the medium compound tyres at the conclusion of lap 14 in an attempt to pass Bottas and remain on a two-stop strategy. Williams elected not to bring Bottas into the pit lane in response and he remained on track to keep a consistent pace without sustaining rear tyre degradation.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> On the 16th lap, Kobayashi blocked an attempted pass from Vettel before turn nine for 19th. Vettel tried again at the following corner and was successful this time round.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> After Massa had made his pit stop the lap before, Alonso asked Ferrari to bring him into the pit lane as his rear tyres were worn after the battle with his teammate R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. The team refused until lap 16 since there were no significant gaps in traffic. That meant R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen entered the pit lane a lap later than Alonso and remained narrowly in front of him \u2013 partly because Alonso was baulked by Sutil.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" />\n\n[[File:Daniel Ricciardo (14191204502).jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Ricciardo]] finished in third to take the first podium of his career.]]\n\nRosberg lowered the deficit to Hamilton to 1.6 seconds by the time of his teammate's first pit stop at the end of lap 18 for the medium compound tyres and a minor front wing angle adjustment.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> Ricciardo drew to within 12 seconds of Bottas, and when the latter made his first stop two laps later, Ricciardo moved past Bottas, who rejoined the track narrowly ahead of Grosjean.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /> Rosberg was confused when his engineer Tony Ross called him into the pit lane at the end of lap 21 for the hard compound tyres because he believed he would have a new set of the medium compound tyres. He rejoined almost four seconds behind his teammate Hamilton, who was told over the radio to increase the gap over the next 20 laps.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> On lap 24, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen attempted to pass Grosjean on the right into the first corner for fifth but he ran deep and Grosjean kept the place.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> He tried again approaching the same turn on the next lap and got ahead as Grosjean had a partial [[Motor\u2013generator|motor\u2013generator unit kinetic]] failure.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> On lap 25, Vergne retired in the pit lane with a broken exhaust. During the same lap, Grosjean locked his tyres into turn ten and allowed Alonso to challenge him. Alonso used DRS to pass Grosjean on the inside for sixth before turn one on lap 26.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" />\n\nAt the front, Hamilton struggled with first over- then understeer on his car. Massa made his second pit stop for the hard compound tyres on lap 28, meaning Vettel's aerodynamics could not be affected by other's cars negatively.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> Vettel caught Grosjean by lap 32 but entered the pit lane for his second pit stop to switch onto the medium compound tyres because he believed he could not pass the latter on the track.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> He rejoined the race in 14th.<ref name=\"STRace\" /> Two laps later, a front-left brake failure put Kobayashi onto the turn one run-off area but he avoided hitting the wall. He rejoined the circuit and returned to the pit lane to retire from the event.<ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" /> Ferrari brought Alonso into the pit lane on the 35th lap in response to Vettel's earlier pit stop. He emerged in tenth, just ahead of Massa.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /><ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> Alonso overtook Magnussen into turn one with DRS for ninth on lap 36 and Vettel passed Massa for eleventh on the next lap. On lap 40, Massa used DRS to pass Magnussen for tenth before the first turn.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /><ref name=\"BBCWebRace\" />\n\n[[File:Lewis Hamilton (14007100330).jpg|left|thumb|[[Lewis Hamilton]] started from pole position and held off his teammate [[Nico Rosberg]] to claim his fourth successive win of the season and the 26th of his career.]]\n\nAt the end of lap 42, Hamilton ignored an instruction from Mercedes to enter the pit lane and asked for further adjustments to his car's front wing to counter a possible oversteer with a new set of tyres. He entered the pit lane on the following lap for the hard compound tyres but the stop was problematic: Hamilton's pit crew had difficulty installing the right-rear wheel and he was stationary for 4.3 seconds. Rosberg led for two laps before his second pit stop for the medium compound tyres on the 45th lap.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> He began drawing closer to his teammate Hamilton, who questioned the decision to bring him into the pit lane before Rosberg. On lap 49, P\u00e9rez passed his teammate H\u00fclkenberg for ninth.<ref name=\"AutosportRaceLive\" /> Three laps later, Vettel entered the pit lane for his second pit stop. Alonso did the same in response for the medium-compound tyres the lap after. As Alonso exited the pit lane, Vettel overtook him on the outside for sixth into turn one. An oversteer for R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen leaving turn nine slowed him on the back straight and allowed Vettel to pass him in the act of braking at the turn ten hairpin for fifth.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" />\n\nRosberg was less than a second behind his teammate Hamilton by lap 59 and used DRS. However, Hamilton was within a second of Button entering the final corner and used DRS to cancel out Rosberg's pace.<ref name=\"MMagRace\" /> It was around this point that Hamilton switched to higher-powered engine mode that was forbidden for use by Mercedes to improve his performance and keep Rosberg behind.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/10857150/Monaco-Grand-Prix-2014-Lewis-Hamiltons-feud-with-Nico-Rosberg-began-at-the-Spanish-Grand-Prix.html|title=Monaco Grand Prix 2014: Lewis Hamilton's feud with Nico Rosberg began at the Spanish Grand Prix|last=Johnson|first=Daniel|date=26 May 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=3 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620174226/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/10857150/Monaco-Grand-Prix-2014-Lewis-Hamiltons-feud-with-Nico-Rosberg-began-at-the-Spanish-Grand-Prix.html|archivedate=20 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> As Rosberg returned to DRS range on lap 62, Alonso overtook his teammate R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen between turns three and four for sixth after a short duel.

In the latter game, Gators starting quarterback [[Luke Del Rio]] exited the game with a knee injury and would not return. [[Austin Appleby]] was called to lead the offense for the next two games at [[2016 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] and [[2016 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]] respectively.  Tennessee, seeking revenge for the previous year's comeback by the Gators at The Swamp, quickly fell behind as the Gators entered halftime with a commanding 21\u20133 lead.  However, the Gators experienced a colossal collapse in the second half as Tennessee stormed back with 35 unanswered points before Florida could score a touchdown late in the game, and the Gators left Knoxville with a stunning 28\u201338 loss on their record, the first of the season.  At Vanderbilt, the Gators struggled to a 13\u20136 victory over the Commodores.  The Gators' next game was to be against the [[2016 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] in Gainesville.  However, it became apparent that week as the date of the game approached that [[Hurricane Matthew]] would likely devastate Florida's Atlantic coast.  Because only a small deviation in the storm's destructive projected path would have brought severe weather to the immediate Gainesville area, the Saturday game was indefinitely postponed on Thursday.<ref name=\"LSU cancellation\">{{cite web |url=http://floridagators.com/news/2016/10/6/football-Gators-AD-Foley-Offers-Insight-Into-Florida-LSU-Postponement.aspx?path=football |title=Gators AD Foley Offers Insight Into Florida-LSU Postponement |last=Carter |first=Scott |date=October 6, 2016 |website=floridagators.com |publisher=[[University of Florida Athletic Association|University Athletic Assoc., Inc.]], [[Fox Sports Sun]], [[IMG College]] |access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref>  In the week that followed, heated negotiations between athletic directors [[Jeremy Foley]] of Florida and [[Joe Alleva]] of LSU.

The Gators were now poised to secure the Eastern Division championship in the conference finale, the makeup game at LSU.  The defense capitalized on numerous LSU turnovers while the offense put on a solid performance which included a 98-yard touchdown pass to put the Gators up 10\u20137 entering the fourth quarter.  The game eventually came down to a fourth-and-goal play for LSU with three seconds remaining in the game, a play which was stuffed by the Gators defense, preserving an emotional 16\u201310 win in Death Valley to guarantee a berth in the [[2016 SEC Championship Game]] against undefeated [[2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]].  Florida lost for the fourth straight year to [[Florida\u2013Florida State football rivalry|rival]] [[2016 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] 13\u201331 to close out the regular season, and was trounced 54\u201316 by Alabama in the SEC Championship Game.

On Thursday, updated forecast tracks (correctly) predicted that Irma would move up the middle of the Florida peninsula as a major hurricane, prompting both schools to agree to cancel the game altogether due to safety and traffic concerns. This cancellation marked the third time in four seasons that Florida had to cancel or move a home game due to inclement weather and the second season in a row in which a scheduled home game was affected by the threat of a hurricane.<ref name=\"irmagame\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.gatorsports.com/2017/09/northern-colorado-florida-game-cancelled/ |title=Northern Colorado at Florida game cancelled |last=Andreu |first=Robbie |date=September 7, 2017 |work=Gainesville Sun |access-date=September 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n'''Schedule Source'''<ref>http://floridagators.com/schedule.aspx?schedule=367&path=football</ref>\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Further|2017 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings}}\n{{NCAA Division I FBS CFP ranking movements\n| year            = {{2017}}\n| finalpollweek   = \n| cfpfirstweek    = 9\n| AP_pre          = 17\n| coaches_pre     = 16\n| AP_1            = 22\n| coaches_1       = 24\n| AP_2            = 24\n| coaches_2       = 25\n| AP_3            = 20\n| coaches_3       = 22\n| AP_4            = 21\n| coaches_4       = 20\n| AP_5            = 21\n| coaches_5       = 20\n| AP_6            = RV\n| coaches_6       = RV\n| AP_7            = NR\n| coaches_7       = RV\n| AP_8            = NR\n| coaches_8       = RV\n| AP_9            = NR\n| coaches_9       = NR\n| cfp_9           = NR\n| AP_10           = NR\n| coaches_10      = NR\n| cfp_10          = NR\n| AP_11           = NR\n| coaches_11      = NR\n| cfp_11          = NR\n| AP_12           = NR\n| coaches_12      = NR\n| cfp_12          = NR\n| AP_13           = NR\n| coaches_13      = NR\n| cfp_13          = NR\n| AP_14           = NR\n| coaches_14      = NR\n| cfp_14          = NR\n| AP_15           = NR\n| coaches_15      = NR\n}}\n\n==Game summaries==\n===Michigan===\n{{see also|2017 Michigan Wolverines football team|Advocare Classic}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Florida Gators|color=white}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Michigan Wolverines vs. Florida Gators \u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 2, 2017\n|time=3:41 p.m.\n|road='''No. 11 Michigan\n|R1=10|R2=3|R3=13|R4=7\n|home=No. 17 Florida\n|H1=3|H2=14|H3=0|H4=0\n|stadium=[[AT&T Stadium]] \u2022 [[Arlington, Texas]]\n|attendance=75,802\n|weather=Game indoors\n|referee=Brad Van Vark\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Joe Tessitore]], [[Todd Blackledge]] and [[Holly Rowe]]<ref name=\"MICH Pregame\">[https://s3.amazonaws.com/sidearm.sites/gatorzone.com/documents/2017/8/24/UF_vs_Michigan_Game_Notes_Public.pdf MICH Pregame]</ref>\n|TV=[[College Football on ABC|ABC]]\n|reference=[http://floridagators.com/boxscore.aspx?path=football&id=12996 Boxscore]\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n*Florida \u2013 [[Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro]] 46-yard field goal, 12:26\n*Michigan \u2013 [[Quinn Nordin]] 25-yard field goal, 5:27\n*Michigan \u2013 [[Tarik Black (American football)|Tarik Black]] 46-yard pass from [[Wilton Speight]] (Quinn Nordin kick), 3:01\n;Second Quarter\n*Florida \u2013 Duke Dawson 48-yard interception return (Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro kick), 12:19\n*Florida \u2013 CJ Henderson 41-yard interception return (Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro kick), 10:50\n*Michigan \u2013 Nordin Quinn 55-yard field goal, 4:20\n;Third Quarter\n*Michigan \u2013 Karan Higdon 3-yard run (Quinn Nordin kick), 11:53\n*Michigan \u2013 Quinn Nordin 30-yard field goal, 11:05\n*Michigan \u2013 Quinn Nordin 50-yard field goal, 9:00\n;Fourth Quarter\n*Michigan \u2013 Noah Forbush 0-yard fumble recovery (Quinn Nordin kick), 1:37\n|stats=\n;Passing leaders\n*MICH \u2013 [[Wilton Speight]] \u2013 11/25, 181 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions\n*FLA \u2013 [[Malik Zaire]] \u2013 9/17, 106 yards\n;Rushing leaders\n*MICH \u2013 [[Ty Isaac]] \u2013 11 carries, 114 yards\n*FLA \u2013 Mark Thompson \u2013 5 carries, 13 yards\n;Receiving leaders\n*MICH \u2013 [[Tarik Black (American football)|Tarik Black]] \u2013 2 receptions, 83 yards, 1 touchdown\n*FLA \u2013 Josh Hammond \u2013 3 touchdowns, 71 yards\n;Tackling leaders\n*MICH \u2013 [[Devin Bush Jr.|Devin Bush]] \u2013 7 tackles\n*FLA \u2013 David Reese \u2013 11 tackles\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the latter game, Gators starting quarterback [[Luke Del Rio]] exited the game with a knee injury and would not return. [[Austin Appleby]] was called to lead the offense for the next two games at [[2016 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] and [[2016 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]] respectively.  Tennessee, seeking revenge for the previous year's comeback by the Gators at The Swamp, quickly fell behind as the Gators entered halftime with a commanding 21\u20133 lead.  However, the Gators experienced a colossal collapse in the second half as Tennessee stormed back with 35 unanswered points before Florida could score a touchdown late in the game, and the Gators left Knoxville with a stunning 28\u201338 loss on their record, the first of the season.  At Vanderbilt, the Gators struggled to a 13\u20136 victory over the Commodores.  The Gators' next game was to be against the [[2016 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] in Gainesville.  However, it became apparent that week as the date of the game approached that [[Hurricane Matthew]] would likely devastate Florida's Atlantic coast.  Because only a small deviation in the storm's destructive projected path would have brought severe weather to the immediate Gainesville area, the Saturday game was indefinitely postponed on Thursday.<ref name=\"LSU cancellation\">{{cite web |url=http://floridagators.com/news/2016/10/6/football-Gators-AD-Foley-Offers-Insight-Into-Florida-LSU-Postponement.aspx?path=football |title=Gators AD Foley Offers Insight Into Florida-LSU Postponement |last=Carter |first=Scott |date=October 6, 2016 |website=floridagators.com |publisher=[[University of Florida Athletic Association|University Athletic Assoc., Inc.]], [[Fox Sports Sun]], [[IMG College]] |access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref>  In the week that followed, heated negotiations between athletic directors [[Jeremy Foley]] of Florida and [[Joe Alleva]] of LSU.

The Gators were now poised to secure the Eastern Division championship in the conference finale, the makeup game at LSU.  The defense capitalized on numerous LSU turnovers while the offense put on a solid performance which included a 98-yard touchdown pass to put the Gators up 10\u20137 entering the fourth quarter.  The game eventually came down to a fourth-and-goal play for LSU with three seconds remaining in the game, a play which was stuffed by the Gators defense, preserving an emotional 16\u201310 win in Death Valley to guarantee a berth in the [[2016 SEC Championship Game]] against undefeated [[2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]].  Florida lost for the fourth straight year to [[Florida\u2013Florida State football rivalry|rival]] [[2016 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] 13\u201331 to close out the regular season, and was trounced 54\u201316 by Alabama in the SEC Championship Game.
