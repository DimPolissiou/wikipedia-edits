''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]].

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals.

Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium. In 1871, he expanded his predictions further as well as named a few more elements, although he noted that the principles described for those three elements can be used to describe other missing elements, noting that he wouldn't for that reason describe the elements himself.{{Efn|1=Those elements Mendeleev explicitly mentioned, saying he would be most interested to see them discovered were: eka-caesium, dvi-caesium, eka-niobium, eka-tantalum, eka-manganese, tri-manganese, as well as he noted a missing \"entire ninth row and even almost a whole big period (starting with Ce = 140)\".|name=|group=}}\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]], and the five rare earth metals\u2014[[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium, and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Van den Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Van den Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium. In 1871, he expanded his predictions further as well as named a few more elements, although he noted that the principles described for those three elements can be used to describe other missing elements, noting that he wouldn't for that reason describe the elements himself.{{Efn|1=Those elements Mendeleev explicitly mentioned, saying he would be most interested to see them discovered were: eka-caesium, dvi-caesium, eka-niobium, eka-tantalum, eka-manganese, tri-manganese, as well as he noted a missing \"entire ninth row and even almost a whole big period (starting with Ce = 140)\".|name=|group=}}\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]], and the five rare earth metals\u2014[[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium, and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Van den Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Van den Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

The most influential specimen was [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]] from [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]], France. French palaeontologist [[Marcellin Boule]] authored several publications, among the first to establish palaeontology as a science, detailing the specimen, but reconstructed it as ape-like and only remotely related to modern humans. The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule's error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|issue=291|pages=158\u2013164|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00089936}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged. In 1939, American anthropologist [[Carlton Coon]] reconstructed a Neanderthal in a modern business suit and hat to emphasize that they would be, more or less, indistinguishable from modern humans had they survived into the present.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule's error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|issue=291|pages=158\u2013164|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00089936}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'' and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon]]ese and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li's personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] noted that Up\u0101li was the \"striking proof of the reality of the effect produced by Gautama's disregard of the supposed importance of caste\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1903 |p=69}} Historian {{ill|H.W. Schumann|de}} also raises Up\u0101li as an example of the general rule that \"in no case did ... humble origins prevent a monk from becoming prominent in the [[sangha|Order]]\".{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=166}} Religion scholar Jeffrey Samuels points out, though, that the majority of Buddhist monks and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]], as drawn from several analyses of Buddhist texts, were from higher castes, with a minority of six percent like Up\u0101li being exception to the rule.{{sfn |Samuels |2007 |p=123}} Historian Sangh Sen Singh argues that Up\u0101li could have been the leader of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' after the Buddha's ''[[parinibb\u0101na]]'' instead of [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa). But the fact that he was from a low caste effectively prevented this, as many of the Buddhist devotees at the time might have objected to his leadership position.{{sfn |Singh |1973 |pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n=== Monastic life ===\nUp\u0101li had a dwelling place in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101li]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101li}}), called V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma.<!--Calikarama-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma}}{{sfn |Geiger |1912 |p=35}} He once asked the Buddha for leave to withdraw in the forest and lead a life in solitude. The Buddha refused, however, and told him that such a life was not for everyone.<!--Upali Sutta--> P\u0101li scholar [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|Gunapala Malalasekera]] argued that the Buddha wanted Up\u0101li to learn both meditation and Buddhist doctrine, and a life in the forest would have provided him with only the former. The texts state that the Buddha himself taught the ''[[vinaya]]'' (monastic discipline) to Up\u0101li.<!--Upali-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; Up\u0101li Sutta (3)}} Up\u0101li later attained the state of an [[arhat|enlightened disciple]].{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the [[Upadhyay#In Buddhism|preceptor]] who completed the process of Up\u0101li's [[upasampada|acceptance]] in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' was a monk called Kappitaka.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=58}}{{refn |group=note |Philosopher Michael Freedman argues that the office of preceptor may have only been developed after the Buddha's ''parinibb\u0101na'', although he admits the texts contradict each other with regard to Up\u0101li's acceptance.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=57 n.60, 97\u201398}}}} There is one story told about Up\u0101li and his preceptor. Kappitaka was in the habit of living in cemeteries. In one cemetery near Ves\u0101li he had a [[monastic cell]]. One day, a couple of nuns built a small monument there in honor of their teacher, also a nun, and made much noise in the process. Disturbed by the nuns, Kappitaka destroyed the monument, which greatly angered the nuns. Later, in an attempt to kill Kappitaka, they destroyed his cell in return. But Kappitaka was warned by Up\u0101li in advance and he had already fled elsewhere.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kappitaka Thera}} The next day, Up\u0101li was verbally abused by the nuns for having informed his teacher.{{sfn |Dhammadinna |2016 |pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Role in monastic discipline ===\n[[File:Upali (Ubari), from the series \u201cTwo Bodhisattva and Ten Great Disciples of Sakyamuni\u201d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Up\u0101li, woodblock print by [[Munakata Shik\u014d]], originally from 1939|left|alt=Monk in black robes looking at the sky with hands held up]]\n\nIn the literature of every Buddhist school, Up\u0101li is depicted as an expert in ''vinaya'' and the ''[[p\u0101\u1e6dimokkha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratimok\u1e63a|italic=yes}}; monastic code),{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} for which the Buddha declared him [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#Foremost disciples|foremost]] among those who remember the vinaya ({{lang-pi|Vinaya-p\u0101mokkha|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Vinayapramukkha|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=878}}{{sfn |Robinson |Johnson |1997 |p=45}} He was therefore dubbed the 'repository of the discipline' ({{lang-pi|Vinaye agganikkhitto|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} In some schools, he is also seen as an expert in the [[Bodhisattva Precepts|precepts]] of a ''[[bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]'' ({{lang-sa|bodhisattva|italic=yes}}; Buddha-to-be).{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} 5th-century commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] stated that Up\u0101li drew up instructions and explanatory notes for monks dealing with disciplinary matters.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nUp\u0101li was also known for his strictness in practicing the discipline.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=365}} Monks considered it a privilege to study the ''vinaya'' under him.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=4}} At times, monks who felt repentance and wanted to improve themselves, sought his advice.<!--Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera--> In other cases, Up\u0101li was consulted in making decisions considering alleged offenses of monastic discipline. For example, one newly ordained nun was found pregnant, and was judged by the monk [[Devadatta]] as unfit to be a nun. However, the Buddha had Up\u0101li do a second investigation, during which Up\u0101li called upon the help of the laywoman [[Visakha|Visakh\u0101]] and several other laypeople. Eventually, Up\u0101li concluded the nun had conceived the child by her husband before her ordination as a nun, and therefore was innocent. The Buddha later praised Up\u0101li for his careful consideration of this matter.<!--Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa; Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera}}\n\nOther notable cases about which Up\u0101li decided are that of the monks Bharukaccha and Ajjuka. Bharukaccha consulted Up\u0101li whether dreaming about having sex with a woman amounted to an offense that required disrobing, and Up\u0101li judged it did not.<!--Bharukaccha--> As for the monk Ajjuka, he had decided about a dispute about real estate.<!--Ajjuka-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka; Bharukaccha}}. For the other laypeople, see {{harvtxt |Churn Law |2000 |p=464}}.}} In this case, a rich householder was in doubt as to who he should will his inheritance to, his pious nephew or his own son. He asked Ajjuka to invite for an audience the person who had the most faith of the two{{em dash}}Ajjuka invited the nephew. Angry about the decision, the son accused Ajjuka of partisanship and went to see the monk [[\u0100nanda]]. \u0100nanda disagreed with Ajjuka's decision, judging the son the more rightful heir, and causing the son to feel justified in accusing Ajjuka of not being a \"true monk\". When Up\u0101li got involved, however, he judged in favor of Ajjuka. He pointed out to \u0100nanda that the act of inviting a layperson did not break monastic discipline.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}. {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |pp=30\u201332}} mentions faith, the son seeing \u0100nanda, and the accusation of false monkhood.}} Eventually, \u0100nanda agreed with Up\u0101li, and Up\u0101li was able to settle the issue.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=32}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka}} Here, too, the Buddha praised Up\u0101li for his handling of the case.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1961}} Law scholar [[Andrew Huxley (law scholar)|Andrew Huxley]] noted that Up\u0101li's judgment of this case allowed monks to engage on an ethical level with the world, whereas \u0100nanda's judgment did not.{{sfn |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}\n\n=== First Council and death ===\n[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 013 First Council at Rajagaha (9241729223).jpg|The First Council.

The ''[[Apadana|Apad\u0101na]]'' explains this by relating that Up\u0101li had been an all-powerful [[cakravartin|wheel-turning king]] for thousand previous lives, and a king of the [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]] in another thousand lives.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |1996 |p=126 note 27}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. Huxley mentions the question raised.}} Before that, the texts say he was born during the age of [[Padumuttara Buddha]] and met one of that [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]'s disciples who was foremost in monastic discipline. Up\u0101li aspired to be like him, and pursued it through doing [[merit (Buddhism)|merits]].{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\nDespite Up\u0101li's previous lives as a king, he was born as a low caste barber in the time of [[Gotama Buddha]]. This is also explained in an ''Apad\u0101na'' story: in a previous life, Up\u0101li insulted a ''[[paccekabuddha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratyekabuddha|italic=yes}}; a type of Buddha). The evil [[karma in Buddhism|karma]] brought about low birth.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nUp\u0101li was the focus of worship in ancient and medieval India and was regarded as the \"patron saint\" of monks who specialize in the ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Hsuan Tsang}} He is one of the [[eight enlightened disciples]], and is honored in Burmese ceremonies.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn|Strong |1992 |p=240}}\n\n=== Schools and lineages ===\n[[File:Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra on 1890 map of Anuradhapura.svg|1890 map showing the historical location of the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra, drawn by a British civil servant |alt=Map of Anurudhapura, the city that included the Mahvihara |thumb]]\nSeveral scholars have contended that the prominence of certain of the Buddha's disciples in the early texts is indicative of the preference of the compilers. Buddhologist [[Jean Przyluski]] argued that Up\u0101li's prominence in the P\u0101li texts is indicative of the preference of the [[Sthavira]]v\u0101dins for ''vinaya'' above [[sutra|discourse]], whereas the prominence of \u0100nanda in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts is indicative of their preference for discourse above ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=13, 464\u2013465}}{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |pp=22\u201323}} This preference of the compilers has also affected how \u0100nanda addresses Up\u0101li.<!--34-35--> In many of the early discourses Up\u0101li has little to no role,<!--88--> and he is not mentioned among many early lists of significant disciples.<!--89--> He is, however, frequently mentioned in lists in the ''Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka'', which only proves the point. Up\u0101li seems to obtain a much more significant role with the end of the Buddha's life.<!--110-->{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=34\u201335, 88\u201389, 110}} Przyluski's theory, which was further developed by Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Migot]], regarded [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}), Up\u0101li and [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}) as part of the second period in the compiling of the early texts (4th to early 3rd century BCE) that emphasized [[\u015b\u012bla|moral discipline]], associated with these disciples, as well as the city of [[Vesali|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015bal\u012b}}).{{refn |group=note |Although Przyluski connected this with the city of [[Kosambi|Kosamb\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Kau\u015bamb\u012b}}) instead.{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |p=184}}}} In this period, these disciples' roles and stories were emphasized and embellished more than other disciples.{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} These differences in schools gradually developed and became stereotyped over time.{{sfn |Dutt |1925 |pp=206\u2013207}}\n\nUp\u0101li's successors formed a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] called the ''vinayadharas'', or the 'custodians of the vinaya'.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=3}}{{sfn |Prebish |2008 |p=2}} ''Vinayadharas'' were monks who in [[early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]] were particularly known for their mastery and strictness with regard to the ''vinaya''. In 4th<!--2-->\u20135th-century<!--3--> [[Ceylon]], they then came to be associated with a lineage of such masters,<!--2--> because of the influence of Buddhaghosa, who established Up\u0101li and the other ''vinayadharas'' as an important characteristic<!--3--> of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra]] tradition.<!--12--> This concept of a ''vinayadhara'' lineage also affected Burma, and led to a belief that only those ordained in the proper lineage could become ''vinayadharas''.<!--3--> Gradually, the ''vinayadhara'' came to be seen a sign of superior tradition, as the lineage was integrated with local history.<!--12--> Even later, the ''vinayadhara'' became a formal position<!--14--> of judge and arbitrator in problems of ''vinaya''.<!--4-->{{sfn |Frasch |1996 |pp=2\u20134, 12, 14}}\n\nUp\u0101li's lineage has gained scholarly attention because of their way of timekeeping, known by modern scholars as the \"dotted record\". Chinese sources say that Up\u0101li and his successors had a custom to insert a dot in a manuscript marking each year after the First Council. The sources claim that each of successors continued this tradition, up until 489 CE, when the [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] scholar [[Sa\u1e43ghabhadra]] entered the last dot in the manuscript. This tradition has been used by some modern scholars to calculate the [[parinirvana|passing away]] of the Buddha,<!--6--> but has now been debunked as historically unlikely.<!--7--> Still, data pertaining to the ''vinayadharas'' is used to support theories regarding the dating of the Buddha's life and death,<!--6--> such as the one proposed by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]].<!--8-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Prebish |2008 |pp=6\u20138}}. {{harvtxt |Geiger |1912 |p=xlvii}} mentions the term ''para\u1e43par\u0101''.}}\n[[File:Daoxuan (Nara National Museum).jpg|thumb|The Chinese Vinaya school founded by Tao-hs\u00fcan saw themselves as the continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|ICP]], [[Nara National Museum]]) |upright=.7]]\nNot only in ancient India did certain lineages identify with Up\u0101li. In 7th-century China, the Vinaya or Nan-shan School was founded by the monks Ku-hsin and [[Tao-hs\u00fcan]], seen as a continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage. The school emphasized restoring and propagating the ''vinaya'' and became popular in the Pa Hwa Hills of [[Nanking]]. It developed a standard for teaching the ''vinaya''. The monks would wear black and emphasized protecting oneself against error. It was believed at the time that Ku-hsin was a reincarnation of Up\u0101li.{{refn |For Ku-hsin, the Pa Hwa Hills, the standard and the reincarnation, see {{harvtxt |Hsiang-Kuang |1956 |p=207}}.

Much of this is found in the ''[[Pariv\u0101ra]]'', a late ''vinaya'' text.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} Bareau has suggested the conversation between the Buddha and Up\u0101li about schisms was the origin of the traditions about this subject in the ''Vinayapi\u1e6daka''.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=169}} In the ''vinaya'' texts of the Sarvastiv\u0101da tradition, the ''Uttragrantha''{{sfn

P\u0101li at all.{{sfn |Norman |1983 |p=29}} With regard to these lists of questions, it is unknown which of these questions are from Up\u0101li, and which were attributed to him because of his reputation.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} Apart from these technical discussions, there is also a teaching given by Up\u0101li referred to in the P\u0101li

Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'' and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon]]ese and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li's personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] noted that Up\u0101li was the \"striking proof of the reality of the effect produced by Gautama's disregard of the supposed importance of caste\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1903 |p=69}} Historian {{ill|H.W. Schumann|de}} also raises Up\u0101li as an example of the general rule that \"in no case did ... humble origins prevent a monk from becoming prominent in the [[sangha|Order]]\".{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=166}} Religion scholar Jeffrey Samuels points out, though, that the majority of Buddhist monks and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]], as drawn from several analyses of Buddhist texts, were from higher castes, with a minority of six percent like Up\u0101li being exception to the rule.{{sfn |Samuels |2007 |p=123}} Historian Sangh Sen Singh argues that Up\u0101li could have been the leader of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' after the Buddha's ''[[parinibb\u0101na]]'' instead of [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa). But the fact that he was from a low caste effectively prevented this, as many of the Buddhist devotees at the time might have objected to his leadership position.{{sfn |Singh |1973 |pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n=== Monastic life ===\nUp\u0101li had a dwelling place in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101li]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101li}}), called V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma.<!--Calikarama-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma}}{{sfn |Geiger |1912 |p=35}} He once asked the Buddha for leave to withdraw in the forest and lead a life in solitude. The Buddha refused, however, and told him that such a life was not for everyone.<!--Upali Sutta--> P\u0101li scholar [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|Gunapala Malalasekera]] argued that the Buddha wanted Up\u0101li to learn both meditation and Buddhist doctrine, and a life in the forest would have provided him with only the former. The texts state that the Buddha himself taught the ''[[vinaya]]'' (monastic discipline) to Up\u0101li.<!--Upali-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; Up\u0101li Sutta (3)}} Up\u0101li later attained the state of an [[arhat|enlightened disciple]].{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the [[Upadhyay#In Buddhism|preceptor]] who completed the process of Up\u0101li's [[upasampada|acceptance]] in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' was a monk called Kappitaka.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=58}}{{refn |group=note |Philosopher Michael Freedman argues that the office of preceptor may have only been developed after the Buddha's ''parinibb\u0101na'', although he admits the texts contradict each other with regard to Up\u0101li's acceptance.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=57 n.60, 97\u201398}}}} There is one story told about Up\u0101li and his preceptor. Kappitaka was in the habit of living in cemeteries. In one cemetery near Ves\u0101li he had a [[monastic cell]]. One day, a couple of nuns built a small monument there in honor of their teacher, also a nun, and made much noise in the process. Disturbed by the nuns, Kappitaka destroyed the monument, which greatly angered the nuns. Later, in an attempt to kill Kappitaka, they destroyed his cell in return. But Kappitaka was warned by Up\u0101li in advance and he had already fled elsewhere.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kappitaka Thera}} The next day, Up\u0101li was verbally abused by the nuns for having informed his teacher.{{sfn |Dhammadinna |2016 |pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Role in monastic discipline ===\n[[File:Upali (Ubari), from the series \u201cTwo Bodhisattva and Ten Great Disciples of Sakyamuni\u201d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Up\u0101li, woodblock print by [[Munakata Shik\u014d]], originally from 1939|left|alt=Monk in black robes looking at the sky with hands held up]]\n\nIn the literature of every Buddhist school, Up\u0101li is depicted as an expert in ''vinaya'' and the ''[[p\u0101\u1e6dimokkha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratimok\u1e63a|italic=yes}}; monastic code),{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} for which the Buddha declared him [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#Foremost disciples|foremost]] among those who remember the vinaya ({{lang-pi|Vinaya-p\u0101mokkha|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Vinayapramukkha|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=878}}{{sfn |Robinson |Johnson |1997 |p=45}} He was therefore dubbed the 'repository of the discipline' ({{lang-pi|Vinaye agganikkhitto|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} In some schools, he is also seen as an expert in the [[Bodhisattva Precepts|precepts]] of a ''[[bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]'' ({{lang-sa|bodhisattva|italic=yes}}; Buddha-to-be).{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} 5th-century commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] stated that Up\u0101li drew up instructions and explanatory notes for monks dealing with disciplinary matters.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nUp\u0101li was also known for his strictness in practicing the discipline.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=365}} Monks considered it a privilege to study the ''vinaya'' under him.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=4}} At times, monks who felt repentance and wanted to improve themselves, sought his advice.<!--Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera--> In other cases, Up\u0101li was consulted in making decisions considering alleged offenses of monastic discipline. For example, one newly ordained nun was found pregnant, and was judged by the monk [[Devadatta]] as unfit to be a nun. However, the Buddha had Up\u0101li do a second investigation, during which Up\u0101li called upon the help of the laywoman [[Visakha|Visakh\u0101]] and several other laypeople. Eventually, Up\u0101li concluded the nun had conceived the child by her husband before her ordination as a nun, and therefore was innocent. The Buddha later praised Up\u0101li for his careful consideration of this matter.<!--Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa; Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera}}\n\nOther notable cases about which Up\u0101li decided are that of the monks Bharukaccha and Ajjuka. Bharukaccha consulted Up\u0101li whether dreaming about having sex with a woman amounted to an offense that required disrobing, and Up\u0101li judged it did not.<!--Bharukaccha--> As for the monk Ajjuka, he had decided about a dispute about real estate.<!--Ajjuka-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka; Bharukaccha}}. For the other laypeople, see {{harvtxt |Churn Law |2000 |p=464}}.}} In this case, a rich householder was in doubt as to who he should will his inheritance to, his pious nephew or his own son. He asked Ajjuka to invite for an audience the person who had the most faith of the two{{em dash}}Ajjuka invited the nephew. Angry about the decision, the son accused Ajjuka of partisanship and went to see the monk [[\u0100nanda]]. \u0100nanda disagreed with Ajjuka's decision, judging the son the more rightful heir, and causing the son to feel justified in accusing Ajjuka of not being a \"true monk\". When Up\u0101li got involved, however, he judged in favor of Ajjuka. He pointed out to \u0100nanda that the act of inviting a layperson did not break monastic discipline.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}. {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |pp=30\u201332}} mentions faith, the son seeing \u0100nanda, and the accusation of false monkhood.}} Eventually, \u0100nanda agreed with Up\u0101li, and Up\u0101li was able to settle the issue.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=32}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka}} Here, too, the Buddha praised Up\u0101li for his handling of the case.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1961}} Law scholar [[Andrew Huxley (law scholar)|Andrew Huxley]] noted that Up\u0101li's judgment of this case allowed monks to engage on an ethical level with the world, whereas \u0100nanda's judgment did not.{{sfn |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}\n\n=== First Council and death ===\n[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 013 First Council at Rajagaha (9241729223).jpg|The First Council.

Huxley mentions the question raised.}} Before that, the texts say he was born during the age of [[Padumuttara Buddha]] and met one of that [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]'s disciples who was foremost in monastic discipline. Up\u0101li aspired to be like him, and pursued it through doing [[merit (Buddhism)|merits]].{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\nDespite Up\u0101li's previous lives as a king, he was born as a low caste barber in the time of [[Gotama Buddha]]. This is also explained in an ''Apad\u0101na'' story: in a previous life, Up\u0101li insulted a ''[[paccekabuddha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratyekabuddha|italic=yes}}; a type of Buddha). The evil [[karma in Buddhism|karma]] brought about low birth.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nUp\u0101li was the focus of worship in ancient and medieval India and was regarded as the \"patron saint\" of monks who specialize in the ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Hsuan Tsang}} He is one of the [[eight enlightened disciples]], and is honored in Burmese ceremonies.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn|Strong |1992 |p=240}}\n\n=== Schools and lineages ===\n[[File:Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra on 1890 map of Anuradhapura.svg|1890 map showing the historical location of the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra, drawn by a British civil servant |alt=Map of Anurudhapura, the city that included the Mahvihara |thumb]]\nSeveral scholars have contended that the prominence of certain of the Buddha's disciples in the early texts is indicative of the preference of the compilers. Buddhologist [[Jean Przyluski]] argued that Up\u0101li's prominence in the P\u0101li texts is indicative of the preference of the [[Sthavira]]v\u0101dins for ''vinaya'' above [[sutra|discourse]], whereas the prominence of \u0100nanda in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts is indicative of their preference for discourse above ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=13, 464\u2013465}}{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |pp=22\u201323}} This preference of the compilers has also affected how \u0100nanda addresses Up\u0101li.<!--34-35--> In many of the early discourses Up\u0101li has little to no role,<!--88--> and he is not mentioned among many early lists of significant disciples.<!--89--> He is, however, frequently mentioned in lists in the ''Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka'', which only proves the point. Up\u0101li seems to obtain a much more significant role with the end of the Buddha's life.<!--110-->{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=34\u201335, 88\u201389, 110}} Przyluski's theory, which was further developed by Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Migot]], regarded [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}), Up\u0101li and [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}) as part of the second period in the compiling of the early texts (4th to early 3rd century BCE) that emphasized [[\u015b\u012bla|moral discipline]], associated with these disciples, as well as the city of [[Vesali|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015bal\u012b}}).{{refn |group=note |Although Przyluski connected this with the city of [[Kosambi|Kosamb\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Kau\u015bamb\u012b}}) instead.{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |p=184}}}} In this period, these disciples' roles and stories were emphasized and embellished more than other disciples.{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} These differences in schools gradually developed and became stereotyped over time.{{sfn |Dutt |1925 |pp=206\u2013207}}\n\nUp\u0101li's successors formed a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] called the ''vinayadharas'', or the 'custodians of the vinaya'.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=3}}{{sfn |Prebish |2008 |p=2}} ''Vinayadharas'' were monks who in [[early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]] were particularly known for their mastery and strictness with regard to the ''vinaya''. In 4th<!--2-->\u20135th-century<!--3--> [[Ceylon]], they then came to be associated with a lineage of such masters,<!--2--> because of the influence of Buddhaghosa, who established Up\u0101li and the other ''vinayadharas'' as an important characteristic<!--3--> of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra]] tradition.<!--12--> This concept of a ''vinayadhara'' lineage also affected Burma, and led to a belief that only those ordained in the proper lineage could become ''vinayadharas''.<!--3--> Gradually, the ''vinayadhara'' came to be seen a sign of superior tradition, as the lineage was integrated with local history.<!--12--> Even later, the ''vinayadhara'' became a formal position<!--14--> of judge and arbitrator in problems of ''vinaya''.<!--4-->{{sfn |Frasch |1996 |pp=2\u20134, 12, 14}}\n\nUp\u0101li's lineage has gained scholarly attention because of their way of timekeeping, known by modern scholars as the \"dotted record\". Chinese sources say that Up\u0101li and his successors had a custom to insert a dot in a manuscript marking each year after the First Council. The sources claim that each of successors continued this tradition, up until 489 CE, when the [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] scholar [[Sa\u1e43ghabhadra]] entered the last dot in the manuscript. This tradition has been used by some modern scholars to calculate the [[parinirvana|passing away]] of the Buddha,<!--6--> but has now been debunked as historically unlikely.<!--7--> Still, data pertaining to the ''vinayadharas'' is used to support theories regarding the dating of the Buddha's life and death,<!--6--> such as the one proposed by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]].<!--8-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Prebish |2008 |pp=6\u20138}}. {{harvtxt |Geiger |1912 |p=xlvii}} mentions the term ''para\u1e43par\u0101''.}}\n[[File:Daoxuan (Nara National Museum).jpg|thumb|The Chinese Vinaya school founded by Tao-hs\u00fcan saw themselves as the continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|ICP]], [[Nara National Museum]]) |upright=.7]]\nNot only in ancient India did certain lineages identify with Up\u0101li. In 7th-century China, the Vinaya or Nan-shan School was founded by the monks Ku-hsin and [[Tao-hs\u00fcan]], seen as a continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage. The school emphasized restoring and propagating the ''vinaya'' and became popular in the Pa Hwa Hills of [[Nanking]]. It developed a standard for teaching the ''vinaya''. The monks would wear black and emphasized protecting oneself against error. It was believed at the time that Ku-hsin was a reincarnation of Up\u0101li.{{refn |For Ku-hsin, the Pa Hwa Hills, the standard and the reincarnation, see {{harvtxt |Hsiang-Kuang |1956 |p=207}}.

Much of this is found in the ''[[Pariv\u0101ra]]'', a late ''vinaya'' text.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} Bareau has suggested the conversation between the Buddha and Up\u0101li about schisms was the origin of the traditions about this subject in the ''Vinayapi\u1e6daka''.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=169}} In the ''vinaya'' texts of the Sarvastiv\u0101da tradition, the ''Uttragrantha''{{sfn

P\u0101li at all.{{sfn |Norman |1983 |p=29}} With regard to these lists of questions, it is unknown which of these questions are from Up\u0101li, and which were attributed to him because of his
