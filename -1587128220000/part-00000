In the United States, wetlands are defined as \"those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas\".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/definitions.cfm|title=EPA Regulations listed at 40 CFR 230.3(t)|accessdate=2014-02-18|date=March 2015}}</ref> This definition has been used in the enforcement of the [[Clean Water Act]]. Some US states, such as [[Massachusetts]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have separate definitions that may differ from the federal government's.\n\nIn the [[United States Code]], the term wetland is defined \"as land that (A) has a predominance of hydric soils, (B) is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions and (C) under normal circumstances supports a prevalence of such vegetation.\" Related to this legal definitions, the term \"normal circumstances\" are conditions expected to occur during the wet portion of the growing season under normal climatic conditions (not unusually dry or unusually wet), and in the absence of significant disturbance. It is not uncommon for a wetland to be dry for long portions of the growing season. Wetlands can be dry during the dry season and abnormally dry periods during the wet season, but under normal environmental conditions the soils in a wetland will be saturated to the surface or inundated such that the soils become anaerobic, and those conditions will persist through the wet portion of the growing season.<ref>US Government Publishing Office.

The duration of flooding or prolonged soil saturation by [[groundwater]] determines whether the resulting wetland has aquatic, [[marsh]] or [[swamp]] [[vegetation]]. Other important factors include fertility, natural disturbance, competition, [[herbivory]], burial and salinity.<ref name=\"Keddy2010\"/> When [[peat]] accumulates, [[bog]]s and [[fen]]s arise.\n\n==Characteristics==\nWetlands vary widely due to local and regional differences in [[topography]], [[hydrology]], [[vegetation]], and other factors, including human involvement.\n\n==Hydrology==\nWetland hydrology is associated with the spatial and temporal dispersion, flow, and physio-chemical attributes of surface and ground water in its reservoirs. Based on hydrology, wetlands can be categorized as [[riverine]] (associated with streams), [[wikt:lacustrine|lacustrine]] (associated with lakes and reservoirs), and [[palustrine]] (isolated). Sources of hydrological flows into wetlands are predominantly [[precipitation]], surface water, and [[groundwater]]. Water flows out of wetlands by [[evapotranspiration]], [[surface runoff]], and subsurface water outflow. [[Hydrodynamics]] (the movement of water through and from a wetland) affects hydro-periods (temporal fluctuations in water levels) by controlling the water balance and water storage within a wetland.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=J.

The [[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] and [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] [[concentration (chemistry)|concentrations]] of water depend on [[temperature]] and [[atmospheric pressure]]. Hydrochemistry within wetlands is determined by the [[pH]], [[salinity]], nutrients, [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], soil composition, [[Water hardness|hardness]], and the sources of water. Water chemistry of wetlands varies across landscapes and climatic regions. Wetlands are generally [[minerotrophic]] with the exception of bogs.\n\nBogs receive most of their water from the [[atmosphere]]; therefore, their water usually has low mineral ionic composition. In contrast, groundwater has a higher concentration of dissolved nutrients and minerals.\n\nThe water chemistry of fens ranges from low pH and low minerals to alkaline with high accumulation of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] because they acquire their water from precipitation as well as ground water.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vitt|first1=D.

[[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] and [[Ramsar Convention]] described wetlands as a whole to be of [[biosphere]] significance and societal importance in the following areas, for example:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n*[[Flood control|Water storage (flood control)]]\n*Groundwater replenishment\n*Shoreline stabilisation and storm protection\n*[[Water purification]]\n*Reservoirs of [[biodiversity]]\n*Pollination\n*Wetland products\n*Cultural values\n*Recreation and [[Eco tourism|tourism]]\n*[[Climate change mitigation]] and adaptation\n\nAccording to the Ramsar Convention:\n\n<blockquote>The economic worth of the ecosystem services provided to society by intact, naturally functioning wetlands is frequently much greater than the perceived benefits of converting them to 'more valuable' intensive land use \u2013 particularly as the profits from unsustainable use often go to relatively few individuals or corporations, rather than being shared by society as a whole.</blockquote>\n\n''Unless otherwise cited, ecosystem services information is based on the following series of references.''<ref name=\"ramsar_a\"/>\n\nTo replace these wetland [[ecosystem services]], enormous amounts of money would need to be spent on [[water purification]] plants, dams, levees, and other hard infrastructure, and many of the services are impossible to replace.\n\n=== Water storage (flood control) ===\n''Major wetland type: floodplain and closed-depression wetlands''\n\n'''Storage reservoirs and flood protection:''' The wetland system of [[floodplains]] is formed from major rivers downstream from their [[headwaters]]. \"The floodplains of major rivers act as natural storage reservoirs, enabling excess water to spread out over a wide area, which reduces its depth and speed. Wetlands close to the headwaters of streams and rivers can slow down rainwater runoff and spring snowmelt so that it doesn't run straight off the land into water courses. This can help prevent sudden, damaging floods downstream.\"<ref name=\"ramsar_a\" /> Notable river systems that produce large spans of floodplain include the [[Nile River]], the Niger river inland delta, the Zambezi River flood plain, the Okavango River inland delta, the Kafue River flood plain, the Lake Bangweulu flood plain (Africa), [[Mississippi River]] (USA), [[Amazon River]] (South America), [[Yangtze River]] (China), [[Danube River]] (Central Europe) and [[Murray-Darling]] River (Australia).\n\n'''Human impact:''' Converting wetlands to upland through drainage and development forces adjoining or downstream water channels into narrower corridors. This accelerates watershed hydrologic response to storm events and this increases the need in some cases for alternative means of flood control. That is because the newly formed channels must manage the same amount of precipitation, causing flood peaks to be [higher or deeper] and floodwaters to travel faster.\n\nWater management engineering developments in the past century have degraded these wetlands through the construction of artificial embankments. These constructions may be classified as [[Levee|dykes]], bunds, [[levees]], [[weirs]], barrages and [[dams]] but serve the single purpose of concentrating water into a select source or area. Wetland water sources that were once spread slowly over a large, shallow area are pooled into deep, concentrated locations. Loss of wetland floodplains results in more severe and damaging flooding. Catastrophic human impact in the Mississippi River floodplains was seen in death of several hundred individuals during a [[levee breach]] in New Orleans caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Ecological catastrophic events from human-made embankments have been noticed along the Yangtze River floodplains since the middle of the river has become prone to more frequent and damaging flooding. Some of these events include the loss of [[riparian vegetation]], a 30% loss of the vegetation cover throughout the river's basin, a doubling of the percentage of the land affected by soil erosion, and a reduction in reservoir capacity through [[siltation]] build-up in floodplain lakes.<ref name=\"ramsar_a\"/>\n\n===Groundwater replenishment===\n''Major wetland type: [[marsh]], [[swamp]], and subterranean [[karst]] and cave hydrological systems''\n\nThe [[surface water]] which is the water visibly seen in wetland systems only represents a portion of the overall water cycle which also includes [[atmospheric water]] and [[groundwater]]. Wetland systems are directly linked to groundwater and a crucial regulator of both the quantity and [[water quality|quality of water]] found below the ground. Wetland systems that are made of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] [[sediment]]s like [[limestone]] or occur in areas with highly variable and fluctuating water tables especially have a role in [[groundwater replenishment]] or [[water recharge]]. Sediments that are [[porous]] allow water to filter down through the soil and overlying rock into [[aquifers]] which are the source of 95% of the world's drinking water. Wetlands can also act as recharge areas when the surrounding water table is low and as a discharge zone when it is too high. [[Karst cave|Karst]] (cave) systems are a unique example of this system and are a connection of underground rivers influenced by rain and other forms of [[precipitation]]. These wetland systems are capable of regulating changes in the water table on upwards of {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n'''Human impact''': Groundwater is an important source of water for [[drinking water|drinking]] and [[irrigation]] of crops. Over 1&nbsp;billion people in Asia and 65% of the public water sources in Europe source 100% of their water from groundwater. Irrigation is a massive use of groundwater with 80% of the world's groundwater used for agricultural production.<ref name=\"ramsar_a\"/>\n\nUnsustainable abstraction of groundwater has become a major concern. In the Commonwealth of [[Australia]], water licensing is being implemented to control use of water in major agricultural regions. On a global scale, groundwater deficits and water scarcity is one of the most pressing concerns facing the 21st century.<ref name=\"ramsar_a\"/>\n\n===Shoreline stabilization and storm protection===\n''Wetland type: [[Mangrove]]s, [[coral reef]]s, [[salt marsh]]''\n\n{{Main|Integrated coastal zone management}}\n\nTidal and inter-tidal wetland systems protect and stabilize coastal zones. [[Coral reefs]] provide a protective barrier to coastal shoreline. [[Mangrove]]s stabilize the coastal zone from the interior and will migrate with the shoreline to remain adjacent to the boundary of the water. The main conservation benefit these systems have against storms and [[storm surge]]s is the ability to reduce the speed and height of waves and floodwaters.\n\n'''Human impact''': The sheer number of people who live and work near the coast is expected to grow immensely over the next fifty years. From an estimated 200&nbsp;million people that currently live in low-lying coastal regions, the development of urban coastal centers is projected to increase the population by fivefold within 50 years.<ref name=\"urlUNEP-Home\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.unep.org\n|title=United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \u2013 Home page\n|accessdate=2011-12-11\n}}</ref>\nThe United Kingdom has begun the concept of managed coastal realignment. This management technique provides shoreline protection through restoration of natural wetlands rather than through applied engineering. In East Asia, reclamation of coastal wetlands has resulted in widespread transformation of the coastal zone, and up to 65% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed by coastal development.<ref>{{ Citation | first1 = J. | last1 = MacKinnon | first2 = Y.

A natural function of wetland vegetation is the up-take, storage, and (for nitrate) the removal of nutrients found in [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from the surrounding soil and water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|title=Letting Nature Do the Job|date=2008-08-01|website=Wild.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113192135/http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|archive-date=2013-01-13|url-status=dead|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> In many wetlands, nutrients are retained until plants die or are harvested by animals or humans and taken to another location, or until microbial processes convert soluble nutrients to a gas as is the case with nitrate.\n\n'''Sediment and heavy metal traps:''' Precipitation and surface runoff induces [[soil erosion]], transporting sediment in suspension into and through waterways. These sediments move towards larger and more sizable waterways through a natural process that moves water towards oceans. All types of sediments which may be composed of clay, sand, silt, and rock can be carried into wetland systems through this process. Wetland vegetation acts as a physical barrier to slow water flow and trap sediment for short or long periods of time. Suspended sediment often contains heavy metals that are retained when wetlands trap the sediment. In some cases, certain metals are taken up through wetland plant stems, roots, and leaves. Many floating plant species, for example, can absorb and filter heavy metals. [[Water hyacinth]] (''Eichhornia crassipes''), [[duckweed]] (''Lemna'') and [[water fern]] (''Azolla'') store [[iron]] and [[copper]] commonly found in [[wastewater]]. Many fast-growing plants rooted in the soils of wetlands such as [[cattail]] (''Typha'') and [[Phragmites|reed]] (''Phragmites'') also aid in the role of heavy metal up-take. Animals such as the [[oyster]] can filter more than {{convert|200|L|gal}} of water per day while grazing for food, removing nutrients, suspended sediments, and chemical contaminants in the process. On the other hand, some types of wetlands facilitate the mobilization and bioavailability of mercury (another heavy metal), which in its [[Methylmercury|methyl mercury]] form increases the risk of bioaccumulation in fish important to animal food webs and harvested for human consumption.\n\n'''Capacity:''' The ability of wetland systems to store or remove nutrients and trap sediment and associated metals is highly efficient and effective but each system has a threshold. An overabundance of nutrient input from fertilizer run-off, sewage effluent, or non-point pollution will cause [[eutrophication]]. Upstream erosion from deforestation can overwhelm wetlands making them shrink in size and cause dramatic [[biodiversity loss]] through excessive sedimentation load. Retaining high levels of metals in sediments is problematic if the sediments become resuspended or oxygen and pH levels change at a future time. The capacity of wetland vegetation to store heavy metals depends on the particular metal, oxygen and pH status of wetland sediments and overlying water, water flow rate (detention time), wetland size, season, climate, type of plant, and other factors.\n\n'''Human impact''': The capacity of a wetland to store sediment, nutrients, and metals can be diminished if sediments are compacted such as by vehicles or heavy equipment, or are regularly tilled. Unnatural changes in water levels and water sources also can affect the water purification function. If water purification functions are impaired, excessive loads of nutrients enter waterways and cause [[eutrophication]]. This is of particular concern in temperate coastal systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Valiela|first1=I.|last2=Collins|first2=G.|last3=Kremer|first3=J.|last4=Lajtha|first4=K.|last5=Geist|first5=M.|last6=Seely|first6=B.|last7=Brawley|first7=J.|last8=Sham|first8=C.

Constructed wetlands can be used to treat raw sewage, storm water, agricultural and [[industrial effluent]].

Hundred of thousands of animal species, 20,000 of them vertebrates, are living in wetland systems. The discovery rate of fresh water fish is at 200 new species per year. The impact of maintaining biodiversity is seen at the local level through job creation, sustainability, and community productivity. A good example is the Lower Mekong basin which runs through Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Supporting over 55&nbsp;million people, the sustainability of the region is enhanced through wildlife tours. The U.S. state of Florida has estimated that US$1.6&nbsp;billion was generated in state revenue from recreational activities associated with wildlife.\n\n'''Biodiverse river basins:''' The Amazon holds 3,000 species of freshwater fish species within the boundaries of its basin, whose function it is to disperse the seeds of trees. One of its key species, the Piramutaba catfish, ''Brachyplatystoma vaillantii'', migrates more than {{convert|3300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from its nursery grounds near the mouth of the Amazon River to its spawning grounds in Andean tributaries, {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, distributing plants seed along the route.\n\n'''Productive intertidal zones:''' Intertidal mudflats have a level of productivity similar to that of some wetlands even while possessing a low number of species. The abundance of [[invertebrates]] found within the mud are a food source for [[migratory waterfowl]].\n\n'''Critical life-stage habitat:''' Mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds have high levels of both species richness and productivity, and are home to important nursery areas for many commercial fish stocks.\n\n'''Genetic diversity:''' Populations of many species are confined geographically to only one or a few wetland systems, often due to the long period of time that the wetlands have been physically isolated from other aquatic sources. For example, the number of [[endemic species]] in [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia classifies it as a hotspot for biodiversity and one of the most biodiverse wetlands in the entire world. Evidence from a research study by Mazepova ''et al.'' suggest that the number of [[crustacean]] species endemic to Baikal Lake (over 690 species and subspecies) exceeds the number of the same groups of animals inhabiting all the fresh water bodies of Eurasia together. Its 150 species of free-living [[Platyhelminthes]] alone is analogous to the entire number in all of Eastern Siberia. The 34 species and subspecies number of [[Baikal sculpins]] is more than twice the number of the analogous fauna that inhabits Eurasia. One of the most exciting discoveries was made by A.&nbsp;V. Shoshin who registered about 300 species of free-living [[nematodes]] using only six near-shore sampling localities in the Southern Baikal. \"If we will take into consideration, that about 60% of the animals can be found nowhere else except Baikal, it may be assumed that the lake may be the biodiversity center of the Eurasian continent.\"<ref name=\"Baikal\">{{cite book|editor-last=Timoshkin|editor-first=O.

Introduced hydrophytes in different wetland systems can have devastating results. The introduction of [[water hyacinth]], a native plant of South America into Lake Victoria in East Africa as well as [[duckweed]] into non-native areas of Queensland, Australia, have overtaken entire wetland systems suffocating the wetlands and reducing the diversity of other plants and animals. This is largely due to their phenomenal growth rate and ability to float and grow on the surface of the water.\n\n===Wetland products and productivity===\n\nWetland productivity is linked to the climate, wetland type, and nutrient availability.

Larger wetland systems can influence local precipitation patterns. Some boreal wetland systems in catchment headwaters may help extend the period of flow and maintain water temperature in connected downstream waters. Pollination services are supported by many wetlands which may provide the only suitable habitat for pollinating insects, birds, and mammals in highly developed areas. It is likely that wetlands have other functions whose benefits to society and other ecosystems have yet to be discovered.\n\n==Wetlands and climate change==\nWetlands perform two important functions in relation to climate change.

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) called for different sectors to join forces to secure wetland environments in the context of sustainable development and improving human wellbeing. A three-year project carried out by Wetlands International in partnership with the [[International Water Management Institute]] found that it is possible to conserve wetlands while improving the livelihoods of people living among them. Case studies conducted in Malawi and Zambia looked at how [[dambo]]s \u2013 wet, grassy valleys or depressions where water seeps to the surface \u2013 can be farmed sustainably to improve livelihoods. Mismanaged or overused dambos often become degraded, however, using a knowledge exchange between local farmers and environmental managers, a protocol was developed using soil and water management practices. Project outcomes included a high yield of crops, development of sustainable farming techniques, and adequate water management generating enough water for use as irrigation. Before the project, there were cases where people had died from starvation due to food shortages. By the end of it, many more people had access to enough water to grow vegetables. A key achievement was that villagers had secure food supplies during long, dry months. They also benefited in other ways: nutrition was improved by growing a wider range of crops, and villagers could also invest in health and education by selling produce and saving money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good practices and lessons learned in integrating ecosystem conservation and poverty reduction objectives in wetlands|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/wn/w.n.iwmi_poverty_report.pdf|publisher=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands|accessdate= 2011-11-19|date=2008-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Ramsar Convention===\n{{Main|Ramsar Convention|List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance}}\n''The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat'', or Ramsar Convention, is an international [[treaty]] designed to address global concerns regarding wetland loss and degradation. The primary purposes of the treaty are to list wetlands of international importance and to promote their wise use, with the ultimate goal of preserving the world's wetlands. Methods include restricting access to the majority portion of wetland areas, as well as educating the public to combat the misconception that wetlands are wastelands. The Convention works closely with five International Organisation Partners. These are: [[Birdlife International]], the [[IUCN]], the [[International Water Management Institute]], [[Wetlands International]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]. The partners provide technical expertise, help conduct or facilitate field studies and provide financial support. The IOPs also participate regularly as observers in all meetings of the Conference of the Parties and the Standing Committee and as full members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel.\n\n==Valuation==\n\nThe value of a wetland to local communities, as well as the value of wetland systems generally to the earth and to humankind, is one of the most important valuations that can be conducted for [[sustainable development]]. This typically involves first mapping a region's wetlands, then assessing the functions and ecosystem services the wetlands provide individually and cumulatively, and evaluating that information to prioritize or rank individual wetlands or wetland types for conservation, management, restoration, or development. Over a longer period, it requires keeping inventories of known wetlands and monitoring a representative sample of the wetlands to determine changes due to both natural and human factors. Such a valuation process is used to educate decision-makers such as governments of the importance of particular wetlands within their jurisdiction.\n\n===Assessment===\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2020}}\nRapid assessment methods are used to score, rank, rate, or categorize various functions, [[ecosystem services]], species, communities, levels of disturbance, and/or [[ecological health]] of a wetland or group of wetlands. This is often done to prioritize particular wetlands for conservation (avoidance) or to determine the degree to which loss or alteration of wetland functions should be compensated, such as by restoring degraded wetlands elsewhere or providing additional protections to existing wetlands. Rapid assessment methods are also applied before and after a wetland has been restored or altered, to help monitor or predict the effects of those actions on various wetland functions and the services they provide. Assessments are typically considered to be \"rapid\" when they require only a single visit to the wetland lasting less than one day, which in some cases may include interpretation of aerial imagery and [[geographic information system]] (GIS) analyses of existing spatial data, but not detailed post-visit laboratory analyses of water or biological samples. Due to time and cost constraints, the levels of various wetland functions or other attributes are usually not measured directly but rather are estimated relative to other assessed wetlands in a region, using observation-based variables, sometimes called \"indicators\", that are hypothesized or known to predict performance of the specified functions or attributes.\n\nTo achieve consistency among persons doing the assessment, rapid methods present indicator variables as questions or checklists on standardized data forms, and most methods standardize the scoring or rating procedure that is used to combine question responses into estimates of the levels of specified functions relative to the levels estimated in other wetlands (\"calibration sites\") assessed previously in a region.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://people.oregonstate.edu/~adamusp/WESP/Manual_WESP1.3_13Oct2016_Adamus.pdf |title=Manual for the Wetland Ecosystem Services Protocol (WESP)|last=Adamus|first=P. |date= 2016|website=Oregon State University|access-date=July 28, 2018}}</ref> Rapid assessment methods, partly because they often use dozens of indicators pertaining to conditions surrounding a wetland as well as within the wetland itself, aim to provide estimates of wetland functions and services that are more accurate and repeatable than simply describing a wetland's class type.<ref>{{Cite book |author= |chapter= |editor=Dorney, J. |editor2=Savage, R. |editor3=Tiner, R.W. |editor4=Adamus, P. |title=Wetland and Stream Rapid Assessments: Development, Validation, and Application |date=2018 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-12-805091-0}}</ref> A need for wetland assessments to be rapid arises mostly when government agencies set deadlines for decisions affecting a wetland, or when the number of wetlands needing information on their functions or condition is large.\n\nIn North America and a few other countries, standardized rapid assessment methods for wetlands have a long history, having been developed, calibrated, tested, and applied to varying degrees in several different regions and wetland types since the 1970s. However, few rapid assessment methods have been fully validated. Done correctly, validation is a very expensive endeavor that involves comparing rankings of a series of wetlands based on results from rapid assessment methods with rankings based on less rapid and considerably more costly, multi-visit, detailed measurements of levels of the same functions or other attributes in the same series of wetlands.\n\n===Inventory===\n\nAlthough developing a global inventory of wetlands has proven to be a large and difficult undertaking, many efforts at more local scales have been successful. Current efforts are based on available data, but both classification and spatial resolution have sometimes proven to be inadequate for regional or site-specific environmental management decision-making. It is difficult to identify small, long, and narrow wetlands within the landscape. Many of today's remote sensing satellites do not have sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to monitor wetland conditions, although multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data may offer improved spatial resolutions once it is 4&nbsp;m or higher. Majority of the pixels are just mixtures of several plant species or vegetation types and are difficult to isolate which translates into an inability to classify the vegetation that defines the wetland. Improved remote sensing information, coupled with good knowledge domain on wetlands will facilitate expanded efforts in wetland monitoring and mapping. This will also be extremely important because we expect to see major shifts in species composition due to both anthropogenic land use and natural changes in the environment caused by climate change.\n\n===Monitoring===\n\nA wetland needs to be monitored over time to assess whether it is functioning at an ecologically sustainable level or whether it is becoming degraded. Degraded wetlands will suffer a loss in water quality, loss of sensitive species, and aberrant functioning of soil geochemical processes.\n\n'''Mapping'''\n\nPractically, many natural wetlands are difficult to monitor from the ground as they quite often are difficult to access and may require exposure to dangerous plants and animals as well as diseases borne by insects or other invertebrates..Therefore, mapping using aerial imagery is one effective tool to monitor a wetland, especially a large wetland, and can also be used to monitor the status of numerous wetlands throughout a watershed or region. Many remote sensing methods can be used to map wetlands. Remote-sensing technology permits the acquisition of timely digital data on a repetitive basis. This repeat coverage allows wetlands, as well as the adjacent land-cover and land-use types, to be monitored seasonally and/or annually. Using digital data provides a standardized data-collection procedure and an opportunity for data integration within a [[geographic information system]]. Traditionally, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the SPOT 4 and 5 satellite systems have been used for this purpose. More recently, however, multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data, with spatial resolutions of {{convert|4|by|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.44|by|2.44|m|ft|abbr=on}}, respectively, have been shown to be excellent sources of data when mapping and monitoring smaller wetland habitats and vegetation communities.\n\nFor example, Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District assessed area wetlands in Michigan, USA, using remote sensing. Through using this technology, satellite images were taken over a large geographic area and extended period. In addition, using this technique was less costly and time-consuming compared to the older method using visual interpretation of [[aerial photographs]]. In comparison, most aerial photographs also require experienced interpreters to extract information based on structure and texture while the interpretation of remote sensing data only requires analysis of one characteristic (spectral).\n\nHowever, there are a number of limitations associated with this type of image acquisition. Analysis of wetlands has proved difficult because to obtain the data it is often linked to other purposes such as the analysis of land cover or land use.\n\n'''Further improvements'''\n\nMethods to develop a classification system for specific biota of interest could assist with technological advances that will allow for identification at a very high accuracy rate. The issue of the cost and expertise involved in remote sensing technology is still a factor hindering further advancements in image acquisition and data processing. Future improvements in current wetland vegetation mapping could include the use of more recent and better geospatial data when it is available.\n\n==Restoration==\nRestoration and [[Restoration ecology|restoration ecologists]] intend to return wetlands to their natural trajectory by aiding directly with the natural processes of the ecosystem.<ref name=clewell2013>{{cite book|last1=Clewell|first1=AF|last2=Aronson|first2=J|title=Ecological restoration|date=2013|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|edition=2nd}}</ref> These direct methods vary with respect to the degree of physical manipulation of the natural environment and each are associated with different levels of restoration.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Restoration is needed after disturbance or [[Disturbance (ecology)|perturbation]] of a wetland.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Disturbances include [[Exogeny|exogenous]] factors such as flooding or drought.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Other external damage may be [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbance caused by clear-cut harvesting of trees, oil and gas extraction, poorly defined infrastructure installation, over grazing of livestock, ill-considered recreational activities, alteration of wetlands including dredging, draining, and filling, and other negative human impacts.<ref name=clewell2013 /><ref name=\"mitsch2007\" /> Disturbance puts different levels of stress on an environment depending on the type and duration of disturbance.<ref name=clewell2013 /> There is no one way to restore a wetland and the level of restoration required will be based on the level of disturbance although, each method of restoration does require preparation and administration.<ref name=clewell2013 />\n\n===Levels of restoration===\n;Factors influencing selected approach may include<ref name=clewell2013 />\n*Budget\n*Time scale limitations\n*Project goals\n*Level of disturbance\n*Landscape and ecological constraints\n*Political and administrative agendas\n*Socioeconomic priorities\n\n# '''Prescribed natural regeneration'''\n#: There are no biophysical manipulation and the ecosystem is left to recover based on the process of [[Ecological succession|succession]] alone.<ref name=clewell2013 /> The focus of this method is to eliminate and prevent further disturbance from occurring.<ref name=clewell2013 /> In order for this type of restoration to be effective and successful there must be prior research done to understand the probability that the wetland will recover with this method.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Otherwise, some biophysical manipulation may be required to enhance the rate of succession to an acceptable level determined by the project managers and ecologists.<ref name=clewell2013 /> This is likely to be the first method of approach for the lowest level of disturbance being that it is the least intrusive and least costly.<ref name=clewell2013 /> \n# '''Assisted natural regeneration'''\n#: There are some biophysical manipulations however they are non-intrusive.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Example methods that are not limited to wetlands include prescribed burns to small areas, promotion of site specific soil [[microbiota]] and plant growth using nucleation planting whereby plants radiate from an initial planting site,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Corbin|first1=JD|last2=Holl|first2=KD|title=Applied nucleation as a forest restoration strategy|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2012|volume=256|pages=37\u201346|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2011.10.013}}</ref> and promotion of niche diversity or increasing the range of niches to promote use by a variety of different species.<ref name=clewell2013 /> These methods can make it easier for the natural species to flourish by removing competition from their environment and can speed up the process of succession.<ref name=clewell2013 />\n# '''Partial reconstruction'''\n#: Here there is a mix between natural regeneration and manipulated environmental control.<ref name=clewell2013 /> These manipulations may require some engineering and more invasive biophysical manipulation including ripping of [[subsoil]], [[Agrochemical|agrichemical]] applications such as herbicides and insecticides, laying of mulch, mechanical seed dispersal, and tree planting on a large scale.<ref name=clewell2013 /> In these circumstances the wetland is impaired and without human assistance it would not recover within an acceptable period of time determined by ecologists.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Again these methods of restoration will have to be considered on a site by site basis as each site will require a different approach based on levels of disturbance and ecosystem dynamics.<ref name=clewell2013 />\n# '''Complete reconstruction'''\n#: The most expensive and intrusive method of reconstruction requiring engineering and ground up reconstruction.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Because there is a redesign of the entire ecosystem it is important that the natural trajectory of the ecosystem be considered and that the plant species will eventually return the ecosystem towards its natural trajectory.<ref name=clewell2013 />\n\n=== Important considerations ===\n\n* Constructed wetlands can take 10\u2013100 years to fully resemble the vegetative composition of a natural wetland.\n* Artificial wetlands do not have hydric soil. The soil has very low levels of organic carbon and total nitrogen compared to natural wetland systems, and this reduces the performance of several functions.\n* Organic matter added to degraded natural wetlands can in some cases help restore their productivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=T.

In the United States, wetlands are defined as \"those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.

It is not uncommon for a wetland to be dry for long portions of the growing season. Wetlands can be dry during the dry season and abnormally dry periods during the wet season, but under normal environmental conditions the soils in a wetland will be saturated to the surface or inundated such that the soils become anaerobic, and those conditions will persist through the wet portion of the growing season.<ref>US Government Publishing Office.

Based on hydrology, wetlands can be categorized as [[riverine]] (associated with streams), [[wikt:lacustrine|lacustrine]] (associated with lakes and reservoirs), and [[palustrine]] (isolated). Sources of hydrological flows into wetlands are predominantly [[precipitation]], surface water, and [[groundwater]]. Water flows out of wetlands by [[evapotranspiration]], [[surface runoff]], and subsurface water outflow. [[Hydrodynamics]] (the movement of water through and from a wetland) affects hydro-periods (temporal fluctuations in water levels) by controlling the water balance and water storage within a wetland.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=J.

[[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] and [[Ramsar Convention]] described wetlands as a whole to be of [[biosphere]] significance and societal importance in the following areas, for example:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n*[[Flood control|Water storage (flood control)]]\n*Groundwater replenishment\n*Shoreline stabilisation and storm protection\n*[[Water purification]]\n*Reservoirs of [[biodiversity]]\n*Pollination\n*Wetland products\n*Cultural values\n*Recreation and [[Eco tourism|tourism]]\n*[[Climate change mitigation]] and adaptation\n\nAccording to the Ramsar Convention:\n\n<blockquote>The economic worth of the ecosystem services provided to society by intact, naturally functioning wetlands is frequently much greater than the perceived benefits of converting them to 'more valuable' intensive land use \u2013 particularly as the profits from unsustainable use often go to relatively few individuals or corporations, rather than being shared by society as a whole.</blockquote>\n\n''Unless otherwise cited, ecosystem services information is based on the following series of references.''<ref name=\"ramsar_a\"/>\n\nTo replace these wetland [[ecosystem services]], enormous amounts of money would need to be spent on [[water purification]] plants, dams, levees, and other hard infrastructure, and many of the services are impossible to replace.\n\n=== Water storage (flood control) ===\n''Major wetland type: floodplain and closed-depression wetlands''\n\n'''Storage reservoirs and flood protection:''' The wetland system of [[floodplains]] is formed from major rivers downstream from their [[headwaters]]. \"The floodplains of major rivers act as natural storage reservoirs, enabling excess water to spread out over a wide area, which reduces its depth and speed. Wetlands close to the headwaters of streams and rivers can slow down rainwater runoff and spring snowmelt so that it doesn't run straight off the land into water courses. This can help prevent sudden, damaging floods downstream.\"<ref name=\"ramsar_a\" /> Notable river systems that produce large spans of floodplain include the [[Nile River]], the Niger river inland delta, the Zambezi River flood plain, the Okavango River inland delta, the Kafue River flood plain, the Lake Bangweulu flood plain (Africa), [[Mississippi River]] (USA), [[Amazon River]] (South America), [[Yangtze River]] (China), [[Danube River]] (Central Europe) and [[Murray-Darling]] River (Australia).\n\n'''Human impact:''' Converting wetlands to upland through drainage and development forces adjoining or downstream water channels into narrower corridors. This accelerates watershed hydrologic response to storm events and this increases the need in some cases for alternative means of flood control. That is because the newly formed channels must manage the same amount of precipitation, causing flood peaks to be [higher or deeper] and floodwaters to travel faster.\n\nWater management engineering developments in the past century have degraded these wetlands through the construction of artificial embankments. These constructions may be classified as [[Levee|dykes]], bunds, [[levees]], [[weirs]], barrages and [[dams]] but serve the single purpose of concentrating water into a select source or area. Wetland water sources that were once spread slowly over a large, shallow area are pooled into deep, concentrated locations. Loss of wetland floodplains results in more severe and damaging flooding. Catastrophic human impact in the Mississippi River floodplains was seen in death of several hundred individuals during a [[levee breach]] in New Orleans caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Ecological catastrophic events from human-made embankments have been noticed along the Yangtze River floodplains since the middle of the river has become prone to more frequent and damaging flooding. Some of these events include the loss of [[riparian vegetation]], a 30% loss of the vegetation cover throughout the river's basin, a doubling of the percentage of the land affected by soil erosion, and a reduction in reservoir capacity through [[siltation]] build-up in floodplain lakes.<ref name=\"ramsar_a\"/>\n\n===Groundwater replenishment===\n''Major wetland type: [[marsh]], [[swamp]], and subterranean [[karst]] and cave hydrological systems''\n\nThe [[surface water]] which is the water visibly seen in wetland systems only represents a portion of the overall water cycle which also includes [[atmospheric water]] and [[groundwater]]. Wetland systems are directly linked to groundwater and a crucial regulator of both the quantity and [[water quality|quality of water]] found below the ground. Wetland systems that are made of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] [[sediment]]s like [[limestone]] or occur in areas with highly variable and fluctuating water tables especially have a role in [[groundwater replenishment]] or [[water recharge]]. Sediments that are [[porous]] allow water to filter down through the soil and overlying rock into [[aquifers]] which are the source of 95% of the world's drinking water. Wetlands can also act as recharge areas when the surrounding water table is low and as a discharge zone when it is too high. [[Karst cave|Karst]] (cave) systems are a unique example of this system and are a connection of underground rivers influenced by rain and other forms of [[precipitation]]. These wetland systems are capable of regulating changes in the water table on upwards of {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n'''Human impact''': Groundwater is an important source of water for [[drinking water|drinking]] and [[irrigation]] of crops. Over 1&nbsp;billion people in Asia and 65% of the public water sources in Europe source 100% of their water from groundwater. Irrigation is a massive use of groundwater with 80% of the world's groundwater used for agricultural production.<ref name=\"ramsar_a\"/>\n\nUnsustainable abstraction of groundwater has become a major concern. In the Commonwealth of [[Australia]], water licensing is being implemented to control use of water in major agricultural regions. On a global scale, groundwater deficits and water scarcity is one of the most pressing concerns facing the 21st century.<ref name=\"ramsar_a\"/>\n\n===Shoreline stabilization and storm protection===\n''Wetland type: [[Mangrove]]s, [[coral reef]]s, [[salt marsh]]''\n\n{{Main|Integrated coastal zone management}}\n\nTidal and inter-tidal wetland systems protect and stabilize coastal zones. [[Coral reefs]] provide a protective barrier to coastal shoreline. [[Mangrove]]s stabilize the coastal zone from the interior and will migrate with the shoreline to remain adjacent to the boundary of the water. The main conservation benefit these systems have against storms and [[storm surge]]s is the ability to reduce the speed and height of waves and floodwaters.\n\n'''Human impact''': The sheer number of people who live and work near the coast is expected to grow immensely over the next fifty years. From an estimated 200&nbsp;million people that currently live in low-lying coastal regions, the development of urban coastal centers is projected to increase the population by fivefold within 50 years.<ref name=\"urlUNEP-Home\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.unep.org\n|title=United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \u2013 Home page\n|accessdate=2011-12-11\n}}</ref>\nThe United Kingdom has begun the concept of managed coastal realignment. This management technique provides shoreline protection through restoration of natural wetlands rather than through applied engineering. In East Asia, reclamation of coastal wetlands has resulted in widespread transformation of the coastal zone, and up to 65% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed by coastal development.<ref>{{ Citation | first1 = J. | last1 = MacKinnon | first2 = Y.

A natural function of wetland vegetation is the up-take, storage, and (for nitrate) the removal of nutrients found in [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from the surrounding soil and water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|title=Letting Nature Do the Job|date=2008-08-01|website=Wild.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113192135/http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|archive-date=2013-01-13|url-status=dead|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> In many wetlands, nutrients are retained until plants die or are harvested by animals or humans and taken to another location, or until microbial processes convert soluble nutrients to a gas as is the case with nitrate.\n\n'''Sediment and heavy metal traps:''' Precipitation and surface runoff induces [[soil erosion]], transporting sediment in suspension into and through waterways. These sediments move towards larger and more sizable waterways through a natural process that moves water towards oceans. All types of sediments which may be composed of clay, sand, silt, and rock can be carried into wetland systems through this process. Wetland vegetation acts as a physical barrier to slow water flow and trap sediment for short or long periods of time. Suspended sediment often contains heavy metals that are retained when wetlands trap the sediment. In some cases, certain metals are taken up through wetland plant stems, roots, and leaves. Many floating plant species, for example, can absorb and filter heavy metals. [[Water hyacinth]] (''Eichhornia crassipes''), [[duckweed]] (''Lemna'') and [[water fern]] (''Azolla'') store [[iron]] and [[copper]] commonly found in [[wastewater]]. Many fast-growing plants rooted in the soils of wetlands such as [[cattail]] (''Typha'') and [[Phragmites|reed]] (''Phragmites'') also aid in the role of heavy metal up-take. Animals such as the [[oyster]] can filter more than {{convert|200|L|gal}} of water per day while grazing for food, removing nutrients, suspended sediments, and chemical contaminants in the process. On the other hand, some types of wetlands facilitate the mobilization and bioavailability of mercury (another heavy metal), which in its [[Methylmercury|methyl mercury]] form increases the risk of bioaccumulation in fish important to animal food webs and harvested for human consumption.\n\n'''Capacity:''' The ability of wetland systems to store or remove nutrients and trap sediment and associated metals is highly efficient and effective but each system has a threshold. An overabundance of nutrient input from fertilizer run-off, sewage effluent, or non-point pollution will cause [[eutrophication]]. Upstream erosion from deforestation can overwhelm wetlands making them shrink in size and cause dramatic [[biodiversity loss]] through excessive sedimentation load. Retaining high levels of metals in sediments is problematic if the sediments become resuspended or oxygen and pH levels change at a future time. The capacity of wetland vegetation to store heavy metals depends on the particular metal, oxygen and pH status of wetland sediments and overlying water, water flow rate (detention time), wetland size, season, climate, type of plant, and other factors.\n\n'''Human impact''': The capacity of a wetland to store sediment, nutrients, and metals can be diminished if sediments are compacted such as by vehicles or heavy equipment, or are regularly tilled. Unnatural changes in water levels and water sources also can affect the water purification function. If water purification functions are impaired, excessive loads of nutrients enter waterways and cause [[eutrophication]]. This is of particular concern in temperate coastal systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Valiela|first1=I.|last2=Collins|first2=G.|last3=Kremer|first3=J.|last4=Lajtha|first4=K.|last5=Geist|first5=M.|last6=Seely|first6=B.|last7=Brawley|first7=J.|last8=Sham|first8=C.

Constructed wetlands can be used to treat raw sewage, storm water, agricultural and [[industrial effluent]].

Hundred of thousands of animal species, 20,000 of them vertebrates, are living in wetland systems. The discovery rate of fresh water fish is at 200 new species per year. The impact of maintaining biodiversity is seen at the local level through job creation, sustainability, and community productivity. A good example is the Lower Mekong basin which runs through Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Supporting over 55&nbsp;million people, the sustainability of the region is enhanced through wildlife tours. The U.S. state of Florida has estimated that US$1.6&nbsp;billion was generated in state revenue from recreational activities associated with wildlife.\n\n'''Biodiverse river basins:''' The Amazon holds 3,000 species of freshwater fish species within the boundaries of its basin, whose function it is to disperse the seeds of trees. One of its key species, the Piramutaba catfish, ''Brachyplatystoma vaillantii'', migrates more than {{convert|3300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from its nursery grounds near the mouth of the Amazon River to its spawning grounds in Andean tributaries, {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, distributing plants seed along the route.\n\n'''Productive intertidal zones:''' Intertidal mudflats have a level of productivity similar to that of some wetlands even while possessing a low number of species. The abundance of [[invertebrates]] found within the mud are a food source for [[migratory waterfowl]].\n\n'''Critical life-stage habitat:''' Mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds have high levels of both species richness and productivity, and are home to important nursery areas for many commercial fish stocks.\n\n'''Genetic diversity:''' Populations of many species are confined geographically to only one or a few wetland systems, often due to the long period of time that the wetlands have been physically isolated from other aquatic sources. For example, the number of [[endemic species]] in [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia classifies it as a hotspot for biodiversity and one of the most biodiverse wetlands in the entire world. Evidence from a research study by Mazepova ''et al.'' suggest that the number of [[crustacean]] species endemic to Baikal Lake (over 690 species and subspecies) exceeds the number of the same groups of animals inhabiting all the fresh water bodies of Eurasia together. Its 150 species of free-living [[Platyhelminthes]] alone is analogous to the entire number in all of Eastern Siberia. The 34 species and subspecies number of [[Baikal sculpins]] is more than twice the number of the analogous fauna that inhabits Eurasia. One of the most exciting discoveries was made by A.&nbsp;V. Shoshin who registered about 300 species of free-living [[nematodes]] using only six near-shore sampling localities in the Southern Baikal. \"If we will take into consideration, that about 60% of the animals can be found nowhere else except Baikal, it may be assumed that the lake may be the biodiversity center of the Eurasian continent.\"<ref name=\"Baikal\">{{cite book|editor-last=Timoshkin|editor-first=O.

Introduced hydrophytes in different wetland systems can have devastating results. The introduction of [[water hyacinth]], a native plant of South America into Lake Victoria in East Africa as well as [[duckweed]] into non-native areas of Queensland, Australia, have overtaken entire wetland systems suffocating the wetlands and reducing the diversity of other plants and animals. This is largely due to their phenomenal growth rate and ability to float and grow on the surface of the water.\n\n===Wetland products and productivity===\n\nWetland productivity is linked to the climate, wetland type, and nutrient availability.

Larger wetland systems can influence local precipitation patterns. Some boreal wetland systems in catchment headwaters may help extend the period of flow and maintain water temperature in connected downstream waters. Pollination services are supported by many wetlands which may provide the only suitable habitat for pollinating insects, birds, and mammals in highly developed areas. It is likely that wetlands have other functions whose benefits to society and other ecosystems have yet to be discovered.\n\n==Wetlands and climate change==\nWetlands perform two important functions in relation to climate change.

It decomposes and turns into [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), which is released into the atmosphere.

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) called for different sectors to join forces to secure wetland environments in the context of sustainable development and improving human wellbeing. A three-year project carried out by Wetlands International in partnership with the [[International Water Management Institute]] found that it is possible to conserve wetlands while improving the livelihoods of people living among them. Case studies conducted in Malawi and Zambia looked at how [[dambo]]s \u2013 wet, grassy valleys or depressions where water seeps to the surface \u2013 can be farmed sustainably to improve livelihoods. Mismanaged or overused dambos often become degraded, however, using a knowledge exchange between local farmers and environmental managers, a protocol was developed using soil and water management practices. Project outcomes included a high yield of crops, development of sustainable farming techniques, and adequate water management generating enough water for use as irrigation. Before the project, there were cases where people had died from starvation due to food shortages. By the end of it, many more people had access to enough water to grow vegetables. A key achievement was that villagers had secure food supplies during long, dry months. They also benefited in other ways: nutrition was improved by growing a wider range of crops, and villagers could also invest in health and education by selling produce and saving money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good practices and lessons learned in integrating ecosystem conservation and poverty reduction objectives in wetlands|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/wn/w.n.iwmi_poverty_report.pdf|publisher=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands|accessdate= 2011-11-19|date=2008-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Ramsar Convention===\n{{Main|Ramsar Convention|List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance}}\n''The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat'', or Ramsar Convention, is an international [[treaty]] designed to address global concerns regarding wetland loss and degradation. The primary purposes of the treaty are to list wetlands of international importance and to promote their wise use, with the ultimate goal of preserving the world's wetlands. Methods include restricting access to the majority portion of wetland areas, as well as educating the public to combat the misconception that wetlands are wastelands. The Convention works closely with five International Organisation Partners. These are: [[Birdlife International]], the [[IUCN]], the [[International Water Management Institute]], [[Wetlands International]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]. The partners provide technical expertise, help conduct or facilitate field studies and provide financial support. The IOPs also participate regularly as observers in all meetings of the Conference of the Parties and the Standing Committee and as full members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel.\n\n==Valuation==\n\nThe value of a wetland to local communities, as well as the value of wetland systems generally to the earth and to humankind, is one of the most important valuations that can be conducted for [[sustainable development]]. This typically involves first mapping a region's wetlands, then assessing the functions and ecosystem services the wetlands provide individually and cumulatively, and evaluating that information to prioritize or rank individual wetlands or wetland types for conservation, management, restoration, or development. Over a longer period, it requires keeping inventories of known wetlands and monitoring a representative sample of the wetlands to determine changes due to both natural and human factors. Such a valuation process is used to educate decision-makers such as governments of the importance of particular wetlands within their jurisdiction.\n\n===Assessment===\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2020}}\nRapid assessment methods are used to score, rank, rate, or categorize various functions, [[ecosystem services]], species, communities, levels of disturbance, and/or [[ecological health]] of a wetland or group of wetlands. This is often done to prioritize particular wetlands for conservation (avoidance) or to determine the degree to which loss or alteration of wetland functions should be compensated, such as by restoring degraded wetlands elsewhere or providing additional protections to existing wetlands. Rapid assessment methods are also applied before and after a wetland has been restored or altered, to help monitor or predict the effects of those actions on various wetland functions and the services they provide. Assessments are typically considered to be \"rapid\" when they require only a single visit to the wetland lasting less than one day, which in some cases may include interpretation of aerial imagery and [[geographic information system]] (GIS) analyses of existing spatial data, but not detailed post-visit laboratory analyses of water or biological samples. Due to time and cost constraints, the levels of various wetland functions or other attributes are usually not measured directly but rather are estimated relative to other assessed wetlands in a region, using observation-based variables, sometimes called \"indicators\", that are hypothesized or known to predict performance of the specified functions or attributes.\n\nTo achieve consistency among persons doing the assessment, rapid methods present indicator variables as questions or checklists on standardized data forms, and most methods standardize the scoring or rating procedure that is used to combine question responses into estimates of the levels of specified functions relative to the levels estimated in other wetlands (\"calibration sites\") assessed previously in a region.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://people.oregonstate.edu/~adamusp/WESP/Manual_WESP1.3_13Oct2016_Adamus.pdf |title=Manual for the Wetland Ecosystem Services Protocol (WESP)|last=Adamus|first=P. |date= 2016|website=Oregon State University|access-date=July 28, 2018}}</ref> Rapid assessment methods, partly because they often use dozens of indicators pertaining to conditions surrounding a wetland as well as within the wetland itself, aim to provide estimates of wetland functions and services that are more accurate and repeatable than simply describing a wetland's class type.<ref>{{Cite book |author= |chapter= |editor=Dorney, J. |editor2=Savage, R. |editor3=Tiner, R.W. |editor4=Adamus, P. |title=Wetland and Stream Rapid Assessments: Development, Validation, and Application |date=2018 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-12-805091-0}}</ref> A need for wetland assessments to be rapid arises mostly when government agencies set deadlines for decisions affecting a wetland, or when the number of wetlands needing information on their functions or condition is large.\n\nIn North America and a few other countries, standardized rapid assessment methods for wetlands have a long history, having been developed, calibrated, tested, and applied to varying degrees in several different regions and wetland types since the 1970s. However, few rapid assessment methods have been fully validated. Done correctly, validation is a very expensive endeavor that involves comparing rankings of a series of wetlands based on results from rapid assessment methods with rankings based on less rapid and considerably more costly, multi-visit, detailed measurements of levels of the same functions or other attributes in the same series of wetlands.\n\n===Inventory===\n\nAlthough developing a global inventory of wetlands has proven to be a large and difficult undertaking, many efforts at more local scales have been successful. Current efforts are based on available data, but both classification and spatial resolution have sometimes proven to be inadequate for regional or site-specific environmental management decision-making. It is difficult to identify small, long, and narrow wetlands within the landscape. Many of today's remote sensing satellites do not have sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to monitor wetland conditions, although multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data may offer improved spatial resolutions once it is 4&nbsp;m or higher. Majority of the pixels are just mixtures of several plant species or vegetation types and are difficult to isolate which translates into an inability to classify the vegetation that defines the wetland. Improved remote sensing information, coupled with good knowledge domain on wetlands will facilitate expanded efforts in wetland monitoring and mapping. This will also be extremely important because we expect to see major shifts in species composition due to both anthropogenic land use and natural changes in the environment caused by climate change.\n\n===Monitoring===\n\nA wetland needs to be monitored over time to assess whether it is functioning at an ecologically sustainable level or whether it is becoming degraded. Degraded wetlands will suffer a loss in water quality, loss of sensitive species, and aberrant functioning of soil geochemical processes.\n\n'''Mapping'''\n\nPractically, many natural wetlands are difficult to monitor from the ground as they quite often are difficult to access and may require exposure to dangerous plants and animals as well as diseases borne by insects or other invertebrates..Therefore, mapping using aerial imagery is one effective tool to monitor a wetland, especially a large wetland, and can also be used to monitor the status of numerous wetlands throughout a watershed or region. Many remote sensing methods can be used to map wetlands. Remote-sensing technology permits the acquisition of timely digital data on a repetitive basis. This repeat coverage allows wetlands, as well as the adjacent land-cover and land-use types, to be monitored seasonally and/or annually. Using digital data provides a standardized data-collection procedure and an opportunity for data integration within a [[geographic information system]]. Traditionally, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the SPOT 4 and 5 satellite systems have been used for this purpose. More recently, however, multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data, with spatial resolutions of {{convert|4|by|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.44|by|2.44|m|ft|abbr=on}}, respectively, have been shown to be excellent sources of data when mapping and monitoring smaller wetland habitats and vegetation communities.\n\nFor example, Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District assessed area wetlands in Michigan, USA, using remote sensing. Through using this technology, satellite images were taken over a large geographic area and extended period. In addition, using this technique was less costly and time-consuming compared to the older method using visual interpretation of [[aerial photographs]]. In comparison, most aerial photographs also require experienced interpreters to extract information based on structure and texture while the interpretation of remote sensing data only requires analysis of one characteristic (spectral).\n\nHowever, there are a number of limitations associated with this type of image acquisition. Analysis of wetlands has proved difficult because to obtain the data it is often linked to other purposes such as the analysis of land cover or land use.\n\n'''Further improvements'''\n\nMethods to develop a classification system for specific biota of interest could assist with technological advances that will allow for identification at a very high accuracy rate. The issue of the cost and expertise involved in remote sensing technology is still a factor hindering further advancements in image acquisition and data processing. Future improvements in current wetland vegetation mapping could include the use of more recent and better geospatial data when it is available.\n\n==Restoration==\nRestoration and [[Restoration ecology|restoration ecologists]] intend to return wetlands to their natural trajectory by aiding directly with the natural processes of the ecosystem.<ref name=clewell2013>{{cite book|last1=Clewell|first1=AF|last2=Aronson|first2=J|title=Ecological restoration|date=2013|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|edition=2nd}}</ref> These direct methods vary with respect to the degree of physical manipulation of the natural environment and each are associated with different levels of restoration.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Restoration is needed after disturbance or [[Disturbance (ecology)|perturbation]] of a wetland.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Disturbances include [[Exogeny|exogenous]] factors such as flooding or drought.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Other external damage may be [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbance caused by clear-cut harvesting of trees, oil and gas extraction, poorly defined infrastructure installation, over grazing of livestock, ill-considered recreational activities, alteration of wetlands including dredging, draining, and filling, and other negative human impacts.<ref name=clewell2013 /><ref name=\"mitsch2007\" /> Disturbance puts different levels of stress on an environment depending on the type and duration of disturbance.<ref name=clewell2013 /> There is no one way to restore a wetland and the level of restoration required will be based on the level of disturbance although, each method of restoration does require preparation and administration.<ref name=clewell2013 />\n\n===Levels of restoration===\n;Factors influencing selected approach may include<ref name=clewell2013 />\n*Budget\n*Time scale limitations\n*Project goals\n*Level of disturbance\n*Landscape and ecological constraints\n*Political and administrative agendas\n*Socioeconomic priorities\n\n# '''Prescribed natural regeneration'''\n#: There are no biophysical manipulation and the ecosystem is left to recover based on the process of [[Ecological succession|succession]] alone.<ref name=clewell2013 /> The focus of this method is to eliminate and prevent further disturbance from occurring.<ref name=clewell2013 /> In order for this type of restoration to be effective and successful there must be prior research done to understand the probability that the wetland will recover with this method.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Otherwise, some biophysical manipulation may be required to enhance the rate of succession to an acceptable level determined by the project managers and ecologists.<ref name=clewell2013 /> This is likely to be the first method of approach for the lowest level of disturbance being that it is the least intrusive and least costly.<ref name=clewell2013 /> \n# '''Assisted natural regeneration'''\n#: There are some biophysical manipulations however they are non-intrusive.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Example methods that are not limited to wetlands include prescribed burns to small areas, promotion of site specific soil [[microbiota]] and plant growth using nucleation planting whereby plants radiate from an initial planting site,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Corbin|first1=JD|last2=Holl|first2=KD|title=Applied nucleation as a forest restoration strategy|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2012|volume=256|pages=37\u201346|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2011.10.013}}</ref> and promotion of niche diversity or increasing the range of niches to promote use by a variety of different species.<ref name=clewell2013 /> These methods can make it easier for the natural species to flourish by removing competition from their environment and can speed up the process of succession.<ref name=clewell2013 />\n# '''Partial reconstruction'''\n#: Here there is a mix between natural regeneration and manipulated environmental control.<ref name=clewell2013 /> These manipulations may require some engineering and more invasive biophysical manipulation including ripping of [[subsoil]], [[Agrochemical|agrichemical]] applications such as herbicides and insecticides, laying of mulch, mechanical seed dispersal, and tree planting on a large scale.<ref name=clewell2013 /> In these circumstances the wetland is impaired and without human assistance it would not recover within an acceptable period of time determined by ecologists.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Again these methods of restoration will have to be considered on a site by site basis as each site will require a different approach based on levels of disturbance and ecosystem dynamics.<ref name=clewell2013 />\n# '''Complete reconstruction'''\n#: The most expensive and intrusive method of reconstruction requiring engineering and ground up reconstruction.<ref name=clewell2013 /> Because there is a redesign of the entire ecosystem it is important that the natural trajectory of the ecosystem be considered and that the plant species will eventually return the ecosystem towards its natural trajectory.<ref name=clewell2013 />\n\n=== Important considerations ===\n\n* Constructed wetlands can take 10\u2013100 years to fully resemble the vegetative composition of a natural wetland.\n* Artificial wetlands do not have hydric soil. The soil has very low levels of organic carbon and total nitrogen compared to natural wetland systems, and this reduces the performance of several functions.\n* Organic matter added to degraded natural wetlands can in some cases help restore their productivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=T.

The name altered after King [[Henry V of England]] had lived there as a young child of eight, following the death of his mother [[Mary de Bohun]], under the care of Lady Margaret Montacute, wife of Sir [[John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]], long before his father, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]], usurped the throne of [[King Richard II]]. An [[effigy]] of Lady Margaret Montacute can be seen in Welsh Bicknor church and her plain tomb is beside the altar in [[Goodrich, Herefordshire|Goodrich]] church.\n\nAs its name suggests, Welsh Bicknor has close ties with Wales, having been a detached parish of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], although adjacent to [[English Bicknor]] and [[Lydbrook]], which are part of [[Gloucestershire]]. The manor house and surrounding land of Welsh Bicknor belonged to the Vaughan family. However, in 1651 Richard Vaughan, who was a Catholic, had his land [[Sequestration (law)|sequestered]] and given to Phillip Nicholas of [[Llansoy]], in Monmouthshire, leading to the unusual situation of the exclave. It has been deemed part of [[Herefordshire]] since the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]].\n\nReligious dissension within the Vaughan families continued for several generations. In 1715, a John Vaughan (presumably one of Richard's descendants) refused the oath of allegiance to [[George I of England|George I]]. He had estates in the several counties of Monmouthshire, [[Radnorshire]], Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire valued at \u00a31,000 per annum. In 1719 he was fined for not attending church.\n\nA later generation, in the person of Richard Vaughan, joined Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]]'s army in 1745. Vaughan took part in the [[Battle of Culloden]] and followed the Prince into exile. He and his brother William Vaughan were outlawed and their property seized, while they themselves fled to [[Spain]] and became officers in the army of that country. Both married Spanish women and some of their descendants settled in the home of their adoption and became grandees of Spain.\n\nRichard Vaughan died in [[Barcelona]] in 1795 but his son William eventually returned to Wales and obtained a restoration of the main portion of his estates, as heir to his uncle. Later, John Vaughan of Courtfield, elder brother of William, took the oath of allegiance to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] at [[Monmouth]] in 1778. Louisa Eliza Rolls, who married John Vaughan of Courtfield in 1830, prayed that her children might have vocations to priesthood or the religious life, and six of her sons became priests (including the later [[Cardinal Vaughan]]) and four of her daughters became nuns.<ref>A Mill Hill Father, ''Remembered in Blessing: The Courtfield Story'' Sands and Co., London 1955, 1969.</ref>\n\nWelsh Bicknor parish records are now held by Hereford Records Office.\n\nThere is a [[Youth Hostel]] at Welsh Bicknor, next to the church.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/yha-wye-valley |title=YHA Wye Valley |publisher=YHA |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref> The building had served as the [[rectory]] until it was leased to YHA in 1936.

The name altered after King [[Henry V of England]] had lived there as a young child of eight, following the death of his mother [[Mary de Bohun]], under the care of Lady Margaret Montacute, wife of Sir [[John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] long before his father, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]], was to usurp the throne of [[King Richard II]]. An [[effigy]] of Lady Margaret Montacute can be seen in Welsh Bicknor church and her plain tomb is beside the altar in [[Goodrich, Herefordshire|Goodrich]] church.\n\nAs its name suggests, Welsh Bicknor has close ties with Wales, having been a detached parish of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], although adjacent to [[English Bicknor]] and [[Lydbrook]], which are part of [[Gloucestershire]]. The manor house and surrounding land of Welsh Bicknor belonged to the Vaughan family. However, in 1651 Richard Vaughan, who was a Catholic, had his land [[Sequestration (law)|sequestered]] and given to Phillip Nicholas of [[Llansoy]], in Monmouthshire, leading to the unusual situation of the exclave. It has been deemed part of [[Herefordshire]] since the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]].\n\nReligious dissension within the Vaughan families continued for several generations. In 1715, a John Vaughan (presumably one of Richard's descendants) refused the oath of allegiance to [[George I of England|George I]]. He had estates in the several counties of Monmouthshire, [[Radnorshire]], Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire valued at \u00a31,000 per annum. In 1719 he was fined for not attending church.\n\nA later generation, in the person of Richard Vaughan, joined Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]]'s army in 1745. Vaughan took part in the [[Battle of Culloden]] and followed the Prince into exile. He and his brother William Vaughan were outlawed and their property seized, while they themselves fled to [[Spain]] and became officers in the army of that country. Both married Spanish women and some of their descendants settled in the home of their adoption and became grandees of Spain.\n\nRichard Vaughan died in [[Barcelona]] in 1795 but his son William eventually returned to Wales and obtained a restoration of the main portion of his estates, as heir to his uncle. Later, John Vaughan of Courtfield, elder brother of William, took the oath of allegiance to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] at [[Monmouth]] in 1778. Louisa Eliza Rolls, who married John Vaughan of Courtfield in 1830, prayed that her children might have vocations to priesthood or the religious life, and six of her sons became priests (including the later [[Cardinal Vaughan]]) and four of her daughters became nuns.<ref>A Mill Hill Father, ''Remembered in Blessing: The Courtfield Story'' Sands and Co., London 1955, 1969.</ref>\n\nWelsh Bicknor parish records are now held by Hereford Records Office.\n\nThere is a [[Youth Hostel]] at Welsh Bicknor, next to the church.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/yha-wye-valley |title=YHA Wye Valley |publisher=YHA |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref> The building had served as the [[rectory]] until it was leased to YHA in 1936.

These are now called French [[Serif#Old-style|old-style]], a style that remained popular for over 200 years and revived in the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|53}} He used rabbits, satyrs, and philosophers as his pressmark.[[File:Simon de Colines (1480-1546).jpg|thumb|Colines's satyr pressmark]]\n\n==Life==\nColines was born between 1480 and 1490, possibly south of Paris, where his siblings later owned farms.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|12}} He probably studied at the University of Paris and probably worked for the elder [[Henri Estienne]], and replaced Estienne as press director after his death in 1520. Colines married Estienne's widow, Guyonne Viart, and inherited charge of the press and her six children.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|13}} He continued working in Estienne's shop until [[Robert Estienne]] (Estienne's son) entered the business in 1526, by which time Colines had set up his own shop nearby at ''Soleil d'or'' and helped Robert become established as a printer without ties to the university.<ref name= \"Amert2005\"/> One scholar, Jeanne Veyrin-Forrer, believes Colines may have furnished French old-style typefaces to his step-son, Robert Estienne.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|57}} For the next 13 years Colines would cut most of his common print types: [[Roman type|romans]], [[Italic type|italics]], and his two best Greeks.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|15}} In 1528 he began to use italic type. Colines was recognized for using rabbits near a tree as part of his pressmark, but after moving to ''Soleil d'or'' he started using satyrs and philosophers as his pressmarks.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|17\u201319}}<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> In 1539, Colines left ''Soleil d'or'' and moved his presses outside Paris's wall, at the sign of the four evangelists,<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> where he stayed until his death in spring in 1546. Colines let his stepson-in-law, Chaudi\u00e8re take over his location at ''Soleil d'or'' and would send him projects either because Colines was ill or overloaded. Upon Colines's death it was Chaudi\u00e8re and not Robert who took over Colines' [[backlist]].<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|15}}\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Woodcut title-page border printed by Simon de Colines (5428439118).jpg|thumb|Woodcut title-page border printed by Colines]]\nColines may not have been a major contributor of technical innovations relating to [[typography]], but he certainly was an intellectual pioneer in his field. Many of the important written structural elements that we expect to find in books are components that he contributed: title page organization, chapter headings, page numbers, table of contents, bibliographies, etc. In his work for the University of Paris, Colines printed classics by Cicero, Virgil, Euclid, and others.<ref name=\"Amert2012\">{{cite book|last1=Amert|first1=Kay|title=The Scythe and the Rabbit: Simon de Colines and the Culture of the Book of Renaissance Paris|date=2012|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester, New York|isbn=978-1-933360-56-0}}</ref>{{rp|11, 52}} Although he was not a scholar himself, he extended the range of the Estienne firm's learned and scientific works to include the natural sciences, cosmology, and astrology. He is credited with the design of Italic and Greek fonts and of a Roman face for St. Augustine's ''Sylvius'' (1531), from which the [[Garamond]] types were derived.{{citation needed}} Compared to Henri Estienne's Romans, Colines spaced the letters more generally and altered some letters to be thinner.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|65}} In 1529\u20131531 and in 1536, Louis Blaubloom, also known as Cyanaeus, helped Colines print more editions of the many books Colines was printing. In 1537, Colines started to collaborate with his step-son Fran\u00e7ois Estienne in writing and printing schoolbooks. Starting in 1539, Colines was appointed as one of three officials who had to inspect paper before it was sold.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> Scholar Veyrin-Forrer estimates that during Colines's busiest times he had three presses and about 15 workers press workers and 10 foundry workers. <ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>{{rp|lxx}}\n\n===Textbooks===\n[[File:Woodcut; skeleton, side view, circa 1530-1545. Wellcome L0019614.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut from Estienne's ''De Dessectione'']]\nColines's editions of science books were illustrated with large woodcuts and included editions of [[Juan Mart\u00ednez Sil\u00edceo|Sil\u00edceo]] edited by Rhaetus, Sarzosa, and Fernel. He published versions of [[Galen]]'s medical texts translated into French. In 1528 Colines started using italics purposefully in his texts, starting with ''Saint Augustin'', and also started using a Greek typeface, starting with Cicero's ''De senuctute'' translated into Greek by [[Theodorus Gaza]]. When [[Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples]] became a tutor for the royal family, he commissioned Colines to print three Latin primers, which included accent marks to indicate long and short vowels, printed in black and red.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>  In 1528, Colines printed ''De literis syllabis et metris'' by [[Terentianus Maurus]], with commentary by Nicolas Briss\u00e9. For this book, Colines used a roman ''Gros Romain'' font which appears to be modeled after one of [[Aldus Manutius]]'s types from Venice. This was part of a greater trend of changing typography styles in France. Also around this time, a new italic typeface derived from the ''Gros Romain'' appears in Colines's 1532 printing of Paul of Aegina's ''Opus de re medica''.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> The typeface \"lacks the curves that terminated the ascenders of the earlier face, while conserving the graceful shape of the ligature ''et''.\"<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>{{rp|lvii}}\n\nIn 1536, Colines printed his most famous edition: Jean Ruel's ''De natura stirpium,'' which incorporated a unique garden woodcut on its title page. The same year, Colines printed ''Demonstrationes'' by [[Oronce Fin\u00e9]], which contained a border design reserved for Fine's works.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> Colines printed ''Praxis criminis persequendi'' by Jean Milles de Souvigny in 1541. Colines published ''De dissectione partium corporis humani libri tres'', an anatomy textbook 10 years in the making, in 1545. Charles Estienne wrote the text and his friend Etienne de la Rivi\u0117re, a barber-surgeon, illustrated much of it. The woodcuts were based on illustrations and drawings by Berengario, Perino del Vaga, and Mannerist models from the Fontainebleau School. The work was published in Latin and French, and was popular enough to be pirated in Germany. The French version of the anatomy textbook was Colines's last publication.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>\n\n[[File:O942 C682 10 p56.jpg|thumb|Illustration of an imaginary murder trial from ''Praxis criminis persequendi'' by Jean Milles de Souvigny and printed by Simon de Colines]] \n\n===Religious books and Parliament===\nIn addition to textbooks, Colines also published a few editions of scriptures and some devotional books. In 1522, Colines printed the four Gospels with commentary by Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples called ''Commentarii initiatorii in quatuor Evangelia''. The book was not submitted to the Parisian Faculty of Theology for approval as had been decreed the previous November, and the theologians fined Colines on June 9, 1523, and threatened to seize the remaining copies.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>{{rp|xlix}} Colines argued that the printing had started in Meaux before the decree, and the theologians consented to let him keep his remaining copies as long as he did not sell them. In 1545, after Lef\u00e8vre's death, Parliament censored ''Commentarii''. In 1524, Colines printed Lef\u00e8vre's French translations of both the New Testament and the Psalms; however, Colines also published anti-Lutheran pamphlets (''Antilutherus''), much to Robert Estienne's and Lef\u00e8vre's disapproval. Colines was careful to petition for approval from Parliament. In 1526, the theologians prohibited the sale and possession of French language scriptures.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\">{{cite book|last1=Veyrin-Forrer|first1=Jeanne|editor1-last=schreiber|editor1-first=Fred|title=Simon de Colines: An annotated catalog of 230 examples of his press, 1520\u20131546|date=1995|publisher=Friends of the Brigham Young University Library|location=Provo, Utah|pages=xlv-lxxxiv|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> \n\nIn 1525 and 1527 Colines published [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]] with decorations by [[Geoffroy Tory]]. Both books together are called the Tory Books of Hours.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|156; 70}} Colines also published Books of Hours in the 1540s.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|167}} Colines's miniature ''[[Vulgate]]'' was widely circulated and went through 50 editions.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|52}} In 1541 Colines revised a Latin Bible folio with diacritical marks which contained a geographical index by Robert Estienne in Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. The volume, over 800 pages long, was a difficult printing job and published by Galliot du Pr\u00e9 and Lyonese Antoine Vincent.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>\n\nColines published a few more anti-Lutheran books in 1526. Colines printed several works by [[Josse van Clichtove]], including Clichtove's refutation to [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] (1527) and Clichtove's commentary (1529) on the decrees of the [[Councils of Sens]] in 1528. Colines also printed a book of polemical essays by [[Johann Eck]] in 1526.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>\n\nColines published many books by [[Erasmus]], often for schools. After Erasmus's ''Colloquia'' was censured, two secretly printed editions (1528 and 1532) bore Colines's typeface called ''Mignonne''. When Colines printed a New Testament with commentary by Erasmus in a single volume (''Testamentum Nouum per Des. Erasmum recognitum'') in 1533, he used a typeface even smaller than the ''Mignonne''. In 1542, French Parliament decreed that all books entering Paris should be examined, in order to make sure they contained no \"Lutheran errors\". The decree also stipulated that all books should contain the name and address of their printer. In 1544, Parliament published a list of censored books, and anyone still owning the books after three days could be incarcerated. The list included four books Colines had published. Colines published few new works after this decree.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nColines's types were renowned among and often praised by authors and poets of the period including Hubert Sussaneau, Salmon Macrinus, [[Nicholas Bourbon (the younger)|Nicolas Bourbon]], and Jean Visagier.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|59}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''Simon de Colines: An Annotated Catalogue of 230 Examples of his Press, 1520\u20131546.''

These are now called French [[Serif#Old-style|old-style]], a style that remained popular for over 200 years and revived in the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|53}} He used rabbits, satyrs, and philosophers as his pressmark.[[File:Simon de Colines (1480-1546).jpg|thumb|Colines's satyr pressmark]]\n\n==Life==\nColines was born between 1480 and 1490, possibly south of Paris, where his siblings later owned farms.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|12}} He probably studied at the University of Paris and probably worked for the elder [[Henri Estienne]], and replaced Estienne as press director after his death in 1520. Colines married Estienne's widow, Guyonne Viart, and inherited charge of the press and her six children.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|13}} He continued working in Estienne's shop until [[Robert Estienne]] (Estienne's son) entered the business in 1526, by which time Colines had set up his own shop nearby at ''Soleil d'or'' and helped Robert become established as a printer without ties to the university.<ref name= \"Amert2005\"/> One scholar, Jeanne Veyrin-Forrer, believes Colines may have furnished French old-style typefaces to his step-son, Robert Estienne.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|57}} For the next 13 years Colines would cut most of his common print types: [[Roman type|romans]], [[Italic type|italics]], and his two best Greeks.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|15}} In 1528 he began to use italic type. Colines was recognized for using rabbits near a tree as part of his pressmark, but after moving to ''Soleil d'or'' he started using satyrs and philosophers as his pressmarks.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|17\u201319}}<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> In 1539, Colines left ''Soleil d'or'' and moved his presses outside Paris's wall, at the sign of the four evangelists,<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> where he stayed until his death in spring in 1546. Colines let his stepson-in-law, Chaudi\u00e8re take over his location at ''Soleil d'or'' and would send him projects either because Colines was ill or overloaded. Upon Colines's death it was Chaudi\u00e8re and not Robert who took over Colines' [[backlist]].<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|15}}\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Woodcut title-page border printed by Simon de Colines (5428439118).jpg|thumb|Woodcut title-page border printed by Colines]]\nColines may not have been a major contributor of technical innovations relating to [[typography]], but he certainly was an intellectual pioneer in his field. Many of the important written structural elements that we expect to find in books are components that he contributed: title page organization, chapter headings, page numbers, table of contents, bibliographies, etc. In his work for the University of Paris, Colines printed classics by Cicero, Virgil, Euclid, and others.<ref name=\"Amert2012\">{{cite book|last1=Amert|first1=Kay|title=The Scythe and the Rabbit: Simon de Colines and the Culture of the Book of Renaissance Paris|date=2012|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester, New York|isbn=978-1-933360-56-0}}</ref>{{rp|11, 52}} Although he was not a scholar himself, he extended the range of the Estienne firm's learned and scientific works to include the natural sciences, cosmology, and astrology. He is credited with the design of Italic and Greek fonts and of a Roman face for St. Augustine's ''Sylvius'' (1531), from which the [[Garamond]] types were derived.[Cite?] Compared to Henri Estienne's Romans, Colines spaced the letters more generally and altered some letters to be thinner.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|65}} In 1529\u20131531 and in 1536, Louis Blaubloom, also known as Cyanaeus, helped Colines print more editions of the many books Colines was printing. In 1537, Colines started to collaborate with his step-son Fran\u00e7ois Estienne in writing and printing schoolbooks. Starting in 1539, Colines was appointed as one of three officials who had to inspect paper before it was sold.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> Scholar Veyrin-Forrer estimates that during Colines's busiest times he had three presses and about 15 workers press workers and 10 foundry workers. <ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>{{rp|lxx}}\n\n===Textbooks===\n[[File:Woodcut; skeleton, side view, circa 1530-1545. Wellcome L0019614.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut from Estienne's ''De Dessectione'']]\nColines's editions of science books were illustrated with large woodcuts and included editions of [[Juan Mart\u00ednez Sil\u00edceo|Sil\u00edceo]] edited by Rhaetus, Sarzosa, and Fernel. He published versions of [[Galen]]'s medical texts translated into French. In 1528 Colines started using italics purposefully in his texts, starting with ''Saint Augustin'', and also started using a Greek typeface, starting with Cicero's ''De senuctute'' translated into Greek by [[Theodorus Gaza]]. When [[Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples]] became a tutor for the royal family, he commissioned Colines to print three Latin primers, which included accent marks to indicate long and short vowels, printed in black and red.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>  In 1528, Colines printed ''De literis syllabis et metris'' by [[Terentianus Maurus]], with commentary by Nicolas Briss\u00e9. For this book, Colines used a roman ''Gros Romain'' font which appears to be modeled after one of [[Aldus Manutius]]'s types from Venice. This was part of a greater trend of changing typography styles in France. Also around this time, a new italic typeface derived from the ''Gros Romain'' appears in Colines's 1532 printing of Paul of Aegina's ''Opus de re medica''.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> The typeface \"lacks the curves that terminated the ascenders of the earlier face, while conserving the graceful shape of the ligature ''et''.\"<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>{{rp|lvii}}\n\nIn 1536, Colines printed his most famous edition: Jean Ruel's ''De natura stirpium,'' which incorporated a unique garden woodcut on its title page. The same year, Colines printed ''Demonstrationes'' by [[Oronce Fin\u00e9]], which contained a border design reserved for Fine's works.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/> Colines printed ''Praxis criminis persequendi'' by Jean Milles de Souvigny in 1541. Colines published ''De dissectione partium corporis humani libri tres'', an anatomy textbook 10 years in the making, in 1545. Charles Estienne wrote the text and his friend Etienne de la Rivi\u0117re, a barber-surgeon, illustrated much of it. The woodcuts were based on illustrations and drawings by Berengario, Perino del Vaga, and Mannerist models from the Fontainebleau School. The work was published in Latin and French, and was popular enough to be pirated in Germany. The French version of the anatomy textbook was Colines's last publication.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>\n\n[[File:O942 C682 10 p56.jpg|thumb|Illustration of an imaginary murder trial from ''Praxis criminis persequendi'' by Jean Milles de Souvigny and printed by Simon de Colines]] \n\n===Religious books and Parliament===\nIn addition to textbooks, Colines also published a few editions of scriptures and some devotional books. In 1522, Colines printed the four Gospels with commentary by Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples called ''Commentarii initiatorii in quatuor Evangelia''. The book was not submitted to the Parisian Faculty of Theology for approval as had been decreed the previous November, and the theologians fined Colines on June 9, 1523, and threatened to seize the remaining copies.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>{{rp|xlix}} Colines argued that the printing had started in Meaux before the decree, and the theologians consented to let him keep his remaining copies as long as he did not sell them. In 1545, after Lef\u00e8vre's death, Parliament censored ''Commentarii''. In 1524, Colines printed Lef\u00e8vre's French translations of both the New Testament and the Psalms; however, Colines also published anti-Lutheran pamphlets (''Antilutherus''), much to Robert Estienne's and Lef\u00e8vre's disapproval. Colines was careful to petition for approval from Parliament. In 1526, the theologians prohibited the sale and possession of French language scriptures.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\">{{cite book|last1=Veyrin-Forrer|first1=Jeanne|editor1-last=schreiber|editor1-first=Fred|title=Simon de Colines: An annotated catalog of 230 examples of his press, 1520\u20131546|date=1995|publisher=Friends of the Brigham Young University Library|location=Provo, Utah|pages=xlv-lxxxiv|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> \n\nIn 1525 and 1527 Colines published [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]] with decorations by [[Geoffroy Tory]]. Both books together are called the Tory Books of Hours.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|156; 70}} Colines also published Books of Hours in the 1540s.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|167}} Colines's miniature ''[[Vulgate]]'' was widely circulated and went through 50 editions.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|52}} In 1541 Colines revised a Latin Bible folio with diacritical marks which contained a geographical index by Robert Estienne in Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. The volume, over 800 pages long, was a difficult printing job and published by Galliot du Pr\u00e9 and Lyonese Antoine Vincent.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>\n\nColines published a few more anti-Lutheran books in 1526. Colines printed several works by [[Josse van Clichtove]], including Clichtove's refutation to [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] (1527) and Clichtove's commentary (1529) on the decrees of the [[Councils of Sens]] in 1528. Colines also printed a book of polemical essays by [[Johann Eck]] in 1526.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>\n\nColines published many books by [[Erasmus]], often for schools. After Erasmus's ''Colloquia'' was censured, two secretly printed editions (1528 and 1532) bore Colines's typeface called ''Mignonne''. When Colines printed a New Testament with commentary by Erasmus in a single volume (''Testamentum Nouum per Des. Erasmum recognitum'') in 1533, he used a typeface even smaller than the ''Mignonne''. In 1542, French Parliament decreed that all books entering Paris should be examined, in order to make sure they contained no \"Lutheran errors\". The decree also stipulated that all books should contain the name and address of their printer. In 1544, Parliament published a list of censored books, and anyone still owning the books after three days could be incarcerated. The list included four books Colines had published. Colines published few new works after this decree.<ref name=\"Veyrin-Forrer\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nColines's types were renowned among and often praised by authors and poets of the period including Hubert Sussaneau, Salmon Macrinus, [[Nicholas Bourbon (the younger)|Nicolas Bourbon]], and Jean Visagier.<ref name=\"Amert2012\"/>{{rp|59}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''Simon de Colines: An Annotated Catalogue of 230 Examples of his Press, 1520\u20131546.''
