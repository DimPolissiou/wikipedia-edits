This worked well enough within a single enterprise, like MIT where Kerberos was invented, or major corporations where all of the resources were internal sites. However, as federated services like [[Active Directory Federation Services]] proliferated, the user's private information was sent out to affiliated sites not under control of the enterprise that collected the data from the user. Since privacy regulations are now tightening with legislation like the [[GDPR]], the newer methods like [[OpenID Connect]] have started to become more attractive; for example MIT, the originator of Kerberos, now supports [[OpenID Connect]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ist.mit.edu/oidc|author=MIT IST|title=OpenID Connect Authorization}}</ref>\n\n==== Email address ====\nSingle sign-on in theory can work without revealing identifying information like email address to the relying party (credential consumer), but many credential providers do not allow users to configure what information is passed on to the credential consumer. As of 2019, Google and Facebook sign-in do not require users to share email address with the credential consumer. '[[Sign in with Apple]]' introduced in [[iOS 13]] allows user to request a unique relay email each time the user signs up for a new service, thus reducing the likelihood of account linking by the credential consumer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/sign-in-with-apple-mixed-reactions/|title=App Makers Are Mixed on \u2018Sign In With Apple\u2019|last=Goode|first=Lauren|date=2019-06-15|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=2019-06-15|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>\n\n==Common configurations==\n\n===Kerberos-based===\n* Initial sign-on prompts the user for credentials, and gets a [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] [[ticket-granting ticket]] (TGT).\n* Additional software applications requiring authentication, such as [[email client]]s, [[wiki]]s, and [[revision control|revision-control]] systems, use the ticket-granting ticket to acquire service tickets, proving the user's identity to the mailserver / wiki server / etc. without prompting the user to re-enter credentials.\n\n[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environment - Windows login fetches TGT. [[Active Directory]]-aware applications fetch service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.\n\n[[Unix]]/[[Linux]] environment -  Log in via Kerberos [[Pluggable Authentication Modules|PAM]] modules fetches TGT. Kerberized client applications such as [[Evolution (software)|Evolution]], [[Firefox]], and [[Apache Subversion|SVN]] use service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.\n\n===Smart-card-based===\nInitial sign-on prompts the user for the [[smart card]]. Additional [[Application software|software applications]] also use the smart card, without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. Smart-card-based single sign-on can either use certificates or passwords stored on the smart card.\n\n===Integrated Windows Authentication===\n''[[Integrated Windows Authentication]]'' is a term associated with [[Microsoft]] products and refers to the [[SPNEGO]], [[Kerberos protocol|Kerberos]], and [[NTLMSSP]] authentication protocols with respect to [[Security Support Provider Interface|SSPI]] functionality introduced with Microsoft [[Windows 2000]] and included with later [[Windows NT]]-based operating systems. The term is most commonly used to refer to the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft [[Internet Information Services]] and [[Internet Explorer]].  Cross-platform [[Active Directory]] integration vendors have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to Unix (including Mac) and GNU/Linux systems.\n\n===Security Assertion Markup Language===\n[[Security Assertion Markup Language]] (SAML) is an [[XML]]-based method for exchanging user security information between an [[identity provider (SAML)|SAML identity provider]] and a [[service provider (SAML)|SAML service provider]]. [[SAML 2.0]] supports [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] XML encryption and service provider initiated web browser single sign-on exchanges.  A user wielding a user agent (usually a web browser) is called the subject in SAML-based single sign-on.  The user requests a web resource protected by a SAML service provider.  The service provider, wishing to know the identity of the user, issues an authentication request to a SAML identity provider through the user agent.  The identity provider is the one that provides the user credentials.  The service provider trusts the [[user information]] from the identity provider to provide access to its services or resources.\n\n==Emerging configurations==\n\n===Mobile devices as access credentials===\nA newer variation of single-sign-on authentication has been developed using mobile devices as access credentials.  Users' mobile devices can be used to automatically log them onto multiple systems, such as building-access-control systems and computer systems, through the use of authentication methods which include [[OpenID Connect]] and SAML,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/microstrategys-office-of-the-future-includes-mobile-identity-and-cybersecurity/2013/04/13/eb82e074-a1e3-11e2-be47-b44febada3a8_story.html|title=MicroStrategy\u2019s office of the future includes mobile identity and cybersecurity|publisher=Washington Post |date=2014-04-14|accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref> in conjunction with an [[X.509]] [[ITU-T]] [[cryptography]] certificate used to identify the mobile device to an access server.\n\nA mobile device is \"something you have\", as opposed to a password which is \"something you know\", or biometrics (fingerprint, retinal scan, facial recognition,...) which is \"something you are\".

This worked well enough within a single enterprise, like MIT where Kerberos was invented, or major corporations where all of the resources were internal sites. However, as federated services like [[Active Directory Federation Services]] proliferated, the user's private information was sent out to affiliated sites not under control of the enterprise that collected the data from the user. Since privacy regulations are now tightening with legislation like the [[GDPR]], the newer methods like [[OpenID Connect]] have started to become more attractive; for example MIT, the originator of Kerberos, now supports [[OpenID Connect]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ist.mit.edu/oidc|author=MIT IST|title=OpenID Connect Authorization}}</ref>\n\n==== Email address ====\nSingle sign-on in theory can work without revealing identifying information like email address to the relying party (credential consumer), but many credential providers do not allow users to configure what information is passed on to the credential consumer. As of 2019, Google and Facebook sign-in do not require users to share email address with the credential consumer. '[[Sign in with Apple]]' introduced in [[iOS 13]] allows user to request a unique relay email each time the user signs up for a new service, thus reducing the likelihood of account linking by the credential consumer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/sign-in-with-apple-mixed-reactions/|title=App Makers Are Mixed on \u2018Sign In With Apple\u2019|last=Goode|first=Lauren|date=2019-06-15|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=2019-06-15|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>\n\n==Common configurations==\n\n===Kerberos-based===\n* Initial sign-on prompts the user for credentials, and gets a [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] [[ticket-granting ticket]] (TGT).\n* Additional software applications requiring authentication, such as [[email client]]s, [[wiki]]s, and [[revision control|revision-control]] systems, use the ticket-granting ticket to acquire service tickets, proving the user's identity to the mailserver / wiki server / etc. without prompting the user to re-enter credentials.\n\n[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environment - Windows login fetches TGT. [[Active Directory]]-aware applications fetch service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.\n\n[[Unix]]/[[Linux]] environment -  Log in via Kerberos [[Pluggable Authentication Modules|PAM]] modules fetches TGT. Kerberized client applications such as [[Evolution (software)|Evolution]], [[Firefox]], and [[Apache Subversion|SVN]] use service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.\n\n===Smart-card-based===\nInitial sign-on prompts the user for the [[smart card]]. Additional [[Application software|software applications]] also use the smart card, without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. Smart-card-based single sign-on can either use certificates or passwords stored on the smart card.\n\n===Integrated Windows Authentication===\n''[[Integrated Windows Authentication]]'' is a term associated with [[Microsoft]] products and refers to the [[SPNEGO]], [[Kerberos protocol|Kerberos]], and [[NTLMSSP]] authentication protocols with respect to [[Security Support Provider Interface|SSPI]] functionality introduced with Microsoft [[Windows 2000]] and included with later [[Windows NT]]-based operating systems. The term is most commonly used to refer to the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft [[Internet Information Services]] and [[Internet Explorer]].  Cross-platform [[Active Directory]] integration vendors have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to Unix (including Mac) and GNU/Linux systems.\n\n===Security Assertion Markup Language===\n[[Security Assertion Markup Language]] (SAML) is an [[XML]]-based method for exchanging user security information between an [[identity provider (SAML)|SAML identity provider]] and a [[service provider (SAML)|SAML service provider]]. [[SAML 2.0]] supports [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] XML encryption and service provider initiated web browser single sign-on exchanges.  A user wielding a user agent (usually a web browser) is called the subject in SAML-based single sign-on.  The user requests a web resource protected by a SAML service provider.  The service provider, wishing to know the identity of the user, issues an authentication request to a SAML identity provider through the user agent.  The identity provider is the one that provides the user credentials.  The service provider trusts the [[user information]] from the identity provider to provide access to its services or resources.\n\n==Emerging configurations==\n\n===Mobile devices as access credentials===\nA newer variation of single-sign-on authentication has been developed using mobile devices as access credentials.  Users' mobile devices can be used to automatically log them onto multiple systems, such as building-access-control systems and computer systems, through the use of authentication methods which include [[OpenID Connect]] and SAML,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/microstrategys-office-of-the-future-includes-mobile-identity-and-cybersecurity/2013/04/13/eb82e074-a1e3-11e2-be47-b44febada3a8_story.html|title=MicroStrategy\u2019s office of the future includes mobile identity and cybersecurity|publisher=Washington Post |date=2014-04-14|accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref> in conjunction with an [[X.509]] [[ITU-T]] [[cryptography]] certificate used to identify the mobile device to an access server.\n\nA mobile device is \"something you have\", as opposed to a password which is \"something you know\", or biometrics (fingerprint, retinal scan, facial recognition,...) which is \"something you are\". Security experts recommend using at least two out of these three factors ([[multi-factor authentication]]) for best protection.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Central Authentication Service]]\n* [[Identity management]]\n* [[Identity management systems]]\n* [[List of single sign-on implementations]]\n* [[Security Assertion Markup Language]]\n* [[Usability of web authentication systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.opengroup.org/security/sso/sso_intro.htm Single sign-on intro with diagrams]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Single Sign-On}}\n[[Category:Password authentication]]\n[[Category:Federated identity]]\n[[Category:Computer access control]]\n", "name_user": "Waldyrious", "label": "safe", "comment": "simplify opening sentence (MOS:JARGON,WP:TECHNICAL)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on"}

He is a small, green humanoid alien with tremendous power in the Force. In his first appearance in the original trilogy, the spirit of Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi describes Yoda as the Jedi master who trained him and asks Luke Skywalker to seek Jedi training from Yoda, which Luke does and later uses to fight against the Galactic Empire. The character reappears in Return of the Jedi where he reveals his age to be 900, making him the oldest living character in the Star Wars franchise.\n\nIn the prequel trilogy, set a generation before the original trilogy, Yoda is among the most powerful members of the Jedi Order and a general of clone troopers during the Clone Wars. He also trains all Jedi children, before they are assigned a Jedi master. Yoda appears again in the sequel trilogy, advising Luke.\n\n\nContents\n1\tConcept and creation\n1.1\tCharacter overview\n1.2\tOther members of species\n2\tAppearances\n2.1\tSkywalker saga\n2.2\tAnimated series\n2.3\tCanon media\n2.4\tLegends\n3\tIn popular culture\n3.1\tMerchandising\n4\tSee also\n5\tReferences\n6\tExternal links\nConcept and creation\nFrank Oz provided Yoda's voice in each film and used his skills as a puppeteer in the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. For some walking scenes in Episodes V and I, dwarf actors Deep Roy and Warwick Davis appeared in costume as Yoda (though neither was credited). While Frank Oz served as the primary performer, he was assisted by a multitude of other puppeteers, including:[5] Kathryn Mullen (Ep. V), Wendy Froud (Ep. V), David Barclay (Ep. V-VI), Mike Quinn (Ep. VI), David Greenaway (Ep. I & VI), Don Austen (Ep. I), Kathy Smee (Ep. I), Dave Chapman (Ep. VIII), Damian Farrell (Ep. VIII), and Colin Purves (Ep. VIII). For the radio dramatizations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Yoda was voiced by John Lithgow, while Tom Kane voiced him in the Clone Wars animated series, several video games, and the series Star Wars: The Clone Wars.\n\nThe make-up artist Stuart Freeborn based Yoda's face partly on his own and partly on Albert Einstein's.[6][7][8][9] In The Phantom Menace, he was redesigned to look younger. He was computer-generated for two distant shots, but remained mostly a puppet.[10] The puppet was re-designed by Nick Dudman from Stuart Freeborn's original design.\n\nRendered with computer animation in Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith, Yoda appeared in ways not previously possible, including his participation in elaborate fight scenes. In Revenge of the Sith, his face appears in several big close-ups, demanding highly detailed CGI work. His performance was deliberately designed to be consistent with the limitations of the puppet version, with some \"mistakes\" made such as the occasional ear-jiggling.[citation needed] Rob Coleman was responsible for the character's new incarnation to the series.\n\nYoda was recreated in CGI for the 2011 Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace.[11] A clip of the new CG Yoda from The Phantom Menace was first seen in the featurette The Chosen One, included in the 2005 DVD release of Revenge of the Sith.[12] The 2012 theatrical 3D release of The Phantom Menace also features the CG version of Yoda.\n\nCharacter overview\nJedi Master Yoda is amongst the oldest, most stoic and most powerful known Jedi Masters in the Star Wars universe. Series creator George Lucas opted to have many details of the character's life history remain unknown. Yoda's race and home world have not been named in any official media, canonical or otherwise, and he is merely said to be of a \"species unknown\" by the Star Wars Databank. Yoda's characteristic speech patterns have been analyzed and discussed by academic syntacticians, who found it somewhat inconsistent, but could extrapolate that it has object\u2013subject\u2013verb word order[13] making it anastrophe.\n\nThe films and Expanded Universe reveal that he had a hand in training almost every Jedi Master in the galaxy. In the Star Wars prequel films, he instructs several younglings in the Jedi Temple before they are assigned to a master. In The Empire Strikes Back he mentions that he had been training Jedi \"for 800 years\", which means he must have been a Master Jedi for quite some time before that.\n\nOther members of species\nTwo other members of Yoda's unnamed alien species are known: Yaddle (who appears as a background female character in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace as a Jedi master) and the character in The Mandalorian known currently as \"The Child\" (called \"Baby Yoda\" by fans and media). Their respective relation (if any) to Yoda is unknown. Very little is known about Yoda's alien species, though all three are powerful in The Force.[14][15]\n\nAppearances\nSkywalker saga\nMain article: Skywalker saga\nOriginal trilogy\nThe Empire Strikes Back (1980)\nYoda makes his first film appearance in The Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) arrives on Dagobah to seek his guidance, having been instructed to do so by the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), who describes him as \"the Jedi Master who instructed me\".\n\nYoda does not initially identify himself to Luke and instead tests his patience by presenting himself as a comical backwater individual, deliberately provoking both Luke and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). Luke is shocked when he finally discovers that this small, eccentric creature is the powerful Jedi Master he was seeking. Finding that Luke has the same anger and recklessness which caused his father's downfall, Yoda is reluctant to teach him the ways of the Force, and agrees only at Obi-Wan's behest. Before finishing his training, however, Luke chooses to leave Dagobah in order to confront Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and save his friends on Bespin. Yoda and Obi-Wan warn him that he is not ready to face Vader and is being lured into a trap, but Luke leaves anyway, promising to return. When Obi-Wan laments that Luke is their \"last hope,\" Yoda reminds him that \"there is another\".\n\nReturn of the Jedi (1983)\nYoda makes a brief appearance in Return of the Jedi, set a year after The Empire Strikes Back. Yoda, now sick and frail, informs Luke that he has completed his training but will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader; he also confirms that Vader is Luke's father, something Vader had told Luke in the previous film. Yoda then peacefully dies at the age of 900, his body disappearing as he becomes \"one with the Force\". He leaves Luke with the knowledge that \"there is another Skywalker\". Moments later, Obi-Wan's ghost helps Luke come to the realization that the \"other\" of whom Yoda spoke is Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), who is his twin sister.\n\nIn the film's final scene, after the Empire has been defeated, Luke sees Yoda's spirit looking upon him with pride, alongside Obi-Wan and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw in the original version of the film, Hayden Christensen in the 2004 DVD release), Vader's former Jedi self.[16]\n\nPrequel trilogy\nStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\nYoda returns as a younger version of himself in the prequel trilogy beginning with The Phantom Menace. The film marked the final time Oz would portray the character as a puppet, until the release of The Last Jedi (2017).[17] However, in the 2011 Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, the Yoda puppet was replaced by a CGI character to match the later depiction of the character. In the film, which is set 35 years before The Empire Strikes Back, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) brings the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) to the Jedi Council. Qui-Gon is convinced that Anakin is the \"Chosen One\" of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force, and requests the boy be trained as a Jedi. Yoda senses great fear in Anakin, especially in regards to his attachment to his mother Shmi (Pernilla August), and foresees \"grave danger\" in his training. The Council, led at the time by Yoda's former padawan Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), rejects Qui-Gon's request.\n\nWhen Qui-Gon is mortally wounded in a duel with Sith Lord Darth Maul (played by Ray Park and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz), his dying request to his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is that Anakin be trained as a Jedi. Obi-Wan, determined to fulfill his promise to his master, tells Yoda that he will train the boy, even without the Council's approval. Yoda makes Obi-Wan a Jedi Knight, and reluctantly gives his blessing to Anakin's training.[18]\n\nStar Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\nYoda holding a lightsaber\nYoda's CGI appearance in Attack of the Clones\nYoda makes his first CGI appearance in Attack of the Clones, set a decade after The Phantom Menace. Yoda, now in direct control of the Order's policy as Master of the High Council in addition to his traditional position as Grandmaster, is one of the many Jedi who are concerned about the emergence of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a secessionist movement wanting independence from the Galactic Republic. After the first attempted assassination of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala (Natalie Portman), Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) suggests that she be put under the protection of Obi-Wan, who is training Anakin (now played by Hayden Christensen). In a deleted scene, a meditating Yoda senses Anakin slaughtering the Tusken Raiders who murdered his mother.\n\nAt the climax of the film, Yoda arrives in time to save Obi-Wan and Anakin from the Separatists and defeats his former apprentice, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the Separatists\u2019 leader and a Sith lord, in a lightsaber duel.\n\nStar Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\nIn Revenge of the Sith, Yoda leads the Jedi Council in pursuing the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Palpatine has by now amassed near-dictatorial emergency powers, and begins interfering in Jedi affairs by appointing Anakin as his personal representative on the Council. The Council grants Anakin a Council seat, but denies him the rank of Master, feeling that doing so would amount to giving Palpatine a vote in the Council. Additionally, they order him to spy on Palpatine, whom Anakin considers a friend and mentor.\n\nAnakin seeks Yoda's counsel about his prophetic visions that someone close to him will die. Yoda, unaware that the person Anakin speaks of is Padm\u00e9, or that she is Anakin's wife and pregnant with his child, tells him to \"train yourself to let go of everything that you fear to lose\". Unsatisfied, Anakin turns to Palpatine, who then reveals himself as Darth Sidious. Palpatine manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, with the promise that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padm\u00e9 from dying in childbirth.\n\nPalpatine later transforms the Republic into the tyrannical Galactic Empire, proclaiming himself emperor for life, and orders the clone troopers to kill their Jedi generals. At this time, Yoda is on Kashyyyk, overseeing the battle between the Separatist forces and a combined command of clone troopers and Wookiees. Through the Force, Yoda feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are assassinated by their own troops. After swiftly killing the clone troopers instructed to kill him, he escapes with Wookiee leaders Tarfful (Michael Kingma) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and returns to Coruscant, where he and Obi-Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple to stop a trap for all surviving Jedi. Inside, they discover that all the Jedi inside, younglings included, have been slaughtered. They then discover a holographic recording, revealing Vader as the assassin. Yoda decides to face Palpatine, sending Obi-Wan to kill Vader. When Obi-Wan protests, Yoda tells him that the Anakin he knew no longer exists, having been \"consumed by Darth Vader\".\n\nSubsequently, Yoda battles Palpatine in a lightsaber duel that wrecks the Senate Rotunda. In the end, neither is able to overcome the other and Yoda is forced to retreat. He goes into exile on Dagobah so that he may hide from the Empire and wait for another opportunity to destroy the Sith. At the end of the film, it is revealed that Yoda has been in contact with Qui-Gon's spirit, learning the secret of immortality from him and passing it on to Obi-Wan.\n\nYoda is also instrumental in deciding the fate of the Skywalker children after Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth, recommending that Luke and Leia be hidden from Vader and Palpatine; he sends Leia to be adopted by Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) of Alderaan, and Luke to Vader's stepfamily Owen (Joel Edgerton) and Beru Lars (Bonnie Piesse) on Tatooine. Other than the ancient Jedi Master, only the Organas, the Lars family, R2-D2 and Obi-Wan know of their true identities.[19]\n\nSequel trilogy\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)\nIn The Force Awakens, set 30 years after Yoda's death in Return of the Jedi, Yoda's voice is heard by the young scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) after she discovers Luke Skywalker's lightsaber in a bar owned by supporting character Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o).[20]\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)\nIn Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Yoda appears to Luke as a Force spirit as Luke debates whether to burn down the tree storing the only remaining copies of the Sacred Texts of the Jedi.[21] As Luke makes his way to the tree, Yoda appears behind him and reminds him that a Jedi must always be sure of his path. When Luke decides against burning down the tree and destroying the texts, Yoda summons a lightning bolt down upon the tree, setting it ablaze. When confronting Yoda as to why he did it, Yoda tells Luke that true Jedi knowledge is not found in books, but within Jedi themselves, and it is their responsibility to pass that knowledge on. As Luke takes in the message, he sits with Yoda and shares a quiet moment with his former master.\n\nUnlike in the prequels, where fight scenes necessitated the character be rendered in with computer-generated imagery, Yoda is once more portrayed using puppetry.[22]\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\nYoda appeared in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker via voice-over, as one of the voices of Jedi past who speak to Rey during her battle against Emperor Palpatine.[23]\n\nAnimated series\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\nYoda appears in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, voiced by Tom Kane. In the prequel film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Yoda assigns Anakin Skywalker (voiced by Matt Lanter) his own Padawan, Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein), as he believes that she will help Anakin grow as a Jedi and as a person. Throughout most of the series, Yoda spends his time on Coruscant with the Jedi Council, but he occasionally leaves for certain tasks, such as negotiations with King Katuunko (voiced by Brian George) on Rugosa, and a confrontation with Asajj Ventress' (voiced by Grey DeLisle) droid army. Yoda also watches over Anakin and Ahsoka throughout the series, pleased that they are both maturing due to each other's influence. However, in the final arc of season five, Ahsoka is framed for a crime she didn't commit, and Yoda and the Jedi Council expel her and turn her over to the Republic military. Along with other members of the Council, Yoda observes Ahsoka's trial, but Anakin bursts in with the true culprit, fallen Jedi Barriss Offee (voiced by Meredith Salenger), before the verdict can be read. Afterwards Yoda, Anakin and the Council personally invite Ahsoka to rejoin the Order, but she refuses and leaves. According to show runner Dave Filoni, Yoda blames himself for Ahsoka's departure, as he had made her Anakin's padawan in the first place.\n\nIn the final arc of the final season, Yoda hears Qui-Gon Jinn speaking to him from beyond the grave. Yoda flees the Jedi Temple with R2-D2 to travel to Dagobah, his future home, to find answers. Shown cryptic visions of the fall of the Jedi, Yoda learns he has been \"chosen\" to learn how to manifest his consciousness after death as a Force ghost. Yoda is tested by a group of spirit priestesses in order to overcome trials and temptations on his pilgrimage; one of these tests is to face an illusion of ancient Sith lord Darth Bane (voiced by Mark Hamill). Yoda's final test is to resist an attempt by Darth Sidious and Dooku to lure him to the dark side with a false vision of deceased Jedi Master Sifo Dyas. Yoda engages in a metaphysical battle with Sidious, and appears to sacrifice his life in order to save Anakin's \u2013 only to awaken and discover that the battle was merely a vision, and that he has passed the test. The priestesses inform Yoda that his training will resume in time.\n\nStar Wars Rebels (2014)\nYoda was heard in the Star Wars Rebels episode \"Path of the Jedi\" with Frank Oz reprising the role for the first time since Revenge of the Sith.[24] He communicates with Padawan Ezra Bridger and his master Kanan Jarrus during their experience in an ancient temple on Lothal, and helps the pair do some soul-searching to analyze their true motivations. He appears physically for the first time, in the season 2 episode \"Shroud of Darkness\", in which he tells Ezra he should find Malachor and reunites with Ahsoka after nearly 20 years.\n\nCanon media\nYoda appears in canon books and other media, including Dooku: Jedi Lost and Master & Apprentice, which take place before The Phantom Menace. In some of these works, he is referred to as the \"Grand Master of the Jedi Order\".\n\nLegends\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.[25][26][27]\n\nClone Wars (2003)\nYoda appears in the 2003 Cartoon Network animated television series Star Wars: Clone Wars, voiced by Tom Kane. In the show, Yoda is made a general, like many of the Jedi Knights and Masters. Yoda escorts Padm\u00e9 on their journey to an unspecified planet, but Yoda senses several Jedi in distress on Ilum. Using the Jedi mind trick to convince Captain Typho to take them to Ilum, Yoda saves two Jedi Knights and finds a message from Count Dooku giving orders to destroy the Jedi Temple on Ilum. In the animated series' final episode, Yoda fights side by side with Mace Windu to defend Coruscant, which is under attack from the Separatists. The two Jedi Masters realize too late that the battle is a distraction; Separatist leader General Grievous truly intends to kidnap Palpatine. The Jedi Master's effort to stop Grievous fails, and Palpatine is taken hostage, thus setting the stage for Revenge of the Sith.\n\nLegends comics\nYoda acts as a supporting character in Dark Horse Comics' Clone Wars tie-in comic books.\n\nLegends novel Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\nMain article: Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\n\nIt has been suggested that Yoda: Dark Rendezvous be merged into this article.

It is set in the Star Wars expanded universe during the Clone Wars conflict between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.\n\nThe Clone Wars have raged across the galaxy for almost two years, when the Grand Master of the Jedi Order, Yoda, receives a message from Separatist leader Count Dooku. In the message, Dooku concedes to Yoda that things have gotten far out of hand; What began as a political play to keep the Senate honest had turned into a bloodbath, and the time for a truce has come. Dooku invites Yoda to meet him on the planet Vjun, where they would organize the cease-fire.\n\nAfter conferring with his fellow Jedi Masters from the Council, principally Mace Windu, Yoda judges that even if the meeting at Vjun were a feint, the chance to end the war far outweighs the perils of a trap. Yoda decides to send a decoy impersonating himself to a different planet, while he secretly slips off to Vjun. He contracts a famous actor and Yoda impersonator, Palleus Chuff, to pull off the bluff. Disguised as Yoda, Chuff leaves on a very public mission to Ithor. When Chuff's fighter is captured by Dooku's minion Asajj Ventress, who is unaware of the switch, the apparent loss of Yoda comes as a sad blow to the morale of the Republic.\n\nJedi Masters Jai Maruk and Maks Leem journey towards Vjun, accompanied by their Padawans, the under-achieving Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy (or \"Scout\") and Whie. They make their way slowly, travelling under the false identities of a refugee family, with Yoda disguised as their faithful R2 unit. During one Spaceport layover, Ventress (accompanied by the bumbling but brave Chuff) catches the quintet, and unleashes a dangerous new type of battle droid. While the other Jedi fight the droids and Ventress, Yoda seeks to rescue Chuff. Unfortunately, both Jai Maruk and Maks Leem fall to the terrible droids and Ventress' lightsaber. Yoda, however, diverts Ventress' attention before she gets a chance to kill the young Padawans, and the three Jedi (with Chuff in tow) escape.\n\nMeanwhile, on Vjun, Count Dooku awaits Yoda in the Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux, the manor of the long since waned aristocratic clan Malreaux. As the group of Jedi land on Vjun they are forced to separate: Yoda goes to meet with Dooku, and the Padawans follow mysterious disruptions in the Force felt by Whie. Soon, Ventress captures the Padawans. She reveals to Whie that the Ch\u00e2teau is in fact his house, and the insane house-woman was his mother, Lady \"Whirry\" Malreaux. Meanwhile, Yoda meets with Dooku, and discovers that Dooku's summons is indeed a feint. The two masters engage in a tense debate about the ways of the Force, and reminiscence about Dooku's childhood in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In the end, Yoda encourages his former apprentice to leave the dark side and Darth Sidious forever. Dooku, hands shaking, is on the verge of answering when an assistant informs him of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi's arrival in the mansion, dispatched there by the Jedi Council, on behalf of Palpatine.\n\nConvinced that the legendary duo are replacements for him, Dooku is overcome by jealousy and throws his assistant out the window. Yoda is forced to save Whirry from falling to her death, and then parry Dooku's follow-up lightsaber attack. Even though Dooku wounds him, Yoda, unfazed, does not yield to the dark side. Yoda recovers, and a short lightsaber battle ensues. Before leaping from the window to escape, Dooku tells Yoda of a missile approaching from space, aimed at the house, and everyone in it. Yoda stops the missile, inevitably allowing Dooku and Ventress time to escape.\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 2007, Yoda was selected by Empire magazine as the \"25th greatest movie character of all time\".[28] On their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters, Fandomania.com ranked Yoda at number 60.[29]\n\nYoda also appears in Disney's Star Tours: The Adventures Continue attraction, where he is voiced by his original voice actor, Frank Oz.[30]\n\nA life-size statue of Yoda greets visitors to Lucasfilm's Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco's Presidio, the headquarters of Industrial Light and Magic.\n\nAmerican musician and parody artist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic used the character as inspiration for a parody of The Kinks' \"Lola\", in a song entitled \"Yoda.\"\n\nLinguistics professor David Ager from Queen Mary University of London says Yoda's language most closely resembles the Hawaiian language.[31]\n\nIn 2019, discount store Poundland used the voice of Yoda at its self-service checkouts in stores across the United Kingdom.[32]\n\nMerchandising\n[icon]\t\nThis section needs expansion.

It consists of two [[archipelago]]s around the two main islands of [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] and [[Pr\u00edncipe]], about {{convert|140|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart and about {{convert|250|and|225|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} off the northwestern coast of [[Gabon]], respectively.\n\nThe islands were uninhabited until their discovery by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers in the 15th century. Gradually colonized and settled by the Portuguese throughout the 16th century, they collectively served as a vital commercial and trade center for the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The rich volcanic soil and close proximity to the Equator made S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe ideal for [[sugar]] cultivation, followed later by cash crops such as [[coffee]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]; the lucrative plantation economy was heavily dependent upon imported African slaves. Cycles of social unrest and economic instability throughout the 19th and 20th centuries culminated in peaceful [[independence]] in 1975. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has since remained one of [[Africa]]'s most stable and [[Democracy|democratic]] countries.\n\nWith a population of 201,800 (2018 official estimate),<ref name=\"auto\">Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe, as at 13 May 2018.</ref><ref name=\"UN_WPP\"/> S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is the second-smallest African [[sovereign state]] after [[Seychelles]], as well as the smallest Portuguese-speaking country. Its people are predominantly of African and ''[[Mesti\u00e7o#Mesti\u00e7o \u2013 S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|mesti\u00e7o]]'' descent, with most practicing [[Roman Catholicism]]. The legacy of Portuguese rule is also visible in the country's culture, customs, and music, which fuse European and African influences. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is a founding member state of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!-- most paragraphs have no citations-->\n\n=== Arrival of Europeans ===\n[[File:Johannes Vingboons - 't eylant St. Thome (1665).jpg|thumb|left|Map of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 by [[Johannes Vingboons]] (1665)]]\nThe islands of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe were uninhabited when the Portuguese arrived sometime around 1470. The first Europeans to put ashore were [[Jo\u00e3o de Santar\u00e9m]] and [[P\u00earo Escobar]]. Portuguese navigators explored the islands and decided that they would be good locations for bases to trade with the mainland.\n\nThe dates of European arrival are sometimes given as 21 December ([[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas's Day]]) 1471, for S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9; and 17 January ([[Anthony the Great|St Antony's Day]]) 1472, for Pr\u00edncipe, though other sources cite different years around that time. Pr\u00edncipe was initially named ''Santo Ant\u00e3o'' (\"Saint Anthony\"), changing its name in 1502 to ''Ilha do Pr\u00edncipe'' (\"Prince's Island\"), in reference to the Prince of Portugal to whom duties on the island's sugar crop were paid.\n\nThe first successful settlement of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was established in 1493 by [[\u00c1lvaro Caminha]], who received the land as a grant from the crown. Pr\u00edncipe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, and most of the earliest inhabitants were \"undesirables\" sent from Portugal, mostly [[Jews]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/h/9av/aas/52421817.html |title=The Expulsion 1492 Chronicles, section XI: \"The Vale of Tears\", quoting Joseph Hacohen (1496\u20131577); also, section XVII, quoting 16th century author Samuel Usque |publisher=Aish.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2013-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003125410/http://www.aish.com/h/9av/aas/52421817.html |archive-date=2013-10-03 |url-status=live }}</ref> In time, these settlers found the volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of sugar.\n\n=== Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe ===\nBy 1515, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe had become slave depots for the coastal slave trade centered at [[Elmina]].<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=Ivor Wilks and Akan Wangara|editor=Peter John Bakewell|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBhmQgAACAAJ|date=January 1997|publisher=Variorum|isbn=978-0-86078-513-2|chapter=Portuguese in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|location=Aldershot|page=24}}</ref>\n[[File:Forte_de_S%C3%A3o_Sebasti%C3%A3o_-_S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_(8084256064).jpg|thumb|left|[[S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o Museum]] in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]]\nThe cultivation of sugar was a labour-intensive process and the Portuguese began to enslave large numbers of Africans from the mainland.

The greatest slave revolt in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 occurred in July 1595, during a period when the government was weakened by disputes between the bishop and the governor.<ref name=\":7\" /> The revolt, which was headed by a native slave named Amador, was successful in uniting 5000 slaves in an effort to raid and destroy plantations, sugar mills, and settler's houses.<ref name=\":7\" /> Amador and his rebellion unsuccessfully attempted to raid the town three times before eventually, after three weeks, they were defeated by the militia.<ref name=\":7\" /> Two hundred slaves were killed in combat, and Amador and the other rebel leaders were executed.<ref name=\":7\" /> The rest of the slaves were granted amnesty and returned to their plantations. Amador's revolt had successfully destroyed 60 of the island's 85 sugar mills in one of the greatest slave uprisings in history.<ref name=\":7\" /> Smaller slavery rebellions followed in the 17th and 18th centuries. \n\nEventually, competition from sugar-producing colonies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] began to hurt the islands. The large enslaved population also proved difficult to control, with Portugal unable to invest many resources in the effort. Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-17th century, the economy of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 had changed. It was now primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between the West and continental Africa.\n\nIn the early 19th century, two new cash crops, coffee and cocoa, were introduced. The rich, volcanic soils proved well suited to the new cash crop industry, and soon extensive plantations (known as ''ro\u00e7as''), owned by Portuguese companies or absentee landlords, occupied almost all of the good farmland.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> By 1908, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 had become the world's largest producer of cocoa, which remains the country's most important crop.\n\nThe ''ro\u00e7as'' system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although Portugal officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labour continued. ''[[Scientific American]]'' documented in words and pictures the continued use of slaves in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in its 13 March 1897 issue.\n\nIn the early 20th century, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that [[Angola]]n contract workers were being subjected to forced labour and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their Portuguese rulers. This \"[[Batep\u00e1 Massacre]]\" remains a major event in the colonial history of the islands, and its anniversary is officially observed by the government.\n\n===Independence (1975)===\n[[File:Sao_Tome_Cathedral_7_(16223085806).jpg|thumb|The cathedral of [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]]]]\nBy the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African continent demanded their independence, a small group of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans had formed the [[Movement for the Liberation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby [[Gabon]]. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] dictatorship in Portugal in April 1974.\n\nThe new Portuguese regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies. In November 1974, their representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe achieved independence on 12 July 1975, choosing as the first president the MLSTP Secretary General [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]].\n\nIn 1990, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 became one of the first African countries to undergo [[Democratization|democratic reform]], and changes to the constitution \u2013 the legalization of opposition political parties \u2013 led to elections in 1991 that were nonviolent, free, and transparent. [[Miguel Trovoada]], a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's second multiparty presidential election in 1996.\n\nThe [[Democratic Convergence Party \u2013 Reflection Group|Party of Democratic Convergence]] won a majority of seats in the [[National Assembly of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|National Assembly]], with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late 1992, in which the MLSTP won a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November 1998 elections.\n\nPresidential elections were held in July 2001. The candidate backed by the [[Independent Democratic Action]] party, [[Fradique de Menezes]], was elected in the first round and inaugurated on 3 September. Parliamentary elections were held in March 2002. For the next four years, a series of short-lived opposition-led governments was formed.\n\nThe army seized power for one week in July 2003, complaining of corruption and that forthcoming oil revenues would not be divided fairly. An accord was negotiated under which President de Menezes was returned to office.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} The [[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] period ended in March 2006, when a propresidential coalition won enough seats in National Assembly elections to form a new government.<ref>Gerhard Seibert (2006), ''Comrades, Clients and Cousins: Colonialism, Socialism and Democratization in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe'', Leiden: Brill.</ref>\n\nIn the 30 July 2006 presidential election, Fradique de Menezes easily won a second five-year term in office, defeating two other candidates [[Patrice Trovoada]] (son of former President Miguel Trovoada) and independent [[Nilo Guimar\u00e3es]].

At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises. The main crop on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is cocoa, representing about 95% of agricultural exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.\n\nDomestic food-crop production is inadequate to meet local consumption, so the country imports most of its food.<ref name=\"AMD\">{{cite book|author1=Mary E.

The scenic islands have potential for tourism, and the government is attempting to improve its rudimentary tourist industry infrastructure. The government sector accounts for about 11% of employment.\n\nFollowing independence, the country had a centrally directed economy, with most means of production owned and controlled by the state. The original constitution guaranteed a [[mixed economy]], with privately owned cooperatives combined with publicly owned property and means of production.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 encountered major difficulties. Economic growth stagnated, and cocoa exports dropped in both value and volume, creating large balance-of-payments deficits. Plantation land was seized, resulting in the complete collapse of cocoa production. At the same time, the international price of cocoa slumped.\n\nIn response to its economic downturn, the government undertook a series of far-reaching economic reforms. In 1987, the government implemented an [[International Monetary Fund]] [[structural adjustment]] program, and invited greater private participation in management of the [[State-owned enterprise|parastatal]]s, as well as in the agricultural, commercial, banking, and tourism sectors. The focus of economic reform since the early 1990s has been widespread privatization, especially of the state-run agricultural and industrial sectors.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an government has traditionally obtained foreign assistance from various donors, including the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]], the [[World Bank]], the European Union, Portugal, [[Taiwan]], and the [[African Development Bank]]. In April 2000, in association with the [[Central Bank of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|Banco Central de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe]], the IMF approved a poverty-reduction and growth facility for S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 aimed at reducing inflation to 3% for 2001, raising ideal growth to 4%, and reducing the fiscal deficit.\n\nIn late 2000, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 qualified for significant debt reduction under the IMF\u2013World Bank's [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] initiative. The reduction is being reevaluated by the IMF, due to the attempted ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' in July 2003 and subsequent emergency spending. Following the truce, the IMF decided to send a mission to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 to evaluate the macroeconomic state of the country. This evaluation is ongoing, reportedly pending oil legislation to determine how the government will manage incoming oil revenues, which are still poorly defined, but in any case expected to change the economic situation dramatically.\n\nIn parallel, some efforts have been made to incentivize private tourism initiatives, but their scope remains limited.<ref>Br\u00edgida Rocha Brito and others, ''Turismo em Meio Insular Africano: Potencialidades, constrangimentos e impactos'', Lisbon: Gerpress, 2010 {{in lang|pt}}</ref>\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 also hosts a broadcasting station of the American [[International Broadcasting Bureau]] for the [[Voice of America]]<ref name=\"WRTH1995p162\">''World Radio TV Handbook'' (WRTH) Vol. 49 \u2022 1995, p. 162; [http://www.wrth.com/ Billboard Publications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024001313/http://www.wrth.com/ |date=2013-10-24 }}, Amsterdam 1995. {{ISBN|0-8230-5926-X}}</ref> at Pinheira.<ref name=\"WRTH1997p514\">WRTH 1997, p. 514, {{ISBN|0-8230-7797-7}}</ref>\n\nPortugal remains one of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's major trading partners, particularly as a source of imports.

This derives from [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] [[Water well|wells]] of which Wells used to have many, rising through the chalk of the area. The town became Wells-next-the-Sea from ''juxta mare'' in the fourteenth century to distinguish it from other places of the same name. When the [[Wells and Fakenham Railway]] was opened on 1 December 1857, the terminus was given the name of Wells-on-Sea. In 1956 the Wells Urban District Council voted to (re-)adopt the name Wells-next-the-Sea, and this has been the official name since then.<ref>Description of Wells-next-the-Sea [http://www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[North Sea]] is now a mile from the town; the main channel which once wandered through marshes, grazed by sheep for hundreds of years, was confined by earthworks to the west in 1859 when Holkham Estate reclaimed some 800 hectares of saltmarsh north-west of Wells with the building of a mile-long bank.<ref>Nature Reserve : The Beach : Holkham Hall and Estate \u2013 North Norfolk, England [http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215011258/http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html |date=15 December 2014 }}</ref> This reclamation was claimed to have reduced the tidal scour though the West Fleet which provided much of the water entered the channel to its north.\n\nBecause the town has no river running through it, it relies on the tides to scour the harbour. The problem of siltation had preoccupied the merchants of the town for hundreds of years and occupied the attentions of various engineers, leading eventually to disputes which came to court in the eighteenth century. [[John Coode (engineer)|Sir John Coode]], who had been knighted for his work on the completion of Portland harbour was recruited to solve its siltation problems in the 1880s. No attempted solution proved permanent. The growth of faster marine traffic whose wake washes at the banks of the marshes has widened the channel and reduced tidal flow further.\n\nThe town has been a seaport since before the fourteenth century when it supplied grain to London and subsequently to the miners of the north east in return for which Wells was supplied with coal. Until the nineteenth century, it was easier to carry bulk cargoes by sea than overland. It was a significant port in the sixteenth century with 19 ships over 16 tons burden operating out of Wells in 1580, making it the major port in the area; the main trade was corn.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Port of Wells: 1100 Years of History | author=Pooley, Graham | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-9516120-1-9 }}</ref> Wells was also from early days a manufactury of [[malt]]. At its height the town boasted up to twelve [[Malt house|maltings]], having in 1750 contributed a third of the exports of malt from the country, mostly to Holland,  more than any other port save Yarmouth.\n\nWells was also a fishing port: in 1337 it is recorded as having had thirteen fishing boats; next door Holkham had nine. Its mariners brought first herring and then cod from Iceland in quantity between the fifteenth and seventeenth  centuries. The regulation of the harbour in order to preserve its use was by Act of Parliament in 1663; and in 1769 Harbour Commissioners were appointed with powers over vessels entering and leaving (as they still have today). The Quay was substantially rebuilt in 1845 as part of attempts to improve the town. At the same time, Improvement Commissioners were appointed with the task of making the town commodious and attractive to residents and  the burgeoning tourist trade.  As a small port, it built ships until the late nineteenth century; it never transferred to building motor vessels or to steel hulls. The coming of the railway in 1857 reduced the harbour trade but it revived briefly after the Second World War for the import of fertilizer and animal feed. In 1982 there were 258 ship movements into the harbour.<ref>{{cite book | title= Wells next the Sea: a small port in a wide world | author=Arguile, Roger  | year=2014| isbn=978-1-909796-49-2 }}</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century malting assumed an industrial character dominated by merchants rather than hands-on maltsters. Eventually, the entire estate was acquired by  F. & G. Smith who had maltings in Dereham and Great Ryburgh; they latterly bought out the competition becoming one of the biggest maltsters in the country.  Following the Great War demand began to fall and new methods of production were being used. After a local dispute,  they closed the Wells operation down in 1929. Other agriculture-related enterprises such as the Ipswich-based Eastern Counties Farmers Cooperative were, over the following years,  bought out or closed. The post-war revival of the harbour trade made of the Quay a busy place from the 1960s to the 1990s.  Small coasters, mostly from across the Channel,<ref>{{cite book | title= Favor Parker Shipping Register  23.11.81-31.12.86 }} </ref> brought in fertiliser and animal feed, latterly mostly soya beans until 1992 when changes in government regulations and the increasing size of vessels made the port uneconomic. Wind-farm support began in 2009 with the building of the [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm]].\n\nTourism, which had begun on a small scale a century before became a major draw, based as it was on the Pinewoods Caravan site much expanded post-war.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town has long thrived as a seaport and is now also a [[seaside resort]] with a popular beach that can be reached on foot or by a narrow gauge railway that runs partway alongside the mile-long sea wall north of the harbour. The beach is known for its long flat terrain, abstract sand dunes, varied unique [[beach hut]]s and a [[naturist]] area situated to the west at Holkham. A land-locked brackish pool called Abraham's Bosom was for many years used for pleasure boating and canoeing; it is all that remains of the West Fleet which once drained the Holkham marshes. The beach is backed by dense [[pine]] woods which are part of the [[Holkham National Nature Reserve]]. The woods comprise [[Scots pine]], [[Maritime pine]] and [[Corsican Pine]] growing on sand.<ref>Holkham National Nature Reserve [http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/ holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/]</ref>\n\nMore pinewoods exist to the east of the beach over the shipping channel at an area called the East Hills. This can be accessed on foot at low tide though all of the tidal sands in the area are extremely dangerous due to the speed and currents of the rising tide.  It is not advisable to cross the channel without detailed local knowledge.\n\nThe majority of shops and other such businesses are now found on Staithe Street but up to the 1960s commercial premises were also to be found along High Street which continues south towards St Nicholas's Church. The church burned after a lightning strike in 1879; the exterior shows the original stonework, but the interior, while light and airy, shows the want of stained glass. The Victorian bench ends are worth a look. [[John Fryer (sailor)|John Fryer]], Captain Bligh's [[sailing master]] on [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] was born at Wells, and is buried in the churchyard. His gravestone is in the church porch.\n\nThe distinctive landmark of the seafront is the granary with its overhanging gantry on the quay, started in 1904 and finished in 1905. This has now been converted into flats, having ceased operating as a granary in 1990. The maritime tradition of the town meant it used to have a remarkable number of public houses for a town of its size although many of these have since closed. The northern end of the town used to be notable for parallel 'yards', narrow rows of cottages similar to the northern '[[ginnel]]s', which may derive from the rebuilding of the port in the eleventh century. (The original port is reputed to have been adjacent to the church.) Most of these remain though some have been lost to development and [[slum clearance]]. The 1953 flood affected the northern edge of the town, breaching the beach bank and causing damage to houses in the east end. It also destroyed the pine woods which had been planted in the nineteenth century to stabilise the dunes and which fringed Abraham's Bosom. Today there is a large moving flood gate next to the harbour car park and many of the houses have their own flood defences.\n\nA feature of the town is the area known as The Buttlands, a large green ringed by lime trees. Large elegant Georgian houses overlook The Buttlands, as do the Crown Hotel, Globe Inn and the Wells Catholic Church. If you exit The Buttlands down the hill at its south-west corner you can see Ware Hall,a medieval house which was rebuilt over a period of years from the 1970s by Miss May Savidge, who brought it in parts when she moved from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] in Hertfordshire.<ref>[http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/the_house_that_may_built_1_700239 The house that May built], Eastern Daily Press, 28 November 2007</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n===Railways===\n[[File:Wells next the seamap 1946.png|thumb|250px|right|A map of Wells-next-the-Sea from 1946]]\n[[File:Wells-next-the-sea lifeboat statiion cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station]]]]\n[[File:Wells-next-the-sea lifeboat coming home by Dennis Smith.jpg|thumb|Wells-next-the-Sea lifeboat being towed to the lifeboat house]]\n\nFormerly the town was served by [[Wells-on-Sea railway station]] and was connected to the [[British Rail]] network by two lines.

The junior school was relocated to the former Secondary Modern school when a new secondary school, [[Alderman Peel High School]], was built in the late 1960s, part of which is upon the former railway line to the west towards King's Lynn. For several years, these buildings housed a field studies centre.  More recently, though, the former school has been converted to social housing units.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Buses===\nWells was located on the high-profile 'Coasthopper' bus route between [[King's Lynn]] and [[Cromer]]. In April 2018, Stagecoach ceased operations in Norfolk. The Coasthopper service was split into two sections at Wells-next-the-Sea: the section from King's Lynn to Wells was rebranded as the ''Coastliner'' 36, extended inland from Wells to [[Fakenham]], and taken over by [[Lynx (bus company)|Lynx]]; while the section from Wells to Cromer was branded as the 4 and taken over by Sanders Coaches.\n\n==Lifeboat==\nThe [[Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station|current lifeboat station]], housing both an all-weather lifeboat and an inshore rescue boat, is at the harbour entrance. The old lifeboat house, now used as the harbour offices, is at the western end of the quay. A new [[Shannon-class lifeboat|''Shannon''-class lifeboat]] is planned to replace the current boat in 2021 requiring a new much larger lifeboat station; the fate of the current station is uncertain.\n\nIn 1880, in the [[Wells lifeboat disaster]], 11 of the 13 crew drowned, leaving 10 widows and 27 children without fathers.

In the twentieth century the notorious 1953 floods were followed by a surge almost as dangerous in 1978for which the town was better prepared. On December 5th 2013 a similar flood occurred which did not affect the west end of the town because of a tidal barrier built in 1980.

This derives from [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] [[Water well|wells]] of which Wells used to have many, rising through the chalk of the area. The town became Wells-next-the-Sea from ''juxta mare'' in the fourteenth century to distinguish it from other places of the same name. When the [[Wells and Fakenham Railway]] was opened on 1 December 1857, the terminus was given the name of Wells-on-Sea. In 1956 the Wells Urban District Council voted to (re-)adopt the name Wells-next-the-Sea, and this has been the official name since then.<ref>Description of Wells-next-the-Sea [http://www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[North Sea]] is now a mile from the town; the main channel which once wandered through marshes, grazed by sheep for hundreds of years, was confined by earthworks to the west in 1859 when Holkham Estate reclaimed some 800 hectares of saltmarsh north-west of Wells with the building of a mile-long bank.<ref>Nature Reserve : The Beach : Holkham Hall and Estate \u2013 North Norfolk, England [http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215011258/http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html |date=15 December 2014 }}</ref> This reclamation was claimed to have reduced the tidal scour though the West Fleet which provided much of the water entered the channel to its north.\n\nBecause the town has no river running through it, it relies on the tides to scour the harbour. The problem of siltation had preoccupied the merchants of the town for hundreds of years and occupied the attentions of various engineers, leading eventually to disputes which came to court in the eighteenth century. [[John Coode (engineer)|Sir John Coode]], who had been knighted for his work on the completion of Portland harbour was recruited to solve its siltation problems in the 1880s. No attempted solution proved permanent. The growth of faster marine traffic whose wake washes at the banks of the marshes has widened the channel and reduced tidal flow further.\n\nThe town has been a seaport since before the fourteenth century when it supplied grain to London and subsequently to the miners of the north east in return for which Wells was supplied with coal. Until the nineteenth century, it was easier to carry bulk cargoes by sea than overland. It was a significant port in the sixteenth century with 19 ships over 16 tons burden operating out of Wells in 1580, making it the major port in the area; the main trade was corn.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Port of Wells: 1100 Years of History | author=Pooley, Graham | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-9516120-1-9 }}</ref> Wells was also from early days a manufactury of [[malt]]. At its height the town boasted up to twelve [[Malt house|maltings]], having in 1750 contributed a third of the exports of malt from the country, mostly to Holland,  more than any other port save Yarmouth.\n\nWells was also a fishing port: in 1337 it is recorded as having had thirteen fishing boats; next door Holkham had nine. Its mariners brought first herring and then cod from Iceland in quantity between the fifteenth and seventeenth  centuries. The regulation of the harbour in order to preserve its use was by Act of Parliament in 1663; and in 1769 Harbour Commissioners were appointed with powers over vessels entering and leaving (as they still have today). The Quay was substantially rebuilt in 1845 as part of attempts to improve the town. At the same time, Improvement Commissioners were appointed with the task of making the town commodious and attractive to residents and  the burgeoning tourist trade.  As a small port, it built ships until the late nineteenth century; it never transferred to building motor vessels or to steel hulls. The coming of the railway in 1857 reduced the harbour trade but it revived briefly after the Second World War for the import of fertilizer and animal feed. In 1982 there were 258 ship movements into the harbour.<ref>{{cite book | title= Wells next the Sea: a small port in a wide world | author=Arguile, Roger  | year=2014| isbn=978-1-909796-49-2 }}</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century malting assumed an industrial character dominated by merchants rather than hands-on maltsters. Eventually, the entire estate was acquired by  F. & G. Smith who had maltings in Dereham and Great Ryburgh; they latterly bought out the competition becoming one of the biggest maltsters in the country.  Following the Great War demand began to fall and new methods of production were being used. After a local dispute,  they closed the Wells operation down in 1929. Other agriculture-related enterprises such as the Ipswich-based Eastern Counties Farmers Cooperative were, over the following years,  bought out or closed. The post-war revival of the harbour trade made of the Quay a busy place from the 1960s to the 1990s.
