The name ''Cyclops'' comes from the [[Cyclops]] of [[Greek mythology]] which shares the quality of having a single large eye, which may be either red or black in ''Cyclops''.\n\n[[File:Nauplius larva of a cyclops copepod.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nauplius (larva)|Nauplius larva]] of ''Cyclops'']]\n\n== Anatomy ==\n\n''Cyclops'' individuals may range from \u00bd\u20135&nbsp;mm long<ref>Reed & McIntyre (1995). Cyclops strenuus (Fischer, 1851) sensu lato in Alaska and Canada, with new records of occurrence </ref> and are clearly divided into two sections. The broadly oval front section comprises the head and the first five thoracic [[Segment (biology)|segment]]s. The hind part is considerably slimmer and is made up of the sixth thoracic segment and the four legless pleonic segments. Two caudal appendages project from the rear. Although they may be difficult to observe, ''Cyclops'' has 5 pairs of legs. The long [[antenna (biology)|first antennae]], 2 in number, are used by the males for gripping the females during mating. Afterwards, the female carries the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in two small sacs on her body. The larvae, or [[nauplius (larva)|nauplii]], are free-swimming and unsegmented.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\n\n''Cyclops'' has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] in fresh water, but is less frequent in [[brackish water]]. It lives along the plant-covered banks of stagnant and slow-flowing bodies of water, where it feeds on small fragments of plant material, animals (such as [[nematodes]]), or carrion. It swims with characteristic jerky movements.  ''Cyclops'' has the capacity to survive unsuitable conditions by forming a cloak of slime. Average lifespan is about 3 months.\n\n== Public health importance ==\n\nCyclops is [[Host (biology)|intermediate host]] of [[dracunculiasis]] (guinea-worm disease) and fish tapeworm (''[[Diphyllobothrium|Diphyllobothrium latum]]'') infection.\n\n=== Control methods===\n\nCyclops can be controlled using physical, chemical, biological and engineering methods.\n\n==== Physical ====\n\nStraining of water through piece of fine cloth is sufficient to remove ''Cyclops''. It can also be killed by boiling water, as it is easily killed by heat at 60&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==== Chemical ====\n\n[[Chlorine]] destroys guineaworm larvae and ''Cyclops'' in strength of 5 ppm; although this concentration of chlorine gives bad odour and taste to water. Excess chlorine can be removed with [[Sodium thiosulfate]]. [[Calcium hydroxide]] at dosage of 4 gram per gallon of water can be used. [[Temefos]] kills cyclops at concentration of 1&nbsp;mg/litre.\n\n==== Biological ====\n\nSmall fish like [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]] and ''[[Gambusia]]'' feed on ''Cyclops''. This type of predation was used in Indian state of [[Karnataka]] to eradicate [[dracunculiasis]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=USA National Research Council |author2=World Health Organization |title=Workshop on opportunities for control of dracunculiasis, 16\u201319 June 1982, Washington, D.C.

The name ''Cyclops'' comes from the [[Cyclops]] of [[Greek mythology]] which shares the quality of having a single large eye, which may be either red or black in ''Cyclops''.\n\n[[File:Nauplius larva of a cyclops copepod.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nauplius (larva)|Nauplius larva]] of ''Cyclops'']]\n\n== Anatomy ==\n\n''Cyclops'' individuals may range from \u00bd\u20135&nbsp;mm long<ref>Reed & McIntyre (1995). Cyclops strenuus (Fischer, 1851) sensu lato in Alaska and Canada, with new records of occurrence </ref> and are clearly divided into two sections. The broadly oval front section comprises the head and the first five thoracic [[Segment (biology)|segment]]s. The hind part is considerably slimmer and is made up of the sixth thoracic segment and the four legless pleonic segments. Two caudal appendages project from the rear. Although they may be difficult to observe, ''Cyclops'' has 5 pairs of legs. The long [[antenna (biology)|first antennae]], 2 in number, are used by the males for gripping the females during mating. Afterwards, the female carries the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in two small sacs on her body. The larvae, or [[nauplius (larva)|nauplii]], are free-swimming and unsegmented.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\n\n''Cyclops'' has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] in fresh water, but is less frequent in [[brackish water]]. It lives along the plant-covered banks of stagnant and slow-flowing bodies of water, where it feeds on small fragments of plant material, animals or carrion. It swims with characteristic jerky movements.  ''Cyclops'' has the capacity to survive unsuitable conditions by forming a cloak of slime. Average lifespan is about 3 months.\n\n== Public health importance ==\n\nCyclops is [[Host (biology)|intermediate host]] of [[dracunculiasis]] (guinea-worm disease) and fish tapeworm (''[[Diphyllobothrium|Diphyllobothrium latum]]'') infection.\n\n=== Control methods===\n\nCyclops can be controlled using physical, chemical, biological and engineering methods.\n\n==== Physical ====\n\nStraining of water through piece of fine cloth is sufficient to remove ''Cyclops''. It can also be killed by boiling water, as it is easily killed by heat at 60&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==== Chemical ====\n\n[[Chlorine]] destroys guineaworm larvae and ''Cyclops'' in strength of 5 ppm; although this concentration of chlorine gives bad odour and taste to water. Excess chlorine can be removed with [[Sodium thiosulfate]]. [[Calcium hydroxide]] at dosage of 4 gram per gallon of water can be used. [[Temefos]] kills cyclops at concentration of 1&nbsp;mg/litre.\n\n==== Biological ====\n\nSmall fish like [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]] and ''[[Gambusia]]'' feed on ''Cyclops''. This type of predation was used in Indian state of [[Karnataka]] to eradicate [[dracunculiasis]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=USA National Research Council |author2=World Health Organization |title=Workshop on opportunities for control of dracunculiasis, 16\u201319 June 1982, Washington, D.C.

{"title_page": "Levant (wind)", "text_new": "{{Expert-subject|Meteorology|date=November 2008}}\n{{Mediterranean wind rose}}\n[[File:Clouds covering the walls of Gibraltar Rock.jpg|thumb|Levant cloud forming against the eastern cliffs of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].]]\n\nThe '''levant'''  ({{lang-ca|Llevant}}, {{lang-it|Levante}}, {{lang-mt|Lvant}}, {{lang-el|\u039b\u03b5\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2}}, {{lang-es|Levante}}) is an easterly [[wind]] that blows in the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] and southern France, an example of [[mountain-gap wind]]. In Roussillon it is called \"llevant\" and in Corsica \"levante\".  In the western Mediterranean, particularly when the wind blows through the Strait of [[Gibraltar]], it is called the '''Viento de Levante''' or the '''Levanter'''. It is also known as the [[Solano (wind)|Solano]].\n\nWhen blowing moderately or strongly, the levant causes heavy swells on the Mediterranean.  Usually gentle and damp, the levant frequently brings clouds and rain.  When it brings good weather, it is known as the \"''levant blanc''\"<ref>Meteo-France website (in French) on \"Vents regionaux and vents locaux\"</ref>, or \"''levante calma''\" in Gibraltar.\n\nThe origin of the name is the same as the origin of the [[Levant]], the region of the eastern Mediterranean: it is the Middle French word  \"levant\", the participle of lever \"to raise\" \u2014 as in soleil levant \"rising sun\" \u2014 from the Latin levare. It thus referred to the Eastern direction of the rising sun.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the wind pattern comes from the ''[[levant]]e'' ({{lang-es|east}}), the perceived origin point of the rain, and it is used to describe both east and the wind coming from the east.  The opposite of the levante is the ''[[poniente]]'' ({{lang-es|west}}). Levante originates from the verb ''levantar'' ({{lang-es|to rise}}) and refers to the fact that the sun rises from the east.  In the same way, ''poniente'' comes from the verb ''poner'' (or ''ponerse'' in its intransitive form) ({{lang-es|to put down : lay down : lie down}}) and refers to the fact that the sun sets in the west. Both of these terms, ''levante'' and ''poniente'', are commonly used in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] sea terminology to indicate directions, east and west, while at sea.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Description==\nThe wind rises in the central Mediterranean or around the [[Balearic Islands]] and blows westwards reaching its greatest intensity through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].  The winds are moist carrying [[fog]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in the eastern side of the Strait, but dry in the western side, as the moisture rains on the mountains between [[Algeciras]] and [[Tarifa]].  The winds are well known for creating a particular cloud formation above the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]; In [[Almer\u00eda]], the winds are well known for making the temperatures rise as the wind blows across the desert interior of the province. The Levanter winds can occur at any time in the year, but are most common from May to October.\n\n==The Strait of Gibraltar==\n[[File:Gibraltar Levante Cloud 7.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Levant cloud hanging over the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].]]\nThe [[Strait of Gibraltar]], located at the western entrance to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], is frequently associated with strong gap winds that can produce dangerous seas, especially when they blow against [[tide]], [[ocean current|current]] or [[Swell (ocean)|swell]] through the Strait, which is a narrow sea-level passage about 15&nbsp;km wide and 55&nbsp;km long that is surrounded by terrain reaching several thousand feet.\n\nThe most pronounced gap wind though the Strait, the Levanter, can produce winds of 20-40&nbsp;kt (10-20&nbsp;m/s) in and to the west of the gap when there is higher pressure to the east, over the Mediterranean, with lower pressure to the west of [[Gibraltar]]. The sinking motions accompanying such anticyclonic conditions cause stability in the low-level air flow, strongly suppressing vertical air motion and may result in the formation of an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] within a few thousand feet of the surface. Such an inversion provides a cap that contains the low-level air and results in greater [[topographic]] blocking and the acceleration of the airflow through the gap forming the Strait. Under such circumstances, the winds can go from a moderate or fresh easterly over the [[Alboran Sea]] (the western part of the Mediterranean) to [[gale force]] strength on the western side of the Strait and to its west.  Because the flow is accelerating and there is often a significant pressure gradient through the Strait, the strongest winds are not observed mid-Strait, as might be expected if the funnel mechanism was dominant; rather, the strongest winds are in the western Strait and immediately downwind to the west.  Levanters are most frequent during the warm season from April until October and often reach a peak in spring, when the Mediterranean is comparatively cool, increasing the stability of the low-level air flow.\n\n==The Gibraltar levanter cloud==\n[[File:The classic Levanter cloud.JPG|thumb|The cap cloud that forms in moist stable easterly winds over the Rock of Gibraltar]]\nSometimes the levanter forms a characteristic cloud over the Rock of Gibraltar. However, this is not always the case and a particular set of conditions is required for its formation. \n\nNear the surface, the levanter is moist, but is unsaturated. As the moist air, which must be capped to be stable and so unable to rise by convection, is forced to rise over the Rock, the moisture condenses to form a cloud which streams away west from its top. If wind speeds are too low and stability high in the near-surface layer, the cloud does not form and condensation is also sensitive to small changes in moisture content, such that when the wind across the Rock veers into the southeast, the flow becomes too dry for the cloud to form, bringing drier air from [[North Africa]]. When the wind speed is too low, the air is blocked and unable to rise to form the cloud. At high wind speeds, the turbulent mixing to the lee of the Rock distributes the moisture through a comparatively deep layer and the cloud is, at best, very broken. Often it dissolves immediately west of the Rock in these turbulent windy conditions. \n\nIn suitable conditions, the characteristic \"pennant\" cloud forms downwind. It usually extends about 5&nbsp;km west from the top of the Rock in a turbulent plume. (Similar clouds may sometimes be seen elsewhere - notably the pennant cloud that forms on the [[Matterhorn]] in [[Switzerland]].) This cloud hangs over the centre of the city of [[Gibraltar]], while there is usually sunny weather in to the north and south from the southern outskirts of the city.\n\nOn the western side of the Rock, the winds near sea level are often from the west or southwest, as the air forms large overturning rolls, more than 350&nbsp;m deep in the lee protection of the mountain, but strong winds tend to alter this flow regime, as described in [[#Strong winds across the Rock]]. \n\nThe pennant cloud is not seen in westerly winds, although many of the same processes occur - it is just that the air is usually drier and may be warmer, as well as being less stable - so that convection from the surface is deeper and not capped near the mountaintop level.

It is also likely that the very steep eastern slope of the Rock tends to make the downwind flow too turbulent for cloud formation.) \n\nAround dawn, the flow is relatively smooth through the cloud, but later in the morning, as it becomes warmer, some convective overturning develops within the plume as temperatures rise.\n\nFormation of the cloud is classically very near the top of the ridge-line of the Rock at nearly 400&nbsp;m altitude, but the base is usually a little lower in the turbulent flow to the west.

At the same time, curved arcs of cloud may be seen within or below the pennant cloud, indicating the formation of a [[roll cloud]]. Usually, this produces light and rather variable winds near sea level, at times forming a cyclonic circulation area over Gibraltar Bay and the town.

In Roussillon it is called \"llevant\" and in Corsica \"levante\".  In the western Mediterranean, particularly when the wind blows through the Strait of [[Gibraltar]], it is called the '''Viento de Levante''' or the '''Levanter'''. It is also known as the [[Solano (wind)|Solano]].\n\nWhen blowing moderately or strongly, the levant causes heavy swells on the Mediterranean.  Usually gentle and damp, the levant frequently brings clouds and rain.  When it brings good weather, it is known as the \"''levant blanc''\"<ref>Meteo-France website (in French) on \"Vents regionaux and vents locaux\"</ref>, or \"''levante calma''\" in Gibraltar.\n\nThe origin of the name is the same as the origin of the [[Levant]], the region of the eastern Mediterranean: it is the Middle French word  \"levant\", the participle of lever \"to raise\" \u2014 as in soleil levant \"rising sun\" \u2014 from the Latin levare. It thus referred to the Eastern direction of the rising sun.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the wind pattern comes from the ''[[levant]]e'' ({{lang-es|east}}), the perceived origin point of the rain, and it is used to describe both east and the wind coming from the east.  The opposite of the levante is the ''[[poniente]]'' ({{lang-es|west}}). Levante originates from the verb ''levantar'' ({{lang-es|to rise}}) and refers to the fact that the sun rises from the east.  In the same way, ''poniente'' comes from the verb ''poner'' (or ''ponerse'' in its intransitive form) ({{lang-es|to put down : lay down : lie down}}) and refers to the fact that the sun sets in the west. Both of these terms, ''levante'' and ''poniente'', are commonly used in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] sea terminology to indicate directions, east and west, while at sea.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Description==\nThe wind rises in the central Mediterranean or around the [[Balearic Islands]] and blows westwards reaching its greatest intensity through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].  The winds are moist carrying [[fog]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in the eastern side of the Strait, but dry in the western side, as the moisture rains on the mountains between [[Algeciras]] and [[Tarifa]].  The winds are well known for creating a particular cloud formation above the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]; In [[Almer\u00eda]], the winds are well known for making the temperatures rise as the wind blows across the desert interior of the province. The Levanter winds can occur at any time in the year, but are most common from May to October.\n\n==The Strait of Gibraltar==\n[[File:Gibraltar Levante Cloud 7.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Levant cloud hanging over the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].]]\nThe [[Strait of Gibraltar]], located at the western entrance to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], is frequently associated with strong gap winds that can produce dangerous seas, especially when they blow against [[tide]], [[ocean current|current]] or [[Swell (ocean)|swell]] through the Strait, which is a narrow sea-level passage about 15&nbsp;km wide and 55&nbsp;km long that is surrounded by terrain reaching several thousand feet.\n\nThe most pronounced gap wind though the Strait, the Levanter, can produce winds of 20-40&nbsp;kt (10-20&nbsp;m/s) in and to the west of the gap when there is higher pressure to the east, over the Mediterranean, with lower pressure to the west of [[Gibraltar]]. The sinking motions accompanying such anticyclonic conditions cause stability in the low-level air flow, strongly suppressing vertical air motion and may result in the formation of an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] within a few thousand feet of the surface. Such an inversion provides a cap that contains the low-level air and results in greater [[topographic]] blocking and the acceleration of the airflow through the gap forming the Strait. Under such circumstances, the winds can go from a moderate or fresh easterly over the [[Alboran Sea]] (the western part of the Mediterranean) to [[gale force]] strength on the western side of the Strait and to its west.  Because the flow is accelerating and there is often a significant pressure gradient through the Strait, the strongest winds are not observed mid-Strait, as might be expected if the funnel mechanism was dominant; rather, the strongest winds are in the western Strait and immediately downwind to the west.  Levanters are most frequent during the warm season from April until October and often reach a peak in spring, when the Mediterranean is comparatively cool, increasing the stability of the low-level air flow.\n\n==The Gibraltar levanter cloud==\n[[File:The classic Levanter cloud.JPG|thumb|The cap cloud that forms in moist stable easterly winds over the Rock of Gibraltar]]\nSometimes the levanter forms a characteristic cloud over the Rock of Gibraltar. However, this is not always the case and a particular set of conditions is required for its formation. \n\nNear the surface, the levanter is moist, but is unsaturated. As the moist air, which must be capped to be stable and so unable to rise by convection, is forced to rise over the Rock, the moisture condenses to form a cloud which streams away west from its top. If wind speeds are too low and stability high in the near-surface layer, the cloud does not form and condensation is also sensitive to small changes in moisture content, such that when the wind across the Rock veers into the southeast, the flow becomes too dry for the cloud to form, bringing drier air from [[North Africa]]. When the wind speed is too low, the air is blocked and unable to rise to form the cloud. At high wind speeds, the turbulent mixing to the lee of the Rock distributes the moisture through a comparatively deep layer and the cloud is, at best, very broken. Often it dissolves immediately west of the Rock in these turbulent windy conditions. \n\nIn suitable conditions, the characteristic \"pennant\" cloud forms downwind. It usually extends about 5&nbsp;km west from the top of the Rock in a turbulent plume. (Similar clouds may sometimes be seen elsewhere - notably the pennant cloud that forms on the [[Matterhorn]] in [[Switzerland]].) This cloud hangs over the centre of the city of [[Gibraltar]], while there is usually sunny weather in to the north and south from the southern outskirts of the city.\n\nOn the western side of the Rock, the winds near sea level are often from the west or southwest, as the air forms large overturning rolls, more than 350&nbsp;m deep in the lee protection of the mountain, but strong winds tend to alter this flow regime, as described in [[#Strong winds across the Rock]]. \n\nThe pennant cloud is not seen in westerly winds, although many of the same processes occur - it is just that the air is usually drier and may be warmer, as well as being less stable - so that convection from the surface is deeper and not capped near the mountaintop level. (Low cloud can sometimes be seen on the Rock, early in the morning in westerly winds, but this disappears as temperatures rise. It is also likely that the very steep eastern slope of the Rock tends to make the downwind flow too turbulent for cloud formation.) \n\nAround dawn, the flow is relatively smooth through the cloud, but later in the morning, as it becomes warmer, some convective overturning develops within the plume as temperatures rise.\n\nFormation of the cloud is classically very near the top of the ridge-line of the Rock at nearly 400&nbsp;m altitude, but the base is usually a little lower in the turbulent flow to the west. The top of the cloud is rarely much more than 450&nbsp;m above [[Gibraltar Bay]].\n\n==Strong winds across the Rock==\n\n[[File:The detached Levanter cloud over the Rock of Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|The Levanter cloud becoming detached from the crest of the Rock in strong easterly winds]]\nWhen winds are very strong across the crest of the Rock (usually in excess of about 15 m/s), the cloud becomes detached from the crest of the Rock forming west of a line parallel to the ridge up to about 100 m from it.

It drains a [[timber industry|timber-producing]] area of the [[Northern Oregon Coast Range]] northwest of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. It forms the first [[estuary]] south of the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] along the [[Oregon Coast]], reaching the [[Pacific Ocean]] at [[Seaside, Oregon|Seaside]] in [[Clatsop County]].\n\n==History==\n''Necanicum'' is one of several Indian names in northwest Oregon beginning with ''ne'', meaning ''place''. Necanicum is derived from Ne-hay-ne-hum, the name of an Indian village once on the stream. [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] named it '''Clatsop River''' on January&nbsp;7, 1806, but the name did not stick. The river was also once known as '''Latty Creek''', for William Latty, an early pioneer in the southern part of Seaside.<ref>{{cite book |title=Oregon Geographic Names |authors=Lewis A.

Recent intensive spawning surveys from 1990\u20132000 indicate that only about 600 fish (range 185 to 1135) now use the river. Coho salmon prefer streams with a high degree of structural complexity, including the presence of large woods, flood plains, braided channels, beaver ponds, and occasionally lakes.

In 1967, Ananda Marga headquarters came under attack by locals who were allegedly incited by Communist leaders.{{sfn|Lewis|2011|p=254}} Criticism of corruption in the Indian government by acharyas of Ananda Marga also put it in confrontation with Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. In 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned in India for the alleged murder of Ananda Marga members. In February 1973, Sarkar was poisoned in prison, allegedly by the jail doctor on orders from the higher echelons of government. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an inquest into his poisoning. That demand was never met. So he continued his fast for the next five years, four months, and two days, until 2 August 1978 when he was released from jail after having been acquitted of all charges.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Sydney Hilton bombing===\n{{Main|Sydney Hilton bombing}}\nThe Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing occurred on 13 February 1978, when a [[bomb]] exploded outside the [[Hilton Hotel]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

An ''acarya'' is most commonly a [[monk]] or [[nun]], but in the ''Ananda Marga'' tradition there are also \"family ''acaryas''\". In the [[initiation]] the aspirant makes a commitment to practice meditation and to live in harmony with the universal balance, and is then taught the technique itself. The aspirant is then required to keep the individual [[lesson]]s personal. In addition, he also taught ''Kapalika'' meditation to many ''[[Sannyasa|sany\u00e1sins]]''. His system of ''yoga'' can be termed as ''R\u00e1jadhir\u00e1ja Yoga'', ''Tantra Yoga'', or simply ''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Yoga''. The basic ''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga'' meditation system is called Sahaja Yoga ('simple yoga').

These meetings called ''Dharma Chakras'' (weekly held in a place called ''Dhyan Mandir'') are preceded by the singing of few ''Prabhat Samgiita'' (\"Songs of the New Dawn\" composed by the ''Ananda Marga'' founder) followed by the spiritual dance of ''Lalita Marmika'' along with the singing of and by the practice of meditation.

The concept was first introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by P.R. Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality of psychic expression. They are smaller and subtler than physical [[atom]]s and [[subatomic particle]]s. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron.{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=325}} The author predicted that they would be recognized by conventional science when it is developed much further.\n\n=== Social philosophy ===\nThe social outlook of ''Ananda Marga'' recognizes that the welfare of the [[individual]] is linked with the welfare of the [[collective]], each relying on the other for its [[existence]] and dynamism. According to this philosophy everyone has the [[Rights|right]] to [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] of life and [[Social change|development]] and as such there should be no discrimination on the basis of superficial barriers such as [[race (classification of humans)|race]], nationality and religion. ''Ananda Marga'' advocates a world of [[justice]], security and [[peace]] for all.<ref>[http://anandamarga.org/social-philosophy/ Ananda Marga Social Philosophy]</ref> The Social Philosophy of ''Ananda Marga'' can be categorized under the topics: \n* '''[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]''': in 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of [[Society|human society]] with the [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] of his new theory of \"[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]\".<ref>See: Sarkar, P. R., 1982.</ref> While [[humanism]] extends the recognition of equal rights to all humans, yet tends to anthropocentric worldview, neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to [[universalism]], thus expanding an inclusive spirit of welfare to all living beings and the created world.<ref group=note>\"When the underlying spirit of [[humanism]] is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this [[universe]] \u2013 I have designated this as \"Neohumanism\". This Neohumanism will elevate [[humanism]] to [[universalism]], the [[cult]] of love for all created beings of this [[universe]].\" (Sarkar, P. R., 1982).</ref>\n* '''Education''': according to the ''Ananda Marga'' system \"Education is for [[Moksha|Liberation]].\" Education means the simultaneous development in the physical, mental and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[realm]]s of human [[existence]]. By this, dormant human [[potentialities]] will be awakened and put to proper use. Sarkar said that real education leads to a pervasive [[Feeling|sense]] of love and [[compassion]] for all creation; in the ''Ananda Marga's'' education system, special emphasis is given to [[Morality|moral]] education and the inculcation of idealism together with a \"psycho-pedagogical approach\" and a blending of occidental extroversial science and oriental introversial philosophy.<ref group=note>\"The noblest form of social service is to educate the public and create a sense of consciousness in them. This sense of consciousness is to be instilled in every human being. This is your duty. The goal of education is to elevate the all-round standard, and especially the intellectual standard. In addition, the elevation of the moral standard is extremely necessary in the sphere of education. This moral standard is deficient today. It is lacking in the present educational system also. You are to create a new social order. Therefore, you should first acquire more and more knowledge in different spheres of life and also you are to upgrade your morality. Along with your intellectual standard, if you have morality, then everybody will respect you. Try to acquire as much knowledge as possible through our own books. Education which leads to the acquisition of knowledge plus morality makes for a peaceful society.\" (Sarkar, P. R., ''Discourses on Neo\u2013 humanist Education''.).</ref>\n* '''Culture''': In his discourse \"Talks on Prout\", given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \"culture\" and \"customs\". According to Sarkar \"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\" but \"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\"{{sfn|Sarkar|1968}} The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto:\n{{Quote|''...If the term \"culture\" is usually referred to the original meaning of this word (i.e. from the Greek \"paid\u00e9ia\" to the Latin \"humanitas\", that is to human beings capable of distinguishably mastering the arts, rhetoric, and philosophy), then Sarkar offers a new point of view, with a large universalistic explanation: \u201cthe culture of the whole human race is one, but marked by different local manifestations... it is the same, but varying in expression.\" (Sarkar, P.R., 1987)...''{{sfn|Maggipinto|2000}}}}\n* '''[[Progressive utilization theory|PROUT]]''' (\"[[Progressivism|Progressive]] Utilization [[Theory]]\"): is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] theory first mentioned in 1959 by P.

So only those who do not understand Tantra, or even after understanding Tantra do not want to do any spiritual practice, oppose the cult of Tantra.\"|source=Shrii Shrii Anandamurti\u00b4s \"Tantra and its Effect on Society\", 1959.{{sfn|Anandamurti|1959}}}}\nSarkar weaves continuity with the ancient philosophy of ''Tantra'', infusing new insights in [[Psychology|human psychology]], [[social theory]] and in each individuals' [[role]]s as spiritual and \"socio-economic-cultural-political\" beings.\n''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Tantra'' has a broad [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] base which allows for ways of [[Knowledge|knowing]], [[feeling]] and [[Process (science)|processing]] which go far beyond [[intellect]]uality or limited [[rationality]]. Priorities are given to the spiritual development, as Shrii Shrii \u00c1nandam\u00farti notes, \"spiritual life controls all other arenas of human life.\"<ref>[http://www.gurukul.edu Bussey, Marcus. ''Homo Tantricus: Tantra as an Episteme for Future Generations'']</ref>''Ananda Marga Tantra'' is a [[principle]], a science which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The [[essence]] of ''Tantra'' is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.<ref group=note>\"It is not a religion or empty philosophy which can be confined to the realms of abstract speculation or theoretical debate. Tantra is a process of subjective transformation, which may be practiced by anyone irrespective of gender, cultural background, education, social status or intellectual evolution, as an adequate system of spiritual endeavor is the birthright of all. ''Tantra'' does not discriminate by any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences amongst human beings, as the later might form the basis for one human group to assert superiority over another. ''Tantra'' does, however, give recognition to individual vigor and the development of latent human potentialities, which make some people outstand in their lives. Consequently ''Tantra'' puts greater emphasis on human values than on social values\".(Coyle, G. 1985).</ref>\n\n=== ''Guru'' and Disciple ===\nAccording to ''tantric'' tradition a proper [[preceptor]] and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of ''Tantra''.\nP.R. Sarkar clearly explains<ref>See: Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 and 1994.</ref> that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.\n\n==References==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|group=note|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/100346371/ Abhipremananda Murder case]\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation |title=Tantra and its Effect on Society |last=Anandamurti |first=Shrii Shrii |location=Bhagalpur |publisher= Ananda Marga Pubs |year=1959}}\n* {{citation |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&pg=PA21 |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |title=Travel with the Mystic Master |last=Dharmavedananda |first=\u00c1c. |year=1999 |location=Singapore |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |ISBN=981-04-0864-1}}\n* {{citation|title=Political Parties of Asia and the Pacific |last= Fukui |first= Haruhiro |year= 1985 | publisher=Greenwood Press|page=357 |isbn= 0-313-21350-X|ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=Violence and New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CqS3ILwnmsC&pg=PA250 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973563-1}}\n* {{citation |last = Maggipinto |first = Antonello |contribution = Multilanguage Acquisition, New Technologies, Education and Global Citizenship |editor-last = American Association for Italian Studies |title = Academic journal article from Italian Culture |volume = 18-2 |page =147 |pages = |publisher = AAIS |place = New York |year = 2000 |contribution-url =https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-83245337/multilanguage-acquisition-new-technologies-education}}\n* {{citation |title=PROUT in a Nutshell Part 15 |last=Sarkar |first=Prabhat Ranjan |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |year= 1968 |ISBN= }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|title=Teaching asanas: An Ananda Marga manual for teacher |author=Ananda Marga Aa.

In February 1973, Sarkar was poisoned in prison, allegedly by the jail doctor on orders from the higher echelons of government.

The ''guru'' guides and leads students on the spiritual path. The aspirant [[Learning|learns]] meditation by a qualified ''acarya''. An ''acarya'' is most commonly a [[monk]] or [[nun]], but in the ''Ananda Marga'' tradition there are also \"family ''acaryas''\". In the [[initiation]] the aspirant makes a commitment to practice meditation and to live in harmony with the universal balance, and is then taught the technique itself. The aspirant is then required to keep the individual [[lesson]]s personal. In addition, he also taught ''Kapalika'' meditation to many ''[[Sannyasa|sany\u00e1sins]]''. His system of ''yoga'' can be termed as ''R\u00e1jadhir\u00e1ja Yoga'', ''Tantra Yoga'', or simply ''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Yoga''. The basic ''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga'' meditation system is called Sahaja Yoga ('simple yoga'). The ''sahaja'' system consists of 6 meditation techniques or lessons taught one by one, on a personal basis.<ref group=note>This is the short list of six lessons: 1)First Lesson: ''Iishvara Pranidhana'' (Personal mantra and ''Ishta [[Cakra]]''), 2)Second Lesson: ''Guru Mantra'' (Personal ''[[Guru]] [[Mantra]]''), 3)Third Lesson: ''Tattva Dharana'' (Concentration on ''[[Cakra]]s' [[Tattva]]s''), 4)Fourth Lesson: ''Sadharana Pranayama'' (Basic ''[[Pranayama]]''.

These meetings called ''Dharma Chakras'' (weekly held in a place called ''Dhyan Mandir'') are preceded by the singing of few ''Prabhat Samgiita'' (\"Songs of the New Dawn\" composed by the ''Ananda Marga'' founder) followed by the spiritual dance of ''Lalita Marmika'' along with the singing of and by the practice of meditation.

This [[system]] incorporate [[Practice (social theory)|practice]]s that range from [[hygiene]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[Asanas|yoga postures]], to a [[Science|scientific]] [[Technology|technique]] of [[meditation]] based on [[morality|moral rules]] and directed to the inner fulfillment. It recognizes that a balance is needed between the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mundane]] aspects of [[existence]], and that neither one should be neglected at the [[expense]] of the other.

The following is a brief list of the essential elements of ''Ananda Marga'' Spiritual Philosophy:\n* '''Atma''' or '''[[Soul]]''' and '''[[Paramatma]]''' or the '''[[Cosmic Consciousness]]''': the Consciousness (''Purusa'') is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] in the unit objects forming the \"unit consciousness\" (''atma'') or [[soul]]. Particularly the reflection of the soul on the mind is called ''jiivatma'' and in that case the \"reflector-soul\" is called ''Paramatma'' (Supreme Soul).<ref group=note>''Vis\u2019aya purus\u2019a'vabha\u2019shah jiiva\u2019tma\u2019'': \"The reflection of Consciousness \u2013 ''Purusa'' \u2013 in the unit object is known as ''jiiva\u2019tma'' \u2013 \"unit soul\" \u2013 (''A\u2019nanda Sutram'', Chapter 2, Sutra 8 (2\u20138) in Avadh\u016btika \u0100nanda Mitra \u0100c\u0101ry\u0101, 1981).</ref>\n\n{{Infobox\n|title        = Yama-Niyama\n<!-- This infobox is based on the 10 principles of yogic morality (yama-niyama) \nas explained by Shrii Shrii Anandamurti in ''A Guide to Human Conduct''. -->\n\n|headerstyle  = background:#ccf;\n|labelstyle   = background:#ddf;\n\n|header1 = Yama (Restraint)\n  | label2= Ahim'sa' (Benignity)\n  | data2 = Thinking, speaking, and acting without inflicting pain or harm on another\n  | label3= Satya (Benevolence)\n  | data3 = Thinking and speaking with goodwill\n  | label4= Asteya<br/>(Honesty)\n  | data4 = Not taking or keeping what belongs to others\n  | label5= Brahmacarya (Ideation)\n  | data5 = Constant mental association with the Supreme\n  | label6= Aparigraha (Frugality)\n  | data6 = Non-indulgence in superfluous amenities\n|header7 = Niyama (Regulation)\n  | label8= Shaoca (Cleanliness)\n  | data8 = Physical and mental purity, both internal and external\n  | label9= Santos'a (Contentment)\n  | data9 = Maintaining a state of mental ease\n  | label10= Tapah<br/>(Sacrifice)\n  | data10 = Acceptance of sufferings to reach the spiritual goal\n  | label11= Sva'dhya'ya (Contemplation)\n  | data11 = Clear understanding of any spiritual subject\n  | label12= Iishvara Pran'idha'na (Dedication)\n  | data12 = Adopting the Cosmic Controller as the only ideal of life and moving with ever-accelerating speed toward that Desideratum\n\n|belowstyle = background:#ddf;\n|below = Intent is primary, but both intent and action should conform if possible.\n}}\n* '''Realms of the [[Mind]]''': according to ''Ananda Marga'' philosophy the human mind is composed of five layers called ''Kosas'':<ref group=note>The last three deeper layers are collectively called \"Causal Mind\". \"Causal\" signifies that these layers are in the most direct contact with the \"Causal Consciousness\" from which the mind has evolved and within which it exists.</ref> 1)''Kamamaya Kosa'' (\"desire layer\") or \"Crude Mind\": is the crudest layer, purified through adherence to the yogic code of morality, Yama-Niyama.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' controls the various autonomic activities of the body and the expression of the mental propensities, known as ''vrtti'', in [[Samskrta]].</ref> 2)''Manomaya Kosa'' (\"layer of thinking\") or \"Subtle Mind\": is the layer of thought and memory.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' gives experience of pleasure and pain. It is developed naturally through physical clash, and in ''Ananda Marga sadhana'' by ''pranayama'' with cosmic ideation.</ref> 3)''Atimanasa Kosa'' or \"Supramental Mind\": is the intuitive layer.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa''  gives the capacity of intuitive [[dream]]s, [[clairvoyance]], [[telepathy]] and [[creativity|creative]] insight. It is developed naturally through psychic clash, and in ''Ananda Marga sadhana'' by methods of ''pratyahara'' (withdrawal) such as ''shuddhis'' and ''Guru Puja''.</ref> 4)''Vijinanamaya Kosa'' (\"layer of the special knowledge\") or \"Subliminal Mind\": is the layer of conscience or discrimination (''viveka'') and ''[[Vairagya|vaeragya]]'' (non-attachment).<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' is developed naturally through psychic clash, and its development is accelerated by the process of ''dharana''.</ref> 5)''Hiranyamaya Kosa'' (\"golden level\") or \"Subtle Causal Mind\": is the subtlest layer. Here the [[awareness]] of mind is very close to the direct [[experience]] of \"Supreme Consciousness\".<ref group=note>Here there is only the separation of a thin veil of ignorance. This ''Kosa'' is developed naturally through the attraction for the Great, and ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' accelerates this process for ''[[sadhaka]]s'' (spirituals aspirants).</ref>\n* '''[[Microvita theory]]''': ''Microvita'' is plural for ''Micro-vitum'' and literally means \"micro-life\". The concept was first introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by P.R. Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality of psychic expression. They are smaller and subtler than physical [[atom]]s and [[subatomic particle]]s. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron.{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=325}} The author predicted that they would be recognized by conventional science when it is developed much further.\n\n=== Social philosophy ===\nThe social outlook of ''Ananda Marga'' recognizes that the welfare of the [[individual]] is linked with the welfare of the [[collective]], each relying on the other for its [[existence]] and dynamism. According to this philosophy everyone has the [[Rights|right]] to [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] of life and [[Social change|development]] and as such there should be no discrimination on the basis of superficial barriers such as [[race (classification of humans)|race]], nationality and religion. ''Ananda Marga'' advocates a world of [[justice]], security and [[peace]] for all.<ref>[http://anandamarga.org/social-philosophy/ Ananda Marga Social Philosophy]</ref> The Social Philosophy of ''Ananda Marga'' can be categorized under the topics: \n* '''[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]''': in 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of [[Society|human society]] with the [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] of his new theory of \"[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]\".<ref>See: Sarkar, P. R., 1982.</ref> While [[humanism]] extends the recognition of equal rights to all humans, yet tends to anthropocentric worldview, neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to [[universalism]], thus expanding an inclusive spirit of welfare to all living beings and the created world.<ref group=note>\"When the underlying spirit of [[humanism]] is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this [[universe]] \u2013 I have designated this as \"Neohumanism\". This Neohumanism will elevate [[humanism]] to [[universalism]], the [[cult]] of love for all created beings of this [[universe]].\" (Sarkar, P. R., 1982).</ref>\n* '''Education''': according to the ''Ananda Marga'' system \"Education is for [[Moksha|Liberation]].\" Education means the simultaneous development in the physical, mental and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[realm]]s of human [[existence]]. By this, dormant human [[potentialities]] will be awakened and put to proper use. Sarkar said that real education leads to a pervasive [[Feeling|sense]] of love and [[compassion]] for all creation; in the ''Ananda Marga's'' education system, special emphasis is given to [[Morality|moral]] education and the inculcation of idealism together with a \"psycho-pedagogical approach\" and a blending of occidental extroversial science and oriental introversial philosophy.<ref group=note>\"The noblest form of social service is to educate the public and create a sense of consciousness in them. This sense of consciousness is to be instilled in every human being. This is your duty. The goal of education is to elevate the all-round standard, and especially the intellectual standard. In addition, the elevation of the moral standard is extremely necessary in the sphere of education. This moral standard is deficient today. It is lacking in the present educational system also. You are to create a new social order. Therefore, you should first acquire more and more knowledge in different spheres of life and also you are to upgrade your morality. Along with your intellectual standard, if you have morality, then everybody will respect you. Try to acquire as much knowledge as possible through our own books. Education which leads to the acquisition of knowledge plus morality makes for a peaceful society.\" (Sarkar, P. R., ''Discourses on Neo\u2013 humanist Education''.).</ref>\n* '''Culture''': In his discourse \"Talks on Prout\", given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \"culture\" and \"customs\". According to Sarkar \"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\" but \"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\"{{sfn|Sarkar|1968}} The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto:\n{{Quote|''...If the term \"culture\" is usually referred to the original meaning of this word (i.e. from the Greek \"paid\u00e9ia\" to the Latin \"humanitas\", that is to human beings capable of distinguishably mastering the arts, rhetoric, and philosophy), then Sarkar offers a new point of view, with a large universalistic explanation: \u201cthe culture of the whole human race is one, but marked by different local manifestations... it is the same, but varying in expression.\" (Sarkar, P.R., 1987)...''{{sfn|Maggipinto|2000}}}}\n* '''[[Progressive utilization theory|PROUT]]''' (\"[[Progressivism|Progressive]] Utilization [[Theory]]\"): is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] theory first mentioned in 1959 by P.

Where there is no spiritual practice, where people pray to God for the fulfilment of narrow worldly desires, where people's only slogan is \"Give us this and give us that\" \u2013 only there do we find that Tantra is discouraged.

''Homo Tantricus: Tantra as an Episteme for Future Generations'']</ref>''Ananda Marga Tantra'' is a [[principle]], a science which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The [[essence]] of ''Tantra'' is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.<ref group=note>\"It is not a religion or empty philosophy which can be confined to the realms of abstract speculation or theoretical debate. Tantra is a process of subjective transformation, which may be practiced by anyone irrespective of gender, cultural background, education, social status or intellectual evolution, as an adequate system of spiritual endeavor is the birthright of all. ''Tantra'' does not discriminate by any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences amongst human beings, as the later might form the basis for one human group to assert superiority over another. ''Tantra'' does, however, give recognition to individual vigor and the development of latent human potentialities, which make some people outstand in their lives. Consequently ''Tantra'' puts greater emphasis on human values than on social values\".(Coyle, G. 1985).</ref>\n\n=== ''Guru'' and Disciple ===\nAccording to ''tantric'' tradition a proper [[preceptor]] and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of ''Tantra''.\nP.R. Sarkar clearly explains<ref>See: Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 and 1994.</ref> that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.\n\n==References==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|group=note|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/100346371/ Abhipremananda Murder case]\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation |title=Tantra and its Effect on Society |last=Anandamurti |first=Shrii Shrii |location=Bhagalpur |publisher= Ananda Marga Pubs |year=1959}}\n* {{citation |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&pg=PA21 |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |title=Travel with the Mystic Master |last=Dharmavedananda |first=\u00c1c. |year=1999 |location=Singapore |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |ISBN=981-04-0864-1}}\n* {{citation|title=Political Parties of Asia and the Pacific |last= Fukui |first= Haruhiro |year= 1985 | publisher=Greenwood Press|page=357 |isbn= 0-313-21350-X|ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=Violence and New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CqS3ILwnmsC&pg=PA250 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973563-1}}\n* {{citation |last = Maggipinto |first = Antonello |contribution = Multilanguage Acquisition, New Technologies, Education and Global Citizenship |editor-last = American Association for Italian Studies |title = Academic journal article from Italian Culture |volume = 18-2 |page =147 |pages = |publisher = AAIS |place = New York |year = 2000 |contribution-url =https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-83245337/multilanguage-acquisition-new-technologies-education}}\n* {{citation |title=PROUT in a Nutshell Part 15 |last=Sarkar |first=Prabhat Ranjan |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |year= 1968 |ISBN= }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|title=Teaching asanas: An Ananda Marga manual for teacher |author=Ananda Marga Aa.

Moira was one of the major supporting characters in Claremont's Uncanny X-Men run. She worked as a geneticist and was an expert in mutant affairs. She was romantically involved with [[Professor X]].

She was the longest running human associate of the X-Men and was [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]'s colleague, confidante, and also once his fianc\u00e9e, having met and fallen in love with him while they were postgraduates at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #117</ref> She ended their engagement for unknown reasons and returned to Scotland. She was married to her old flame, the late politician Joseph MacTaggert which caused delays with her former engagement to Xavier. Joe proved to be an abusive husband; Moira separated from him after he beat her into a week long coma and, as it is implied, raped her, leaving her pregnant. She kept her son's existence a secret, and when Joe refused her a divorce she allowed people to believe she was widowed.\n\nShe eventually created a Mutant Research Center on [[Muir Island]], off the coast of [[Scotland]]. Moira was forced to contain and imprison her son Kevin, later called [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], when he developed reality warping abilities and severe psychosis. One of Moira's goals was to understand human/mutant genetics, in order to cure her son. However, it is suggested that she intentionally married Joseph and gave birth to Kevin in order to produce a mutant with reality-bending abilities.\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|First appearance from ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #96.<br>Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]\nMoira's connection to the X-Men began long before the team formed. The silent partner in the founding of [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] and co-creator of [[Cerebro]], Moira assisted Xavier in helping the young [[Jean Grey]] recover after the traumatic triggering of her mutant abilities.\n\nMoira was a kind woman who took to helping humans and mutants alike. She rescued a young Rahne Sinclair ([[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]) from an angry mob, and adopted the girl. She even attempted to treat Xavier's son, a mutant known as [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] who suffered from [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]]. When a confused, traumatized [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] first arrived from the future, he washed up in Scotland unable to speak English, and it was Moira who stood up for him against an angry mob. Taking him back to Muir Island, he scanned her mind and learned English in the process, as well as the truth about her son, and promised to keep her secrets. She taught him literature and the customs of the time and introduced him to Xavier. They became close friends ever since, being the first kind person Cable met in the present timeline, her later death devastating him enough to leave the X-Men. When [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] was reduced to infancy, he was entrusted to Moira's care on Muir Island, where she altered his genetic code in an attempt to keep him from reverting to villainy.\n\n===Involvement with the X-Men===\nMoira appeared at Xavier's call to act as \"housekeeper\" for the team while they were on missions (a position that required her to demonstrate her proficiency with an [[M16 rifle]] against a demon within hours of her arrival). Though each of the X-Men formed some sort of relationship with the \"Widow\" MacTaggert, Moira and Sean Cassidy ([[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]) hit it off immediately, forming an on-and-off relationship that would last for the remainder of her life. Proteus' escape and eventual destruction at the hands of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and the X-Men left Moira in a position of ethical compromise again: though Banshee stopped her from cloning her son, she saved his genetic structure on disk to allow herself the future option of bringing him back.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #128</ref><ref>''Classic X-Men'' #36, \"Outside-In\".</ref>\n\nAfter finding out that her foster daughter, Rahne, was a mutant, Moira was the catalyst for change. She talked a discouraged Xavier into opening his school to the next generation of [[New Mutants]], with Rahne becoming an initial member. She was also an integral part of the support for the X-Men and the New Mutants, providing medical aid including cloning Xavier after the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] attacks, transferring his mind into a new body and restoring his ability to walk after a Brood embryo nearly killed him.\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 3.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Muir Islanders ([[Muir Island]] X-Men) on the cover of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #254. Art by [[Marc Silvestri]].]]\nWith the apparent death of the X-Men, Moira and Banshee formed an alternate team based from Muir, and carried on as the leader of the team without him when his duties with the X-Men called him away.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #254</ref> Her behavior became unpredictable, her temper impressive, and her decisions harsh and unforgiving as she displayed behavior that made all who knew her suspicious. On Muir, she began to pit her charges against each other in an arena in merciless battles, supposedly allowing her the opportunity to study mutants in action.\n\nMoira and her islanders were involved in the return of Proteus due to the influence of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]]. This was a four-part story in 1991, that ran through that year's annuals for the New Warriors, X-Force, New Mutants and X-Factor. The [[Shadow King]], the corrupting entity behind the island, allowed the Islanders to act heroically in defense of innocent lives.\n\nEventually, the entire population of Muir Island was identified as being possessed by and mentally corrupted by Shadow King, pitting the Islanders against the combined forces of the X-Men and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] before Xavier freed them from his control.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 4.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Moira confronted by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #2. Art by [[Jim Lee]].]]\nMoira's alteration of Magneto did not go unnoticed indefinitely. Enraged when he discovered Moira had tampered with his [[free will]], Magneto took Moira captive and forced her to perform the procedure on half of the X-Men, turning them against their teammates.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #2</ref> While Moira's alterations worked, it was revealed that, due to mutants' powers requiring their body chemistry to operate in a specific manner, use of a mutant's powers would cause them to automatically resist the 'programming' and reverse the effects of the procedure, so anything Magneto had done was of his own free will. While hostage on Asteroid M, Moira witnessed [[Fabian Cortez]] draining Magneto of his powers and manipulating him into placing him as his right hand. Though Cortez fled, it was an observation that would eventually put Moira back in the hands of the Acolytes. Back on Earth, Moira was unable to accept her betrayal of her surrogate family and her own infallibility, and fled the X-Mansion, with Banshee in pursuit.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #6</ref>\n\n===Excalibur and the Legacy Virus===\nWhen a mysterious virus began attacking the genetically engineered [[Genegineer|mutate]] population of [[Genosha]], Moira volunteered her services as a geneticist and was forced to watch as the former slaves were decimated by disease. Returning to the X-Mansion, Moira found [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] suffering from the same illness, later identified as the [[Legacy Virus]]. Moving back to Muir Island after the girl\u2019s death, Moira became the key figure in working for a cure to the disease (during this time, she also worked on curing Wolfsbane's artificial bond with [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]).\n\nThe European superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] took up residence on Muir Island after assisting Moira.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #71</ref> She had been attacked by agents of [[Mister Sinister]] who was seeking the genetic information on her son. Moira became an official member of the group, acting as their medic, team mother, and morale officer. An information leak revealed her to be the only human infected by the Legacy Virus\u2014a bizarre turn of events possibly caused by her long exposure to the infected on Genosha, her autopsy of Illyana, or some susceptibility because she gave birth to a mutant.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #80</ref> It was later established that Moira is in fact a mutant. Despite these events, she maintained a strong outlook on life, helping to maintain discipline, reduce tension, and increase the team's effectiveness throughout Europe. She convinced the team to stay behind when [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] emerged, telling them they might be needed if other heroes fell.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #101</ref>\n\nConferring with the X-Men's [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] did not result in appreciable progress. Locking herself in quarantine in a final attempt to cure the virus without endangering any of her teammates, Moira found her attempts foiled by her foster daughter, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Douglock]]. Wolfsbane originally leapt through the closing doors of the laboratory as the quarantine took effect. She soon found herself a willing assistant to her foster mother's work. Douglock later caused much unintentional damage, his judgement clouded by personal feelings for Wolfsbane.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #115</ref><ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #120</ref> Moira takes time off from her research to attend the bachelorette party and the wedding for her friends Meggan and Brian Braddock.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #124-125 (September\u2013October 1998)</ref>\n[[Image:Mactaggert 5.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Final moments in ''[[X-Men|X-Men (vol. 2)]]'' #108.<br>Art by [[Leinil Francis Yu]]]]\n\nMoira did eventually find a cure for the disease, when the terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] manipulated her research to force the virus to target only humans. Mystique, partly assisted by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], then destroyed Muir Island, de-powered Wolfsbane with the power nullifier once developed by Forge, and brutally injured Moira.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #388</ref><ref>''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' #16</ref> [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] attempted to save Moira's life. Despite Rogue's powers temporarily granting her medical knowledge, she was unable to do so. Moira clung to life long enough to mentally transfer the information to Xavier in one final embrace between the former lovers. Xavier nearly went with her into death, but Jean Grey and Cable intervened on the astral plane, talking him down. She appeared to died in the X-Men's jet, far above the Atlantic Ocean, and was later buried in Scotland.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #108</ref> A psychic representation of Moira was seen as an active portion of Xavier's consciousness as he worked on rebuilding Genosha.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> \n\nMoira is next seen in the afterlife, in which she, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], [[Gwen Stacy]], and [[Dead Girl (comics)|Dead Girl]] assist [[Doctor Strange]] in battling a being known as the Pitiful One. Moira finds herself more interested in the book club she formed with Mockingbird and Gwen Stacy then in battling evil.<ref>''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'' (#1-5, Marvel, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7851-2031-9}})</ref>\n\n===''X-Men: Deadly Genesis''===\nAfter the events of M-Day and upon the reawakening of Vulcan, significant portions of Moira's history with Xavier and the Original X-Men are called into light. While in the rubble of Muir Island, Banshee sees Moira but she completely ignores him and leads him to an old stockroom, where Sean finds old, important notes from the Professor which reveals that during the early years of Xavier's Academy, Moira founded and ran a secondary facility not far from the Xavier School, in which she had her own students; youths whom she took out of bad situations and adopted as her wards, training them in their abilities without the highly militant regimen of Charles' X-Men.\n\nWhen [[Krakoa]] captured the original X-Men, it was Moira's students whom Charles went to first\u2014not the second team of Wolverine, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Banshee, Colossus, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] as it was originally believed\u2014putting them through the psionic equivalent of [[recruit training|boot camp]] and allowing them to believe they were being trained over months as X-Men. Charles took them from Moira's care immediately.\n\nMoira's students\u2014[[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] (Gabriel Summers, the [[Third Summers brother|lost brother]] of X-Men [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Havok), [[Petra (comics)|Petra]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Sway (comics)|Sway]]\u2014were apparently all killed, and Xavier suppressed even the memory of them from his own students, to keep them from going back to save them. Only Moira's project tapes, one made directly after the event before Xavier could suppress the memories, and an abandoned research center remain as clues.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1-6</ref>\n\n===Chaos War===\nDuring the \"[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]\" storyline, Moira MacTaggert is brought back from the afterlife, alongside the fallen X-Men members, John Proudstar, Banshee, three Madrox dupes, Sophie and Esme Cuckoo, after what happened to the death realms.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #1</ref> After escaping from Carrion Crow, the group discovers that Moira has been possessed by [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s ghost.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #2</ref>\n\n===''House of X'' ===\nIn 2019's ''[[House of X]]'', it is revealed that Moira is actually a mutant who possesses the power of reincarnation, starting her life again in the past after her death, possessing her full memories of her prior lives. She is also revealed to be alive, having faked her death at the hands of the Brotherhood by using a Shi'ar Golem which impersonated and died in her place which indicates that it was Moira's replica that was seen in the afterlife and was brought back to life, during the Chaos War.\n\n====The Lives of Moira MacTaggert====\n'''Life 1'''\nMoira Kinross was born to powerful Scots nobleman Lord Kinross and when she turned 13, her mutant ability manifested, but due to her passive power, there were no signs indicating that she had become a mutant other than a strong, temporary fever. Living a simple life, Moira meets Charles Xavier, but he passes through without them forming a bond. She later marries a man named Kenneth Cowan and has three children: twin boys Callum and Dean, and a girl named Abigail. Kenneth dies when Moira is 68 years old, and she passes away from [[congestive heart failure]] at age 74.\n\n'''Life 2'''\nHer second life began in utero, having already become fully sentient and possessing a perfect recollection of her prior life when she turned 13, which is when her powers first manifest. This allowed Moira to appear intellectually gifted, and she was pushed in the direction of academia. She didn't fight her parents' intentions, since she intended to understand her true nature. After she verified that she wasn\u2019t suffering from psychosis or a disorder, and having lived through one life with Kenneth and learning all his faults, she makes a point not to fall in love with him when they met. She enrolls at Oxford at age 16, becomes a biology professor at 20, founds the Muir Research Institute at 31 and at 44 she finally deduced she was a mutant after seeing Charles Xavier coming out as one on television. She boards a plane to the United States of America in order to meet him, however, the plane crashes before reaching its destination, killing Moira.\n\n'''Life 3'''\nMoira made a point of finding Xavier earlier in her third life. She meets Charles Xavier when they were both at Oxford University, however she becomes turned off by his arrogance and a thinly veiled god complex. So she instead devotes her life to finding a cure for mutation, which she compared to cancer. Moira founds again the Muir Research Institute, and at 36 she identifies the X-gene. Just when it appears Moira had rid herself of her reincarnation powers, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants attack the Muir Research Institute. Able to see the future, Destiny alone is able to sense Moira's mutant status and see the effects her reincarnations are having on the timeline. Destiny orders Moira to stop wasting her gift by working against her own kind, and instead help prevent a seemingly inevitable future where mankind's machines wipe out the mutant race. Destiny also tells Moira of her future, revealing that Moira will ultimately live either ten or eleven lives, depending on the choices she makes in the tenth cycle. Destiny also reveals that if Moira dies before her powers manifest at 13, she won't reincarnate. With that, Destiny warns Moira that she'll continue to hunt her in each new life if she doesn't work for the betterment of mutantkind. By Destiny's request, Moira is then killed by being slowly burned alive by Pyro so she would always remember what this slow and painful death feels like.\n\n'''Life 4'''\nIn her fourth life, reconsidering the positive nature of mutants and Xavier himself, Moira throws herself into studying the human-mutant dilemma. She meets Xavier and goes on to fall in love with and marry him, with the couple establishing the Xavier School for Gifted Children. She, Xavier and the X-Men fight for the mutant cause for years, but at age 55, Moira is killed by Sentinels. That ultimately means Destiny's vision was right as she warned Moira that humans would always try to exterminate mutants.\n\n'''Life 5'''\nNow choosing aggression as a response to the violent tendencies of humanity, Moira runs away from home at 13, to encounter Xavier a full decade earlier than when they're supposed to meet. Not wasting any time, Moira opens her mind to Xavier so he can see how his dream fails in her past lives. The mind-reading radicalizes him, forcing the duo to form the mutant nation of Faraway instead of a school. It seemed mutants were finally safe from humanity. Yet, Boliver Trask's adaptive-learning Sentinels still make their way there, and Moira is initially injured in an attack when she was 43 and dies a year later during a genocide.\n\n'''Life 6'''\nIn her sixth life, Moira discovers the true threat to mutants are not Sentinels or Humanity, but ironically, Time itself. It turns out that while mutants are the natural evolution response to Humans, they will not be the next evolutionary step for Them, and they never will be because Humans will render evolution obsolete by changing its environment around its needs, rather than adapting to that same environment. Humans will use technology to extend their life and when they reach an evolutionary stagnation, they will overtime integrate themselves with it, creating in the process a genetically engineered new species, the pinnacle of humanity without natural evolution, the Post-Humans (''Homo novissima''), blue-hued human-machine hybrids that will rule the Earth and bring mutants nearly to extinction, one thousand years in the future. The last surviving mutants are kept captive in preserve areas, as a diversionary tactic to keep them from interfering with the process of breeding something far beyond human or mutant. Moira and Wolverine are among them because they were able to survive on each other's blood. One of the Post-Humans, the Librarian, comes to them and reveal how they'll achieve Godhood. Due to the Post-Humans techo-organic nature, it allows them to be more readily absorbed by the Phalanx in a process known as Ascension and join the physical form of the Phalanx, and the hive mind of the Dominion system to artificially force their evolution into higher beings once again, gaining in the process control over time and space. The Librarian intends to send Moira and Wolverine to another planet to prevent Moira from dying and use her knowledge against them in her resurrection. However, the Librarian underestimated Wolverine who manages to kill him and afterwards, with Moira's consent, kills her too.\n\n'''Life 7'''\nWith the knowledge that the Trask Family is responsible for creating the Sentinels and learning how Humanity will use it to overtake mutantkind, Moira spends her seventh life eradicating the Trask bloodline. Bolivar, Donald, Gwyneth and Simon Trask are systematically murdered over the span of a decade, with Moira even taking out their children for good measure. But when she thought she had successfully eliminated the potential for Sentinel creation, Moira lost all hope when she sadly discovered Sentinels were still being created. She finally understood that Mutantkind\u2019s fall is the \"Inevitable Truth\" as the Artificial Intelligence is unavoidable since it's a discovery and not a creation. This realization radicalized her as Sentinels killed her again.\n\n'''Life 8'''\nAbandoning Xavier's peaceful dream to foster a safe future for mutants, Moira seeks out Magneto instead. Presenting Magneto with tales of her past lives and his future failures, Moira convinced him to join her. Together they conquered America, establishing the House of M and initiated the War of M. However during the war, Moira witness Magneto being defeated and killed by the combined might of Earth's humans and mutants heroes in the likes of the Fantastic Four, Avengers and X-Men. Moira is imprisoned and later killed in a failed prison escape.\n\n'''Life 9'''\nThough eventually a failure, the life-defining decision Moira made to turn to Magneto, did validate her radical approach to beat humanity through force. Magneto was simply not enough. To that end, in her ninth life, Moira woke Apocalypse from his slumber early. Forming a powerful union that leads to the creation of the X-Men, they destroy their two strongest opponents, Xavier and Magneto, gather their Four Horsemen and launch the Apocalypse War. The war provokes a reaction from humanity in the form of the Man-Machine Supremacy, an alliance between humans and machines which culminates with Nimrod becoming online for the first time. One hundred years later, most mutants have been driven out of the solar system as the war still rages. Apocalypse's forces split into two teams, as one group attacks the Temple of Concordance, while another group heads into Nimrod's vast archives to extract vital information about its origins. Once the info is gathered, Apocalypse sends Wolverine away and stays behind to take on Nimrod once it realized that the archives were being raided. Wolverine's destination is revealed to be a container that holds Moira MacTaggert in stasis for over 16 years. With the data embedded into Moira through a techno-organic interface designed by Apocalypse himself, she now knows how and when Nimrod was first brought online, but for that information to actually be useful, Logan kills her.\n\n'''Life 10'''\nMoira\u2019s tenth life occurs in the current iteration of the Marvel Universe. When she meets Xavier, she allowed him to read her mind to learn everything her lives had entailed. Since then she's been using the information from her previous lives to work with Xavier and Magneto to save mutants from humans and machines. As the years passed, it's revealed through her journals that Moira deliberately used her genetic expertise to find mates for herself and Professor X that, in combination with their own mutant genes, would potentially spawn mutants with reality-warping powers (Proteus and Legion), because she knew someone with that power would be needed in the future to enable the mutant resurrection protocol. She notes how her influence indirectly, imprinted the idea for a mutant stronghold in Magneto's mind, after Xavier used his powers to show Magneto the lives of Moira. This is why he created so many of his own, from Asteroid M to Avalon and Genosha. She reluctantly allowed Xavier to read her mind over and over again, and worries that, while he is still being unacceptably hopeful and idealistic, he is becoming too dependent on her interpretation of past-life events. She also fears that his psyche will fracture which will eventually lead to the creation of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] when Charles used his telepathic powers to shut down Erik\u2019s mind completely. Given her knowledge of Sinister's treachery on her previous lifes, Moira laments to learn that without her knowledge or consent, Xavier and Magneto tried to recruit him nevertheless, realizing in the process that Sinister has turned himself into a chimera mutant, decades ahead of schedule compared to the other timelines, that chimera being the mutant clone of himself infused with Thunderbird's DNA. Eventually, Moira had realized she had spent too much time in the spotlight working overtly with Xavier and needed to return to the shadows, in order to do so, she and Xavier used the advanced technology from the Shi'ar to do some preliminary testing for their theory that a mutant could be restored from back-up, creating in the process a Shi'ar golem, a living husk whose empty body was then imprinted with Moira's mental scan, recorded and re-uploaded by Charles Xavier but apparently without all the knowledge lying inside of her.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref> Moira then replaced herself with the decoy at some point allowing her to continued working from the shadows with Xavier. The decoy would eventually be killed during the attack of the Brotherhood. Moira also notes that though Xavier kept fighting her influence, even using on two occasions the Cerebro unit to remove from his mind the knowledge of their plan, but following his demise at Cyclops' hands and his eventual return to the living, he had apparently  become a man with a very different purpose, instead of his peaceful dream of coexistence between man and mutant which he believed at one point, Xavier now envisions a world where a mutant nation must be created as a seat from which mutants will rise as the dominant species on the planet. Moira has since taken residence in \"No-Place\" a blackout zone within the newly sovereign, living island nation of [[List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters:_K#Krakoa|Krakoa]] with Xavier and Magneto, the only people aware of her being alive and her actual role in this grand plan, and has become apparently very paranoid in her isolation, as she is deeply afraid of the notion of Destiny being revived to placate Mystique, or of any precognitive mutant in general because she fears what would happen if the other mutants discovered that they really are doomed.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFor decades, Dr. Moira MacTaggert was depicted as a baseline human with the normal human strength of a woman of her age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise. However, in the 2019 storyline, \"House of X\", Moira was revealed to actually be a mutant with the ability to reincarnate herself upon death, reverting back to the moment of her initial conception with all the memories she experienced in her previous lifetimes from as early as in utero.<ref name=\"PoX2\">{{cite comic|title=House of X|volume=1|issue=#2|writer=[[Jonathan Hickman]]|artist=Pepe Larraz|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August 7, 2019}}</ref> This allows her to manipulate the course of history by changing her own actions and thereby affecting people and circumstances that result from her presence. Her lifetimes have armed her with significant experience, including expertise in the fields of anthropology and genetics, firearms mastery, and leading various mutant survival movements until their eventual downfall.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\nAccording to Destiny, Moira's reincarnation cycle is finite. When she encountered Destiny during her third life, she was informed that she had \"10, maybe 11\" lives in total, noting that if Moira were to die before her mutant power manifested at the age of 13, the reincarnation cycle would end.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\nHer x-gene is also undetectable during her life, providing the ultimate camouflage to mutant sensors and detectors which will see her as a baseline human. Telepathic intrusions on her mind will only see the memories of her current lifetime, however, telepaths can see all her lives' memories as long as she allows it.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the 1995-1996 \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, Moira is the wife of [[Bolivar Trask]], and head of the London-based Human High Council. As resistance to Apocalypse's reign, Moira and her husband designed the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] and armed the human resistance with an impressive weapons array. Their main focus was a plan to destroy Apocalypse's forces in their North American positions, even though this would mean the deaths of many innocent civilians that had not yet escaped the country. The tyrant however, backfires by activating his Sea Walls, slaughtering the Council and those within the Sea Walls reach.\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Moira is the step-mother of Legion (stating that his father had been killed in a bombing in Israel) and therefore one of the few humans allowed to live on Fortress X. She also posed as the AI X, so she could use communication worms and sensors to communicate with and monitor the residents of Fortress X. It was later discovered that she was actually one of the multiple personalities of Legion, created as a \"Psychic Anti-body\" in order to protect Legion from Doctor Nemesis' actions on David's mind, as he and the X-Club were processing the deletion of the personas in order to stabilize David's psyche. Her power is so immense that when she was discovered by Xavier, she was able to defeat him and established the Age of X reality, where mutants were besieged into the Fortress X, everyday attacked by the waves of soldiers of the Human Coalition and used the personalities inside David's mind along with the mutants of Utopia to fill this new world where David would be happy and seen as a hero, as part of the Force Warriors, the protectors of the Fortress, who erected force walls around the citadel every day. Even memories were rewritten, and a background was created. The telepaths and a few others mutants who were able to retain knowledge about the true universe were kept in the X-Brig, considered as mutants too dangerous for the community, but their imprisonment was because they might use their powers to reveal the truth. \nWhen her victims slowly understood that this reality wasn't their one, she manipulated both Danielle Moonstar and her Moonstar Cadre in order to make them to stop any further discovery. Eventually her depiction was revealed and Legion absorb her. Later she offers to make a better world for David, but he declines her offer. During the Lost Legion story Moira's powers were the main target of another personality of Legion and at the end she was seen inside David's mind cursing Xavier.\n\n===Cross-Time Caper===\nReichminister of Genetics Moira MacTaggert, who hails from a reality in which Earth is dominated by Nazis,<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #6 (1989)</ref> is featured in ''Excalibur'' #10 and 11 when she is brought into [[Earth-616]] by the actions of a confused [[Widget (comics)|Widget]]. Making the trip with her is her personal bodyguard, a [[Nazi]] [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and Moira's personal train, powered by an alternate [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]]. It was also hinted that this Moira was behind the Super Team Lightning Force (a Nazi version of Excalibur). Moira's violent actions ultimately result in Excalibur team being sent on a long and arduous cross-dimensional trip.\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Moira MacTaggert was declared a criminal for attempting to cure her son [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Kevin]] of the mutant gene and his psychosis. King [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s mutant supremacy saw this as an act against mutantkind, and [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] were dispatched to destroy Muir Island and capture Moira. Though Moira escaped, Kevin was also freed, sending him on a gruesome killing spree that was attributed to Moira as failed experiments, as she chases him across the globe. When the reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] caught Proteus's attention, Moira emerged from hiding to warn them about her son, who was intrigued by their presence and desired to ruin the realities they attempted to fix. When he attacks the team, Moira shot him, exposing him to the metal that was his deadly allergy and only weakness, forcing him to find a new body. Unsurprisingly, he chose to possess his mother, and rather than allow her son to possess her and use her against them, Moira commits suicide.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #70-71</ref>\n\n===New Exiles===\nOn the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]] face a squad of alternate 'core X-Men' who are loyal to Lilandra. These X-Men include an alternate version of Moira MacTaggert who is not married on this world or is going by her maiden name, Kinross. Moira's codename is Hypernova and her powers are energy blasts. It is not known whether she is a mutant on this world or has gained powers through another method.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]]'' #15 (2008)</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Moira MacTaggert is the ex-wife of [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]], and their son David MacTaggert is [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Proteus|Proteus]]. This version of Moira needs two crutches in order to move around. Moira runs a school/hospital for sick mutants, and assists in the Xavier Institute from behind the scenes. She does this even though Charles left her to join [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s dream of a mutant society, abandoning her to raise their mentally ill child on her own. When Proteus escapes and begins [[body hopping]], Moira calls in the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] for assistance. After murdering hundreds, Proteus is seemingly crushed to death under a car.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #15-19 (2002)</ref>\n\nLater, the X-Men learn that Moira has been funding her hospital by producing and selling \"[[Banshee (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Banshee]]\", a lethal and addictive Mutant Growth Hormone<ref>Ult X v1 94</ref> which amplifies mutant powers, made from the genetic material of [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|Wolverine]]. When Wolverine attempts to destroy her Banshee supply, Moira attacks him with the previously unknown mutant ability to emit a [[Banshee (comics)|deafening sonic cry]]. Wolverine quickly defeats Moira and leaves her to die in the exploding hospital, but she is later shown to have somehow survived when [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] finds her emerging from the smoldering ruins. Her ensuing conversation with him implies that she is now in league with Quicksilver.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Moira appears in episodes of ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Lally Cadeau]].<ref name=\"comicbook\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/08/05/x-men-moira-mactaggert-who-powers-of-x/|title=X-Men: Who is Moira MacTaggert?|last=MAgnett|first=Chase|website=ComicBook|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806151610/https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/08/05/x-men-moira-mactaggert-who-powers-of-x/|archivedate=August 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> She first appeared in the episode \"The Cure\", where supposedly knew a doctor with a cure for mutants. The next episodes were \"The Phoenix Saga\", where she was worried about Professor Xavier's control over his mind. In the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" she was working to help Jean Grey be freed from the Phoenix. Then, the next appearance was in \"Proteus\", in which she revealed to Xavier that Proteus was her son. Here she seems to fill the function of Gabrielle Haller, an old lover of Charles and mother of his son, the powerful but disturbed psychic boy [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]]. Her next appearance was \"The Phalanx Covenant, Part 2\", when she was infected by [[Phalanx]]. Her last appearance was in \"Graduation Day\", when she and Beast debated on how to contact [[Lilandra Neramani]] to help Professor X.\n* In ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]'', the character '''Yui Sasaki''' (voiced by [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]] in the Japanese version and by [[Gwendoline Yeo]] in the English) is introduced as that version's Moira, as she slightly bears resemblance to her. Like Moira, Yui is a geneticist and has a relationship with Professor X when she still owns the Sasaki Institute in Japan. But unknown to Charles, she is the mother his son with her name [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Takeo Sasaki]]. Under the misguided idea of trying to help suppress mutant powers, she entered a partnership with the U-men; they would harvest mutants DNA for a cure for mutancy. In exchange, she gave them a mutant detection device uninhibited by her own Cerebro-jammer. Yui's plans start falling apart, when her serum starts accelerating mutations instead of suppressing them. This leads both the X-Men and the Inner Circle to Japan. Unknown to her, Mastermind was posing as her lab assistant, and was working on trying to brainwash Takeo. Thanks to Armor and Professor X's help, they let Takeo pass away in peace.\n\n===Films===\n* Moira is played by [[Olivia Williams]] in brief appearances in the feature film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.<ref name=\"slashfilm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/rose-byrne-x-men-apocalypse/|title=Rose Byrne Returns for 'X-Men: Apocalypse'|last=Fischer|first=Russ|website=[[/Film]]|date=February 2, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610203727/http://www.slashfilm.com/rose-byrne-x-men-apocalypse/|archivedate=June 10, 2019|url-status=}}</ref> She appears on a video talking about the ethics of using mutant powers, such as transferring the mind of a dying man into the body of a patient with no higher brain function. She is later seen seated next to [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] at the memorial service for Xavier. [[Post-credits scene|After the film's ending credits]], she appears again attending to the brain-dead patient, who suddenly speaks to her in Xavier's voice.\n* [[Rose Byrne]] plays Moira in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.<ref name=\"slashfilm\" /><ref name=\"EW\" /> She is a [[CIA]] agent working to uncover the mysterious [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. This version is depicted as an American instead of being Scottish. During her investigation at Las Vegas, Nevada, she manages to stumble across one of the Club's meetings by stripping down to her [[lingerie|underwear]] to blend in with the [[stripper]]s in which she discovers the club members are mutants as they intimidate a military officer. After the incident, she seeks help from recently graduated professor Charles Xavier, due to his affinity for research in the subject of genetic mutation. Moira eventually learns that Charles and his foster sister [[Mystique (comics)|Raven]] are mutants themselves with Xavier demonstrating his mind-reading while Raven reveals her shape-shifting. She later becomes the liaison to the team and assists the newly formed X-Men in preventing the Club's head [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] from starting a [[nuclear holocaust]] between the Soviet Union and the United States during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. At the climax, she is indirectly responsible for Xavier's paralysis as she fires the bullet which Magneto accidentally deflects into Xavier's spine. In his rage, Magneto almost kills Moira by strangling her with her dog tags until Xavier makes him realize he caused his friend's injury. At the film's end, Xavier erases her memory of the events with Shaw and Magneto while kissing her. This was in order to keep the school for mutants that he has opened during the crisis a secret.\n* Byrne reprises her role in the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/01/30/x-men-apocalypse-rose-byrne-returning-moira-mactaggert-exclusive/|title='X-Men: Apocalypse': Rose Byrne Returning As Moira MacTaggert -- Exclusive|last=Franich|first=Darren|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 30, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329112903/https://ew.com/article/2015/01/30/x-men-apocalypse-rose-byrne-returning-moira-mactaggert-exclusive/|archivedate=March 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Still having a large interest in mutant activity, she investigates a cult in Egypt that was formed upon the existence of mutants being revealed to the public, and ends up inadvertently and unknowingly causing Apocalypse to awaken from his sleep. Charles decides to visit her and take her to the X-Mansion to find out more information and because he misses her. It is here where she tells Charles she has [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|a son]], although she is divorced from the boy's father. While at the X-Mansion, the team are attacked by Apocalypse and his new Horsemen, and Moira becomes drawn into the conflict, acting as the pilot to the team's aircraft when they go to confront Apocalypse. At the end of the story, Charles restores Moira's memories back to her and restarts his relationship with her. In a deleted scene, MacTaggert arrests General Stryker and his men for their earlier attack on her and the other Mutants. He protest against his arrest by claiming that the mutants are a danger, but she refuses to believe him.

She was the longest running human associate of the X-Men and was [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]'s colleague, confidante, and also once his fianc\u00e9e, having met and fallen in love with him while they were postgraduates at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #117</ref> She ended their engagement for unknown reasons and returned to Scotland. She was married to her old flame, the late politician Joseph MacTaggert which caused delays with her former engagement to Xavier. Joe proved to be an abusive husband; Moira separated from him after he beat her into a week long coma and, as it is implied, raped her, leaving her pregnant. She kept her son's existence a secret, and when Joe refused her a divorce she allowed people to believe she was widowed.\n\nShe eventually created a Mutant Research Center on [[Muir Island]], off the coast of [[Scotland]]. Moira was forced to contain and imprison her son Kevin, later called [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], when he developed reality warping abilities and severe psychosis. One of Moira's goals was to understand human/mutant genetics, in order to cure her son. However, it is suggested that she intentionally married Joseph and gave birth to Kevin in order to produce a mutant with reality-bending abilities.\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|First appearance from ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #96.<br>Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]\nMoira's connection to the X-Men began long before the team formed. The silent partner in the founding of [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] and co-creator of [[Cerebro]], Moira assisted Xavier in helping the young [[Jean Grey]] recover after the traumatic triggering of her mutant abilities.\n\nMoira was a kind woman who took to helping humans and mutants alike. She rescued a young Rahne Sinclair ([[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]) from an angry mob, and adopted the girl. She even attempted to treat Xavier's son, a mutant known as [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] who suffered from [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]]. When a confused, traumatized [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] first arrived from the future, he washed up in Scotland unable to speak English, and it was Moira who stood up for him against an angry mob. Taking him back to Muir Island, he scanned her mind and learned English in the process, as well as the truth about her son, and promised to keep her secrets. She taught him literature and the customs of the time and introduced him to Xavier. They became close friends ever since, being the first kind person Cable met in the present timeline, her later death devastating him enough to leave the X-Men. When [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] was reduced to infancy, he was entrusted to Moira's care on Muir Island, where she altered his genetic code in an attempt to keep him from reverting to villainy.\n\n===Involvement with the X-Men===\nMoira appeared at Xavier's call to act as \"housekeeper\" for the team while they were on missions (a position that required her to demonstrate her proficiency with an [[M16 rifle]] against a demon within hours of her arrival). Though each of the X-Men formed some sort of relationship with the \"Widow\" MacTaggert, Moira and Sean Cassidy ([[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]) hit it off immediately, forming an on-and-off relationship that would last for the remainder of her life. Proteus' escape and eventual destruction at the hands of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and the X-Men left Moira in a position of ethical compromise again: though Banshee stopped her from cloning her son, she saved his genetic structure on disk to allow herself the future option of bringing him back.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #128</ref><ref>''Classic X-Men'' #36, \"Outside-In\".</ref>\n\nAfter finding out that her foster daughter, Rahne, was a mutant, Moira was the catalyst for change. She talked a discouraged Xavier into opening his school to the next generation of [[New Mutants]], with Rahne becoming an initial member. She was also an integral part of the support for the X-Men and the New Mutants, providing medical aid including cloning Xavier after the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] attacks, transferring his mind into a new body and restoring his ability to walk after a Brood embryo nearly killed him.\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 3.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Muir Islanders ([[Muir Island]] X-Men) on the cover of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #254.

On Muir, she began to pit her charges against each other in an arena in merciless battles, supposedly allowing her the opportunity to study mutants in action.\n\nMoira and her islanders were involved in the return of Proteus due to the influence of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]]. This was a four-part story in 1991, that ran through that year's annuals for the New Warriors, X-Force, New Mutants and X-Factor. The [[Shadow King]], the corrupting entity behind the island, allowed the Islanders to act heroically in defense of innocent lives.\n\nEventually, the entire population of Muir Island was identified as being possessed by and mentally corrupted by Shadow King, pitting the Islanders against the combined forces of the X-Men and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] before Xavier freed them from his control.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 4.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Moira confronted by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #2. Art by [[Jim Lee]].]]\nMoira's alteration of Magneto did not go unnoticed indefinitely. Enraged when he discovered Moira had tampered with his [[free will]], Magneto took Moira captive and forced her to perform the procedure on half of the X-Men, turning them against their teammates.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #2</ref> While Moira's alterations worked, it was revealed that, due to mutants' powers requiring their body chemistry to operate in a specific manner, use of a mutant's powers would cause them to automatically resist the 'programming' and reverse the effects of the procedure, so anything Magneto had done was of his own free will. While hostage on Asteroid M, Moira witnessed [[Fabian Cortez]] draining Magneto of his powers and manipulating him into placing him as his right hand. Though Cortez fled, it was an observation that would eventually put Moira back in the hands of the Acolytes. Back on Earth, Moira was unable to accept her betrayal of her surrogate family and her own infallibility, and fled the X-Mansion, with Banshee in pursuit.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #6</ref>\n\n===Excalibur and the Legacy Virus===\nWhen a mysterious virus began attacking the genetically engineered [[Genegineer|mutate]] population of [[Genosha]], Moira volunteered her services as a geneticist and was forced to watch as the former slaves were decimated by disease. Returning to the X-Mansion, Moira found [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] suffering from the same illness, later identified as the [[Legacy Virus]]. Moving back to Muir Island after the girl's death, Moira became the key figure in working for a cure to the disease (during this time, she also worked on curing Wolfsbane's artificial bond with [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]).\n\nThe European superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] took up residence on Muir Island after assisting Moira.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #71</ref> She had been attacked by agents of [[Mister Sinister]] who was seeking the genetic information on her son. Moira became an official member of the group, acting as their medic, team mother, and morale officer. An information leak revealed her to be the only human infected by the Legacy Virus\u2014a bizarre turn of events possibly caused by her long exposure to the infected on Genosha, her autopsy of Illyana, or some susceptibility because she gave birth to a mutant.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #80</ref> It was later established that Moira is in fact a mutant. Despite these events, she maintained a strong outlook on life, helping to maintain discipline, reduce tension, and increase the team's effectiveness throughout Europe. She convinced the team to stay behind when [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] emerged, telling them they might be needed if other heroes fell.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #101</ref>\n\nConferring with the X-Men's [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] did not result in appreciable progress. Locking herself in quarantine in a final attempt to cure the virus without endangering any of her teammates, Moira found her attempts foiled by her foster daughter, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Douglock]]. Wolfsbane originally leapt through the closing doors of the laboratory as the quarantine took effect. She soon found herself a willing assistant to her foster mother's work. Douglock later caused much unintentional damage, his judgement clouded by personal feelings for Wolfsbane.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #115</ref><ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #120</ref> Moira takes time off from her research to attend the bachelorette party and the wedding for her friends Meggan and Brian Braddock.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #124-125 (September\u2013October 1998)</ref>\n[[Image:Mactaggert 5.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Final moments in ''[[X-Men|X-Men (vol. 2)]]'' #108.<br>Art by [[Leinil Francis Yu]]]]\n\nMoira did eventually find a cure for the disease, when the terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] manipulated her research to force the virus to target only humans. Mystique, partly assisted by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], then destroyed Muir Island, de-powered Wolfsbane with the power nullifier once developed by Forge, and brutally injured Moira.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #388</ref><ref>''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' #16</ref> [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] attempted to save Moira's life. Despite Rogue's powers temporarily granting her medical knowledge, she was unable to do so. Moira clung to lifelong enough to mentally transfer the information to Xavier in one final embrace between the former lovers. Xavier nearly went with her into death, but Jean Grey and Cable intervened on the astral plane, talking him down. She appeared to died in the X-Men's jet, far above the Atlantic Ocean, and was later buried in Scotland.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #108</ref> A psychic representation of Moira was seen as an active portion of Xavier's consciousness as he worked on rebuilding Genosha.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> \n\nMoira is next seen in the afterlife, in which she, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], [[Gwen Stacy]], and [[Dead Girl (comics)|Dead Girl]] assist [[Doctor Strange]] in battling a being known as the Pitiful One. Moira finds herself more interested in the book club she formed with Mockingbird and Gwen Stacy then in battling evil.<ref>''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'' (#1-5, Marvel, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7851-2031-9}})</ref>\n\n===''X-Men: Deadly Genesis''===\nAfter the events of M-Day and upon the reawakening of Vulcan, significant portions of Moira's history with Xavier and the Original X-Men are called into light. While in the rubble of Muir Island, Banshee sees Moira but she completely ignores him and leads him to an old stockroom, where Sean finds old, important notes from the Professor which reveals that during the early years of Xavier's Academy, Moira founded and ran a secondary facility not far from the Xavier School, in which she had her own students; youths whom she took out of bad situations and adopted as her wards, training them in their abilities without the highly militant regimen of Charles' X-Men.\n\nWhen [[Krakoa]] captured the original X-Men, it was Moira's students whom Charles went to first\u2014not the second team of Wolverine, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Banshee, Colossus, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] as it was originally believed\u2014putting them through the psionic equivalent of [[recruit training|boot camp]] and allowing them to believe they were being trained over months as X-Men. Charles took them from Moira's care immediately.\n\nMoira's students\u2014[[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] (Gabriel Summers, the [[Third Summers brother|lost brother]] of X-Men [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Havok), [[Petra (comics)|Petra]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Sway (comics)|Sway]]\u2014were apparently all killed, and Xavier suppressed even the memory of them from his own students, to keep them from going back to save them. Only Moira's project tapes, one made directly after the event before Xavier could suppress the memories, and an abandoned research center remain as clues.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1-6</ref>\n\n===Chaos War===\nDuring the \"[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]\" storyline, Moira MacTaggert is brought back from the afterlife, alongside the fallen X-Men members, John Proudstar, Banshee, three Madrox dupes, Sophie and Esme Cuckoo, after what happened to the death realms.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #1</ref> After escaping from Carrion Crow, the group discovers that Moira has been possessed by [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s ghost.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #2</ref>\n\n===''House of X'' ===\nIn 2019's ''[[House of X]]'', it is revealed that Moira is actually a mutant who possesses the power of reincarnation, starting her life again in the past after her death, possessing her full memories of her prior lives. She is also revealed to be alive, having faked her death at the hands of the Brotherhood by using a Shi'ar Golem which impersonated and died in her place which indicates that it was Moira's replica that was seen in the afterlife and was brought back to life, during the Chaos War.\n\n====The Lives of Moira MacTaggert====\n'''Life 1'''\nMoira Kinross was born to powerful Scots nobleman Lord Kinross and when she turned 13, her mutant ability manifested, but due to her passive power, there were no signs indicating that she had become a mutant other than a strong, temporary fever. Living a simple life, Moira meets Charles Xavier, but he passes through without them forming a bond. She later marries a man named Kenneth Cowan and has three children: twin boys Callum and Dean, and a girl named Abigail. Kenneth dies when Moira is 68 years old, and she passes away from [[congestive heart failure]] at age 74.\n\n'''Life 2'''\nHer second life began in utero, having already become fully sentient and possessing a perfect recollection of her prior life when she turned 13, which is when her powers first manifest. This allowed Moira to appear intellectually gifted, and she was pushed in the direction of academia. She didn't fight her parents' intentions, since she intended to understand her true nature. After she verified that she wasn't suffering from psychosis or a disorder, and having lived through one life with Kenneth and learning all his faults, she makes a point not to fall in love with him when they met. She enrolls at Oxford at age 16, becomes a biology professor at 20, founds the Muir Research Institute at 31 and at 44 she finally deduced she was a mutant after seeing Charles Xavier coming out as one on television. She boards a plane to the United States of America in order to meet him, however, the plane crashes before reaching its destination, killing Moira.\n\n'''Life 3'''\nMoira made a point of finding Xavier earlier in her third life. She meets Charles Xavier when they were both at Oxford University, however she becomes turned off by his arrogance and a thinly veiled god complex. So she instead devotes her life to finding a cure for mutation, which she compared to cancer. Moira founds again the Muir Research Institute, and at 36 she identifies the X-gene. Just when it appears Moira had rid herself of her reincarnation powers, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants attack the Muir Research Institute. Able to see the future, Destiny alone is able to sense Moira's mutant status and see the effects her reincarnations are having on the timeline. Destiny orders Moira to stop wasting her gift by working against her own kind, and instead help prevent a seemingly inevitable future where mankind's machines wipe out the mutant race. Destiny also tells Moira of her future, revealing that Moira will ultimately live either ten or eleven lives, depending on the choices she makes in the tenth cycle. Destiny also reveals that if Moira dies before her powers manifest at 13, she won't reincarnate. With that, Destiny warns Moira that she'll continue to hunt her in each new life if she doesn't work for the betterment of mutantkind. By Destiny's request, Moira is then killed by being slowly burned alive by Pyro so she would always remember what this slow and painful death feels like.\n\n'''Life 4'''\nIn her fourth life, reconsidering the positive nature of mutants and Xavier himself, Moira throws herself into studying the human-mutant dilemma. She meets Xavier and goes on to fall in love with and marry him, with the couple establishing the Xavier School for Gifted Children. She, Xavier and the X-Men fight for the mutant cause for years, but at age 55, Moira is killed by Sentinels. That ultimately means Destiny's vision was right as she warned Moira that humans would always try to exterminate mutants.\n\n'''Life 5'''\nNow choosing aggression as a response to the violent tendencies of humanity, Moira runs away from home at 13, to encounter Xavier a full decade earlier than when they're supposed to meet. Not wasting any time, Moira opens her mind to Xavier so he can see how his dream fails in her past lives. The mind-reading radicalizes him, forcing the duo to form the mutant nation of Faraway instead of a school. It seemed mutants were finally safe from humanity. Yet, Boliver Trask's adaptive-learning Sentinels still make their way there, and Moira is initially injured in an attack when she was 43 and dies a year later during a genocide.\n\n'''Life 6'''\nIn her sixth life, Moira discovers the true threat to mutants are not Sentinels or Humanity, but ironically, Time itself. It turns out that while mutants are the natural evolution response to Humans, they will not be the next evolutionary step for Them, and they never will be because Humans will render evolution obsolete by changing its environment around its needs, rather than adapting to that same environment. Humans will use technology to extend their life and when they reach an evolutionary stagnation, they will overtime integrate themselves with it, creating in the process a genetically engineered new species, the pinnacle of humanity without natural evolution, the Post-Humans (''Homo novissima''), blue-hued human-machine hybrids that will rule the Earth and bring mutants nearly to extinction, one thousand years in the future. The last surviving mutants are kept captive in preserve areas, as a diversionary tactic to keep them from interfering with the process of breeding something far beyond human or mutant. Moira and Wolverine are among them because they were able to survive on each other's blood. One of the Post-Humans, the Librarian, comes to them and reveal how they'll achieve Godhood. Due to the Post-Humans techo-organic nature, it allows them to be more readily absorbed by the Phalanx in a process known as Ascension and join the physical form of the Phalanx, and the hive mind of the Dominion system to artificially force their evolution into higher beings once again, gaining in the process control over time and space. The Librarian intends to send Moira and Wolverine to another planet to prevent Moira from dying and use her knowledge against them in her resurrection. However, the Librarian underestimated Wolverine who manages to kill him and afterwards, with Moira's consent, kills her too.\n\n'''Life 7'''\nWith the knowledge that the Trask Family is responsible for creating the Sentinels and learning how Humanity will use it to overtake mutantkind, Moira spends her seventh life eradicating the Trask bloodline. Bolivar, Donald, Gwyneth and Simon Trask are systematically murdered over the span of a decade, with Moira even taking out their children for good measure. But when she thought she had successfully eliminated the potential for Sentinel creation, Moira lost all hope when she sadly discovered Sentinels were still being created. She finally understood that Mutantkind's fall is the \"Inevitable Truth\" as the Artificial Intelligence is unavoidable since it's a discovery and not a creation. This realization radicalized her as Sentinels killed her again.\n\n'''Life 8'''\nAbandoning Xavier's peaceful dream to foster a safe future for mutants, Moira seeks out Magneto instead. Presenting Magneto with tales of her past lives and his future failures, Moira convinced him to join her. Together they conquered America, establishing the House of M and initiated the War of M. However, during the war, Moira witness Magneto being defeated and killed by the combined might of Earth's humans and mutants heroes in the likes of the Fantastic Four, Avengers and X-Men. Moira is imprisoned and later killed in a failed prison escape.\n\n'''Life 9'''\nThough eventually a failure, the life-defining decision Moira made to turn to Magneto, did validate her radical approach to beat humanity through force. Magneto was simply not enough. To that end, in her ninth life, Moira woke Apocalypse from his slumber early. Forming a powerful union that leads to the creation of the X-Men, they destroy their two strongest opponents, Xavier and Magneto, gather their Four Horsemen and launch the Apocalypse War. The war provokes a reaction from humanity in the form of the Man-Machine Supremacy, an alliance between humans and machines which culminates with Nimrod becoming online for the first time. One hundred years later, most mutants have been driven out of the solar system as the war still rages. Apocalypse's forces split into two teams, as one group attacks the Temple of Concordance, while another group heads into Nimrod's vast archives to extract vital information about its origins. Once the info is gathered, Apocalypse sends Wolverine away and stays behind to take on Nimrod once it realized that the archives were being raided. Wolverine's destination is revealed to be a container that holds Moira MacTaggert in stasis for over 16 years. With the data embedded into Moira through a techno-organic interface designed by Apocalypse himself, she now knows how and when Nimrod was first brought online, but for that information to actually be useful, Logan kills her.\n\n'''Life 10'''\nMoira's tenth life occurs in the current iteration of the Marvel Universe. When she meets Xavier, she allowed him to read her mind to learn everything her lives had entailed. Since then she's been using the information from her previous lives to work with Xavier and Magneto to save mutants from humans and machines. As the years passed, it's revealed through her journals that Moira deliberately used her genetic expertise to find mates for herself and Professor X that, in combination with their own mutant genes, would potentially spawn mutants with reality-warping powers (Proteus and Legion), because she knew someone with that power would be needed in the future to enable the mutant resurrection protocol. She notes how her influence indirectly, imprinted the idea for a mutant stronghold in Magneto's mind, after Xavier used his powers to show Magneto the lives of Moira. This is why he created so many of his own, from Asteroid M to Avalon and Genosha. She reluctantly allowed Xavier to read her mind over and over again, and worries that, while he is still being unacceptably hopeful and idealistic, he is becoming too dependent on her interpretation of past-life events. She also fears that his psyche will fracture which will eventually lead to the creation of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] when Charles used his telepathic powers to shut down Erik's mind completely. Given her knowledge of Sinister's treachery on her previous lives, Moira laments to learn that without her knowledge or consent, Xavier and Magneto tried to recruit him nevertheless, realizing in the process that Sinister has turned himself into a chimera mutant, decades ahead of schedule compared to the other timelines, that chimera being the mutant clone of himself infused with Thunderbird's DNA. Eventually, Moira had realized she had spent too much time in the spotlight working overtly with Xavier and needed to return to the shadows, in order to do so, she and Xavier used the advanced technology from the Shi'ar to do some preliminary testing for their theory that a mutant could be restored from back-up, creating in the process a Shi'ar golem, a living husk whose empty body was then imprinted with Moira's mental scan, recorded and re-uploaded by Charles Xavier but apparently without all the knowledge lying inside of her.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref> Moira then replaced herself with the decoy at some point allowing her to continued working from the shadows with Xavier. The decoy would eventually be killed during the attack of the Brotherhood. Moira also notes that though Xavier kept fighting her influence, even using on two occasions the Cerebro unit to remove from his mind the knowledge of their plan, but following his demise at Cyclops' hands and his eventual return to the living, he had apparently  become a man with a very different purpose, instead of his peaceful dream of coexistence between man and mutant which he believed at one point, Xavier now envisions a world where a mutant nation must be created as a seat from which mutants will rise as the dominant species on the planet. Moira has since taken residence in \"No-Place\" a blackout zone within the newly sovereign, living island nation of [[List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters:_K#Krakoa|Krakoa]] with Xavier and Magneto, the only people aware of her being alive and her actual role in this grand plan, and has become apparently very paranoid in her isolation, as she is deeply afraid of the notion of Destiny being revived to placate Mystique, or of any precognitive mutant in general because she fears what would happen if the other mutants discovered that they really are doomed.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFor decades, Dr. Moira MacTaggert was depicted as a baseline human with the normal human strength of a woman of her age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise. However, in the 2019 storyline, \"House of X\", Moira was revealed to actually be a mutant with the ability to reincarnate herself upon death, reverting to the moment of her initial conception with all the memories she experienced in her previous lifetimes from as early as in utero.<ref name=\"PoX2\">{{cite comic|title=House of X|volume=1|issue=#2|writer=[[Jonathan Hickman]]|artist=Pepe Larraz|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August 7, 2019}}</ref> This allows her to manipulate the course of history by changing her own actions and thereby affecting people and circumstances that result from her presence. Her lifetimes have armed her with significant experience, including expertise in the fields of anthropology and genetics, firearms mastery, and leading various mutant survival movements until their eventual downfall.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\nAccording to Destiny, Moira's reincarnation cycle is finite. When she encountered Destiny during her third life, she was informed that she had \"10, maybe 11\" lives in total, noting that if Moira were to die before her mutant power manifested at the age of 13, the reincarnation cycle would end.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\nHer x-gene is also undetectable during her life, providing the ultimate camouflage to mutant sensors and detectors which will see her as a baseline human. Telepathic intrusions on her mind will only see the memories of her current lifetime, however, telepaths can see all her lives' memories as long as she allows it.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the 1995-1996 \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, Moira is the wife of [[Bolivar Trask]], and head of the London-based Human High Council. As resistance to Apocalypse's reign, Moira and her husband designed the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] and armed the human resistance with an impressive weapons array. Their main focus was a plan to destroy Apocalypse's forces in their North American positions, even though this would mean the deaths of many innocent civilians that had not yet escaped the country. The tyrant however, backfires by activating his Sea Walls, slaughtering the Council and those within the Sea Walls reach.\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Moira is the step-mother of Legion (stating that his father had been killed in a bombing in Israel) and therefore one of the few humans allowed to live on Fortress X. She also posed as the AI X, so she could use communication worms and sensors to communicate with and monitor the residents of Fortress X. It was later discovered that she was actually one of the multiple personalities of Legion, created as a \"Psychic Anti-body\" in order to protect Legion from Doctor Nemesis' actions on David's mind, as he and the X-Club were processing the deletion of the personas in order to stabilize David's psyche. Her power is so immense that when she was discovered by Xavier, she was able to defeat him and established the Age of X reality, where mutants were besieged into the Fortress X, everyday attacked by the waves of soldiers of the Human Coalition and used the personalities inside David's mind along with the mutants of Utopia to fill this new world where David would be happy and seen as a hero, as part of the Force Warriors, the protectors of the Fortress, who erected force walls around the citadel every day. Even memories were rewritten, and a background was created. The telepaths and a few others mutants who were able to retain knowledge about the true universe were kept in the X-Brig, considered as mutants too dangerous for the community, but their imprisonment was because they might use their powers to reveal the truth. \nWhen her victims slowly understood that this reality wasn't their one, she manipulated both Danielle Moonstar and her Moonstar Cadre in order to make them to stop any further discovery. Eventually her depiction was revealed and Legion absorb her. Later she offers to make a better world for David, but he declines her offer. During the Lost Legion story Moira's powers were the main target of another personality of Legion and at the end she was seen inside David's mind cursing Xavier.\n\n===Cross-Time Caper===\nReichminister of Genetics Moira MacTaggert, who hails from a reality in which Earth is dominated by Nazis,<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #6 (1989)</ref> is featured in ''Excalibur'' #10 and 11 when she is brought into [[Earth-616]] by the actions of a confused [[Widget (comics)|Widget]]. Making the trip with her is her personal bodyguard, a [[Nazi]] [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and Moira's personal train, powered by an alternate [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]]. It was also hinted that this Moira was behind the Super Team Lightning Force (a Nazi version of Excalibur). Moira's violent actions ultimately result in Excalibur team being sent on a long and arduous cross-dimensional trip.\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Moira MacTaggert was declared a criminal for attempting to cure her son [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Kevin]] of the mutant gene and his psychosis. King [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s mutant supremacy saw this as an act against mutantkind, and [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] were dispatched to destroy Muir Island and capture Moira. Though Moira escaped, Kevin was also freed, sending him on a gruesome killing spree that was attributed to Moira as failed experiments, as she chases him across the globe. When the reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] caught Proteus's attention, Moira emerged from hiding to warn them about her son, who was intrigued by their presence and desired to ruin the realities they attempted to fix. When he attacks the team, Moira shot him, exposing him to the metal that was his deadly allergy and only weakness, forcing him to find a new body. Unsurprisingly, he chose to possess his mother, and rather than allow her son to possess her and use her against them, Moira commits suicide.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #70-71</ref>\n\n===New Exiles===\nOn the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]] face a squad of alternate 'core X-Men' who are loyal to Lilandra. These X-Men include an alternate version of Moira MacTaggert who is not married on this world or is going by her maiden name, Kinross. Moira's codename is Hypernova and her powers are energy blasts. It is not known whether she is a mutant on this world or has gained powers through another method.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]]'' #15 (2008)</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Moira MacTaggert is the ex-wife of [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]], and their son David MacTaggert is [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Proteus|Proteus]]. This version of Moira needs two crutches in order to move around. Moira runs a school/hospital for sick mutants, and assists in the Xavier Institute from behind the scenes. She does this even though Charles left her to join [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s dream of a mutant society, abandoning her to raise their mentally ill child on her own. When Proteus escapes and begins [[body hopping]], Moira calls in the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] for assistance. After murdering hundreds, Proteus is seemingly crushed to death under a car.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #15-19 (2002)</ref>\n\nLater, the X-Men learn that Moira has been funding her hospital by producing and selling \"[[Banshee (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Banshee]]\", a lethal and addictive Mutant Growth Hormone<ref>Ult X v1 94</ref> which amplifies mutant powers, made from the genetic material of [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|Wolverine]]. When Wolverine attempts to destroy her Banshee supply, Moira attacks him with the previously unknown mutant ability to emit a [[Banshee (comics)|deafening sonic cry]]. Wolverine quickly defeats Moira and leaves her to die in the exploding hospital, but she is later shown to have somehow survived when [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] finds her emerging from the smoldering ruins. Her ensuing conversation with him implies that she is now in league with Quicksilver.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Moira appears in episodes of ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Lally Cadeau]].<ref name=\"comicbook\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/08/05/x-men-moira-mactaggert-who-powers-of-x/|title=X-Men: Who is Moira MacTaggert?|last=MAgnett|first=Chase|website=ComicBook|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806151610/https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/08/05/x-men-moira-mactaggert-who-powers-of-x/|archivedate=August 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> She first appeared in the episode \"The Cure\", where supposedly knew a doctor with a cure for mutants. The next episodes were \"The Phoenix Saga\", where she was worried about Professor Xavier's control over his mind. In the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" she was working to help Jean Grey be freed from the Phoenix. Then, the next appearance was in \"Proteus\", in which she revealed to Xavier that Proteus was her son. Here she seems to fill the function of Gabrielle Haller, an old lover of Charles and mother of his son, the powerful but disturbed psychic boy [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]]. Her next appearance was \"The Phalanx Covenant, Part 2\", when she was infected by [[Phalanx]]. Her last appearance was in \"Graduation Day\", when she and Beast debated on how to contact [[Lilandra Neramani]] to help Professor X.\n* In ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]'', the character '''Yui Sasaki''' (voiced by [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]] in the Japanese version and by [[Gwendoline Yeo]] in the English) is introduced as that version's Moira, as she slightly bears resemblance to her. Like Moira, Yui is a geneticist and has a relationship with Professor X when she still owns the Sasaki Institute in Japan. But unknown to Charles, she is the mother his son with her name [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Takeo Sasaki]]. Under the misguided idea of trying to help suppress mutant powers, she entered a partnership with the U-men; they would harvest mutants DNA for a cure for mutancy. In exchange, she gave them a mutant detection device uninhibited by her own Cerebro-jammer. Yui's plans start falling apart, when her serum starts accelerating mutations instead of suppressing them. This leads both the X-Men and the Inner Circle to Japan. Unknown to her, Mastermind was posing as her lab assistant, and was working on trying to brainwash Takeo.

This version is depicted as an American instead of being Scottish. During her investigation at Las Vegas, Nevada, she manages to stumble across one of the Club's meetings by stripping down to her [[lingerie|underwear]] to blend in with the [[stripper]]s in which she discovers the club members are mutants as they intimidate a military officer. After the incident, she seeks help from recently graduated professor Charles Xavier, due to his affinity for research in the subject of genetic mutation. Moira eventually learns that Charles and his foster sister [[Mystique (comics)|Raven]] are mutants themselves with Xavier demonstrating his mind-reading while Raven reveals her shape-shifting. She later becomes the liaison to the team and assists the newly formed X-Men in preventing the Club's head [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] from starting a [[nuclear holocaust]] between the Soviet Union and the United States during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. At the climax, she is indirectly responsible for Xavier's paralysis as she fires the bullet which Magneto accidentally deflects into Xavier's spine. In his rage, Magneto almost kills Moira by strangling her with her dog tags until Xavier makes him realize he caused his friend's injury. At the film's end, Xavier erases her memory of the events with Shaw and Magneto while kissing her.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four.The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived.

This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Silent\">{{cite web|url=http://www.silent-warriors.com/nsg011.html|title=National Vigilance Park - Naval Security Group|author=|date=|website=www.silent-warriors.com}}</ref>.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over [[Markt Schwaben]], 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.
