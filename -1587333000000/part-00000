It runs between [[Shotwick]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.2374|-2.9875|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A5117 road (western end)}})}} and [[Helsby]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.2613|-2.7814|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A5117 road (eastern end)}})}} and connects the [[A550 road|A550]] at Woodbank to the [[M56 motorway|M56]]. As such it forms a northerly bypass to [[Chester]] and a shorter route between the North West and [[North Wales]] than the [[A55 road|A55]].  The road is dualled west of the M56. There is roundabout with the [[A540 road|A540]] and at [[Dunkirk, Cheshire|Dunkirk]] at the western terminus of the M56. East of the junction the road is [[single carriageway]] and crosses the [[A41 road|A41]] by way of a roundabout at [[Backford Cross]]. The A5117 intersects the [[M53 motorway|M53]] at Junction 10. This junction is just east of [[Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet]]. The road then continues almost parallel to the M56, which it intersects at Junction 14, at which there is a [[Motorway service area]]. The road then continues south east to terminate where it joins the [[A56 road|A56]] at Helsby.\n\n==Current construction==\nThe upgrading of the A5117 on a section west of the [[M56 motorway]], Dunkirk roundabout to Sealand was started in 2006. It is regularly congested but the improvement will see the road converted to [[grade separation|grade separated]] 2-lane [[dual carriageway]] standard [https://web.archive.org/web/20120205002712/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5018.aspx]. The Government decided that a motorway standard M56 extension would be too environmentally damaging, and instead opted for a route utilising part of the existing road without widening works, whilst providing off-line bypasses for all of the at-grade junctions. The improvements will tie into recently completed works over the [[Wales|Welsh border]] which upgraded the [[A550 road|A550]] to a standard similar to that of motorways. Work started in late 2006 for completion by mid 2008.\n\n==Points of interest==\nTravelling west the sandstone cliff above Helsby appears as the profile of a man's face. The road passes the [[Stanlow Refinery]] which burns off refinery gases.\n\n==History==\nThe road was built in the 1930s and known as the \"Shotwick - Helsby Bypass\".  It formed a link between [[Manchester]], the North West and North Wales via the [[Queensferry, Flintshire|Queensferry]] Lifting bridge, the A550 and the A494, to join the A55 at [[Ewloe]]. Some sections were constructed in concrete.  The road was lined for much of its length with poplar trees.  This original tree lined [[boulevard]] layout is still in evidence on the section adjacent to [[Stanlow Refinery]]. In the 1960s it was marked out as a single carriageway 3-lane road.  The middle lane was known as the \"suicide\" lane due to overtaking vehicles from each direction heading towards each other at speed. Vehicles in the nearside lanes would experience an up and down vertical motion due to the need for \"summit and valley\" drainage on this otherwise flat section of road.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|A5117 road (England)}}\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222820/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/A5117_Deeside_park_junctions_improvement_.pdf Maps of current improvement]\n\n{{GB A road zone 5}}\n\n{{coord|53.2597|-2.8839|dim:8000_region:GB|display=title|name=A5117 road}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:5-5117}}\n[[Category:Roads in England]]\n[[Category:Roads in Cheshire]]\n\n\n{{England-road-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox road\n|country=GBR\n|type=A\n|route=5117\n|length_mi=\n|direction_a= West\n|terminus_a = [[Mollington, Cheshire|Mollington]]\n|direction_b= East\n|terminus_b = [[Hapsford]]\n|junction   = [[File:UK road A494.PNG|1000x20px]]<br>[[A494 road]]<br>[[Image:UK-Motorway-M56.svg|1000x20px]]<br>[[M56 motorway]]<br>[[File:UK road A41.svg|1000x20px]]<br>[[A41 road]]<br>[[File:UK road A5032.PNG|1000x20px]]<br>[[A5032 road]]<br>[[B5132 road]]<br>[[Image:UK-Motorway-M53.svg|1000x20px]]<br>[[M53 motorway]]<br>[[B5132 road]]<br>[[Image:UK-Motorway-M56.svg|1000x20px]]<br>[[M56 motorway]]<br>[[A56 road]]\n|maint      = [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]]\n|counties   = [[Cheshire]]\n|destinations= [[Ellesmere Port]]\n}}\n\nThe '''A5117''' is a [[road]] in [[Cheshire]], [[England]].  It runs between [[Shotwick]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.2374|-2.9875|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A5117 road (western end)}})}} and [[Helsby]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.2613|-2.7814|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A5117 road (eastern end)}})}} and connects the [[A550 road|A550]] at Woodbank to the [[M56 motorway|M56]]. As such it forms a northerly bypass to [[Chester]] and a shorter route between the North West and [[North Wales]] than the [[A55 road|A55]].  The road is dualled west of the M56. There is roundabout with the [[A540 road|A540]] and at [[Dunkirk, Cheshire|Dunkirk]] at the western terminus of the M56. East of the junction the road is [[single carriageway]] and crosses the [[A41 road|A41]] by way of a roundabout at [[Backford Cross]]. The A5117 intersects the [[M53 motorway|M53]] at Junction 10. This junction is just east of [[Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet]]. The road then continues almost parallel to the M56, which it intersects at Junction 14, at which there is a [[Motorway service area]]. The road then continues south east to terminate where it joins the [[A56 road|A56]] at Helsby.\n\n==Current construction==\nThe upgrading of the A5117 on a section west of the [[M56 motorway]], Dunkirk roundabout to Sealand was started in 2006. It is regularly congested but the improvement will see the road converted to [[grade separation|grade separated]] 2-lane [[dual carriageway]] standard [https://web.archive.org/web/20120205002712/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5018.aspx]. The Government decided that a motorway standard M56 extension would be too environmentally damaging, and instead opted for a route utilising part of the existing road without widening works, whilst providing off-line bypasses for all of the at-grade junctions. The improvements will tie into recently completed works over the [[Wales|Welsh border]] which upgraded the [[A550 road|A550]] to a standard similar to that of motorways. Work started in late 2006 for completion by mid 2008.\n\n==Points of interest==\nTravelling west the sandstone cliff above Helsby appears as the profile of a man's face. The road passes the [[Stanlow Refinery]] which burns off refinery gases.\n\n==History==\nThe road was built in the 1930s and known as the \"Shotwick - Helsby Bypass\".  It formed a link between [[Manchester]], the North West and North Wales via the [[Queensferry, Flintshire|Queensferry]] Lifting bridge, the A550 and the A494, to join the A55 at [[Ewloe]]. Some sections were constructed in concrete.  The road was lined for much of its length with poplar trees.  This original tree lined [[boulevard]] layout is still in evidence on the section adjacent to [[Stanlow Refinery]]. In the 1960s it was marked out as a single carriageway 3-lane road.  The middle lane was known as the \"suicide\" lane due to overtaking vehicles from each direction heading towards each other at speed. Vehicles in the nearside lanes would experience an up and down vertical motion due to the need for \"summit and valley\" drainage on this otherwise flat section of road.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|A5117 road (England)}}\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222820/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/A5117_Deeside_park_junctions_improvement_.pdf Maps of current improvement]\n\n{{GB A road zone 5}}\n\n{{coord|53.2597|-2.8839|dim:8000_region:GB|display=title|name=A5117 road}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:5-5117}}\n[[Category:Roads in England]]\n[[Category:Roads in Cheshire]]\n\n\n{{England-road-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Rschen7754", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File:UK road A494.PNG\u2192File:UK road A494.svgsvg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5117_road"}
