The entire image is repeated within the computer monitor.\n}}\n\n'''''The Stanley Parable''''' is an [[interactive drama]] and [[Adventure game#Walking simulators|walking simulator]] designed by American developer Davey Wreden. The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Together with [[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]], Wreden later released a stand-alone [[remake]] using the [[List of Source engine mods|Source engine]] under the Galactic Cafe studio name. The remake included new story elements and upgraded graphics. It was announced and approved via [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2012, and was released on October 17, 2013, for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Later updates to the game added support for [[OS X]] on December 19, 2013, and for [[Linux]] on September 9, 2015. A further expanded edition entitled '''''The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe''''' is scheduled for release in 2020. It will be available on consoles and include additional content.\n\nThe game has no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the gameplay involves guiding a [[silent protagonist]] named Stanley alongside [[narration]] by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may disobey the narrator's suggestions, which will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game restarts. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways. Both the original mod and the remake have received critical praise from journalists. Critics praised the game's narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making.\n\n== Gameplay and story ==\n[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The game begins in a mysteriously abandoned office.|alt=A brightly lit office space with tanish-brown flooring, egg-white walls, and square overhead lights. Several closed doors leading to personal offices and other rooms line the walls, as well as plants and other office-related objects. In the center of the room is a large filing cabinet.]]\n\nThe game is presented to the player from the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nThe story is primarily presented to the player by the narrator. He explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nAt this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based on the player's choices. When the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action. Doing so will force the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door.{{Efn|Technically speaking, the first choice in the game is choosing whether or not to lock Stanley's office door, in which locking it results in a unique ending, but the choice between the two doors is the first one that is obviously presented to the player.<ref name=\"endingtree\">{{Cite web|url=https://guardianlv.com/2013/10/the-stanley-parable-endings-guide-the-definitive-ending-tree/|title=The Stanley Parable Endings Guide: the Definitive Ending Tree|last=Fenner|first=James|date=2013-10-27|website=Guardian Liberty Voice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>}} The player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which causes the narrator to adjust his story to get the player to return to the \"proper\" path.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The narrator also breaks the [[fourth wall]] on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.<ref name=\"wired\" /> A total of six possible endings exist in the original mod, and Wreden states it would take about an hour for the player to experience them all.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/08/the-stanley-parable/ | title = Brilliant Indie Game The Stanley Parable Will Mess With Your Head | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date =2011-08-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-03 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> The remake adds in more than 10 additional endings, as well as several [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] and other choice-related gameplay aspects.<ref name=\"endingtree\" /> The ''Ultra Deluxe'' edition will expand on this further.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Development ==\n=== ''Half-Life 2'' mod ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Initially, I just wanted to make a game that was something I\u2019d never seen before.

Wreden used an audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> Brighting had provided his voice in a single pass.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as \"and then everything was happy!\", that would otherwise insult the player as a poor reward for completing a long game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included, though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out how to work with them within the Source engine.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a \"broken\" puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project \"grueling\" and stifling his career ambition,<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\nWreden initially tested the game with a friend before posting the mod to the website [[ModDB]], a few weeks prior to his graduation from college.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /><ref name=\"rps interview\"/> After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the [[Mana Bar]], which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod.<ref name=\"rps interview\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/ | title = Davey Wreden & William Pugh: Life After The Stanley Parable | first = John | last = Walker | date= 2014-03-28 | accessdate = 2014-03-28 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games as well as some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as at the time it was \"not the kind of scene\" he wanted to work in.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Instead, he started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of ''The Stanley Parable'' and leading towards a completely new title in the future.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\n=== Remake ===\n[[File:Stanley parable screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|The \"Mind Control Facility\" in both the original mod (top) and remake (bottom).

However, Pugh also found that without some visual cues as to where divergent paths occurred, they would often miss these choices, and so added elements like colors to highlight that a choice was available at these points.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> In the original mod, one set of choices briefly takes the player to sections modeled after parts of ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. In the remake, Pugh and Wreden included one section where the player briefly revisits the opening of ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and another where the player is dropped into a ''[[Minecraft]]'' world. These sections were included after getting approval from their creators [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] and [[Markus Persson]], respectively.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/202359/Behind_the_scenes_with_The_Stanley_Parable.php | title = Behind the scenes with The Stanley Parable | first = Mike | last = Rose | date = 2013-10-17 | accessdate = 2013-10-17 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\nTo distribute the new version, the team initially considered a [[pay what you want]] scheme,<ref name=\"rps\" /> but later sought the use of the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] Greenlight service, where independent developers can solicit votes from other players in order to have Valve subsequently offer the title through Steam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/13/stanley-clicked-yes-the-stanley-parable-returns/ | title = Stanley Clicked \"YES\": The Stanley Parable Returns | first = John | last = Walker | date = 2012-09-13 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | publisher = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> In October 2012, the game was successfully approved by Valve to be included on Steam upon the game's completion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/16/postal-dad-stanliest-gnome-21-new-games-greenlit/ | title = Postal Dad: Stanliest Gnome&nbsp;\u2013 21 New Games Greenlit | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = 2012-10-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | publisher = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Although Wreden originally called the stand-alone version ''The Stanley Parable: HD Remix'', he later opted to drop the distinguishing title, affirming that he believes the remake is the \"definitive\" version of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/95511356/1376845925 | title = About that name... | first = Dave | last = Wreden | date = 2013-08-13 | accessdate = 2013-10-15 | publisher = Dave Wreden }}</ref> The OS X version (requiring 10.8 or later) was released on December 19, 2013,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/12/19/the-stanley-parable-now-available-for-mac.aspx|title=The Stanley Parable Now Available For Mac|last=Futter|first=Mike|date=2013-12-19|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=2013-12-19}}</ref> and support for Linux was added on September 9, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-stanley-parable-released-for-linux-you-will-play-it-you-wont-play-it.5919|title=The Stanley Parable Released For Linux, You Will Play It, You Won\u2019t Play it|last=Dawe|first=Liam|date=September 9, 2015|website=GamingOnLinux|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TheStanleyParable DemoFacility.png|thumb|''The Stanley Parable''<nowiki/>'s demo takes place in a \"demo construction facility\", a setting entirely separate from the main game.|alt=A storage facility with grey floors and off-white walls.

The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Together with [[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]], Wreden later released a stand-alone [[remake]] using the [[List of Source engine mods|Source engine]] under the Galactic Cafe studio name. The remake included new story elements and upgraded graphics. It was announced and approved via [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2012, and was released on October 17, 2013, for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Later updates to the game added support for [[OS X]] on December 19, 2013, and for [[Linux]] on September 9, 2015. A further expanded edition entitled '''''The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe''''' is scheduled for release in 2020. It will be available on consoles and include additional content.\n\nThe game has no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the gameplay involves guiding a [[silent protagonist]] named Stanley alongside [[narration]] by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may disobey the narrator's suggestions, which will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game restarts. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways. Both the original mod and the remake have received critical praise from journalists. Critics praised the game's narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making.\n\n== Gameplay and story ==\n[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The game begins in a mysteriously abandoned office.|alt=A brightly lit office space with tanish-brown flooring, egg-white walls, and square overhead lights. Several closed doors leading to personal offices and other rooms line the walls, as well as plants and other office-related objects. In the center of the room is a large filing cabinet.]]\n\nThe game is presented to the player from the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nThe story is primarily presented to the player by the narrator. He explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nAt this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based on the player's choices. When the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action. Doing so will force the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration.

Wreden used an audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> Brighting had provided his voice in a single pass.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as \"and then everything was happy!\", that would otherwise insult the player as a poor reward for completing a long game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included, though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out how to work with them within the Source engine.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a \"broken\" puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project \"grueling\" and stifling his career ambition,<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\nWreden initially tested the game with a friend before posting the mod to the website [[ModDB]], a few weeks prior to his graduation from college.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /><ref name=\"rps interview\"/> After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the [[Mana Bar]], which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod.<ref name=\"rps interview\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/ | title = Davey Wreden & William Pugh: Life After The Stanley Parable | first = John | last = Walker | date= 2014-03-28 | accessdate = 2014-03-28 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games as well as some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as at the time it was \"not the kind of scene\" he wanted to work in.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Instead, he started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of ''The Stanley Parable'' and leading towards a completely new title in the future.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\n=== Remake ===\n[[File:Stanley parable screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|The \"Mind Control Facility\" in both the original mod (top) and remake (bottom).

However, Pugh also found that without some visual cues as to where divergent paths occurred, they would often miss these choices, and so added elements like colors to highlight that a choice was available at these points.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> In the original mod, one set of choices briefly takes the player to sections modeled after parts of ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. In the remake, Pugh and Wreden included one section where the player briefly revisits the opening of ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and another where the player is dropped into a ''[[Minecraft]]'' world.

Eerdmans Publishing Co.</ref> The area was part of [[Canada (New France)]] from 1668 to 1763. In 1701, the French officer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]], along with fifty-one additional French-Canadians, founded a settlement called [[Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit]], now the city of Detroit. When New France was defeated in the [[French and Indian War]], it ceded the region to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] in 1763. After the British defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] expanded the United States' boundaries to include nearly all land east of the Mississippi River and south of Canada. Michigan was then part of the \"Old Northwest\". From 1787 to 1800, it was part of the [[Northwest Territory]]. In 1800, the [[Indiana Territory]] was created, and most of the current state Michigan lay within it, with only the easternmost parts of the state remaining in the Northwest Territory.<ref>Dunbar (1995), pp. 106-07.</ref> In 1802, when Ohio was [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|admitted to the Union]], the whole of Michigan was attached to the Territory of Indiana, and so remained until 1805, when the [[Michigan Territory|Territory of Michigan]] was established.<ref>Utley, Henry M. & Cutcheon, Byron M. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=TxwVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA138 ''Michigan as a Province, Territory and State: Michigan as a Territory, from Its Incorporation as Part of the Northwest Territory to Its Organization as a State''], p. 138.</ref> Michigan's birthday is on January 26th.\n\nThe opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825 connected the Great Lakes with the Hudson River and New York City, and brought large numbers of people to Michigan and provided an inexpensive way to ship crops to market. In 1835 the people approved the Constitution of 1835, thereby forming a state government, although Congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with Ohio known as the [[Toledo War]]. Congress awarded the \"Toledo Strip\" to Ohio. Michigan received the western part of the [[Upper Peninsula]] as a concession and formally entered the Union as a state on January 26, 1837.\n\nWhen iron and copper were discovered in the Upper Peninsula, impetus was created for the construction of the [[Soo Locks]], completed in 1855. Along with mining, agriculture and logging became important industries.<ref name=daly>Daly, Matthew L., et al. (eds.) (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NbaF0SWvRJIC&pg=PA56 ''Michigan Encyclopedia''], pp. 56-62. Somerset Publishers, Inc.</ref> In 1899 [[Henry Ford]] built his first automobile factory in [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]], an independent city that is now surrounded by Detroit. [[General Motors]] was founded in Flint in 1908. Automobile assembly and associated manufacturing soon dominated Detroit, and the economy of Michigan.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s affected Michigan more severely than many other places because of its industrial base.<ref name=daly/> However, the state recovered in the post World War II years. The [[Mackinac Bridge]] connecting the Upper and Lower Peninsulas was completed and opened in 1957. By the 1960s, racial tensions produced unrest through the nation, and Detroit experienced a dramatic instance with the [[12th Street Riot]] in 1967. By the 1980s, the state saw a decline in automobile sales and unemployment climbed. Michigan continues to diversify its economy away from its dependence on the automobile industry.\n\n==Early history==\n{{further information|Pays d'en Haut}}\n[[File:Michigan 1718.jpg|thumb|200px|Michigan in 1718, [[Guillaume Delisle|Guillaume de L'Isle]] map, approximate state area highlighted.]]\nThe area was inhabited from about 1000 B.C. to 1000 A.D. by the Native American [[Hopewell culture]]. Later, according to Oral histories, Algonquian peoples from the East Coast were driven west when Iroquoian people migrated to the region from central Canada and took their original homelands\u2014These being the ancestors of the Ojibwe, Odawa, Potowatomi, Mascouten & Miami. Archaeology shows that this probably occurred during the 12th-13th centuries. Originally, the northern peninsula was largely claimed by the [[Ojibwe]] nation, although the border region of Wisconsin was claimed by the [[Menominee]]. Given that one of the oldest recorded names for the tribe was also the ''Mackinac,'' <ref>Rodesch, Gerrold C. (1984). \"Jean Nicolet\". University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay. Retrieved July 31, 2016.</ref> they most likely predate the other Algonquians in the region. The entire southern peninsula was home to a tribe called the [[Mascouten]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/mascouten-tribe.htm|title=Mascouten Tribe \u2013 Access Genealogy|author=|date=9 July 2011|website=accessgenealogy.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/.../Publications/oa51-2-steckley.pdf{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> until the [[Beaver Wars]], which was probably home to a mixture of Algonquian & Siouan peoples before. Their southern border seems to very clearly be the Maumee River of Ohio & their territory extended around Lake Michigan into Indiana. During the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois of New York pushed other tribes in league with the French hard against Lake Huron, therefore several tribes migrated into Michigan & declared war on the Mascouten & Miami. The most likely identity for these tribes were the Erie, Chonnonton & Anishinaabeg. The Iroquoian tribes quickly continued on into northern & eastern Ohio & the Anishinaabeg groups seem to have formed the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] & [[Meskwaki|Fauk]] tribes by the time of the oldest surviving maps of the region, 1641. Either this, or the Sauk & Fauk were chased into the region after defeats further east. Due to the Beaver Wars, the Mascouten migrated down to settle around the Wabash River.\n\nGiven the fact that they are culturally related & the Mascouten disappear from maps of the region around the same time that the new name appears, they may have later become known as the Wea, or Wabash tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/mas.html|title=Mascouten|author=|date=|website=www.dickshovel.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ohio/early_indian_migration_in_ohio.htm|title=EARLY INDIAN MIGRATION IN OHIO|author=|date=|website=genealogytrails.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>Johnson, Basil \"The Manitous: The Spiritual World of the Ojibway\". 1995</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the Iroquois defeated the other Iroquoian tribes of northern Ohio\u2014the Chonnonton, Erie & Petun\u2014and continued into southern Michigan by the 1660s.<ref>Brandon, William (1961).

Co. p. 187.</ref> With the Iroquoians having conquered the southern peninsula for themselves, the other Algonquians began to refer to the nearby lake as Michigan, which translates to \"Big Cat\" in their language. This is most likely supposed to be a reference to the Iroquoian water deity known as 'Blue Panther', or, more accurately, \"Cat which Stalks Below.\" <ref>Nichols, John & Nyholm, Earl \"Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe\". 1994</ref><ref>Froman, Francis & Keye, Alfred J. \"English-Cayuga/ Cayuga-English Dictionary\". 2014</ref> They defeated the Sauk & Fauk, who migrated west and took refuge among the Ojibwe & Menominee.

Cleland, University of Michigan Press, 1992.</ref>\n\nLater, the Anishinaabeg tribes north of Lake Superior (who were already allied with the Huron) migrated down to the Lake Erie region, claiming some land in southern Michigan. In the U.S., they were known as the Odawa, & in Canada they were known as the [[Mississaugas]]\u2014both deriving from tribal & subtribal names of the Anishinaabeg. The French migrated west, settling the colony of Illinois around 1680, which claimed all the land between the Great Lakes, Ohio River, Mississippi River & Appalachian mountains. Together with their native allies, they chased the Iroquois out of the region by 1701, forcing them to sign a treaty recognizing the Niagara River & the Ohio-Pennsylvania borders as the ends of their lands.\n\nIn the meantime, other tribes which had settled in Ohio were continuously pushed west by new settlers. Some settled in southern Michigan, however these were mostly the Iroquoian [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]. Rumor also has it that a group of Piscataway (An Algonquian tribe from Maryland) called the Conoy migrated into West Virginia & were noted as living around modern-day Detroit by 1819.<ref>Kavanagh et al. 2009.</ref> If true, they most likely merged with the Odawa. During the War of 1812, tribes who sided against the United States were punished by seizure of land. With the Indian Removal Act (best known for causing the Trail of Tears in the south) of the 1830s, many natives were pushed away from Ohio & Michigan, many choosing to return to Canada. Despite this, many native tribesmen were able to remain, if they forewent their tribal allegiances & became American citizens. It was the later laws of 50 years later, outlawing Native American culture to control other tribes of the west, which permanently destroyed this heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-indianremovalact.html|title=Indian Removal Act of 1830 \u2013 Legends of America|author=|date=|website=www.legendsofamerica.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the British and French settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]] (1754 to 1763)]]\nThe Ojibwe called their land Mishi-Anishinaabaki ({{lang|oj|Mey-shih-Ah-ney-shih-nah-baaah-key}}), or Greater Anishinaabe Land. Since Anishinaabe was a collective term for the Ojibwe, Odawa & Potowatomi/ Nishnabe, who formed a governed confederacy known as the Three Council Fires,<ref>Loew, Patty; \"Indian Nations of Wisconsin: Histories of Endurance and Renewal\"; Madison, Wisconsin Historical Society Press; 2001.</ref> most of the Algonquian peoples around Lake Superior referred to their lands as 'something Anishinaabaki.' This most likely confused the French, who chose to simply translate the 'Mishi' part as \"Superior.\" Although the Anishinaabeg (plural) didn't have a true, organized government (They would usually elect temporary leaders called Ogidamoo in the moment.<ref>Johnson, Basil \"The Manitous: The Spiritual World of the Ojibway\" 2001.</ref> ), the sacred site of their council fire, where they would conduct important political business, was known as [[Michilimackinac]]. Today, it's known as [[Mackinac Island]]. The Mascouten are supposedly so named for calling their original homeland of southern Michigan \"Maskoutenich,\" or \"The Treeless Land,\" for the Erie Plains region.<ref>Erdrich, Louise \"Books & Islands in Ojibwe Country\" 2014.</ref><ref>\"The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents Volume 55\". puffin.creighton.edu</ref>\n\nThe first European explorer to visit Michigan was the Frenchman [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] in 1620, who began his expedition from [[Quebec City]] on the orders of [[Samuel de Champlain]] and traveled as far as the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. Eventually, the area became part of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], one of the large colonial provinces of [[New France]]. The first permanent European settlement in Michigan was founded in 1668 at [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] by [[Jacques Marquette]], a French missionary.\n\nThe French built several trading posts, forts, and villages in Michigan during the late 17th century. Among them, the most important was [[Fort Detroit|Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit]] in 1701; it became the city of [[History of Detroit|Detroit]]. Up until this time, French activities in the region were limited to hunting, trapping, trading with and the conversion of local Indians, and some limited subsistence farming. By 1760, the Michigan countryside had only a few hundred white inhabitants.\n\n==From 1763 to 1776==\n[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|400px|Michigan as part of the Province of Quebec 1774\u20131776.]]\nTerritorial disputes between French and British colonists helped start the [[French and Indian War]] as part of the larger [[Seven Years' War]], which took place from 1754 to 1763 and resulted in the defeat of France. As part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], the French ceded all of their North American colonies east of the [[Mississippi River]] to Britain. Thus the future Michigan was handed over to the British. However, since 1761, the Indians in the area were not happy with the way the British treated them. In 1763, the Indians were furious that Great Britain had gained control of the area and war began at [[Fort Detroit]] under the leadership of Pontiac, and quickly spread throughout the region. The war was known as [[Pontiac's War]] and lasted three years. Eight British forts were taken; others, including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt, were held by the British garrisons. In 1774, the area was made part of the British province of [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Quebec]]. During this period Detroit grew slowly; the rest of Michigan continued to be sparsely populated because the British were more interested in the [[fur trade]] and peace with the natives than in settlement of the area.<ref>Richard White, ''The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815'' (1991)</ref>\n\n==From 1776 to 1837==\n[[File:Treaty of Paris by Benjamin West 1783.jpg|thumb|Unfinished contemporaneous painting of the American diplomatic negotiators of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] which brought official conclusion to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and gave possession of Michigan and other territory to the new United States.]]\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the local European population, who were primarily American colonists that supported independence, rebelled against Britain. The British, with the help of local tribes, continually attacked American settlements in the region starting in 1776 and conquered [[Detroit]]. In 1781, Spanish raiders led by a French Captain Eugene Poure travelled by river and overland from [[St Louis Missouri|St Louis]], liberated British-held [[Fort St. Joseph (Niles, Michigan)|Fort St Joseph]], and handed authority over the settlement to the Americans the following day. The war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, and Michigan passed into the control of the newly formed United States of America. The states of New York, Virginia, Massachusetts then Connecticut ceded their territorial rights over the land. In 1787, the region became part of the [[Northwest Territory]]. The majority of Indians did not recognize the new government and instead formed the [[Western Confederacy]]. General [[Anthony Wayne]] with his Kentucky marksmen won the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] which led to the end of hostilities and treaties recognizing federal government sovereignty. The British, however, continued to occupy Detroit and other fortifications. Under terms negotiated in the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]], Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and [[Drummond Island]] until 1818 and 1847, respectively.\n\nThe land which is now Michigan was made part of [[Indiana Territory]] in 1800. Most was declared as [[Michigan Territory]] in 1805, including all of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]]. During the [[War of 1812]], British forces from Canada captured Detroit and [[Fort Mackinac]] early on, giving them a strategic advantage and encouraging native revolt against the United States. American troops retook Detroit in 1813 and Fort Mackinac was returned to the Americans at the end of the war in 1815.\n\nOver the 1810s, the indigenous Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi tribes increasingly decided to oppose white settlement and sided with the British against the U.S. government.\n\n[[File:United States land claims and cessions 1782-1802.png|thumb|Map of the original 13 colonies and their territories, note that Michigan was the object of multiple claims]]\n[[Image:Map of the surveyed part of the territory of Michigan 1825.jpg|thumb|''Map of the Surveyed Part of the Territory of Michigan'' by Orange Risdon, 1825]]\nAfter their defeat in the War of 1812, the tribes were forced to sell all of their land claims to the U.S. federal government by the [[Treaty of Saginaw]] and the [[Treaty of Chicago]]. After the war, the government built forts in some of the northwest territory, such as at Sault Ste. Marie. In the 1820s, the U.S. government assigned Indian agents to work with the tribes, including arranging land cessions and relocation. They forced most of the Native Americans to relocate from Michigan to [[Indian reservation]]s further west.\n\nIn the 1820s and 1830s migrants from [[New England]] began moving to what is now Michigan in large numbers (though there was a trickle of New England settlers who arrived before this date).<ref>The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865 by Lois Kimball Mathews Rosenberry, Houghton Mifflin, 1909   pg. 223</ref>  These were \"[[Yankee]]\" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the [[English people|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled New England during the colonial era.<ref>The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart Holbrook pg. 2</ref>  While most of them came to Michigan directly from New England, there were many who came from [[upstate New York]].  These were people whose parents had moved from New England to upstate New York in the immediate aftermath of the [[American Revolution]].  Due to the prevalence of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York, Michigan was very culturally contiguous with early New England culture for much of its early history.  The Yankee migration to Michigan was a result of several factors, one of which was the overpopulation of New England. The old stock Yankee population had large families, often bearing up to ten children in one household.  Most people were expected to have their own piece of land to farm, and due to the massive and nonstop population boom, land in New England became scarce as every son claimed his own farmstead.  As a result, there was not enough land for every family to have a self-sustaining farm, and Yankee settlers began leaving New England for the [[Midwestern United States]].  This resulted in Michigan's population expanding rapidly in the 1820s.<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State\n By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 91</ref>  The Erie Canal caused such an upsurge in immigration from New England that by 1837 \"it seemed as if all New England were coming\" according to one pioneer.<ref>he Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865 by Lois Kimball Mathews Rosenberry, Houghton Mifflin, 1909   pg. 226</ref>  New England families considered it a route to the \"promised land\".<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State  By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 160</ref>  As a result of this heritage, the New England element of Michigan's population would remain culturally and politically dominant for a long time.<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State  By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 91</ref>\n\nMichigan's oldest university, the [[University of Michigan]] was founded in Detroit in 1817 and was later moved to its present location in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. The state's oldest cultural institution, the Historical Society of Michigan, was established by territorial governor [[Lewis Cass]] and explorer [[Henry Schoolcraft]] in 1828.\n\nRising settlement prompted the elevation of Michigan Territory to that of the present-day [[U.S. state|state]]. In 1835, the federal government enacted a law that would have created a State of Michigan. A territorial dispute with [[Ohio]] over the [[Toledo War|Toledo Strip]], a stretch of land including the city of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], delayed the final accession of statehood. The disputed zone became part of Ohio by the order of a revised bill passed by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Jackson]] which also gave compensation to Michigan in the form of control of the Upper Peninsula. On January 26, 1837, Michigan became the 26th state of the Union.\n\n==From 1837 to 1860==\n[[File:City of Detroit, Michigan - William James Bennett.png|thumb|[[Detroit]], c. 1837, after a sketch by Frederick Grain]]\n[[File:1842 A new map of Michigan with its canals roads distances by H.S.

During the early 1840s, large deposits of copper and iron ores were discovered on the Upper Peninsula. Michigan became the leading U.S. source of these ores by the end of the century, thanks to the influx of experienced Cornish miners (from England) to supervise operations.  Michigan remained a frontier society up until around the time of the Civil War.  Michigan pioneers were overwhelmingly of New England origins, including New England transplants from upstate New York.  The amount with which the New England Yankee population predominated made Michigan unique among frontier states in the antebellum period.  Due to this heritage Michigan was on the forefront of the antislavery crusade and reforms during the 1840s and 1850s.  Another result of this cultural influence was the strength of the Republican Party in Michigan.  Long considered a \"Yankee\" party, Michigan would remain heavily Republican from the Civil War until the 1960s.  The state's leadership in public education is also directly attributable to the New England influence.  Towns such as Vermontville, Bangor, Hartford, Rochester, Utica, and Palmyra Michigan were all named after towns in New England where the founders of those towns were from.  The Congregational Church also was very strong in Michigan from most of Michigan's history, due to the New England origins of the state.  New Englanders and New England transplants from Upstate New York also filled the overwhelming majority of leadership roles in Michigan's early legislatures.<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State  By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 170</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nDuring the [[Second Party System]] (1830-1854), Michigan saw highly developed political parties mobilize the great mass of adult men. The [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] dominated politics before the Civil War. It comprised numerous competing factions, including the federal officeholders who tried to control party affairs, local political organizations with their state legislators and postmasters who managed affairs locally; young anti-slavery activists, typically energized by pietistic ministers in the Baptist and Methodist churches\u2014they fueled the Free Soil Party in 1848\u201352; [[Jacksonian Democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]]  who opposed taxes and government spending; Catholics, Episcopalians and liturgical Germans annoyed at the moralistic pietists; and residents in the newer western districts who resented the elitism and power of Detroiters. The outstanding Democratic leader was [[Lewis Cass]], (1782-1866) who held numerous high offices and was the Democratic party's losing candidate for president in 1848. Cass was best known for his moderation and support for democracy through [[popular sovereignty]].<ref>Willard Carl Klunder, ''Lewis Cass and the Politics of Moderation'' (1996)</ref> Nativism flared up briefly when the Democrats proposed to allow recent immigrants to vote before they became citizens, and the Whigs opposed.<ref>Ronald P. Formisano, ''The Birth of Mass Political Parties in Michigan, 1827-1861'' (1971)</ref><ref>Bruce A. Rubenstein and Lawrence E. Ziewacz, '' Michigan: A History of the Great Lakes State'' (2002) p 100</ref>  Fifteen of Michigan's first eighteen governors were of Yankee origins, either being from New England or being born in upstate New York to parents who were from New England.<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State  By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 311</ref>\n\nThe minority Whig party relied on conservative merchants, bankers and prosperous farmers, and especially on pietistic, moralistic Protestants from evangelical churches. Nationally, the Whig party collapsed in the 1850s as compromise proved impossible between the anti-slavery Northerners, and the pro-slavery Southerners. For a few years in the mid-1850s, nativist fears of foreign immigrants, especially Catholic Irishmen and Germans, motivated the [[Know-Nothing]] movement. It had little success beyond a brief control of city government in Marshall, Pontiac, Battle Creek, Mt. Clemens, Kalamazoo, and Grand Rapids.\n\nThe collapse of the old political system led to the realignment of voters and parties in the formation of the [[Third Party System]], which formed in the mid-1850s and lasted until the mid-1890s. Michigan was dominated for 80 years by the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|new Republican Party]], later nicknamed the GOP. First established in Jackson and other cities in 1854, it gathered together anti-slavery elements from the Whig, Know-Nothing and Democratic parties, and was a majority in Michigan by the end of the decade. The Democrats had always used equalitarianism as a way to attack the rich elitist Whigs. Now the Republicans turned the tables by charging that Michigan's Democrats were in bed with the South's \"slave power aristocrats.\" The Republicans encouraged the moralistic spirit of the pietists by turning it against slavery and the liquor traffic.<ref>Rubenstein and Ziewacz, '' Michigan: A History of the Great Lakes State'' (2002) p 100-103</ref>\n\n==1860 to 1900==\n\n===Civil War===\n{{main article|Michigan in the American Civil War}}\nMichigan actively participated in the [[American Civil War]] sending thousands of volunteers.<ref>Robert E., Mitchell, \"Civil War Recruiting and Recruits from Ever-Changing Labor Pools: Midland County, Michigan, as a Case Study,\" ''Michigan Historical Review,'' 35 (Spring 2009), 29\u201360.</ref> A study of the cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union. [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] called the war a failure, and it became more and more a partisan Republican effort.<ref>Martin J. Hershock, \"Copperheads and Radicals: Michigan Partisan Politics during the Civil War Era, 1860-1865,\" ''Michigan Historical Review'' (1992) 18#1 pp 28-69</ref> Michigan voters remained evenly split between the parties in the presidential election of 1864.<ref>Peter Bratt, \"A Great Revolution in Feeling: The American Civil War in Niles and Grand Rapids, Michigan,\" ''Michigan Historical Review'' (2005) 31#2 pp 43-66.</ref>\n\n===Gilded Age===\nAfter the war, the local economy became more varied and began to prosper. During the 1870s, the [[Lumberjack|lumbering]], railroads, dairy farming and diversified industry grew rapidly in the state. This led to the rise of several wealthy [[socialite]] families such as the [[Hartwick family]]. The population doubled between 1870 and 1890.\n\nToward the end of the century, the state government established a state school system on the German model, with public schools, high schools, normal schools or colleges for training teachers of lower grades, and colleges for classical academic studies and professors. It dedicated more funds to public education than did any other state in the nation. Within a few years, it established four-year curricula at its normal colleges for teachers, and was the first state to establish a full college program for them.\n\n[[History of railroads in Michigan|Railroads]] have been vital in the history of the population and trade of rough and finished goods in the state of Michigan. While some coastal settlements had previously existed supplied by sailing ships and steamers on the Great Lakes, the population, commercial, and industrial growth of the state further bloomed with the establishment of the railroad.\n\n===Pingree===\nIn 1896, Detroit Mayor [[Hazen Pingree]], a Yankee Republican, was elected governor. He was a social reformer who battled corporations and was an early leader of the [[Progressive Era|Progressive Movement.]] During his four-year term, he promoted the regulation of railroad rates, equal taxation, and municipal ownership of public utilities. He also supported the direct election of U.S. senators; an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]]; an income tax; primary elections; the referendum, the abolition of child labor, and compulsory arbitration of labor disputes. Opposition from Democrats and business-oriented Republicans blocked most of his proposals. Pingree expressed the Progressive fear of corporate power, saying, \"I do not condemn corporations and rich men,\" he said, \"but I would keep them within their proper spheres. It is not safe to entrust the government of the country to the influence of  Wall Street.\"<ref>Russel B. Nye, ''Midwestern Progressive Politics: A Historical Study of Its Origins and Development, 1870-1950'' (1951) p 205</ref>\n\n==1900 to 1941==\nUrban Michigan grew rapidly in the early 20th century, pulled along by the automobile industry in Detroit and vicinity. The [[Breakfast cereal#Grand Rapids: two Kelloggs and a Post|breakfast cereal]] industry was based in Battle Creek where two Kelloggs and a Post built on the local [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] heritage and put the city on the map. Less flamboyantly, thousands of machine shops opened in medium and small cities across the state.\n\n===Automobiles===\nDuring the early 20th century, manufacturing industries became the main source of revenue for Michigan \u2013 in large part, because of the [[automobile]]. In 1897, the [[Oldsmobile|Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] opened a factory in Lansing. In 1903, [[Ford Motor Company]] was also founded nearby in Detroit. In 1904 William Durant of the Flint, Michigan Durant Coach Works, a maker of horse carriages, set his sights on Buick Motor Cars which he soon acquired. With the mass production of the [[Ford Model T]], Detroit became the world capital of the auto industry. General Motors was formed a few years later as William Durant along with Alfred Sloan purchased Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Oakland and other car companies. They soon moved their headquarters from Flint, Michigan to Detroit, Michigan.<ref>Sloan Museum exhibits, Flint, MI</ref> [[General Motors]] is based in Detroit, Chrysler is located in Auburn Hills, and Ford is headquartered in nearby [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]]. Both corporations constructed large industrial complexes in the Detroit metropolitan area, exemplified by the [[River Rouge Plant]], which have made Michigan a national leader in manufacturing since the 1910s. This industrial base produced greatly during [[World War I]], filling a huge demand for military vehicles.\n\n[[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]] was home to one of the first car industry developments. Even before Detroit began building cars on assembly lines, Jackson was busy making parts for cars and putting them together in 1901. By 1910, the auto industry became Jackson's main industry. Over twenty different cars were once made in Jackson. Including: Reeves, Jaxon, Jackson, CarterCar, Orlo, Whiting, Butcher and Gage, Buick, Janney, Globe, Steel Swallow, C.V.I., Imperial, Ames-Dean, Cutting, Standard Electric, Duck, Briscoe, Argo, Hollier, Hackett, Marion-Handly, Gem, Earl, Wolverine, and Kaiser-Darrin. Today the auto industry remains one of the largest employers of skilled machine operators in [[Jackson County, Michigan|Jackson County]].\n\n===Immigrants===\nWith the expansion of industry, hundreds of thousands of migrants from the South and immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were attracted to Detroit. In a short time, it became the fourth largest city in the country - housing shortages persisted for years even as new housing was developed throughout the city. Ethnic immigrant enclaves rapidly developed where churches, groceries, clubs and businesses supported unique communities. The WPA guide to the city in 1939 noted that there were students speaking more than 35 languages in the public schools. Ethnic festivals were a regular part of the city's culture. At the same time, fear of Catholics was strong, and fueled the nativism of the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] recruited widely in the state. The Klan peaked in 1925, but membership fell quickly after its internal scandals were exposed. [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], a German-American Protestant minister trained at Yale Divinity School became nationally famous as a Detroit minister who attacked the KKK, which was strong among white Protestants in the city.<ref>Craig Fox, ''Everyday Klansfolk: White Protestant Life and the KKK in 1920s Michigan'' (2011)</ref>\n\n===Progressivism===\nThe cities of Michigan were centers of municipal reform during the [[Progressive Era]]. Using Kalamazoo as her base, [[Caroline Bartlett Crane]] (1858\u20131935) became a nationally famous expert on municipal [[sanitation]]. She was nonpolitical, but scientific in her methods, and energetic in her approach. She made 60 surveys and studies in 14 states that dealt with housing conditions in [[tenement]]s, of schools, jails, water and sewer systems. She identified and found solutions for air pollution. Crane had a sharp eye for inefficiency, waste, and mismanagement, and was always ready to point out improvements and explain what the best practices were in the nation.<ref>Alan S. Brown, \"Caroline Bartlett Crane and Urban Reform,\" ''Michigan History,''  July 1972, Vol. 56 Issue 4, pp 287-301</ref>\n\nA representative politician was George E. Ellis, mayor of Grand Rapids (1906\u201316). He is remembered as the most dynamic and innovative mayor in the city's history, as well as a powerful political boss who built a coalition of working-class ethnic voters, combined with middle-class reform elements. He broadened the base of political participation, and was on the left or liberal side of the political spectrum.<ref>Anthony R. Travis, \"Mayor George Ellis: Grand Rapids Political Boss And Progressive Reformer,\" ''Michigan History,'' March 1974, Vol. 58 Issue 2, pp 101-130</ref> Somewhat more conservative, and much better known, was Mayor [[Hazen Pingree]] of Detroit (1889\u20131896), who brought progressivism to the governor's mansion with his election in 1896. Pingree was elected mayor in 1889 by promising to expose and end corruption in city paving contracts, sewer contracts, and the school board. He fought privately owned utility [[monopolies]], and set up competing companies owned by the city. He fought the street railway interest, demanding fares be lowered to three cents. When the [[depression of 1893]] caused large-scale unemployment, Pingree expanded welfare programs, initiated [[public works]] programs for the unemployed, built new schools, parks, and public baths, and set aside plots of vacant city land for workers to plant their own vegetable gardens. As the Republican governor, he promoted higher railroad taxes to pay for his reforms.<ref>Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (Oxford U.P., 1969)</ref> After Pingree left Detroit in 1897, the local Democratic ward leaders rebuilt their machine, using an ethnic base. This changed after 1910 as the old-stock Yankee Protestant business leaders, especially from the automobile industry, led a [[Progressive Era]] crusade for efficiency. They elected their own men to office, typified by automaker [[James J. Couzens]], who was mayor of Detroit 1919\u201322, and a powerful US Senator, 1922\u201336. The critical change took place in 1918 when the voters 1918 changed the Common Council from a 42-man body elected on a partisan basis from 21 wards, to a nine-man unit, elected on a non-partisan basis from the city at-large. The ethnics (especially the Germans) and the Democrats lost their political base.<ref>Harry Barnard, ''Independent Man: The Life of Senator James Couzens'' (1958)</ref>\n\n===Women===\nMost young women took jobs before marriage, then quit. Before the growth of high schools after 1900, most women left school after the 8th grade at about age 15. Ciani (2005) shows that type of work they did reflected their ethnicity and marital status. African American mothers often chose day labor, usually as domestic servants, because of the flexibility it afforded. Most mothers receiving pensions were white and sought work only when necessary.<ref>Kyle E. Ciani, \"Hidden Laborers: Female Day Workers In Detroit, 1870-1920,\" ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' Jan 2005, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp 23-51</ref>\n\nAcross the state middle class homemakers shaped numerous new and expanded charitable and professional associations, and promoted mothers' pensions, and expanded forms of social welfare. Many of the Protestant homemakers were active in the temperance and suffrage movements as well. The Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs (DFWC) promoted a very wide range of activities for civic minded middle-class women who conformed to traditional gender roles. The Federation argued that safety and health issues were of greatest concern to mothers and could only be solved by improving municipal conditions outside the home. The Federation pressured Detroit officials to upgrade schools, water supplies and sanitation facilities, and to require safe food handling, and traffic safety. However, the membership was divided on going beyond these issues or collaborating with ethnic or groups or labor unions; it refused to stretch traditional gender boundaries, giving it a conservative reputation.<ref>Jayne Morris-Crowther, \"Municipal Housekeeping: The Political Activities of the Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs in the 1920s,\" ''Michigan Historical Review,'' March 2004, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp 31-57</ref>\n\n===Depression===\nThe [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] caused severe economic hardship in Michigan. Thousands of auto industry workers were dismissed along with other workers from several sectors of the state economy. The financial suffering was aggravated by the fact that remaining [[copper]] reserves in the state lay deep underground. With the discovery of copper finds in other states located in less deep rock layers, local mining fell sharply and most miners left the region or resigned themselves to short hours and long unemployment. After decades of GOP dominance, the Democrats came back to power, as the business-oriented Republican economic policies had failed, the Democrats were energized, prohibition was discredited, and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] offered a [[New Deal]]. Washington spent heavily on relief, recovery, and reform, relieved cities of the burden of relief, and buttressed  a political realignment that gave the [[New Deal Coalition|Democratic Coalition]] parity with the Republican Party in Michigan. By 1936 the realignment was secure, as powerful new industrial labor unions, especially the [[United Auto Workers]] turned the factories from Republican bastions to Democratic strongholds, and the ethnic and black population had shifter to the Democrats.<ref>Philip A. Grant, Jr., \"The Presidential Election of 1932 in Michigan,\" ''Michigan Historical Review'' (1986) 12#1 pp 83-94</ref>\n\nYoung men from relief families signed up for six-month tours in one of the state's 50 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camps in rural areas. They were paid five dollars a month, plus room, board, clothing and medical care, while their families received $25 a month. The [[Works Progress Administration]] was the largest federal agency. It hired more than 500,000 unemployed people (80% men) in Michigan alone to construct major public works such as roads, public buildings, and sewer systems\u2014it was a larger labor force that the state's entire auto industry.\n\n===Unions===\n[[File:Flint Sit-Down Strike window.jpg|thumb|left|Union members occupying a General Motors body factory during the [[Flint Sit-Down Strike]] of 1937 which spurred the organization of militant CIO unions in auto industry]]\n\nThanks to new federal laws, [[Labor history of the United States#Organized labor 1929\u20131955|labor unions]] grew rapidly after 1935, and for the first time became a major presence in large factories. The [[Flint Sit-Down Strike]] of 1936-37 was the decisive event in the formation of the [[United Auto Workers Union]] (UAW). Strikers occupied several General Motors plants for more than forty days, and repelled (in nonviolent fashion) the efforts of the state courts, local police and National Guard to remove them. GM signed a contract that legitimized the UAW, and its membership in the next year grew from 30,000 to 500,000 members.<ref>Sidney Fine, \"The General Motors Sit-Down Strike: A Re-examination,\"''American Historical Review'' (1965) 70#3 pp. 691-71 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1845938 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Sidney Fine, ''Sit-Down: The General Motors Strike of 1936-1937'' (1969)</ref>\n\nDuring World War II [[Walter Reuther]] took control of the UAW, and soon led major strikes in 1946. He ousted the Communists from the positions of power, especially at the Ford local 600. He was one of the most articulate and energetic leaders of the CIO, and of the merged [[AFL-CIO]]. Using brilliant negotiating tactics he leveraged high profits for the Big Three automakers into higher wages and superior benefits for UAW members.\n\n==After 1941==\n[[File:Gerald Ford presidential portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Gerald Ford]], a politician from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] who was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] thirteen times and also served as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] and then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], became the 38th [[President of the United States]] after the resignation of [[Richard Nixon]].]]\nThe entry of the United States into World War II in 1941 the same year ended the economic contraction in Michigan. Wartime required the large-scale production of weapons and military vehicles, leading to a massive number of new jobs being filled. After the end of the war, both the automotive and copper mining industries recovered.<ref>Alan Clive, ''State of War: Michigan in World War II'' (1979)</ref>\n\nStarting during World War I, the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] fueled the movement of hundreds of thousands of [[African American|African-Americans]] from the South to industrial jobs in Michigan especially in Detroit. Migration of white southerners from Appalachia to the city increased the volatility of change. Population increases continued with industrial expansion during World War II and afterward. African Americans contributed to a new vibrant urban culture, with expansion of new music, food and culture.\n\nThe postwar years were initially a prosperous time for industrial workers, who achieved middle-class livelihoods, fostered the [[Baby Boom]], and sought better, more spacious housing in safer neighborhoods. These were the years of the creation and popularity of [[Motown Records]]. By late mid-century, however, [[deindustrialization]] and restructuring cost many jobs. The economy suffered and the city postponed needed changes. Neglect of social problems and urban decline fed racial conflicts. In 1967 there was [[12th Street riot|a major riot in Detroit]] that burned out the inner city, caused tens of millions of dollars in damages, and resulted in 43 deaths with The U.S. Army being called in to stop it. The violence then spread to several other Michigan cities and was the trigger for a mass migration to the suburbs.\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Oil Crisis]] caused economic recession in the United States and greatly affected the Michigan economy. Afterward, automobile companies in the United States faced greater multinational competition, especially from Japan. As a consequence, domestic auto makers enacted cost-cutting measures to remain competitive at home and abroad. [[Unemployment]] rates rose dramatically in the state.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Michigan possessed the highest unemployment rate of any U.S. state. Large spending cuts to education and public health were repeatedly made in an attempt to reduce growing state budget deficits. A strengthening of the auto industry and an increase in [[tax revenue]] stabilized government and household finances in the 1980s. Increasing competition by Japanese and South Korean auto companies continues to challenge the state economy, which depends heavily on the automobile industry. Since the late 1980s, the Michigan government has actively sought to attract new industries, thus reducing economic reliance on a single sector.\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Surveys and reference===\n* Bald, F.

In 1701, the French officer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]], along with fifty-one additional French-Canadians, founded a settlement called [[Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit]], now the city of Detroit. When New France was defeated in the [[French and Indian War]], it ceded the region to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] in 1763. After the British defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] expanded the United States' boundaries to include nearly all land east of the Mississippi River and south of Canada. Michigan was then part of the \"Old Northwest\". From 1787 to 1800, it was part of the [[Northwest Territory]].

In 1835 the people approved the Constitution of 1835, thereby forming a state government, although Congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with Ohio known as the [[Toledo War]]. Congress awarded the \"Toledo Strip\" to Ohio. Michigan received the western part of the [[Upper Peninsula]] as a concession and formally entered the Union as a state on January 26, 1837.\n\nWhen iron and copper were discovered in the Upper Peninsula, impetus was created for the construction of the [[Soo Locks]], completed in 1855.

Later, according to Oral histories, Algonquian peoples from the East Coast were driven west when Iroquoian people migrated to the region from central Canada and took their original homelands\u2014These being the ancestors of the Ojibwe, Odawa, Potowatomi, Mascouten & Miami. Archaeology shows that this probably occurred during the 12th-13th centuries. Originally, the northern peninsula was largely claimed by the [[Ojibwe]] nation, although the border region of Wisconsin was claimed by the [[Menominee]]. Given that one of the oldest recorded names for the tribe was also the ''Mackinac,'' <ref>Rodesch, Gerrold C. (1984). \"Jean Nicolet\". University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay.

Their southern border seems to very clearly be the Maumee River of Ohio & their territory extended around Lake Michigan into Indiana. During the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois of New York pushed other tribes in league with the French hard against Lake Huron, therefore several tribes migrated into Michigan & declared war on the Mascouten & Miami. The most likely identity for these tribes were the Erie, Chonnonton & Anishinaabeg. The Iroquoian tribes quickly continued on into northern & eastern Ohio & the Anishinaabeg groups seem to have formed the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] & [[Meskwaki|Fauk]] tribes by the time of the oldest surviving maps of the region, 1641. Either this, or the Sauk & Fauk were chased into the region after defeats further east. Due to the Beaver Wars, the Mascouten migrated down to settle around the Wabash River.\n\nGiven the fact that they are culturally related & the Mascouten disappear from maps of the region around the same time that the new name appears, they may have later become known as the Wea, or Wabash tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/mas.html|title=Mascouten|author=|date=|website=www.dickshovel.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ohio/early_indian_migration_in_ohio.htm|title=EARLY INDIAN MIGRATION IN OHIO|author=|date=|website=genealogytrails.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>Johnson, Basil \"The Manitous: The Spiritual World of the Ojibway\". 1995</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the Iroquois defeated the other Iroquoian tribes of northern Ohio\u2014the Chonnonton, Erie & Petun\u2014and continued into southern Michigan by the 1660s.<ref>Brandon, William (1961).

Cleland, University of Michigan Press, 1992.</ref>\n\nLater, the Anishinaabeg tribes north of Lake Superior (who were already allied with the Huron) migrated down to the Lake Erie region, claiming some land in southern Michigan. In the U.S., they were known as the Odawa, & in Canada they were known as the [[Mississaugas]]\u2014both deriving from tribal & subtribal names of the Anishinaabeg. The French migrated west, settling the colony of Illinois around 1680, which claimed all the land between the Great Lakes, Ohio River, Mississippi River & Appalachian mountains. Together with their native allies, they chased the Iroquois out of the region by 1701, forcing them to sign a treaty recognizing the Niagara River & the Ohio-Pennsylvania borders as the ends of their lands.\n\nIn the meantime, other tribes which had settled in Ohio were continuously pushed west by new settlers. Some settled in southern Michigan, however these were mostly the Iroquoian [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]. Rumor also has it that a group of Piscataway (An Algonquian tribe from Maryland) called the Conoy migrated into West Virginia & were noted as living around modern-day Detroit by 1819.<ref>Kavanagh et al. 2009.</ref> If true, they most likely merged with the Odawa. During the War of 1812, tribes who sided against the United States were punished by seizure of land. With the Indian Removal Act (best known for causing the Trail of Tears in the south) of the 1830s, many natives were pushed away from Ohio & Michigan, many choosing to return to Canada. Despite this, many native tribesmen were able to remain, if they forewent their tribal allegiances & became American citizens. It was the later laws of 50 years later, outlawing Native American culture to control other tribes of the west, which permanently destroyed this heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-indianremovalact.html|title=Indian Removal Act of 1830 \u2013 Legends of America|author=|date=|website=www.legendsofamerica.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the British and French settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]] (1754 to 1763)]]\nThe Ojibwe called their land Mishi-Anishinaabaki ({{lang|oj|Mey-shih-Ah-ney-shih-nah-baaah-key}}), or Greater Anishinaabe Land. Since Anishinaabe was a collective term for the Ojibwe, Odawa & Potowatomi/ Nishnabe, who formed a governed confederacy known as the Three Council Fires,<ref>Loew, Patty; \"Indian Nations of Wisconsin: Histories of Endurance and Renewal\"; Madison, Wisconsin Historical Society Press; 2001.</ref> most of the Algonquian peoples around Lake Superior referred to their lands as 'something Anishinaabaki.' This most likely confused the French, who chose to simply translate the 'Mishi' part as \"Superior.\" Although the Anishinaabeg (plural) didn't have a true, organized government (They would usually elect temporary leaders called Ogidamoo in the moment.<ref>Johnson, Basil \"The Manitous: The Spiritual World of the Ojibway\" 2001.</ref> ), the sacred site of their council fire, where they would conduct important political business, was known as [[Michilimackinac]]. Today, it's known as [[Mackinac Island]].

Eventually, the area became part of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], one of the large colonial provinces of [[New France]]. The first permanent European settlement in Michigan was founded in 1668 at [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] by [[Jacques Marquette]], a French missionary.\n\nThe French built several trading posts, forts, and villages in Michigan during the late 17th century. Among them, the most important was [[Fort Detroit|Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit]] in 1701; it became the city of [[History of Detroit|Detroit]]. Up until this time, French activities in the region were limited to hunting, trapping, trading with and the conversion of local Indians, and some limited subsistence farming. By 1760, the Michigan countryside had only a few hundred white inhabitants.\n\n==From 1763 to 1776==\n[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|400px|Michigan as part of the Province of Quebec 1774-1776.]]\nTerritorial disputes between French and British colonists helped start the [[French and Indian War]] as part of the larger [[Seven Years' War]], which took place from 1754 to 1763 and resulted in the defeat of France. As part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], the French ceded all of their North American colonies east of the [[Mississippi River]] to Britain. Thus the future Michigan was handed over to the British. However, since 1761, the Indians in the area were not happy with the way the British treated them. In 1763, the Indians were furious that Great Britain had gained control of the area and war began at [[Fort Detroit]] under the leadership of Pontiac, and quickly spread throughout the region. The war was known as [[Pontiac's War]] and lasted three years. Eight British forts were taken; others, including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt, were held by the British garrisons. In 1774, the area was made part of the British province of [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Quebec]]. During this period Detroit grew slowly; the rest of Michigan continued to be sparsely populated because the British were more interested in the [[fur trade]] and peace with the natives than in settlement of the area.<ref>Richard White, ''The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815'' (1991)</ref>\n\n==From 1776 to 1837==\n[[File:Treaty of Paris by Benjamin West 1783.jpg|thumb|Unfinished contemporaneous painting of the American diplomatic negotiators of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] which brought official conclusion to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and gave possession of Michigan and other territory to the new United States.]]\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the local European population, who were primarily American colonists that supported independence, rebelled against Britain. The British, with the help of local tribes, continually attacked American settlements in the region starting in 1776 and conquered [[Detroit]]. In 1781, Spanish raiders led by a French Captain Eugene Poure travelled by river and overland from [[St Louis Missouri|St Louis]], liberated British-held [[Fort St. Joseph (Niles, Michigan)|Fort St Joseph]], and handed authority over the settlement to the Americans the following day. The war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, and Michigan passed into the control of the newly formed United States of America. The states of New York, Virginia, Massachusetts then Connecticut ceded their territorial rights over the land. In 1787, the region became part of the [[Northwest Territory]]. The majority of Indians did not recognize the new government and instead formed the [[Western Confederacy]]. General [[Anthony Wayne]] with his Kentucky marksmen won the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] which led to the end of hostilities and treaties recognizing federal government sovereignty. The British, however, continued to occupy Detroit and other fortifications. Under terms negotiated in the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]], Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and [[Drummond Island]] until 1818 and 1847, respectively.\n\nThe land which is now Michigan was made part of [[Indiana Territory]] in 1800. Most was declared as [[Michigan Territory]] in 1805, including all of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]]. During the [[War of 1812]], British forces from Canada captured Detroit and [[Fort Mackinac]] early on, giving them a strategic advantage and encouraging native revolt against the United States. American troops retook Detroit in 1813 and Fort Mackinac was returned to the Americans at the end of the war in 1815.\n\nOver the 1810s, the indigenous Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi tribes increasingly decided to oppose white settlement and sided with the British against the U.S. government.\n\n[[File:United States land claims and cessions 1782-1802.png|thumb|Map of the original 13 colonies and their territories, note that Michigan was the object of multiple claims]]\n[[Image:Map of the surveyed part of the territory of Michigan 1825.jpg|thumb|''Map of the Surveyed Part of the Territory of Michigan'' by Orange Risdon, 1825]]\nAfter their defeat in the War of 1812, the tribes were forced to sell all of their land claims to the U.S. federal government by the [[Treaty of Saginaw]] and the [[Treaty of Chicago]]. After the war, the government built forts in some of the northwest territory, such as at Sault Ste. Marie. In the 1820s, the U.S. government assigned Indian agents to work with the tribes, including arranging land cessions and relocation. They forced most of the Native Americans to relocate from Michigan to [[Indian reservation]]s further west.\n\nIn the 1820s and 1830s migrants from [[New England]] began moving to what is now Michigan in large numbers (though there was a trickle of New England settlers who arrived before this date).<ref>The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865 by Lois Kimball Mathews Rosenberry, Houghton Mifflin, 1909   pg. 223</ref>  These were \"[[Yankee]]\" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the [[English people|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled New England during the colonial era.<ref>The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart Holbrook pg. 2</ref>  While most of them came to Michigan directly from New England, there were many who came from [[upstate New York]].  These were people whose parents had moved from New England to upstate New York in the immediate aftermath of the [[American Revolution]].  Due to the prevalence of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York, Michigan was very culturally contiguous with early New England culture for much of its early history.  The Yankee migration to Michigan was a result of several factors, one of which was the overpopulation of New England. The old stock Yankee population had large families, often bearing up to ten children in one household.  Most people were expected to have their own piece of land to farm, and due to the massive and nonstop population boom, land in New England became scarce as every son claimed his own farmstead.  As a result, there was not enough land for every family to have a self-sustaining farm, and Yankee settlers began leaving New England for the [[Midwestern United States]].  This resulted in Michigan's population expanding rapidly in the 1820s.<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State\n By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 91</ref>  The Erie Canal caused such an upsurge in immigration from New England that by 1837 \"it seemed as if all New England were coming\" according to one pioneer.<ref>he Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865 by Lois Kimball Mathews Rosenberry, Houghton Mifflin, 1909   pg. 226</ref>  New England families considered it a route to the \"promised land\".<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State  By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 160</ref>  As a result of this heritage, the New England element of Michigan's population would remain culturally and politically dominant for a long time.<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State  By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 91</ref>\n\nMichigan's oldest university, the [[University of Michigan]] was founded in Detroit in 1817 and was later moved to its present location in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. The state's oldest cultural institution, the Historical Society of Michigan, was established by territorial governor [[Lewis Cass]] and explorer [[Henry Schoolcraft]] in 1828.\n\nRising settlement prompted the elevation of Michigan Territory to that of the present-day [[U.S. state|state]]. In 1835, the federal government enacted a law that would have created a State of Michigan. A territorial dispute with [[Ohio]] over the [[Toledo War|Toledo Strip]], a stretch of land including the city of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], delayed the final accession of statehood. The disputed zone became part of Ohio by the order of a revised bill passed by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Jackson]] which also gave compensation to Michigan in the form of control of the Upper Peninsula. On January 26, 1837, Michigan became the 26th state of the Union.\n\n==From 1837 to 1860==\n[[File:City of Detroit, Michigan - William James Bennett.png|thumb|[[Detroit]], c. 1837, after a sketch by Frederick Grain]]\n[[File:1842 A new map of Michigan with its canals roads distances by H.S.

During the early 1840s, large deposits of copper and iron ores were discovered on the Upper Peninsula. Michigan became the leading U.S. source of these ores by the end of the century, thanks to the influx of experienced Cornish miners (from England) to supervise operations.  Michigan remained a frontier society up until around the time of the Civil War.  Michigan pioneers were overwhelmingly of New England origins, including New England transplants from upstate New York.  The amount with which the New England Yankee population predominated made Michigan unique among frontier states in the antebellum period.  Due to this heritage Michigan was on the forefront of the antislavery crusade and reforms during the 1840s and 1850s.  Another result of this cultural influence was the strength of the Republican Party in Michigan.  Long considered a \"Yankee\" party, Michigan would remain heavily Republican from the Civil War until the 1960s.  The state's leadership in public education is also directly attributable to the New England influence.  Towns such as Vermontville, Bangor, Hartford, Rochester, Utica, and Palmyra Michigan were all named after towns in New England where the founders of those towns were from.  The Congregational Church also was very strong in Michigan from most of Michigan's history, due to the New England origins of the state.  New Englanders and New England transplants from Upstate New York also filled the overwhelming majority of leadership roles in Michigan's early legislatures.<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State  By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 170</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nDuring the [[Second Party System]] (1830-1854), Michigan saw highly developed political parties mobilize the great mass of adult men. The [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] dominated politics before the Civil War. It comprised numerous competing factions, including the federal officeholders who tried to control party affairs, local political organizations with their state legislators and postmasters who managed affairs locally; young anti-slavery activists, typically energized by pietistic ministers in the Baptist and Methodist churches\u2014they fueled the Free Soil Party in 1848-52; [[Jacksonian Democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]]  who opposed taxes and government spending; Catholics, Episcopalians and liturgical Germans annoyed at the moralistic pietists; and residents in the newer western districts who resented the elitism and power of Detroiters. The outstanding Democratic leader was [[Lewis Cass]], (1782-1866) who held numerous high offices and was the Democratic party's losing candidate for president in 1848. Cass was best known for his moderation and support for democracy through [[popular sovereignty]].<ref>Willard Carl Klunder, ''Lewis Cass and the Politics of Moderation'' (1996)</ref> Nativism flared up briefly when the Democrats proposed to allow recent immigrants to vote before they became citizens, and the Whigs opposed.<ref>Ronald P. Formisano, ''The Birth of Mass Political Parties in Michigan, 1827-1861'' (1971)</ref><ref>Bruce A. Rubenstein and Lawrence E. Ziewacz, '' Michigan: A History of the Great Lakes State'' (2002) p 100</ref>  Fifteen of Michigan's first eighteen governors were of Yankee origins, either being from New England or being born in upstate New York to parents who were from New England.<ref>Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State  By Willis F. Dunbar, George S. May pg. 311</ref>\n\nThe minority Whig party relied on conservative merchants, bankers and prosperous farmers, and especially on pietistic, moralistic Protestants from evangelical churches. Nationally, the Whig party collapsed in the 1850s as compromise proved impossible between the anti-slavery Northerners, and the pro-slavery Southerners. For a few years in the mid-1850s, nativist fears of foreign immigrants, especially Catholic Irishmen and Germans, motivated the [[Know-Nothing]] movement. It had little success beyond a brief control of city government in Marshall, Pontiac, Battle Creek, Mt. Clemens, Kalamazoo, and Grand Rapids.\n\nThe collapse of the old political system led to the realignment of voters and parties in the formation of the [[Third Party System]], which formed in the mid-1850s and lasted until the mid-1890s. Michigan was dominated for 80 years by the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|new Republican Party]], later nicknamed the GOP. First established in Jackson and other cities in 1854, it gathered together anti-slavery elements from the Whig, Know-Nothing and Democratic parties, and was a majority in Michigan by the end of the decade. The Democrats had always used equalitarianism as a way to attack the rich elitist Whigs. Now the Republicans turned the tables by charging that Michigan's Democrats were in bed with the South's \"slave power aristocrats.\" The Republicans encouraged the moralistic spirit of the pietists by turning it against slavery and the liquor traffic.<ref>Rubenstein and Ziewacz, '' Michigan: A History of the Great Lakes State'' (2002) p 100-103</ref>\n\n==1860 to 1900==\n\n===Civil War===\n{{main article|Michigan in the American Civil War}}\nMichigan actively participated in the [[American Civil War]] sending thousands of volunteers.<ref>Robert E., Mitchell, \"Civil War Recruiting and Recruits from Ever-Changing Labor Pools: Midland County, Michigan, as a Case Study,\" ''Michigan Historical Review,'' 35 (Spring 2009), 29\u201360.</ref> A study of the cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union. [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] called the war a failure, and it became more and more a partisan Republican effort.<ref>Martin J. Hershock, \"Copperheads and Radicals: Michigan Partisan Politics during the Civil War Era, 1860-1865,\" ''Michigan Historical Review'' (1992) 18#1 pp 28-69</ref> Michigan voters remained evenly split between the parties in the presidential election of 1864.<ref>Peter Bratt, \"A Great Revolution in Feeling: The American Civil War in Niles and Grand Rapids, Michigan,\" ''Michigan Historical Review'' (2005) 31#2 pp 43-66.</ref>\n\n===Gilded Age===\nAfter the war, the local economy became more varied and began to prosper. During the 1870s, the [[Lumberjack|lumbering]], railroads, dairy farming and diversified industry grew rapidly in the state. This led to the rise of several wealthy [[socialite]] families such as the [[Hartwick family]]. The population doubled between 1870 and 1890.\n\nToward the end of the century, the state government established a state school system on the German model, with public schools, high schools, normal schools or colleges for training teachers of lower grades, and colleges for classical academic studies and professors. It dedicated more funds to public education than did any other state in the nation. Within a few years, it established four-year curricula at its normal colleges for teachers, and was the first state to establish a full college program for them.\n\n[[History of railroads in Michigan|Railroads]] have been vital in the history of the population and trade of rough and finished goods in the state of Michigan. While some coastal settlements had previously existed supplied by sailing ships and steamers on the Great Lakes, the population, commercial, and industrial growth of the state further bloomed with the establishment of the railroad.\n\n===Pingree===\nIn 1896, Detroit Mayor [[Hazen Pingree]], a Yankee Republican, was elected governor. He was a social reformer who battled corporations and was an early leader of the [[Progressive Era|Progressive Movement.]] During his four-year term, he promoted the regulation of railroad rates, equal taxation, and municipal ownership of public utilities. He also supported the direct election of U.S. senators; an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]]; an income tax; primary elections; the referendum, the abolition of child labor, and compulsory arbitration of labor disputes. Opposition from Democrats and business-oriented Republicans blocked most of his proposals. Pingree expressed the Progressive fear of corporate power, saying, \"I do not condemn corporations and rich men,\" he said, \"but I would keep them within their proper spheres. It is not safe to entrust the government of the country to the influence of  Wall Street.\"<ref>Russel B. Nye, ''Midwestern Progressive Politics: A Historical Study of Its Origins and Development, 1870-1950'' (1951) p 205</ref>\n\n==1900 to 1941==\nUrban Michigan grew rapidly in the early 20th century, pulled along by the automobile industry in Detroit and vicinity. The [[Breakfast cereal#Grand Rapids: two Kelloggs and a Post|breakfast cereal]] industry was based in Battle Creek where two Kelloggs and a Post built on the local [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] heritage and put the city on the map. Less flamboyantly, thousands of machine shops opened in medium and small cities across the state.\n\n===Automobiles===\nDuring the early 20th century, manufacturing industries became the main source of revenue for Michigan \u2013 in large part, because of the [[automobile]]. In 1897, the [[Oldsmobile|Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] opened a factory in Lansing. In 1903, [[Ford Motor Company]] was also founded nearby in Detroit. In 1904 William Durant of the Flint, Michigan Durant Coach Works, a maker of horse carriages, set his sights on Buick Motor Cars which he soon acquired. With the mass production of the [[Ford Model T]], Detroit became the world capital of the auto industry. General Motors was formed a few years later as William Durant along with Alfred Sloan purchased Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Oakland and other car companies. They soon moved their headquarters from Flint, Michigan to Detroit, Michigan.<ref>Sloan Museum exhibits, Flint, MI</ref> [[General Motors]] is based in Detroit, Chrysler is located in Auburn Hills, and Ford is headquartered in nearby [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]]. Both corporations constructed large industrial complexes in the Detroit metropolitan area, exemplified by the [[River Rouge Plant]], which have made Michigan a national leader in manufacturing since the 1910s. This industrial base produced greatly during [[World War I]], filling a huge demand for military vehicles.\n\n[[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]] was home to one of the first car industry developments. Even before Detroit began building cars on assembly lines, Jackson was busy making parts for cars and putting them together in 1901. By 1910, the auto industry became Jackson's main industry. Over twenty different cars were once made in Jackson. Including: Reeves, Jaxon, Jackson, CarterCar, Orlo, Whiting, Butcher and Gage, Buick, Janney, Globe, Steel Swallow, C.V.I., Imperial, Ames-Dean, Cutting, Standard Electric, Duck, Briscoe, Argo, Hollier, Hackett, Marion-Handly, Gem, Earl, Wolverine, and Kaiser-Darrin. Today the auto industry remains one of the largest employers of skilled machine operators in [[Jackson County, Michigan|Jackson County]].\n\n===Immigrants===\nWith the expansion of industry, hundreds of thousands of migrants from the South and immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were attracted to Detroit. In a short time, it became the fourth largest city in the country - housing shortages persisted for years even as new housing was developed throughout the city. Ethnic immigrant enclaves rapidly developed where churches, groceries, clubs and businesses supported unique communities. The WPA guide to the city in 1939 noted that there were students speaking more than 35 languages in the public schools. Ethnic festivals were a regular part of the city's culture. At the same time, fear of Catholics was strong, and fueled the nativism of the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] recruited widely in the state. The Klan peaked in 1925, but membership fell quickly after its internal scandals were exposed. [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], a German-American Protestant minister trained at Yale Divinity School became nationally famous as a Detroit minister who attacked the KKK, which was strong among white Protestants in the city.<ref>Craig Fox, ''Everyday Klansfolk: White Protestant Life and the KKK in 1920s Michigan'' (2011)</ref>\n\n===Progressivism===\nThe cities of Michigan were centers of municipal reform during the [[Progressive Era]]. Using Kalamazoo as her base, [[Caroline Bartlett Crane]] (1858\u20131935) became a nationally famous expert on municipal [[sanitation]]. She was nonpolitical, but scientific in her methods, and energetic in her approach. She made 60 surveys and studies in 14 states that dealt with housing conditions in [[tenement]]s, of schools, jails, water and sewer systems. She identified and found solutions for air pollution. Crane had a sharp eye for inefficiency, waste, and mismanagement, and was always ready to point out improvements and explain what the best practices were in the nation.<ref>Alan S. Brown, \"Caroline Bartlett Crane and Urban Reform,\" ''Michigan History,''  July 1972, Vol. 56 Issue 4, pp 287-301</ref>\n\nA representative politician was George E. Ellis, mayor of Grand Rapids (1906\u201316). He is remembered as the most dynamic and innovative mayor in the city's history, as well as a powerful political boss who built a coalition of working-class ethnic voters, combined with middle-class reform elements. He broadened the base of political participation, and was on the left or liberal side of the political spectrum.<ref>Anthony R. Travis, \"Mayor George Ellis: Grand Rapids Political Boss And Progressive Reformer,\" ''Michigan History,'' March 1974, Vol. 58 Issue 2, pp 101-130</ref> Somewhat more conservative, and much better known, was Mayor [[Hazen Pingree]] of Detroit (1889\u20131896), who brought progressivism to the governor's mansion with his election in 1896. Pingree was elected mayor in 1889 by promising to expose and end corruption in city paving contracts, sewer contracts, and the school board. He fought privately owned utility [[monopolies]], and set up competing companies owned by the city. He fought the street railway interest, demanding fares be lowered to three cents. When the [[depression of 1893]] caused large-scale unemployment, Pingree expanded welfare programs, initiated [[public works]] programs for the unemployed, built new schools, parks, and public baths, and set aside plots of vacant city land for workers to plant their own vegetable gardens. As the Republican governor, he promoted higher railroad taxes to pay for his reforms.<ref>Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (Oxford U.P., 1969)</ref> After Pingree left Detroit in 1897, the local Democratic ward leaders rebuilt their machine, using an ethnic base. This changed after 1910 as the old-stock Yankee Protestant business leaders, especially from the automobile industry, led a [[Progressive Era]] crusade for efficiency. They elected their own men to office, typified by automaker [[James J. Couzens]], who was mayor of Detroit 1919\u201322, and a powerful US Senator, 1922\u201336. The critical change took place in 1918 when the voters 1918 changed the Common Council from a 42-man body elected on a partisan basis from 21 wards, to a nine-man unit, elected on a non-partisan basis from the city at-large. The ethnics (especially the Germans) and the Democrats lost their political base.<ref>Harry Barnard, ''Independent Man: The Life of Senator James Couzens'' (1958)</ref>\n\n===Women===\nMost young women took jobs before marriage, then quit. Before the growth of high schools after 1900, most women left school after the 8th grade at about age 15. Ciani (2005) shows that type of work they did reflected their ethnicity and marital status. African American mothers often chose day labor, usually as domestic servants, because of the flexibility it afforded. Most mothers receiving pensions were white and sought work only when necessary.<ref>Kyle E. Ciani, \"Hidden Laborers: Female Day Workers In Detroit, 1870-1920,\" ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' Jan 2005, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp 23-51</ref>\n\nAcross the state middle class homemakers shaped numerous new and expanded charitable and professional associations, and promoted mothers' pensions, and expanded forms of social welfare. Many of the Protestant homemakers were active in the temperance and suffrage movements as well. The Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs (DFWC) promoted a very wide range of activities for civic minded middle-class women who conformed to traditional gender roles. The Federation argued that safety and health issues were of greatest concern to mothers and could only be solved by improving municipal conditions outside the home. The Federation pressured Detroit officials to upgrade schools, water supplies and sanitation facilities, and to require safe food handling, and traffic safety. However, the membership was divided on going beyond these issues or collaborating with ethnic or groups or labor unions; it refused to stretch traditional gender boundaries, giving it a conservative reputation.<ref>Jayne Morris-Crowther, \"Municipal Housekeeping: The Political Activities of the Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs in the 1920s,\" ''Michigan Historical Review,'' March 2004, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp 31-57</ref>\n\n===Depression===\nThe [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] caused severe economic hardship in Michigan. Thousands of auto industry workers were dismissed along with other workers from several sectors of the state economy. The financial suffering was aggravated by the fact that remaining [[copper]] reserves in the state lay deep underground. With the discovery of copper finds in other states located in less deep rock layers, local mining fell sharply and most miners left the region or resigned themselves to short hours and long unemployment. After decades of GOP dominance, the Democrats came back to power, as the business-oriented Republican economic policies had failed, the Democrats were energized, prohibition was discredited, and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] offered a [[New Deal]]. Washington spent heavily on relief, recovery, and reform, relieved cities of the burden of relief, and buttressed  a political realignment that gave the [[New Deal Coalition|Democratic Coalition]] parity with the Republican Party in Michigan. By 1936 the realignment was secure, as powerful new industrial labor unions, especially the [[United Auto Workers]] turned the factories from Republican bastions to Democratic strongholds, and the ethnic and black population had shifter to the Democrats.<ref>Philip A. Grant, Jr., \"The Presidential Election of 1932 in Michigan,\" ''Michigan Historical Review'' (1986) 12#1 pp 83-94</ref>\n\nYoung men from relief families signed up for six-month tours in one of the state's 50 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camps in rural areas. They were paid five dollars a month, plus room, board, clothing and medical care, while their families received $25 a month. The [[Works Progress Administration]] was the largest federal agency. It hired more than 500,000 unemployed people (80% men) in Michigan alone to construct major public works such as roads, public buildings, and sewer systems\u2014it was a larger labor force that the state's entire auto industry.\n\n===Unions===\n[[File:Flint Sit-Down Strike window.jpg|thumb|left|Union members occupying a General Motors body factory during the [[Flint Sit-Down Strike]] of 1937 which spurred the organization of militant CIO unions in auto industry]]\n\nThanks to new federal laws, [[Labor history of the United States#Organized labor 1929\u20131955|labor unions]] grew rapidly after 1935, and for the first time became a major presence in large factories. The [[Flint Sit-Down Strike]] of 1936-37 was the decisive event in the formation of the [[United Auto Workers Union]] (UAW). Strikers occupied several General Motors plants for more than forty days, and repelled (in nonviolent fashion) the efforts of the state courts, local police and National Guard to remove them. GM signed a contract that legitimized the UAW, and its membership in the next year grew from 30,000 to 500,000 members.<ref>Sidney Fine, \"The General Motors Sit-Down Strike: A Re-examination,\"''American Historical Review'' (1965) 70#3 pp. 691-71 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1845938 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Sidney Fine, ''Sit-Down: The General Motors Strike of 1936-1937'' (1969)</ref>\n\nDuring World War II [[Walter Reuther]] took control of the UAW, and soon led major strikes in 1946. He ousted the Communists from the positions of power, especially at the Ford local 600. He was one of the most articulate and energetic leaders of the CIO, and of the merged [[AFL-CIO]]. Using brilliant negotiating tactics he leveraged high profits for the Big Three automakers into higher wages and superior benefits for UAW members.\n\n==After 1941==\n[[File:Gerald Ford presidential portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Gerald Ford]], a politician from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] who was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] thirteen times and also served as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] and then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], became the 38th [[President of the United States]] after the resignation of [[Richard Nixon]].]]\nThe entry of the United States into World War II in 1941 the same year ended the economic contraction in Michigan. Wartime required the large-scale production of weapons and military vehicles, leading to a massive number of new jobs being filled. After the end of the war, both the automotive and copper mining industries recovered.<ref>Alan Clive, ''State of War: Michigan in World War II'' (1979)</ref>\n\nStarting during World War I, the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] fueled the movement of hundreds of thousands of [[African American|African-Americans]] from the South to industrial jobs in Michigan especially in Detroit. Migration of white southerners from Appalachia to the city increased the volatility of change. Population increases continued with industrial expansion during World War II and afterward. African Americans contributed to a new vibrant urban culture, with expansion of new music, food and culture.\n\nThe postwar years were initially a prosperous time for industrial workers, who achieved middle-class livelihoods, fostered the [[Baby Boom]], and sought better, more spacious housing in safer neighborhoods. These were the years of the creation and popularity of [[Motown Records]]. By late mid-century, however, [[deindustrialization]] and restructuring cost many jobs. The economy suffered and the city postponed needed changes. Neglect of social problems and urban decline fed racial conflicts. In 1967 there was [[12th Street riot|a major riot in Detroit]] that burned out the inner city, caused tens of millions of dollars in damages, and resulted in 43 deaths with The U.S. Army being called in to stop it. The violence then spread to several other Michigan cities and was the trigger for a mass migration to the suburbs.\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Oil Crisis]] caused economic recession in the United States and greatly affected the Michigan economy. Afterward, automobile companies in the United States faced greater multinational competition, especially from Japan. As a consequence, domestic auto makers enacted cost-cutting measures to remain competitive at home and abroad. [[Unemployment]] rates rose dramatically in the state.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Michigan possessed the highest unemployment rate of any U.S. state. Large spending cuts to education and public health were repeatedly made in an attempt to reduce growing state budget deficits. A strengthening of the auto industry and an increase in [[tax revenue]] stabilized government and household finances in the 1980s. Increasing competition by Japanese and South Korean auto companies continues to challenge the state economy, which depends heavily on the automobile industry. Since the late 1980s, the Michigan government has actively sought to attract new industries, thus reducing economic reliance on a single sector.\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Surveys and reference===\n* Bald, F.

The stockade attracted squatters, surveying parties, and other settlers who had taken grants to live in the local cabins until they could build their own; hence the little community became known as \"Hole's Station\". Settlers came west primarily from [[Pennsylvania]]. By 1822, the unincorporated community had become a village; it achieved city status in the 1920s.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBy 1827, the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] was under construction through the community, which improved transportation of people and goods through the region. The formal opening took place in January 1829, when the ''Governor Brown'' was the first [[packet boat]] to go through the settlement. Also that year the first boats from [[Cincinnati]] had arrived and passed through Miamisburg to get to Dayton. By 1834 the canal had been extended to Piqua, and many businesses along the river grew. The 1840s and the 1850s were brought the best of times to the canals.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[George Kinder]], a local resident, shipped bags of food to Ireland during its Great Famine; these also contained his address, with ads saying that he was hiring immigrant workers. Some Irish immigrants did come to Miamisburg and surrounding cities in search of work. By the early 20th century, however, the canal was abandoned. Later, highways carried most of the local traffic.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nMiamisburg was the site of one of the first post-war U.S [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) facilities, beginning in 1947. The Dayton area had supported numerous [[Dayton Project|secret operations]] for the War Department during [[World War II]]. As the war ended, the majority of these operations were moved to the Miamisburg [[Mound Laboratories|Mound Laboratory]], which was operated by the [[Monsanto Chemical Company]]. The Mound Labs were to monitor all aspects of the US nuclear defense stockpile.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe Mound Plant, built in 1947, was situated on a {{convert|306|acre|adj=on}} site in the city {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of Dayton. The workers, who numbered more than 2,000 at the height of the production, made [[plutonium]] detonators for [[nuclear weapons]]. Their work was very classified. The plant had a small army of security guards and was ringed by chain-link fencing and razor wire. When the [[Cold War]] ended, the plant discontinued the detonator work, but it continued to make nuclear power generators for space probes.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May 1993 U.S Department of Energy decided to end all production at the Mound. This move affected 2,100 employees in the local area. By 1996 cleanup of radioactive and hazardous waste was the main activity at the Plant. The Mound Development Corporation spearheaded the creation of the Mound Advanced Technology Center in the redevelopment of the plant, with the Montgomery County Regional Dispatch Center joining 14 other tenants in March 2009. In December 2010, the Dayton Police Department became the 17th law enforcement agency, along with 11 fire departments, to be dispatched from the regional center.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nOn September 10, 1978, 15 cars of a [[Conrail]] freight train [[List of rail accidents (1950\u20131999)#1978|derailed]] as the result of a [[hot box]], caused by uneven distribution of steel ingots in a [[gondola (rail)|gondola]] loaded at [[Buffalo, New York]] by [[Republic Steel]]. They demolished a house at the Pearl Street crossing and killed three of its five occupants. As a result of a cooperative investigation by the Miamisburg Police Department and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]], the deaths were ruled homicides by the Montgomery County Coroner.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nEight years later, on July 8, 1986, another train derailed on the [[CSX Transportation]] line on the west bank of the river, igniting [[phosphorus#White phosphorus and related molecular forms|yellow phosphorus]] contained in a tanker car. 7,000 local residents were initially evacuated, but during clearing operations the next day another large escape of product resulted in re-ignition of the phosphorus. This led to the evacuation of approximately 30,000 people across southern Montgomery County, the largest evacuation in Ohio history.

Miamisburg is known for its large industry (mainly for its [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] operations during [[World War II]]) and retail factors (such as the [[Dayton Mall]]) commercial business area, which is partially located in Miami Township, but is probably most famous for being the home to the Miamisburg Mound. Miamisburg borders [[Miami Township, Montgomery County, Ohio|Miami Township]], [[Springboro, Ohio|Springboro]], and [[West Carrollton, Ohio|West Carrollton]].

The stockade attracted squatters, surveying parties, and other settlers who had taken grants to live in the local cabins until they could build their own; hence the little community became known as \"Hole's Station\". Settlers came west primarily from [[Pennsylvania]]. By 1822, the unincorporated community had become a village; it achieved city status in the 1920s.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBy 1827, the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] was under construction through the community, which improved transportation of people and goods through the region. The formal opening took place in January 1829, when the ''Governor Brown'' was the first [[packet boat]] to go through the settlement. Also that year the first boats from [[Cincinnati]] had arrived and passed through Miamisburg to get to Dayton. By 1834 the canal had been extended to Piqua, and many businesses along the river grew. The 1840s and the 1850s were brought the best of times to the canals.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[George Kinder]], a local resident, shipped bags of food to Ireland during its Great Famine; these also contained his address, with ads saying that he was hiring immigrant workers. Some Irish immigrants did come to Miamisburg and surrounding cities in search of work. By the early 20th century, however, the canal was abandoned. Later, highways carried most of the local traffic.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nMiamisburg was the site of one of the first post-war U.S [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) facilities, beginning in 1947. The Dayton area had supported numerous [[Dayton Project|secret operations]] for the War Department during [[World War II]]. As the war ended, the majority of these operations were moved to the Miamisburg [[Mound Laboratories|Mound Laboratory]], which was operated by the [[Monsanto Chemical Company]]. The Mound Labs were to monitor all aspects of the US nuclear defense stockpile.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe Mound Plant, built in 1947, was situated on a {{convert|306|acre|adj=on}} site in the city {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of Dayton. The workers, who numbered more than 2,000 at the height of the production, made [[plutonium]] detonators for [[nuclear weapons]]. Their work was very classified. The plant had a small army of security guards and was ringed by chain-link fencing and razor wire. When the [[Cold War]] ended, the plant discontinued the detonator work, but it continued to make nuclear power generators for space probes.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May 1993 U.S Department of Energy decided to end all production at the Mound. This move affected 2,100 employees in the local area. By 1996 cleanup of radioactive and hazardous waste was the main activity at the Plant. The Mound Development Corporation spearheaded the creation of the Mound Advanced Technology Center in the redevelopment of the plant, with the Montgomery County Regional Dispatch Center joining 14 other tenants in March 2009. In December 2010, the Dayton Police Department became the 17th law enforcement agency, along with 11 fire departments, to be dispatched from the regional center.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nOn September 10, 1978, 15 cars of a [[Conrail]] freight train [[List of rail accidents (1950\u20131999)#1978|derailed]] as the result of a [[hot box]], caused by uneven distribution of steel ingots in a [[gondola (rail)|gondola]] loaded at [[Buffalo, New York]] by [[Republic Steel]]. They demolished a house at the Pearl Street crossing and killed three of its five occupants. As a result of a cooperative investigation by the Miamisburg Police Department and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]], the deaths were ruled homicides by the Montgomery County Coroner.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nEight years later, on July 8, 1986, another train derailed on the [[CSX Transportation]] line on the west bank of the river, igniting [[phosphorus#White phosphorus and related molecular forms|yellow phosphorus]] contained in a tanker car. 7,000 local residents were initially evacuated, but during clearing operations the next day another large escape of product resulted in re-ignition of the phosphorus. This led to the evacuation of approximately 30,000 people across southern Montgomery County, the largest evacuation in Ohio history. The resulting thick white cloud engulfed communities as far north as Yellow Springs, Pitchin, and South Vienna. Rolling in like a massive desert dust storm across the horizon, the chemical cloud hugged the ground and blotted out the sun for several minutes before dissipating. 569 persons were treated for \"various complaints,\" more than $3.5&nbsp;million in property damages occurred, and more than $1&nbsp;billion in lawsuits resulted.<ref>NTSB Hazardous Materials Report NTSB/HZM 87/01, Internet Archives.

JatroDiesel manufactures biodiesel equipment and produces [[biodiesel]], a [[sustainable]] [[alternative energy]] fuel to [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. The headquarters of National City Mortgage Corporation, a division of [[National City Corp.]] was in Miamisburg. In 2009, PNC Bank purchased National City Bank and converted National City Mortgage into PNC Mortgage. The headquarters for PNC Mortgage moved to Downers Grove, Ill, but much of the servicing division remains in Miamisburg. World headquarters of [[LexisNexis]] were in Miamisburg.

Miamisburg is prone to severe weather because of its location in the [[Midwestern]] section of the United States. [[Tornadoes]] are possible from spring to fall. [[Floods]], [[blizzards]], and severe thunderstorms can also occur.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nMiamisburg has suffered some natural disasters. On June 9, 1869, a tornado struck the northwest part of town, reportedly destroying roofs and chimneys, as well as uprooting trees. It also destroyed Linden Avenue Bridge. Blizzards struck the town in 1978, 2004, and 2008.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn 1913, the [[Great Dayton Flood]] destroyed most of the city. Not much precipitation is needed to flood locations such as Rice Field(s), which is on the banks of the Great Miami River.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==City architecture==\nDue to the growth of the city in the 19th century, many of the older houses in the city are [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style homes. They are concentrated in the neighborhood of \"Old Miamisburg\" (downtown and riverfront areas). Other architectural styles include Queen Anne, [[Italianate]], and [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]]-styled buildings. Much of [[Miami Township, Montgomery County, Ohio|Miami Township]] has residential housing of single-family homes, which were built during the expanded suburban development typical of the late 20th century, especially the 1970s through the 1990s. Newer houses have been built in the 21st century as some residents have sought higher-priced luxury homes, evidenced in new developments such as Pipestone, Crains Run, Heincke Woods, and Bear Creek.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nTo encourage and recognize Miamisburg citizens for maintaining the aesthetic appearance (tidiness, landscaping) of their property, the City Beautification Commission selects a number of \"City Beautiful Awards\" each July, August, and September for both residential and commercial properties. Additionally, the City Beautification Commission also offers awards for high-quality architectural renovation projects and for a number of holiday decoration displays in December.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Transportation==\nMiamisburg is part of the [[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority]], which has many bus routes throughout the city.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[CSX]] and [[Norfolk Southern]] provide freight railway services.

He began the formal study of drawing at fifteen but, at his father's insistence, he changed to architecture. Failure to pass the entrance exams at Paris\u2019 [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] ended any plans for a career as an architect, although he briefly studied painting there under [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] in 1864. (His younger brother [[Gaston Redon]] would become a noted architect.)\n\nBack in his native Bordeaux, he took up sculpting, and [[Rodolphe Bresdin]] instructed him in [[etching]] and [[lithography]]. His artistic career was interrupted in 1870 when he was drafted<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/redon/about/childhood.html|title=The Fitzwilliam Museum - Home {{!}} Online Resources {{!}} Online Exhibitions {{!}} Redon {{!}} About Odilon Redon {{!}} Childhood and Early Career|date=2009-11-05|website=www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-07}}</ref> to serve in the army in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] until its end in 1871.\n\nAt the end of the war, he moved to Paris and resumed working almost exclusively in charcoal and lithography. He called his visionary works, conceived in shades of black, his ''noirs''. It was not until 1878 that his work gained any recognition with ''Guardian Spirit of the Waters''; he published his first album of lithographs, titled ''Dans le R\u00eave'', in 1879. Still, Redon remained relatively unknown until the appearance in 1884 of a cult novel by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] titled ''[[\u00c0 rebours]] (Against Nature)''. The story featured a decadent aristocrat who collected Redon's drawings.\n\nIn the 1890s pastel and oils became his favored media; he produced no more ''noirs'' after 1900. In 1899, he exhibited with the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]] at [[Durand-Ruel]]'s.\n\nRedon had a keen interest in Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. The figure of the [[Buddha]] increasingly showed in his work. Influences of [[Japonism]] blended into his art, such as the painting ''The Death of the Buddha'' around 1899, ''The Buddha'' in 1906, ''Jacob and the Angel'' in 1905, and ''Vase with Japanese warrior'' in 1905, amongst many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/odilon-redon-vase-au-guerrier-japonais-5289376-details.aspx |title=Odilon Redon (1840-1916) &#124; Vase au guerrier japonais &#124; IMPRESSIONIST & MODERN ART Auction &#124; 20th Century, Drawings & Watercolors &#124; Christie's |publisher=Christies.com |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pressimages.fondationbeyeler.ch/aktuelle-ausstellungen/odilon-redon |title=Odilon Redon &#124; Press Images - Fondation Beyeler |publisher=Pressimages.fondationbeyeler.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\nBaron Robert de Domecy (1867\u20131946) commissioned the artist in 1899 to create 17 decorative panels for the dining room of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Domecy-sur-le-Vault]] near [[Sermizelles]] in Burgundy. Redon had created large decorative works for private residences in the past, but his compositions for the ch\u00e2teau de Domecy in 1900\u20131901 were his most radical compositions to that point and mark the transition from ornamental to abstract painting. The landscape details do not show a specific place or space. Only details of trees, twigs with leaves, and budding flowers in an endless horizon can be seen. The colours used are mostly yellow, grey, brown and light blue. The influence of the Japanese painting style found on folding screens ''[[by\u014dbu]]'' is discernible in his choice of colours and the rectangular proportions of most of the up to 2.5 metres high panels.

''Odilon Redon''. p. 2.</ref> His work represents an exploration of his internal feelings and psyche.

Washington, D.C.: Phillips Collection. unpaginated. {{OCLC|20763694}}.</ref> A telling source of Redon's inspiration and the forces behind his works can be found in his journal ''A Soi-m\u00eame (To Myself)''. His process was explained best by himself when he said:\n\n{{quote|I have often, as an exercise and as a sustenance, painted before an object down to the smallest accidents of its visual appearance; but the day left me sad and with an unsatiated thirst. The next day I let the other source run, that of imagination, through the recollection of the forms and I was then reassured and appeased.}}\n\nThe mystery and evocativeness of Redon's drawings are described by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] in the following passage from the novel ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' (1884):\n\n{{quote|Those were the pictures bearing the signature: Odilon Redon.

He began the formal study of drawing at fifteen but, at his father's insistence, he changed to architecture. Failure to pass the entrance exams at Paris\u2019 [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] ended any plans for a career as an architect, although he briefly studied painting there under [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] in 1864. (His younger brother [[Gaston Redon]] would become a noted architect.)\n\nBack in his native Bordeaux, he took up sculpting, and [[Rodolphe Bresdin]] instructed him in [[etching]] and [[lithography]]. His artistic career was interrupted in 1870 when he was drafted<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/redon/about/childhood.html|title=The Fitzwilliam Museum - Home {{!}} Online Resources {{!}} Online Exhibitions {{!}} Redon {{!}} About Odilon Redon {{!}} Childhood and Early Career|date=2009-11-05|website=www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-07}}</ref> to serve in the army in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] until its end in 1871.\n\nAt the end of the war, he moved to Paris and resumed working almost exclusively in charcoal and lithography. He called his visionary works, conceived in shades of black, his ''noirs''. It was not until 1878 that his work gained any recognition with ''Guardian Spirit of the Waters''; he published his first album of lithographs, titled ''Dans le R\u00eave'', in 1879. Still, Redon remained relatively unknown until the appearance in 1884 of a cult novel by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] titled ''[[\u00c0 rebours]] (Against Nature)''. The story featured a decadent aristocrat who collected Redon's drawings.\n\nIn the 1890s pastel and oils became his favored media; he produced no more ''noirs'' after 1900. In 1899, he exhibited with the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]] at [[Durand-Ruel]]'s.\n\nRedon had a keen interest in Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. The figure of the [[Buddha]] increasingly showed in his work. Influences of [[Japonism]] blended into his art, such as the painting ''The Death of the Buddha'' around 1899, ''The Buddha'' in 1906, ''Jacob and the Angel'' in 1905, and ''Vase with Japanese warrior'' in 1905, amongst many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/odilon-redon-vase-au-guerrier-japonais-5289376-details.aspx |title=Odilon Redon (1840-1916) &#124; Vase au guerrier japonais &#124; IMPRESSIONIST & MODERN ART Auction &#124; 20th Century, Drawings & Watercolors &#124; Christie's |publisher=Christies.com |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pressimages.fondationbeyeler.ch/aktuelle-ausstellungen/odilon-redon |title=Odilon Redon &#124; Press Images - Fondation Beyeler |publisher=Pressimages.fondationbeyeler.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\nBaron Robert de Domecy (1867\u20131946) commissioned the artist in 1899 to create 17 decorative panels for the dining room of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Domecy-sur-le-Vault]] near [[Sermizelles]] in Burgundy. Redon had created large decorative works for private residences in the past, but his compositions for the ch\u00e2teau de Domecy in 1900\u20131901 were his most radical compositions to that point and mark the transition from ornamental to abstract painting. The landscape details do not show a specific place or space. Only details of trees, twigs with leaves, and budding flowers in an endless horizon can be seen. The colours used are mostly yellow, grey, brown and light blue. The influence of the Japanese painting style found on folding screens ''[[by\u014dbu]]'' is discernible in his choice of colours and the rectangular proportions of most of the up to 2.5 metres high panels.  Fifteen of them are located today in the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], acquisitioned in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html |title=Musee d'Orsay : Homepage |publisher=Musee-orsay.fr |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\nDomecy also commissioned Redon to paint portraits of his wife and their daughter Jeanne, two of which are in the collections of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and the [[Getty Museum]] in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/baronne-robert-de-domecy-8842.html?tx_commentaire_pi1pidLi=509&tx_commentaire_pi1from=841&cHash=abd6d391a6|title=Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay: Odilon Redon Baroness Robert de Domecy|date=4 February 2009|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=257416 |title=Baronne de Domecy (Getty Museum) |publisher=Getty.edu |accessdate=2015-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016184507/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=257416 |archivedate=2014-10-16 }}</ref> Most of the paintings remained in the Domecy family collection until the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.N08633.html/f/46/N08633-46.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sotheby's Impressionist & Modern Art Evening Sale |publisher=Sothebys.com |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903 Redon was awarded the [[Legion of Honor]].<ref>Redon and Werner (1969), p. ix.</ref>\nHis popularity increased when a catalogue of etchings and lithographs was published by [[Andr\u00e9 Mellerio]] in 1913; that same year, he was given the largest single representation at the groundbreaking U.S. [[International Exhibition of Modern Art]] (aka [[Armory Show]]), in New York City, Chicago and Boston.\n\nRedon died on July 6, 1916.
