To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made. Charlotte works at the Blue Cat and declines Wyatt's \"anti-tourists\" party invitation to go with Zach, a tourist from Chicago.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them. Not only was Louis skimming, which Del suspected and Marty confirmed when analyzing the ledgers, he was also informing to Roy at the FBI.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation.

Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

A storm stranded Rybnikov on an island in [[Lake Onega]] where he heard the sound of a bylina being sung; he persuaded the singer to repeat the song and wrote down his words. He proceeded to collect several hundred bylina, all of which he recorded from spoken paraphrase, and published them from 1861 to 1867 in several volumes entitled ''Songs Collected by P. N.

He noticed that the rhythm differed between the sung and spoken versions, and asked the performers to pause for a longer period of time between lines to allow him time to record the words from the song itself. He also organized his collection by singer rather than subject and included short biographical sketches of the performers with their collected songs, thus focusing on the singer's role in the composition of the song.{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998| pages= xvi-xvii }} Following the work of Rybnikov and Gilferding, many more scholars searched for byliny everywhere in northern Russia, and obtained byliny from the shores of the White Sea and the rivers flowing to the north.{{sfnp|Oinas|1978|page=237}}\n\n==Classifications==\nThere are several ways to categorize bylina, and scholars disagree on which classification to use. Scholars from the mythological school differentiate between byliny about 'older' and 'younger' heroes. The 'older' heroes resembled mythological figures, while the 'younger' heroes resembled ordinary human beings. The historical school classifies byliny based on the principality in which the story took place, as in Kievan, Novgorodian, and Galician-Volhynian cycles. The mythological byliny of giants and the like probably originated long before the Kievan state was founded, and cannot be classified easily by principality. Scholars of the historical school often consider mythological byliny separately. Other scholars group byliny based on content, including heroic, fairy tale type, novella type and ballad-byliny. Most scholars prefer classification based on principalities.{{sfnp|Oinas|1978|page=240}}\n\n==Structure==\nBecause of their nature as performed pieces, byliny singers employ basically linear and easy to follow structure.{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998| pages= xxvi-xxvii }} Byliny structure typically includes three basic parts, introduction, narrative portion and epilogue. The introduction sometimes includes a verse to entice the audience to listen. Introductions often describe heroes at a feast being given a task or setting out on a mission. The narrative portion relates the adventure with exaggerated details and hyperbole to make the story more exciting. The epilogue refers to the reward for the mission, a moral or a reference to the sea, since byliny were often performed to attempt to calm the sea.{{sfnp|Oinas|1978|page=247-249 }} To help listeners grasp the story, singers used 'tag lines' to preface speeches or dialogues, setting up for the audience who is talking to whom.{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998| pages=  xxvi-xxvii }}\n\n==Common themes==\nScenes common to byliny include a hero taking leave of his mother, saddling a horse, entering a council chamber, bragging, departing over the wall of a city, going on a journey, urging on his horse, in battle, dressing in the morning, exchanging taunts with an enemy, becoming blood brothers with another hero, and asking for mercy. Singers may use their telling of these scenes in many of their songs, incorporating different elements in song after song. Themes in many bylina include the birth and childhood of a hero, father and son fighting, battling a monster, the imprisoned or reluctant hero returning in time to save his city, matchmaking or bride taking, a husband arriving at the wedding of his wife and encounters with a sorceress who turns men into animals.{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998| pages= xxvii-xxviii }} Christian beliefs mixed with pre-Christian ideas of magic and paganism in byliny, for instance, saints would appear to defend mortals against darkness.<ref name=\"Warner\" />\n\n==Major characters and prototypes==\n[[File:Volga bilibin03.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Mikula Selyaninovich]] and [[Volga Svyatoslavich]] with his [[druzhina]].]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"border\n\n! style=\"width:145px;\"|Russian name!! style=\"width:120px;\"|English name!! style=\"width:330px;\"|Prototype\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0418\u043b\u044c\u044f \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0446}}  || [[Ilya Muromets]] || Saint Ilya Pechorsky, monk of [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]]\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044f \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447}} || [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] || [[Dobrynya]], [[Kievan Rus|Kievan]] [[voivode]].\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0410\u043b\u0451\u0448\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} || [[Alyosha Popovich]] || [[Principality of Rostov|Rostov]] [[boyar]] Alexander (Olesha) Popovich.\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440}} || [[Svyatogor]] || East Slavic pre-Christian folk tales.\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u041c\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} || [[Mikula Selyaninovich]] || Personification of the Russian peasants.\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440}} || {{Interlanguage link multi|Prince Vladimir|ru|3=\u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 (\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436)}} || [[Vladimir the Great]] \n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0412\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0447}} || [[Volga Svyatoslavich]] || [[Prince Oleg]]\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0415\u0432\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442}} || [[Eupaty Kolovrat]] || [[Principality of Ryazan|Ryazan]] nobleman with the same name.\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0421\u0430\u0434\u043a\u043e}} || [[Sadko]] || \n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430-\u043a\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043c\u044f\u043a\u0430}} || [[Nikita the Tanner]] || \n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432}} || [[Vasily Buslayev]] || \n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0414\u044e\u043a \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}  || [[Duke Stepanovich]] ||\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0417\u043c\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044b\u0447}}  || [[Zmey Gorynych]] || Slavic variation of the [[European dragon]].\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0439-\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043a}} || [[Nightingale the Robber]] || \n|}\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[Vasily Kalinnikov]], a famous [[russian composers|Russian composer]] from the nineteenth century composed an [[overture]] on this theme, ''Bylina''.

The epilogue refers to the reward for the mission, a moral or a reference to the sea, since byliny were often performed to attempt to calm the sea.{{sfnp|Oinas|1978|page=247-249 }} To help listeners grasp the story, singers used 'tag lines' to preface speeches or dialogues, setting up for the audience who is talking to whom.{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998| pages=  xxvi-xxvii }}\n\n==Common themes==\nScenes common to byliny include a hero taking leave of his mother, saddling a horse, entering a council chamber, bragging, departing over the wall of a city, going on a journey, urging on his horse, in battle, dressing in the morning, exchanging taunts with an enemy, becoming blood brothers with another hero, and asking for mercy. Singers may use their telling of these scenes in many of their songs, incorporating different elements in song after song. Themes in many bylina include the birth and childhood of a hero, father and son fighting, battling a monster, the imprisoned or reluctant hero returning in time to save his city, matchmaking or bride taking, a husband arriving at the wedding of his wife and encounters with a sorceress who turns men into animals.{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998| pages= xxvii-xxviii }} Christian beliefs mixed with pre-Christian ideas of magic and paganism in byliny, for instance, saints would appear to defend mortals against darkness.<ref name=\"Warner\" />\n\n==Major characters and prototypes==\n[[File:Volga bilibin03.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Mikula Selyaninovich]] and [[Volga Svyatoslavich]] with his [[druzhina]].]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"border\n\n! style=\"width:145px;\"|Russian name!! style=\"width:120px;\"|English name!! style=\"width:330px;\"|Prototype\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0418\u043b\u044c\u044f \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0446}}  || [[Ilya Muromets]] || Saint Ilya Pechorsky, monk of [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]]\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044f \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447}} || [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] || [[Dobrynya]], [[Kievan Rus|Kievan]] [[voivode]].\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0410\u043b\u0451\u0448\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} || [[Alyosha Popovich]] || [[Principality of Rostov|Rostov]] [[boyar]] Alexander (Olesha) Popovich.\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440}} || [[Svyatogor]] || East Slavic pre-Christian folk tales.\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u041c\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} || [[Mikula Selyaninovich]] || Personification of the Russian peasants.\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440}} || {{Interlanguage link multi|Prince Vladimir|ru|3=\u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 (\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436)}} || [[Vladimir the Great]] \n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0412\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0447}} || [[Volga Svyatoslavich]] || [[Prince Oleg]]\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0415\u0432\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442}} || [[Eupaty Kolovrat]] || [[Principality of Ryazan|Ryazan]] nobleman with the same name.\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0421\u0430\u0434\u043a\u043e}} || [[Sadko]] || \n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430-\u043a\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043c\u044f\u043a\u0430}} || [[Nikita the Tanner]] || \n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432}} || [[Vasily Buslayev]] || \n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0414\u044e\u043a \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}  || [[Duke Stepanovich]] ||\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0417\u043c\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044b\u0447}}  || [[Zmey Gorynych]] || Slavic variation of the [[European dragon]].\n|-\n| {{lang|ru|\u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0439-\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043a}} || [[Nightingale the Robber]] || \n|}\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[Vasily Kalinnikov]], a famous [[russian composers|Russian composer]] from the nineteenth century composed an [[overture]] on this theme, ''Bylina''.

At about 8:30&nbsp;p.m., 15 officers surrounded the building and 12 others entered; nine of these went to the three-room apartment of Davis's sister Regina Lewis and seven entered it. Inside were Davis, his girlfriend, his sister, her husband, and four children.

The jury believed the events presented by the defense, in which an officer entered the apartment with a shotgun and fired at Davis, while he was seated behind a desk holding his baby. The officer, thinking he had hit Davis, was then shot in the neck by Davis with a handgun. The police took cover, returning fire as they retreated. In the confusion, no one kept track of Davis, who slipped into his other sister's apartment and escaped out a back window. Lewis had complained to her brother about him bringing guns to the apartment and told him to get out; he did leave but returned.

They surrounded the 14-story building, closed off local streets and posted sharpshooters on nearby rooftops. After searching his sister's second-floor apartment, police began a systematic canvass of all 312 units. At some point during the day, Mr. Davis forced his way at gunpoint into Apartment 14-EB, where Elroy and Sophia Sewer lived with their two daughters, just as neighbor Theresa Ali, and her 2-year-old son, arrived for a visit. Mr. Sewer arrived home at 8 P.M. to find his family and the neighbors being held hostage by Mr. Davis. At 11:45&nbsp;p.m. Davis released the two visitors and sent Mr. Sewer out to pick up food from a nearby Chinese restaurant. He also ordered Mr. Sewer to call Mr. Davis' mother's and sister's tapped telephones and give false location information. When the husband returned with the food he was stopped for questioning by the police and, at 12:45&nbsp;a.m., informed them that his wife and two daughters were being held hostage by Mr. Davis.<ref name= \"NYT_1986-12-07cornered\"/>\n\nPolice set up a command post in a nearby apartment and by 1:30&nbsp;a.m. had established telephone contact. At one point Davis threatened to kill the hostages with a hand grenade, at other points he chatted with negotiators about stereo equipment, asked about a lawyer, and showed concern for his own safety, saying that he was afraid police would harm him. Throughout, negotiators repeated \"There is no use running, you have nowhere to hide now.\"<ref name= \"NYT_1986-12-07on\">{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50712FB3C580C748CDDAB0994DE484D81|title=On the 14th floor, siege ends in quiet talk|last=Gutis|first=Philip S.|date=1986-12-07|work=The New York Times|quote=At times, the police said, the man holed up in the apartment next door spoke very much like a 'frightened child,' concerned solely with his personal safety.

Despite three trials in two years, prosecutors were unable to convince a jury of Larry Davis' guilt for any but the weapons charge, finally getting a conviction more than four years after the shootout.\n\n===Murders of four Bronx drug dealers===\nDuring their opening of and closing arguments Davis's attorneys [[William Kunstler]] and [[Lynne Stewart]] contended that the prosecution evidence was fabricated and that the murder charges were a frame-up to excuse the police raid on Davis's sister's apartment. They further contended that Davis had been recruited into a drug ring by rogue police officers and that the object of the raid was to kill him. The prosecution contended that Davis was a crack dealer who specialized in the armed robbery of other crack dealers, and presented testimony from more than 50 witnesses, including ballistic evidence and fingerprints on a cash box that placed Davis at the scene of the October 1986 murders. The jury found conflicting testimony from witnesses, and discrepancies in times given by prosecution witnesses. After deliberating for nine days, the longest in Bronx history for a single defendant, the jury acquitted Davis of the charges.<ref name=\"NYT_1988-03-04\">{{ cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED7103CF937A35750C0A96E948260|title=Larry Davis Cleared In the 1986 Slayings Of 4 Drug Suspects|last=Verhovek|first=Sam Howe|date=1988-03-04|work=The New York Times|quote=After presenting a defense based almost entirely on the assertion that he had been framed by the authorities, Davis was acquitted of all charges last night in the murder of four suspected drug dealers 16 months ago in the South Bronx.|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>\n\n===Attempted murders of nine police officers===\nDavis was next tried for shooting six police officers during the apartment raid.

McCarren pursued, and the next time he saw Davis was when Davis shot him in the mouth with the .45 pistol.\nA 12-gauge shotgun slug was found embedded in a drawer in the bedroom and the defense suggested that McCarren was carrying a 12-gauge shotgun and was the first to fire. McCarren said that he had been carrying a shotgun earlier in the evening but had turned it over to another detective assigned to cover the rear of the building, and was armed with only a 38-caliber service revolver when he entered the apartment.<ref name= \"NYT_1988-09-28\">{{ cite news\n| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDB1530F93BA1575AC0A96E948260\n| title= Ex-Detective Denies Firing A Shotgun in the Davis Raid\n| last= Blair\n| first= William G\n| date= 1988-09-28\n| work= The New York Times\n| quote= A retired Bronx detective testified yesterday that he never carried a shotgun or fired a shotgun at Larry Davis during a shootout with him in a Bronx apartment in 1986 in which the detective was wounded.\n| accessdate= 2007-12-23 }}</ref>\n\nThe defense contended that Davis feared for his life and acted in [[self-defense]].

At about 8:30&nbsp;p.m., 15 officers surrounded the building and 12 others entered; nine of these went to the three-room apartment of Davis's sister Regina Lewis and seven entered it. Inside were Davis, his girlfriend, his sister, her husband, and four children.

The jury believed the events presented by the defense, in which an officer entered the apartment with a shotgun and fired at Davis, while he was seated behind a desk holding his baby. The officer, thinking he had hit Davis, was then shot in the neck by Davis with a handgun. The police took cover, returning fire as they retreated. In the confusion, no one kept track of Davis, who slipped into his other sister's apartment and escaped out a back window. Lewis had complained to her brother about him bringing guns to the apartment and told him to get out; he did leave but returned.

They surrounded the 14-story building, closed off local streets and posted sharpshooters on nearby rooftops. After searching his sister's second-floor apartment, police began a systematic canvass of all 312 units. At some point during the day, Mr. Davis forced his way at gunpoint into Apartment 14-EB, where Elroy and Sophia Sewer lived with their two daughters, just as neighbor Theresa Ali, and her 2-year-old son, arrived for a visit. Mr. Sewer arrived home at 8 P.M. to find his family and the neighbors being held hostage by Mr. Davis. At 11:45&nbsp;p.m. Davis released the two visitors and sent Mr. Sewer out to pick up food from a nearby Chinese restaurant. He also ordered Mr. Sewer to call Mr. Davis' mother's and sister's tapped telephones and give false location information. When the husband returned with the food he was stopped for questioning by the police and, at 12:45&nbsp;a.m., informed them that his wife and two daughters were being held hostage by Mr. Davis.<ref name= \"NYT_1986-12-07cornered\"/>\n\nPolice set up a command post in a nearby apartment and by 1:30&nbsp;a.m. had established telephone contact.

Despite three trials in two years, prosecutors were unable to convince a jury of Larry Davis' guilt for any but the weapons charge, finally getting a conviction more than four years after the shootout.\n\n===Murders of four Bronx drug dealers===\nDuring their opening of and closing arguments Davis's attorneys [[William Kunstler]] and [[Lynne Stewart]] contended that the prosecution evidence was fabricated and that the murder charges were a frame-up to excuse the police raid on Davis's sister's apartment. They further contended that Davis had been recruited into a drug ring by rogue police officers and that the object of the raid was to kill him. The prosecution contended that Davis was a crack dealer who specialized in the armed robbery of other crack dealers, and presented testimony from more than 50 witnesses, including ballistic evidence and fingerprints on a cash box that placed Davis at the scene of the October 1986 murders. The jury found conflicting testimony from witnesses, and discrepancies in times given by prosecution witnesses.

Before the [[Severn Bridge]] opened on 8 September 1966, it was a major route between England and [[South Wales]]. For most of its route, it runs almost parallel to the [[M4 motorway]]. During times of high winds at the Severn Bridge, the A48 is used as part of the diversion route and is still marked as a Holiday Route.\n\nFrom Gloucester, the A48 runs through the villages of [[Minsterworth]], [[Westbury-on-Severn]], connects to a link road to [[Cinderford]] in the [[Forest of Dean]] then through [[Newnham on Severn|Newnham]], [[Blakeney, Gloucestershire|Blakeney]] and since 1995, [[Bypass (road)|bypassing]] [[Lydney]] on the west bank of the [[River Severn]]. It crosses the [[England\u2013Wales border]] at [[Chepstow]] and continues westwards close to the South Wales coast passing [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Cardiff]], [[Cowbridge]], [[Bridgend]], [[Pyle]], [[Port Talbot]], [[Neath]] and [[Swansea]], before terminating at the junction with the A40 near the centre of Carmarthen.\n\nThere is a motorway section (the [[A48(M) motorway|A48(M)]]) which is a [[Spur route#United Kingdom|spur]] from the [[M4 motorway|M4]] running from junction 29 on the west side of Newport. The A48(M) has no junction options at either end; it leads to limited-access junctions. Near the east of [[Cardiff]], at [[St Mellons]], it ends by flowing onto the A48 (Eastern Avenue) and through Cardiff. It is {{convert|2|mi}} long and is a 2-lane motorway throughout its length. At St Mellons it runs continuously into a further {{convert|6|mi}} of the dual-carriageway A48, which also features  (albeit narrow) [[Hard shoulder#United Kingdom|hard shoulders]].<ref name=\"pm\">[http://pathetic.org.uk/current/a48m/ Pathetic Motorways - A48(M)]</ref> The original A48 continues to link Newport and Cardiff.\n\n==Highnam to Newport==\nThe A48 from Highnam to Newport runs adjacent to the [[River Severn]]. After running through a series of villages, it crosses the [[England\u2013Wales border]] at [[Chepstow]]. From the [[M4 Motorway]] at J15 near Swindon, traffic is directed for Wales if it is over the [[Severn Bridge]] weight limit of 44 tonnes. Traffic is directed onto the A419, then onto the [[A417 road|A417]] after Cirencester, and at Gloucester, onto the A40. This road has some speed cameras, as there have previously been incidents here, and have been erected to prevent them from happening again. During busy periods, such as the Severn Bore, this road may become busy with parked cars near the river's edge. Apart from morning and evening rush hours, the road is generally quite empty and free running, with no heavy traffic reports. The road also runs next to the [[Forest of Dean]]. The woods may be viewed from the roadside, as may the hills of the Dean. There is a [[level crossing]] in Lydney. Until Chepstow, there is a height limit under the low [[railway bridges]]. Tall vehicles are directed to Newport on the A40. For some parts of this route, short distance dual carriageways occur, especially on steep hills.\n\nAt Chepstow, the road links [[Gloucestershire]] with [[Monmouthshire]]. The road runs through Chepstow. There is access to the Forest of Dean in Chepstow. At the end of the road in Chepstow (at the roundabout), the Primary Route ends here, and it meets the A466, a road that provides access to the [[Wye Valley]] and to the [[M48 motorway]], originally the M4. Access to the M4 is available on this road. The A48 becomes a secondary route here, and continues bypassing [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]], [[Caerwent]] and [[Langstone, Newport|Langstone]].\n\nThe A48 then continues to M4 junction 24, where vehicles exceeding the height limit may rejoin the A48. The A449 provides access to [[Usk]] and the A40 near [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]]. When the Severn Bridge is closed in bad weather conditions, the traffic is directed onto the A449. After this roundabout, the road follows through to [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]. There are some minor routes that take you to Newport City Centre, but the main route is the A4042, leading directly to the centre and [[Caerleon]]. This is after the Newport International Sports Village [http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?contentid=devxp001422&fuseaction=leisure.centres], a sports village with facilities including a Swimming Pool, Tennis Courts, Football Stadium, Cricket Pitch, Velodrome and many more facilities. Passing through [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], there are views of the industrial town, with views of historic features such as the Transporter Bridge. The road then reaches the M4 again, at J28.\n\n==History of the road number==\n\nThe original (1923) route of the A48 was [[Worcester]] to Carmarthen via [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Ledbury]], [[Ross-on-Wye]], [[Monmouth]], Newport, Cardiff, Bridgend, Neath and [[Llanelli]]. In 1935 it was rerouted east of Newport, replacing the A437 between Newport and Gloucester.  The road from Worcester to Newport became part of the [[A449 road|A449]], apart from the section between Ross and Monmouth (which became part of the A40).\n\n==Road safety==\nIn June 2008, the {{convert|27|mi|adj=on}} Gloucester{{spaced ndash}}Chepstow stretch of the A48 was named as the most dangerous road in South West England. This single carriageway had 45 fatal and serious injury [[car accident|collisions]] between 2004 and 2006, and was rated as medium risk in the [[EuroRAP]] report published by the [[Road Safety Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting ahead|url=http://www.roadsafetyfoundation.org/media/14940/getting%20ahead.pdf|publisher=Road Safety Foundation|accessdate=21 September 2013|author=Dr Joanne Hill|page=13|date=July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922212650/http://www.roadsafetyfoundation.org/media/14940/getting%20ahead.pdf|archive-date=22 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{GB A road zone 4}}\n{{Motorways and Trunk Roads in Wales|state=collapsed}}\n{{Transport in Bridgend county borough}}\n{{Transport in Cardiff}}\n{{Transport in Carmarthenshire}}\n{{Transport in Gloucestershire}}\n{{Transport in Neath Port Talbot}}\n{{Transport in Newport}}\n{{Transport in Swansea}}\n\n{{coord|51.45989|N|3.37263|W|type:landmark_region:GB_dim:60000|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:4-0048}}\n[[Category:Roads in Bridgend County Borough]]\n[[Category:Roads in Cardiff]]\n[[Category:Roads in Carmarthenshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Monmouthshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Neath Port Talbot]]\n[[Category:Roads in Newport, Wales]]\n[[Category:Roads in Swansea]]\n[[Category:Roads in the Vale of Glamorgan]]\n[[Category:Constituent roads of European route E30]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2013}}\n{{about|the road in Great Britain|the road in France|A48 autoroute|the road in Spain|Autov\u00eda A-48}}\n{{infobox road\n|country=GBR\n| maint = [[English local authorities]] and South Wales Trunk Road Agency \n|type=A\n|route=48\n|map=[[File:A48 road map.png|200px]]|map_custom=yes\n|image=A48 Eastern Avenue, Cardiff.jpg\n|image_notes=The A48 (Eastern Avenue, in Cardiff near the [[University Hospital of Wales]])\n|length_mi=    \n|terminus_a=       [[Highnam]]\n|destinations=[[Chepstow]]<br> [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]<br> [[Cardiff]]<br> [[Bridgend]]<br> [[Port Talbot]]<br> [[Neath]]<br> [[Swansea]]\n|terminus_b=         [[Carmarthen]]         \n|history= \n|junction={{jct|country=GBR|A|40|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4151|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|466|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|449|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}} J24<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4042|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}} J28<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|467|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|AM|48|noshield1=|nolink1= }} J29A<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4232|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4161|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|469|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|470|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4119|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4161|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4232|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4050|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4226|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4222|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|473|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4106|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4229|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}} J38<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4107|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4241|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}} J41<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|474|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|465|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4230|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}} J44<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4217|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4067|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4138|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|4240|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}} J49<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|483|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|476|name1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|40|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br />\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|484|name1= }}\n|e-road= [[File:Tabliczka E30.svg|x20px|link=European route E30]]\n}}\n\nThe '''A48''' is a [[trunk road]] in [[Great Britain]] running from the [[A40 road|A40]] at [[Highnam]], {{convert|3|mi}} west of [[Gloucester]], [[England]], to the A40 at [[Carmarthen]], [[Wales]]. Before the [[Severn Bridge]] opened on 8 September 1966, it was a major route between England and [[South Wales]]. For most of its route, it runs almost parallel to the [[M4 motorway]]. During times of high winds at the Severn Bridge, the A48 is used as part of the diversion route and is still marked as a Holiday Route.\n\nFrom Gloucester, the A48 runs through the villages of [[Minsterworth]], [[Westbury-on-Severn]], connects to a link road to [[Cinderford]] in the [[Forest of Dean]] then through [[Newnham on Severn|Newnham]], [[Blakeney, Gloucestershire|Blakeney]] and since 1995, [[Bypass (road)|bypassing]] [[Lydney]] on the west bank of the [[River Severn]]. It crosses the [[England\u2013Wales border]] at [[Chepstow]] and continues westwards close to the South Wales coast passing [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Cardiff]], [[Cowbridge]], [[Bridgend]], [[Pyle]], [[Port Talbot]], [[Neath]] and [[Swansea]], before terminating at the junction with the A40 near the centre of Carmarthen.\n\nThere is a motorway section (the [[A48(M) motorway|A48(M)]]) which is a [[Spur route#United Kingdom|spur]] from the [[M4 motorway|M4]] running from junction 29 on the west side of Newport. The A48(M) has no junction options at either end; it leads to limited-access junctions. Near the east of [[Cardiff]], at [[St Mellons]], it ends by flowing onto the A48 (Eastern Avenue) and through Cardiff. It is {{convert|2|mi}} long and is a 2-lane motorway throughout its length. At St Mellons it runs continuously into a further {{convert|6|mi}} of the dual-carriageway A48, which also features  (albeit narrow) [[Hard shoulder#United Kingdom|hard shoulders]].<ref name=\"pm\">[http://pathetic.org.uk/current/a48m/ Pathetic Motorways - A48(M)]</ref> The original A48 continues to link Newport and Cardiff.\n\n==Highnam to Newport==\nThe A48 from Highnam to Newport runs adjacent to the [[River Severn]]. After running through a series of villages, it crosses the [[England\u2013Wales border]] at [[Chepstow]]. From the [[M4 Motorway]] at J15 near Swindon, traffic is directed for Wales if it is over the [[Severn Bridge]] weight limit of 44 tonnes. Traffic is directed onto the A419, then onto the [[A417 road|A417]] after Cirencester, and at Gloucester, onto the A40. This road has some speed cameras, as there have previously been incidents here, and have been erected to prevent them from happening again. During busy periods, such as the Severn Bore, this road may become busy with parked cars near the river's edge. Apart from morning and evening rush hours, the road is generally quite empty and free running, with no heavy traffic reports. The road also runs next to the [[Forest of Dean]]. The woods may be viewed from the roadside, as may the hills of the Dean. There is a [[level crossing]] in Lydney. Until Chepstow, there is a height limit under the low [[railway bridges]]. Tall vehicles are directed to Newport on the A40. For some parts of this route, short distance dual carriageways occur, especially on steep hills.\n\nAt Chepstow, the road links [[Gloucestershire]] with [[Monmouthshire]]. The road runs through Chepstow. There is access to the Forest of Dean in Chepstow. At the end of the road in Chepstow (at the roundabout), the Primary Route ends here, and it meets the A466, a road that provides access to the [[Wye Valley]] and to the [[M48 motorway]], originally the M4. Access to the M4 is available on this road. The A48 becomes a secondary route here, and continues bypassing [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]], [[Caerwent]] and [[Langstone, Newport|Langstone]].\n\nThe A48 then continues to M4 junction 24, where vehicles exceeding the height limit may rejoin the A48. The A449 provides access to [[Usk]] and the A40 near [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]]. When the Severn Bridge is closed in bad weather conditions, the traffic is directed onto the A449. After this roundabout, the road follows through to [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]. There are some minor routes that take you to Newport City Centre, but the main route is the A4042, leading directly to the centre and [[Caerleon]]. This is after the Newport International Sports Village [http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?contentid=devxp001422&fuseaction=leisure.centres], a sports village with facilities including a Swimming Pool, Tennis Courts, Football Stadium, Cricket Pitch, Velodrome and many more facilities. Passing through [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], there are views of the industrial town, with views of historic features such as the Transporter Bridge. The road then reaches the M4 again, at J28.\n\n==History of the road number==\n\nThe original (1923) route of the A48 was [[Worcester]] to Carmarthen via [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Ledbury]], [[Ross-on-Wye]], [[Monmouth]], Newport, Cardiff, Bridgend, Neath and [[Llanelli]]. In 1935 it was rerouted east of Newport, replacing the A437 between Newport and Gloucester.  The road from Worcester to Newport became part of the [[A449 road|A449]], apart from the section between Ross and Monmouth (which became part of the A40).\n\n==Road safety==\nIn June 2008, the {{convert|27|mi|adj=on}} Gloucester{{spaced ndash}}Chepstow stretch of the A48 was named as the most dangerous road in South West England. This single carriageway had 45 fatal and serious injury [[car accident|collisions]] between 2004 and 2006, and was rated as medium risk in the [[EuroRAP]] report published by the [[Road Safety Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting ahead|url=http://www.roadsafetyfoundation.org/media/14940/getting%20ahead.pdf|publisher=Road Safety Foundation|accessdate=21 September 2013|author=Dr Joanne Hill|page=13|date=July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922212650/http://www.roadsafetyfoundation.org/media/14940/getting%20ahead.pdf|archive-date=22 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{GB A road zone 4}}\n{{Motorways and Trunk Roads in Wales|state=collapsed}}\n{{Transport in Bridgend county borough}}\n{{Transport in Cardiff}}\n{{Transport in Carmarthenshire}}\n{{Transport in Gloucestershire}}\n{{Transport in Neath Port Talbot}}\n{{Transport in Newport}}\n{{Transport in Swansea}}\n\n{{coord|51.45989|N|3.37263|W|type:landmark_region:GB_dim:60000|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:4-0048}}\n[[Category:Roads in Bridgend County Borough]]\n[[Category:Roads in Cardiff]]\n[[Category:Roads in Carmarthenshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Monmouthshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Neath Port Talbot]]\n[[Category:Roads in Newport, Wales]]\n[[Category:Roads in Swansea]]\n[[Category:Roads in the Vale of Glamorgan]]\n[[Category:Constituent roads of European route E30]]\n", "name_user": "Seth Whales", "label": "safe", "comment": "South Wales Trunk Road Agent Wikilinked", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A48_road"}
