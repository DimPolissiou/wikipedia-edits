IL&nbsp;390 currently connects [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20, Lake Street) in [[Hanover Park, Illinois|Hanover Park]] to the intersection with [[Illinois Route 83]] (IL 83) and Thorndale Avenue in [[Wood Dale, Illinois|Wood Dale]].

The highway then enters [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] from [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] and intersects [[Illinois Route 19|IL&nbsp;19]] (Irving Park Road).

Around that time, congestion was rapidly increasing on local roads, especially US&nbsp;20 (Lake Street). Although Lake Street was extensively widened prior to the completion of the highway, initially to Glen Ellyn Road and then to the Roselle-Bloomingdale border nearly ten years later, its capacity was still insufficient for the rapidly growing western suburbs. Construction on the highway began around 1991 and was completed two years later. Governor [[Jim Edgar]] opened the highway at an afternoon ceremony on November 2, 1993.<ref name=\"ibata_1993\" />\n\nWhen the highway first opened, both of its termini had traffic signals with major arterial roads in the area. This arrangement caused large backups during weekday rush hours.

IL&nbsp;390 currently connects [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20, Lake Street) in [[Hanover Park, Illinois|Hanover Park]] to the intersection with [[Illinois Route 83]] (IL 83) and Thorndale Avenue in [[Wood Dale, Illinois|Wood Dale]]. The only other towns it borders are [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]] and [[Roselle, Illinois|Roselle]].

The highway then enters [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] from [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] and intersects [[Illinois Route 19|IL&nbsp;19]] (Irving Park Road). At Meacham Road, the highway crosses back south into DuPage County. Continuing east for {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}}, IL&nbsp;390 traverses portions of the suburbs of [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]], [[Roselle, Illinois|Roselle]], [[Medinah, Illinois|Medinah]], [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois|Elk Grove Village]], and then intersects with [[Illinois Route 53|IL&nbsp;53]] before a major interchange with [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|I-290]] in [[Itasca, Illinois|Itasca]]. IL&nbsp;390 continues east for {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} through [[Wood Dale, Illinois|Wood Dale]], Elk Grove Village (again), and [[Bensenville, Illinois|Bensenville]], and finally ends at an intersection with [[Illinois Route 83|IL 83]] in Bensenville just short of the west side of [[O'Hare International Airport]].

Around that time, congestion was rapidly increasing on local roads, especially US&nbsp;20 (Lake Street). Although Lake Street was extensively widened prior to the completion of the highway, initially to Glen Ellyn Road and then to the Roselle-Bloomingdale border nearly ten years later, its capacity was still insufficient for the rapidly growing western suburbs. Construction on the highway began around 1991 and was completed two years later. Governor [[Jim Edgar]] opened the highway at an afternoon ceremony on November 2, 1993.<ref name=\"ibata_1993\" />\n\nWhen the highway first opened, both of its termini had traffic signals with major arterial roads in the area. This arrangement caused large backups during weekday rush hours. According to the [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] (IDOT), average daily traffic counts (in 2003) for IL&nbsp;390 are 39,600&nbsp;vehicles for the western {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} and around 82,000 to 87,000&nbsp;cars per day for the remainder.<ref name=idot_traffic>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingaroundillinois.com/default.aspx?ql=aadt |title=Getting Around Illinois |year=2006 |author=Illinois Department of Transportation |publisher=Illinois Department of Transportation |access-date=March 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219183527/http://www.gettingaroundillinois.com/default.aspx?ql=aadt |archivedate=February 19, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn October 29, 2013, IDOT announced that the highway was re-designated IL&nbsp;390 at groundbreaking ceremonies for the Elgin\u2013O\u2019Hare Western Access Project.<ref name=390PR>{{cite press release |title= Governor Quinn and Local Leaders Break Ground on $3.4 Billion Elgin O\u2019Hare Western Access Project: New Illinois Route 390 is First Part of the State\u2019s Largest Roadway Project and Will Create Thousands of Jobs |url= http://www3.illinois.gov/PressReleases/PressReleasesListShow.cfm?RecNum=11659 |publisher= State of Illinois |date= October 29, 2013 |access-date= October 29, 2013}}</ref> Shortly after, maintenance of the road was transferred to the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] (ISTHA), and toll collection on the existing segment from US&nbsp;20 in [[Hanover Park, Illinois|Hanover Park]] to [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|I-290]] in [[Itasca, Illinois|Itasca]] began in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |author= Illinois State Toll Highway Authority |title= EOWA Project Update |url= https://www.illinoistollway.com/projects/eowa/illinois-route-390-project |publisher= Illinois State Toll Highway Authority |access-date= January 10, 2017}}</ref> ISTHA began constructing an eastward extension of IL&nbsp;390 to a new interchange on the western border of [[O'Hare International Airport]] with the planned [[Interstate 490 (Illinois)|I-490]] connecting [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|I-90]] to the north and [[Interstate 294|I-294]] to the south.<ref>{{cite news |last= Rice |first= Jennifer |title= Elgin\u2013O'Hare access approved for construction |work= The Fox Valley Labor News |date= January 17, 2013 |url= http://foxvalleylabornews.com/2013/02/01/elgin-ohare-access-approved-for-construction/ |access-date= January 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= Illinois State Toll Highway Authority |title= EOWA Corridor Overview |url= http://www.illinoistollway.com/construction-and-planning/projects-by-roadway/elgin-o-hare-western-access/eowa-corridor-overview |publisher= Illinois State Toll Highway Authority |access-date= September 20, 2015 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924033638/http://www.illinoistollway.com/construction-and-planning/projects-by-roadway/elgin-o-hare-western-access/eowa-corridor-overview |archivedate= September 24, 2015 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> This interchange may also incorporate ramps into a planned western terminal at O'Hare.
