The shows we've done before, we've never had this much success. We prepared for five. Then we got eight engagements, so we had to pick who we were going to follow.' We got our phones back.

Comparing it to ''[[The Bachelor (American TV series)|The Bachelor]]'', Crimmins called the series \"the bizarre reality TV experiment you've been craving\". She comments that you never know what the couples will do next, even down to the altar at the wedding, making the series \"harmless, entertaining, and satisfying.\"<ref name=\"mashable review\"/>\n\nLucy Mangan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave ''Love Is Blind'' a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, calling it toxic, revolting, but extremely addictive. She says that ''Love Is Blind'' is the final nail in the coffin of humanity; however, in terms of reality television, she states that it is good because it \"exploits emotional frailties, profaning the sacred, making the private and precious public and worthless and turning it into voyeuristic ratings-bait.\" Despite all of this, she recommends the show as a casual reality television binge, similar to ''[[The Bachelor (American TV series)|The Bachelor]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mangan |first1=Lucy |title=Love Is Blind review: toxic, revolting \u2013 and totally addictive |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/13/love-is-blind-review-toxic-revolting-and-totally-addictive |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |language=English |date=February 13, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nKristen Baldwin of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the series \"intensely tragic yet riveting.\" She criticized the series, saying that the first four episodes in the pods feel new and fresh, but once the engaged couples enter the real world, it feels like just another bad dating reality television show. Baldwin also called it depressing, citing the contestants always saying, \"If I don't get married now, I never will.\" Overall, Baldwin gave ''Love Is Blind'' a [[Grading systems by country#United

For ten days in a [[speed dating]] format, the men and women date each other in different \"pods\" where they can talk to each other, but not see each other. Whenever they decided, the men were able to propose to the woman they want to get married to. After the proposal, and meeting face-to-face for the first time, the engaged couples headed to a couples retreat in [[Playa del Carmen]], [[Mexico]]. During this trip they spent time getting to know their partners, and were able to meet the other couples participating in the experiment. \n\nFollowing the couples retreat, the engaged couples moved to the same apartment complex back in Atlanta. While at the apartments, they all met their partners' families and explored their partners' living conditions. At the altar on the day of the wedding, the engaged couples carried out wedding ceremonies and needed to make their final decisions at the altar about whether to split up or get married, answering the question \"Is love blind?\"\n\n==Season summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\" | Season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Original Run\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Couples\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" | Proposal\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" | Still together\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"34%\" | Relationship notes\n|-\n|  rowspan=\"6\"| 1\n| rowspan=\"6\"| February 13, 2020 - March 5, 2020\n| Lauren Speed & Cameron Hamilton\n| {{yes}}\n| {{yes}}\n| The two got married in November 2018, during the filming of the 1st season of Love is Blind.

The modern concept of telepathy emerged in this context.<ref name=\"Luckhurst2002\"/>\n\nPsychical researcher [[Eric Dingwall]] criticized SPR founding members [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic W. H. Myers]] and [[William F. Barrett]] for trying to \"prove\" telepathy rather than objectively analyze whether or not it existed.<ref>[[Eric Dingwall|Dingwall, Eric]]. (1985).

Prometheus Books. pp. 161-174. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}} \"Let me give an example, such as thought-transference, which is as good as any. When the British SPR was founded, the public was led to believe that at least a scientific survey was to be made, and I have no doubt that even some of those closely associated with the early days thought so too. But Myers, among others, had no such intention and cherished no such illusion. He knew that the primary aim of the Society was not objective experimentation but the establishment of telepathy. (...) What was wanted was proof that mind could communicate with mind apart from the normal avenues, for if mental sharing was a fact when the persons concerned were incarnate it could plausibly be suggested that the same mechanism might operate when death had occurred. Thus the supernatural might be proved by science, and psychical research might become, in the words of Sir William Barrett, a handmaid to religion.\"</ref>\n\n==Thought reading==\nIn the late 19th century, the magician and mentalist, [[Washington Irving Bishop]] would perform \"thought reading\" demonstrations. Bishop claimed no [[supernatural]] powers and ascribed his powers to [[Muscle reading|muscular sensitivity]] (reading thoughts from unconscious bodily cues).<ref>Roger Luckhurst. (2002). ''The Invention of Telepathy: 1870-1901''. Oxford University Press. p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0199249626}}</ref> Bishop was investigated by a group of scientists including the editor of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' and the psychologist [[Francis Galton]]. Bishop performed several feats successfully such as correctly identifying a selected spot on a table and locating a hidden object. During the experiment Bishop required physical contact with a subject who knew the correct answer.  He would hold the hand or wrist of the helper. The scientists concluded that Bishop was not a genuine telepath but using a highly trained skill to detect [[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideomotor movements]].<ref>[[Richard Wiseman]]. (2011). ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There''. Macmillan. p. 140-142. {{ISBN|978-0-230-75298-6}}</ref>\n\nAnother famous thought reader was the magician [[Stuart Cumberland]]. He was famous for performing [[blindfold]]ed feats such as identifying a hidden object in a room that a person had picked out or asking someone to imagine a murder scene and then attempt to read the subject's thoughts and identify the victim and reenact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the [[Society for Psychical Research]] who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man cannot be read through telepathy, but only by [[muscle reading]].\n<ref name=\"BownBeer2004\">{{cite book |editors=Nicola Bown, Carolyn Burdett, Pamela Thurschwell, Gillian Beer |title=The Victorian Supernatural |last=Thurschwell |first=Pamela |chapter=Chapter 4: George Eliot's Prophecies: Coercive Second Sight and Everyday Though Reading |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkQV_718ROkC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&focus=viewport&vq=%22Cumberland+himself+always+insisted+that+his+readings%22&dq=Nicola+Bown+The+Victorian+Supernatural+pp.+87#v=onepage&q=%22Cumberland%20himself%20always%20insisted%20that%20his%20readings%22&f=false |date=5 February 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-81015-9 |pages=87\u2013108}}</ref>\n\n==Case studies==\n[[File:Gilbert Murray.jpg|thumb|[[Gilbert Murray]] conducted early telepathy experiments.]]\n\nIn the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by the [[Society for Psychical Research]] and believed to have genuine psychic ability.

For those that occurred three times it was 38%, and for those targets that occurred six or more times, the hit rate was 52%. Each time a videotape is played its quality can degrade. It is plausible then, that when a frequently used clip is the target for a given session, it may be physically distinguishable from the other three decoy clips that are presented to the subject for judging.

The modern concept of telepathy emerged in this context.<ref name=\"Luckhurst2002\"/>\n\nPsychical researcher [[Eric Dingwall]] criticized SPR founding members [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic W. H. Myers]] and [[William F. Barrett]] for trying to \"prove\" telepathy rather than objectively analyze whether or not it existed.<ref>[[Eric Dingwall|Dingwall, Eric]]. (1985).

When the British SPR was founded, the public was led to believe that at least a scientific survey was to be made, and I have no doubt that even some of those closely associated with the early days thought so too. But Myers, among others, had no such intention and cherished no such illusion. He knew that the primary aim of the Society was not objective experimentation but the establishment of telepathy. (...) What was wanted was proof that mind could communicate with mind apart from the normal avenues, for if mental sharing was a fact when the persons concerned were incarnate it could plausibly be suggested that the same mechanism might operate when death had occurred. Thus the supernatural might be proved by science, and psychical research might become, in the words of Sir William Barrett, a handmaid to religion.\"</ref>\n\n==Thought reading==\nIn the late 19th century, the magician and mentalist, [[Washington Irving Bishop]] would perform \"thought reading\" demonstrations. Bishop claimed no [[supernatural]] powers and ascribed his powers to [[Muscle reading|muscular sensitivity]] (reading thoughts from unconscious bodily cues).<ref>Roger Luckhurst. (2002). ''The Invention of Telepathy: 1870-1901''. Oxford University Press. p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0199249626}}</ref> Bishop was investigated by a group of scientists including the editor of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' and the psychologist [[Francis Galton]]. Bishop performed several feats successfully such as correctly identifying a selected spot on a table and locating a hidden object. During the experiment Bishop required physical contact with a subject who knew the correct answer.  He would hold the hand or wrist of the helper. The scientists concluded that Bishop was not a genuine telepath but using a highly trained skill to detect [[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideomotor movements]].<ref>[[Richard Wiseman]]. (2011). ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There''. Macmillan. p. 140-142. {{ISBN|978-0-230-75298-6}}</ref>\n\nAnother famous thought reader was the magician [[Stuart Cumberland]]. He was famous for performing [[blindfold]]ed feats such as identifying a hidden object in a room that a person had picked out or asking someone to imagine a murder scene and then attempt to read the subject's thoughts and identify the victim and reenact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the [[Society for Psychical Research]] who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man cannot be read through telepathy, but only by [[muscle reading]].\n<ref name=\"BownBeer2004\">{{cite book |editors=Nicola Bown, Carolyn Burdett, Pamela Thurschwell, Gillian Beer |title=The Victorian Supernatural |last=Thurschwell |first=Pamela |chapter=Chapter 4: George Eliot's Prophecies: Coercive Second Sight and Everyday Though Reading |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkQV_718ROkC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&focus=viewport&vq=%22Cumberland+himself+always+insisted+that+his+readings%22&dq=Nicola+Bown+The+Victorian+Supernatural+pp.+87#v=onepage&q=%22Cumberland%20himself%20always%20insisted%20that%20his%20readings%22&f=false |date=5 February 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-81015-9 |pages=87\u2013108}}</ref>\n\n==Case studies==\n[[File:Gilbert Murray.jpg|thumb|[[Gilbert Murray]] conducted early telepathy experiments.]]\n\nIn the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by the [[Society for Psychical Research]] and believed to have genuine psychic ability.

(2015). ''Great Myths of Child Development''. Wiley. pp. 10-16. {{ISBN|978-1-118-52122-9}}</ref> According to Hupp and Jewell there are various behavioral and genetic factors that contribute to the twin telepathy myth \"identical twins typically spend a lot of time together and are usually exposed to very similar environments. Thus, it's not at all surprising that they act in similar ways and are adept at anticipating and forecasting each other's reactions to events.\"<ref name=\"Hupp 2015\"/>\n\nA 1993 study by [[Susan Blackmore]] investigated the claims of twin telepathy. In an experiment with six sets of twins one subject would act as the sender and the other the receiver. The sender was given selected objects, photographs or numbers and would attempt to psychically send the information to the receiver. The results from the experiment were negative, no evidence of telepathy was observed.<ref>[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]. (2011). ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There''.

The idea that two people who shared their mother's womb \u2014 or even who share the same DNA \u2014 have a mysterious mental connection is an intriguing one not borne out in science.\"<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/45405-twin-telepathy.html \"The Riddle of Twin Telepathy\"].

Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out of their minds or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by [[antipsychotic]] medication.

Most Apple devices (such as iPhones, iPads and Macs) introduced after 2011 support FaceTime. FaceTime is currently incompatible with non-Apple devices or any other video calling services. Mac models introduced in 2011 have high-definition video FaceTime, which devices use automatically when both ends have a FaceTime HD camera.\n\nUnlike Mac OS X's [[iChat]], FaceTime currently does not support group conferencing but support has been announced for iOS 12. The application is a one-on-one video chat\u2014only two people can talk at once. If a second user calls and the user answers, the video chat with the previous user ends and a new video session begins with the second caller. In iPhone, if a phone call is pending and the user attempts to answer, the video call ends and the phone call begins with the next user.\n\nIncoming notifications on iOS devices are shown during a FaceTime call, but if they are opened, the video will be temporarily paused until the user is back in the FaceTime app. \n[[File:Paused FaceTime.png|thumbnail|left|Paused FaceTime Screen|219x219px]]\n\nOn the iPhone, a user can activate FaceTime during a phone call by pressing the FaceTime button or initiated FaceTime from their call history or the Contacts application. iOS 7 and newer also provide a separate FaceTime app, as there always has been on Apple's non-telephony devices: iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac.\n\nUntil the release of iOS 6, FaceTime required a WiFi connection to work. From iOS 6 onwards, FaceTime for the iPhone and iPad has supported FaceTime calls over cellular networks ([[3G]] or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) provided the carrier enabled it, which by mid-2013 virtually all carriers worldwide have allowed. FaceTime Audio uses about three [[megabyte]]s of data for every five minutes of conversation, with FaceTime Video using significantly more.<ref name=\"IW data usage 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/974213|title=How much data does FaceTime audio calling use?|publisher=iPhoneFAQ|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> Cellular talk time/minutes are not used after switching from a voice call to a FaceTime call.\n\nFaceTime calls can be placed from supported devices to any phone number or email address that is registered to the FaceTime service.

Apple claims that it intended to provide the application free of charge, however, a provision of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] (2002) bars companies from providing an unadvertised new feature of an already-sold product without enduring \"onerous accounting measures\".<ref name=\"Macgasm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.macgasm.net/2011/02/24/apple-charge-facetime|title=Apple charges for FaceTime|last=Macgasm|date=|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> {{As of|2017|12}}, the US$0.99 beta is still available for download from Apple.<ref name=\"softpedia FT beta\">{{cite web|url=http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Internet-Utilities/FaceTime.shtml|title=Mac|date=|publisher=Softpedia|at=link within last sentence \"The page provides access to FaceTime 0.9 Build 92 version\"|accessdate=}}</ref> FaceTime is included for free in macOS from {{nowrap|[[Mac OS X Lion]]}} (10.7) onwards and iOS.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[AT&T]] allowed customers to use FaceTime as long as they were [[tiered internet|tiered]], but blocked the application from working for customers with unlimited data plans.

Most Apple devices (such as iPhones, iPads and Macs) introduced after 2011 support FaceTime. FaceTime is currently incompatible with non-Apple devices or any other video calling services. Mac models introduced in 2011 have high-definition video FaceTime, which devices use automatically when both ends have a FaceTime HD camera.\n\nUnlike Mac OS X's [[iChat]], FaceTime currently does not support group conferencing but support has been announced for iOS 12. The application is a one-on-one video chat\u2014only two people can talk at once. If a second user calls and the user answers, the video chat with the previous user ends and a new video session begins with the second caller. In iPhone, if a phone call is pending and the user attempts to answer, the video call ends and the phone call begins with the next user.\n\nIncoming notifications on iOS devices are shown during a FaceTime call, but if they are opened, the video will be temporarily paused until the user is back in the FaceTime app. \n[[File:Paused FaceTime.png|thumbnail|left|Paused FaceTime Screen|219x219px]]\n\nOn the iPhone, a user can activate FaceTime during a phone call by pressing the FaceTime button or initiated FaceTime from their call history or the Contacts application. iOS 7 and newer also provide a separate FaceTime app, as there always has been on Apple's non-telephony devices: iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac.\n\nUntil the release of iOS 6, FaceTime required a WiFi connection to work. From iOS 6 onwards, FaceTime for the iPhone and iPad has supported FaceTime calls over cellular networks ([[3G]] or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) provided the carrier enabled it, which by mid-2013 virtually all carriers worldwide have allowed. FaceTime Audio uses about three [[megabyte]]s of data for every five minutes of conversation, with FaceTime Video using significantly more.<ref name=\"IW data usage 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/974213|title=How much data does FaceTime audio calling use?|publisher=iPhoneFAQ|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> Cellular talk time/minutes are not used after switching from a voice call to a FaceTime call.\n\nFaceTime calls can be placed from supported devices to any phone number or email address that is registered to the FaceTime service.
