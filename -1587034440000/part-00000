''[[Engagement Ring (Roy Lichtenstein)|Engagement Ring]]'' sold for $1200 and ''[[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]'' sold for $1000. Prices for his work rose quickly. In 1965, German collector Peter Ludwig asked Castelli, what price Lichtenstein might accept to sell ''M-Maybe'' from his personal collection.

As is a common theme among these works, she awaits a man in a vague but urban setting. The [[thought bubble]] reads \"M\u2013Maybe he became ill and couldn\u2019t leave the studio\".

''[[Engagement Ring (Roy Lichtenstein)|Engagement Ring]]'' sold for $1200 and ''[[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]'' sold for $1000. Prices for his work rose quickly. In 1965, German collector Peter Ludwig asked Castelli, what price Lichtenstein might accept to sell ''M-Maybe'' from his personal collection. By then, the going rate for a Lichtenstein was $6000 and Castelli estimated $12,000. Ludwig offered Lichtenstein $30,000 to purchase the work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Mural With Blue Brushstroke|author=Tomkins, Calvin|ISBN=0-8109-2356-4|page=25|publisher=[[Harry N.

Boeing and Airbus seek to exploit this by subcontracting production of aircraft components or assemblies to manufacturers in countries of strategic importance in order to gain a competitive advantage overall.\n\nFor example, Boeing has maintained longstanding relationships since 1974 with Japanese suppliers including [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] by which these companies have had increasing involvement on successive Boeing jet programs, a process which has helped Boeing achieve almost total dominance of the Japanese market for commercial jets. Outsourcing was extended on the 787 to the extent that Boeing's own involvement was reduced to little more than project management, design, assembly and test operation, outsourcing most of the actual manufacturing all around the world. Boeing has since stated that it \"outsourced too much\" and that future airplane projects will depend far more on its own engineering and production personnel.<ref>{{cite news | title = Albaugh: Boeing's 'first preference' is to build planes in Puget Sound region | publisher = The Seattle Times| date = March 1, 2010 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2011228282_albaugh02.html | accessdate = 2010-06-16 | first=Dominic | last=Gates}}</ref>\n\nPartly because of its origins as a consortium of European companies, Airbus has had fewer opportunities to outsource significant parts of its production beyond its own European plants. However, in 2009 Airbus opened an assembly plant in [[Tianjin]], [[China]] for production of its A320 series airliners.<ref>{{cite news | title = Airbus' China gamble | publisher = [[Flight International]] | date = October 28, 2008 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/10/28/317890/airbus-china-gamble.html | accessdate = 2008-11-15 }}</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nAirbus sought to compete with the well-established Boeing in the 1970s through its introduction of advanced technology. For example, the [[Airbus A300|A300]] made the most extensive use of [[composite material]]s yet seen in an aircraft of that era, and by automating the [[flight engineer|flight engineer's]] functions, was the first [[widebody]] jet to have a two-person flight crew. In the 1980s Airbus was the first to introduce digital [[fly-by-wire]] controls into an airliner (the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]]).\n\nWith Airbus now an established competitor to Boeing, both companies use advanced technology to seek performance advantages in their products. Many of these improvements are about weight reduction and fuel efficiency. For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the first large airliner to use 50% composites for its construction. The [[Airbus A350 XWB]] features 53% composites.<ref>{{cite web|title=Qatar Airways A350 XWB factsheet|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/presskits/?eID=maglisting_push&tx_maglisting_pi1%5BdocID%5D=42440|website=Airbus.com|accessdate=28 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905115116/http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/presskits/?eID=maglisting_push&tx_maglisting_pi1%5BdocID%5D=42440|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Engine choices===\nThe competitive strength in the market of any airliner is considerably influenced by the choice of engine available. In general, airlines prefer to have a choice of at least two engines from the major manufacturers [[GE Aviation|General Electric]], [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]]. However, engine manufacturers prefer to be single source, and often succeed in striking commercial deals with Boeing and Airbus to achieve this.\n\nIn 2008, the competition was developing between two sides as Airbus selected the [[Rolls-Royce Trent XWB]] alone for the [[Airbus A350]], while GE avoided a $1&nbsp;billion development competing with its [[Boeing 777#Second generation models|Boeing 777HGW]] exclusive [[GE90]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Engines the thrust of the Boeing-Airbus battle |publisher= [[The Australian]] |date= April 4, 2008 |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23479281-23349,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080101/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23479281-23349,00.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= January 1, 2008 |first= Geoffrey |last= Thomas}}</ref>\nIn 2013, Boeing rejected a Rolls-Royce engine for the [[777X]] to favor General Electric's [[GE9X]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/ge-rolls-out-boeing-seeks-777x-approval |title= GE In, Rolls Out As Boeing Seeks 777X Approval |date=Mar 18, 2013 |author= Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\nIn 2014, Rolls-Royce secured its exclusivity to power the [[A330neo]] with the [[Trent 7000]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-rolls-and-airbus-how-the-latecomer-excelled-401791/ |title= Rolls and Airbus \u2013 how the latecomer excelled |work= Flightglobal |date= 21 Jul 2014 |author= Max Kingsley Jones}}</ref>\n\nOther aircraft providing a single engine offering include the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] ([[CFM LEAP]]) or the [[Airbus A220]] ([[Pratt & Whitney PW1000G|P&W GTF]]); while those with multiple sources include the [[Boeing 787]] ([[GEnx]]/[[Trent 1000]]) or the [[Airbus A320neo]] (P&W GTF/CFM LEAP).\n\n===Currency and exchange rates===\nBoeing's production costs are mostly in [[United States dollar]]s, whereas Airbus's production costs are mostly in [[euro]]. When the dollar appreciates against the euro the cost of producing a Boeing aircraft rises relatively to the cost of producing an Airbus aircraft, and conversely when the dollar falls relative to the euro it is an advantage for Boeing. There are also possible currency risks and benefits involved in the way aircraft are sold. Boeing typically prices its aircraft only in dollars, while Airbus, although pricing most aircraft sales in dollars, has been known to be more flexible and has priced some aircraft sales in Asia and the Middle East in multiple currencies. Depending on currency fluctuations between the acceptance of the order and the delivery of the aircraft this can result in an extra profit or extra expense\u2014or, if Airbus has purchased insurance against such fluctuations, an additional cost regardless.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704317704574503291415066898|title=Strong Euro Weighs on Airbus, Suppliers|journal= [[Wall Street Journal]]|date= October 30, 2009|page=B3}}</ref>\n\n===Safety and quality===\nBoth aircraft manufacturers have good safety records on recently manufactured aircraft and generally, both firms have a positive reputation of delivering well-engineered and high-quality products.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Muellerleile |first1= Christopher M |title= Financialization takes off at Boeing |journal= Journal of Economic Geography |volume= 9 |issue= 5 |pages= 663\u2013677 |date= 2009 |doi= 10.1093/jeg/lbp025 |quote= Boeing\u2019s engineers [...] tended to be first and foremost concerned with safety and quality.

By 2010, little difference remained between Airbus and Boeing in both the wide-body or narrow-body categories or the range on offer.\n\n<!-- Do not alter figures without updating dates -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ Orders\n\n|- style=\"color:white; font-weight:bold; background:#007000;\"\n| style=\"border-top: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n|2020\n|2019\n|2018\n|2017\n|2016\n|2015\n|2014\n|2013\n|2012\n|2011\n|2010\n|2009\n|2008\n|2007\n|2006\n|2005\n|2004\n|2003\n|2002\n|2001\n|2000\n|1999\n|1998\n|1997\n|1996\n|1995\n|1994\n|1993\n|1992\n|1991\n|1990\n|1989\n|-\n||Airbus\n|290\n|{{green|'''768'''}}\n|747\n|{{green|'''1109'''}}\n|{{green|'''731'''}}\n|{{green|'''1080'''}}\n|{{green|'''1456'''}}\n|{{green|'''1503'''}}\n|833\n|{{green|'''1419'''}}\n|{{green|'''574'''}}\n|{{green|'''281'''}}\n|{{green|'''777'''}}\n|1341\n|790\n|{{green|'''1055'''}}\n|{{green|'''370'''}}\n|{{green|'''284'''}}\n|{{green|'''300'''}}\n|{{green|'''375'''}}\n|520\n|{{green|'''476'''}}\n|556\n|460\n|326\n|106\n|{{green|'''125'''}}\n|138\n|136\n|101\n|404\n|421\n|-\n||Boeing\n| \u2212307\n| \u221287\n|{{green|'''893'''}}\n|912 <!--Note: as of December 31, Boeing has included 21 P-8 maritime patrol, 15 KC-46 military tanker, two C-40 military cargo and two B747 PAR (US Presidential Aircraft Replacement) in its 2017 civilian net total, subtract from published figure accordingly--> \n|668\n|768\n|1432\n|1355\n|{{green|'''1203'''}}\n|805\n|530\n|142\n|662\n|{{green|'''1413'''}}\n|{{green|'''1044'''}}\n|1002\n|272\n|239\n|251\n|314\n|{{green|'''588'''}}\n|355\n|{{green|'''606'''}}\n|{{green|'''532'''}}\n|{{green|'''664'''}}\n|{{green|'''379'''}}\n|112\n|{{green|'''220'''}}\n|{{green|'''230'''}}\n|{{green|'''240'''}}\n|{{green|'''456'''}}\n|{{green|'''563'''}}\n|- style=\"line-height: 1em; border-bottom: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; border-right: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n| colspan=\"33\" style=\"line-height: 1em; font-size:90%; text-align:left; background:#F2F2F2\" |Sources:<br>[https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/market/orders-deliveries.html Airbus Orders & Deliveries to 31 March, 2020]<br>[http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=displaystandardreport.cfm&optReportType=CurYrDelv Boeing orders to 31 March, 2020]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ Deliveries\n|- style=\"color:white; font-weight:bold; background:#069;\"\n| style=\"border-top: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n|2020\n|2019\n|2018\n|2017\n|2016\n|2015\n|2014\n|2013\n|2012\n|2011\n|2010\n|2009\n|2008\n|2007\n|2006\n|2005\n|2004\n|2003\n|2002\n|2001\n|2000\n|1999\n|1998\n|1997\n|1996\n|1995\n|1994\n|1993\n|1992\n|1991\n|1990\n|1989\n|-\n||Airbus\n|122\n|{{green|'''863'''}}\n|800\n|718\n|688\n|635\n|629\n|626\n|588\n|{{green|'''534'''}}\n|{{green|'''510'''}}\n|{{green|'''498'''}}\n|{{green|'''483'''}}\n|{{green|'''453'''}}\n|{{green|'''434'''}}\n|{{green|'''378'''}}\n|{{green|'''320'''}}\n|{{green|'''305'''}}\n|303\n|325\n|311\n|294\n|229\n|182\n|126\n|124\n|123\n|138\n|157\n|163\n|95\n|105\n|-\n||Boeing\n|50\n|380\n|{{green|'''806'''}}\n|{{green|'''763'''}} <!--Note: as of December 31, Boeing has included deliveries of 17 C-40/P-8 military aircraft and two B747 PAR (US Presidential Aircraft Replacement) in its 2017 civilian total deliveries, subtract from published figure accordingly--> \n|{{green|'''748'''}}\n|{{green|'''762'''}}\n|{{green|'''723'''}}\n|{{green|'''648'''}}\n|{{green|'''601'''}}\n|477\n|462\n|481\n|375\n|441\n|398\n|290\n|285\n|281\n|{{green|'''381'''}}\n|{{green|'''527'''}}\n|{{green|'''491'''}}\n|{{green|'''620'''}}\n|{{green|'''563'''}}\n|{{green|'''346'''}}\n|{{green|'''219'''}}\n|{{green|'''207'''}}\n|{{green|'''272'''}}\n|{{green|'''330'''}}\n|{{green|'''446'''}}\n|{{green|'''435'''}}\n|{{green|'''385'''}}\n|{{green|'''491'''}}\n|- style=\"line-height: 1em; border-bottom: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; border-right: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n| colspan=\"33\" style=\"line-height: 1em; font-size:90%; text-align:left; background:#F2F2F2\" |Sources:<br>[https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/market/orders-deliveries.html Airbus Orders & Deliveries to 31 March, 2020]<br>[http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=displaystandardreport.cfm&optReportType=CurYrDelv Boeing deliveries to 31 March, 2020]\nThe former [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[MD-80]], the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-90|MD-90]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]] are included in Boeing deliveries since MD's August 1997 merger with Boeing.\n|}\n\n{{Orders for and deliveries of Airbus and Boeing aircraft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Deliveries by decade and fuselage type (through Dec 31, 2019)\n|-\n| style=\"border-top: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n![[Narrow-body]]!![[Wide-body]]!!

The agreement allows up to 33 percent of the program cost to be met through government loans which are to be fully repaid within 17 years with interest and royalties. These loans are held at a minimum interest rate equal to the cost of government borrowing plus 0.25%, which would be below market rates available to Airbus without government support.<ref name=\"BBCAirbusBoeingQA\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3722888.stm|accessdate=22 October 2014|title=Q&A: Boeing and Airbus | work=BBC News | date=7 October 2004}}</ref> Airbus claims that since the signing of the EU-U.S. agreement in 1992, it has repaid European governments more than U.S.$6.7&nbsp;billion and that this is 40% more than it has received.\n\nAirbus argues that [[pork barrel]] military contracts awarded to Boeing (the second largest U.S. defence contractor) are in effect a form of subsidy (see the [[KC-X|KC-X program]]).

Boeing and Airbus seek to exploit this by subcontracting production of aircraft components or assemblies to manufacturers in countries of strategic importance in order to gain a competitive advantage overall.\n\nFor example, Boeing has maintained longstanding relationships since 1974 with Japanese suppliers including [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] by which these companies have had increasing involvement on successive Boeing jet programs, a process which has helped Boeing achieve almost total dominance of the Japanese market for commercial jets. Outsourcing was extended on the 787 to the extent that Boeing's own involvement was reduced to little more than project management, design, assembly and test operation, outsourcing most of the actual manufacturing all around the world. Boeing has since stated that it \"outsourced too much\" and that future airplane projects will depend far more on its own engineering and production personnel.<ref>{{cite news | title = Albaugh: Boeing's 'first preference' is to build planes in Puget Sound region | publisher = The Seattle Times| date = March 1, 2010 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2011228282_albaugh02.html | accessdate = 2010-06-16 | first=Dominic | last=Gates}}</ref>\n\nPartly because of its origins as a consortium of European companies, Airbus has had fewer opportunities to outsource significant parts of its production beyond its own European plants. However, in 2009 Airbus opened an assembly plant in [[Tianjin]], [[China]] for production of its A320 series airliners.<ref>{{cite news | title = Airbus' China gamble | publisher = [[Flight International]] | date = October 28, 2008 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/10/28/317890/airbus-china-gamble.html | accessdate = 2008-11-15 }}</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nAirbus sought to compete with the well-established Boeing in the 1970s through its introduction of advanced technology. For example, the [[Airbus A300|A300]] made the most extensive use of [[composite material]]s yet seen in an aircraft of that era, and by automating the [[flight engineer|flight engineer's]] functions, was the first [[widebody]] jet to have a two-person flight crew. In the 1980s Airbus was the first to introduce digital [[fly-by-wire]] controls into an airliner (the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]]).\n\nWith Airbus now an established competitor to Boeing, both companies use advanced technology to seek performance advantages in their products. Many of these improvements are about weight reduction and fuel efficiency. For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the first large airliner to use 50% composites for its construction. The [[Airbus A350 XWB]] features 53% composites.<ref>{{cite web|title=Qatar Airways A350 XWB factsheet|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/presskits/?eID=maglisting_push&tx_maglisting_pi1%5BdocID%5D=42440|website=Airbus.com|accessdate=28 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905115116/http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/presskits/?eID=maglisting_push&tx_maglisting_pi1%5BdocID%5D=42440|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Engine choices===\nThe competitive strength in the market of any airliner is considerably influenced by the choice of engine available. In general, airlines prefer to have a choice of at least two engines from the major manufacturers [[GE Aviation|General Electric]], [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]]. However, engine manufacturers prefer to be single source, and often succeed in striking commercial deals with Boeing and Airbus to achieve this.\n\nIn 2008, the competition was developing between two sides as Airbus selected the [[Rolls-Royce Trent XWB]] alone for the [[Airbus A350]], while GE avoided a $1&nbsp;billion development competing with its [[Boeing 777#Second generation models|Boeing 777HGW]] exclusive [[GE90]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Engines the thrust of the Boeing-Airbus battle |publisher= [[The Australian]] |date= April 4, 2008 |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23479281-23349,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080101/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23479281-23349,00.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= January 1, 2008 |first= Geoffrey |last= Thomas}}</ref>\nIn 2013, Boeing rejected a Rolls-Royce engine for the [[777X]] to favor General Electric's [[GE9X]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/ge-rolls-out-boeing-seeks-777x-approval |title= GE In, Rolls Out As Boeing Seeks 777X Approval |date=Mar 18, 2013 |author= Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\nIn 2014, Rolls-Royce secured its exclusivity to power the [[A330neo]] with the [[Trent 7000]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-rolls-and-airbus-how-the-latecomer-excelled-401791/ |title= Rolls and Airbus \u2013 how the latecomer excelled |work= Flightglobal |date= 21 Jul 2014 |author= Max Kingsley Jones}}</ref>\n\nOther aircraft providing a single engine offering include the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] ([[CFM LEAP]]) or the [[Airbus A220]] ([[Pratt & Whitney PW1000G|P&W GTF]]); while those with multiple sources include the [[Boeing 787]] ([[GEnx]]/[[Trent 1000]]) or the [[Airbus A320neo]] (P&W GTF/CFM LEAP).\n\n===Currency and exchange rates===\nBoeing's production costs are mostly in [[United States dollar]]s, whereas Airbus's production costs are mostly in [[euro]]. When the dollar appreciates against the euro the cost of producing a Boeing aircraft rises relatively to the cost of producing an Airbus aircraft, and conversely when the dollar falls relative to the euro it is an advantage for Boeing. There are also possible currency risks and benefits involved in the way aircraft are sold. Boeing typically prices its aircraft only in dollars, while Airbus, although pricing most aircraft sales in dollars, has been known to be more flexible and has priced some aircraft sales in Asia and the Middle East in multiple currencies. Depending on currency fluctuations between the acceptance of the order and the delivery of the aircraft this can result in an extra profit or extra expense\u2014or, if Airbus has purchased insurance against such fluctuations, an additional cost regardless.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704317704574503291415066898|title=Strong Euro Weighs on Airbus, Suppliers|journal= [[Wall Street Journal]]|date= October 30, 2009|page=B3}}</ref>\n\n===Safety and quality===\nBoth aircraft manufacturers have good safety records on recently manufactured aircraft and generally, both firms have a positive reputation of delivering well-engineered and high-quality products.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Muellerleile |first1= Christopher M |title= Financialization takes off at Boeing |journal= Journal of Economic Geography |volume= 9 |issue= 5 |pages= 663\u2013677 |date= 2009 |doi= 10.1093/jeg/lbp025 |quote= Boeing\u2019s engineers [...] tended to be first and foremost concerned with safety and quality.

By 2010, little difference remained between Airbus and Boeing in both the wide-body or narrow-body categories or the range on offer.\n\n<!-- Do not alter figures without updating dates -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ Orders\n\n|- style=\"color:white; font-weight:bold; background:#007000;\"\n| style=\"border-top: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n|2020\n|2019\n|2018\n|2017\n|2016\n|2015\n|2014\n|2013\n|2012\n|2011\n|2010\n|2009\n|2008\n|2007\n|2006\n|2005\n|2004\n|2003\n|2002\n|2001\n|2000\n|1999\n|1998\n|1997\n|1996\n|1995\n|1994\n|1993\n|1992\n|1991\n|1990\n|1989\n|-\n||Airbus\n|290\n|{{green|'''768'''}}\n|747\n|{{green|'''1109'''}}\n|{{green|'''731'''}}\n|{{green|'''1080'''}}\n|{{green|'''1456'''}}\n|{{green|'''1503'''}}\n|833\n|{{green|'''1419'''}}\n|{{green|'''574'''}}\n|{{green|'''281'''}}\n|{{green|'''777'''}}\n|1341\n|790\n|{{green|'''1055'''}}\n|{{green|'''370'''}}\n|{{green|'''284'''}}\n|{{green|'''300'''}}\n|{{green|'''375'''}}\n|520\n|{{green|'''476'''}}\n|556\n|460\n|326\n|106\n|{{green|'''125'''}}\n|138\n|136\n|101\n|404\n|421\n|-\n||Boeing\n| \u2212307\n| \u221287\n|{{green|'''893'''}}\n|912 <!--Note: as of December 31, Boeing has included 21 P-8 maritime patrol, 15 KC-46 military tanker, two C-40 military cargo and two B747 PAR (US Presidential Aircraft Replacement) in its 2017 civilian net total, subtract from published figure accordingly--> \n|668\n|768\n|1432\n|1355\n|{{green|'''1203'''}}\n|805\n|530\n|142\n|662\n|{{green|'''1413'''}}\n|{{green|'''1044'''}}\n|1002\n|272\n|239\n|251\n|314\n|{{green|'''588'''}}\n|355\n|{{green|'''606'''}}\n|{{green|'''532'''}}\n|{{green|'''664'''}}\n|{{green|'''379'''}}\n|112\n|{{green|'''220'''}}\n|{{green|'''230'''}}\n|{{green|'''240'''}}\n|{{green|'''456'''}}\n|{{green|'''563'''}}\n|- style=\"line-height: 1em; border-bottom: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; border-right: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n| colspan=\"33\" style=\"line-height: 1em; font-size:90%; text-align:left; background:#F2F2F2\" |Sources:<br>[https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/market/orders-deliveries.html Airbus Orders & Deliveries to 31 March, 2020]<br>[http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=displaystandardreport.cfm&optReportType=CurYrDelv Boeing orders to 31 March, 2020]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ Deliveries\n|- style=\"color:white; font-weight:bold; background:#069;\"\n| style=\"border-top: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n|2020\n|2019\n|2018\n|2017\n|2016\n|2015\n|2014\n|2013\n|2012\n|2011\n|2010\n|2009\n|2008\n|2007\n|2006\n|2005\n|2004\n|2003\n|2002\n|2001\n|2000\n|1999\n|1998\n|1997\n|1996\n|1995\n|1994\n|1993\n|1992\n|1991\n|1990\n|1989\n|-\n||Airbus\n|122\n|{{green|'''863'''}}\n|800\n|718\n|688\n|635\n|629\n|626\n|588\n|{{green|'''534'''}}\n|{{green|'''510'''}}\n|{{green|'''498'''}}\n|{{green|'''483'''}}\n|{{green|'''453'''}}\n|{{green|'''434'''}}\n|{{green|'''378'''}}\n|{{green|'''320'''}}\n|{{green|'''305'''}}\n|303\n|325\n|311\n|294\n|229\n|182\n|126\n|124\n|123\n|138\n|157\n|163\n|95\n|105\n|-\n||Boeing\n|50\n|380\n|{{green|'''806'''}}\n|{{green|'''763'''}} <!--Note: as of December 31, Boeing has included deliveries of 17 C-40/P-8 military aircraft and two B747 PAR (US Presidential Aircraft Replacement) in its 2017 civilian total deliveries, subtract from published figure accordingly--> \n|{{green|'''748'''}}\n|{{green|'''762'''}}\n|{{green|'''723'''}}\n|{{green|'''648'''}}\n|{{green|'''601'''}}\n|477\n|462\n|481\n|375\n|441\n|398\n|290\n|285\n|281\n|{{green|'''381'''}}\n|{{green|'''527'''}}\n|{{green|'''491'''}}\n|{{green|'''620'''}}\n|{{green|'''563'''}}\n|{{green|'''346'''}}\n|{{green|'''219'''}}\n|{{green|'''207'''}}\n|{{green|'''272'''}}\n|{{green|'''330'''}}\n|{{green|'''446'''}}\n|{{green|'''435'''}}\n|{{green|'''385'''}}\n|{{green|'''491'''}}\n|- style=\"line-height: 1em; border-bottom: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; border-right: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n| colspan=\"33\" style=\"line-height: 1em; font-size:90%; text-align:left; background:#F2F2F2\" |Sources:<br>[https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/market/orders-deliveries.html Airbus Orders & Deliveries to 31 March, 2020]<br>[http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=displaystandardreport.cfm&optReportType=CurYrDelv Boeing deliveries to 31 March, 2020]\nThe former [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[MD-80]], the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-90|MD-90]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]] are included in Boeing deliveries since MD's August 1997 merger with Boeing.\n|}\n\n{{Orders for and deliveries of Airbus and Boeing aircraft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Deliveries by decade and fuselage type (through Dec 31, 2019)\n|-\n| style=\"border-top: 2px solid white; border-left: 2px solid white; background:white\" |\n![[Narrow-body]]!![[Wide-body]]!!

The agreement allows up to 33 percent of the program cost to be met through government loans which are to be fully repaid within 17 years with interest and royalties. These loans are held at a minimum interest rate equal to the cost of government borrowing plus 0.25%, which would be below market rates available to Airbus without government support.<ref name=\"BBCAirbusBoeingQA\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3722888.stm|accessdate=22 October 2014|title=Q&A: Boeing and Airbus | work=BBC News | date=7 October 2004}}</ref> Airbus claims that since the signing of the EU-U.S. agreement in 1992, it has repaid European governments more than U.S.$6.7&nbsp;billion and that this is 40% more than it has received.\n\nAirbus argues that [[pork barrel]] military contracts awarded to Boeing (the second largest U.S. defence contractor) are in effect a form of subsidy (see the [[KC-X|KC-X program]]).

In 1921 he left on a study tour of [[Italy]] (as well as visiting the other Nordic countries, [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[north Africa]]), a common practice at that time for architects in the Nordic countries who were turning away from [[National Romantic Style|National Romanticism]].\n\nAfter qualifying V\u00e4likangas worked in Yuzovka in [[Russia]] (present-day [[Donetsk]] in the [[Ukraine]]), but had to leave in a hurry with the onset of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

Among his many other positions, he was chief architect at the National Board of Building from 1937 until the [[Winter War]] in 1940, from 1942 to 1944 he was head of the office responsible for post-war reconstruction, he acted as the director of the board responsible for the restoration of [[Turku Castle]], he was the chief architect at the Helsinki Workers' Savings Bank, and from 1928 to 1930 he was Editor-in-Chief of the ''Finnish Architectural Review'', in doing so influencing the spread of [[Modernist architecture]] in Finland.\n\nHe is buried in the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/material/attachments/hautausmaat/hietaniemi/w8GZkM0y7/Hietaniemen_merkittavia_vainajia.pdf|title=Hietaniemen hautausmaa \u2013 merkitt\u00e4vi\u00e4 vainajia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Helsingin seurakuntayhtym\u00e4|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref> The archives of Martti V\u00e4likangas are in the possession of the [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]] in Helsinki.\n\n== Work ==\n\n[[File:Turun rautatieasema.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Turku Central railway station]], 1940]]\n[[File:K\u00e4til\u00f6opisto 2018.JPG|right|200px|thumb|\"K\u00e4til\u00f6opisto\" Maternity Hospital, Helsinki, 1960]]\n\nV\u00e4likangas designed approximately 170 projects.<ref>Harri Hautaj\u00e4rvi, \"Martti V\u00e4likangas: Housing and Banks for Workers\", ''ARK'', 6/1993, p.27</ref> His most notable work is the Puu-K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 [\u2018wood K\u00e4pyl\u00e4\u2019] Garden Suburb in [[K\u00e4pyl\u00e4]] on the then northern edge of Helsinki, built from 1920 to 1925, a commission he received at the age of 26. Puu-k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 was a model workers\u2019 housing area, built at a time when there was a bad housing problem for workers in the city. The construction follows the typical Finnish vernacular method: square-log construction then faced in weatherboarding. However, the whole process was partly industrialized, and the area is regarded as the first prefabricated housing area in Finland. The mostly 2-storey semi-detached timber houses are arranged around sheltered courtyards, where originally the tenants\u2019 vegetable gardens were sited.

In 1921 he left on a study tour of [[Italy]] (as well as visiting the other Nordic countries, [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[north Africa]]), a common practice at that time for architects in the Nordic countries who were turning away from [[National Romantic Style|National Romanticism]].\n\nAfter qualifying V\u00e4likangas worked in Yuzovka in [[Russia]] (present-day [[Donetsk]] in the [[Ukraine]]), but had to leave in a hurry with the onset of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. On his return he worked for the Br\u00e4nd\u00f6 Villastad company as well as in the architect\u2019s office of G\u00f6sta Jusl\u00e9n and, from 1918 to 1920, in the office of Frosterus and Gripenberg. V\u00e4likangas founded his own office in 1920, while also working elsewhere. Among his many other positions, he was chief architect at the National Board of Building from 1937 until the [[Winter War]] in 1940, from 1942 to 1944 he was head of the office responsible for post-war reconstruction, he acted as the director of the board responsible for the restoration of [[Turku Castle]], he was the chief architect at the Helsinki Workers' Savings Bank, and from 1928 to 1930 he was Editor-in-Chief of the ''Finnish Architectural Review'', in doing so influencing the spread of [[Modernist architecture]] in Finland.\n\nHe is buried in the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/material/attachments/hautausmaat/hietaniemi/w8GZkM0y7/Hietaniemen_merkittavia_vainajia.pdf|title=Hietaniemen hautausmaa \u2013 merkitt\u00e4vi\u00e4 vainajia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Helsingin seurakuntayhtym\u00e4|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref> The archives of Martti V\u00e4likangas are in the possession of the [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]] in Helsinki.\n\n== Work == \n\n[[File:Turun rautatieasema.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Turku Central railway station]], 1940]]\n[[File:K\u00e4til\u00f6opisto 2018.JPG|right|200px|thumb|\"K\u00e4til\u00f6opisto\" Maternity Hospital, Helsinki, 1960]]\n\nV\u00e4likangas designed approximately 170 projects.<ref>Harri Hautaj\u00e4rvi, \"Martti V\u00e4likangas: Housing and Banks for Workers\", ''ARK'', 6/1993, p.27</ref> His most notable work is the Puu-K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 [\u2018wood K\u00e4pyl\u00e4\u2019] Garden Suburb in [[K\u00e4pyl\u00e4]] on the then northern edge of Helsinki, built from 1920 to 1925, a commission he received at the age of 26. Puu-k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 was a model workers\u2019 housing area, built at a time when there was a bad housing problem for workers in the city. The construction follows the typical Finnish vernacular method: square-log construction then faced in weatherboarding. However, the whole process was partly industrialized, and the area is regarded as the first prefabricated housing area in Finland. The mostly 2-storey semi-detached timber houses are arranged around sheltered courtyards, where originally the tenants\u2019 vegetable gardens were sited. The colours vary slightly from one house to another, but with a dominance of traditional red ochre. K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 was threatened with demolition in the 1960s, and even V\u00e4likangas himself drew up plans for the wooden housing to be replaced by a multi-storey development. The area has survived, however, though the working-class families are gradually being replaced by middle-class families and professional types, especially architects \u2013 and it also has become a favourite tourist attraction. \n\nThe Olympic Games were due to take place in Helsinki, in 1940 (but were cancelled due to the Second World War, to be held eventually in Helsinki in [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]]), and V\u00e4likangas participated in the design of the Olympic Village, together with architect Hilding Ekelund.
