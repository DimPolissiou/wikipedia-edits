In course of time, due to their virtues and fighting spirit, they unlock various megazords of the past rangers (meeting several along the way.). An alien named Orion, whose home world was destroyed by the armada, then joins their ranks as the Silver Ranger, and gets all the legendary Sixth Ranger along with those of Robo Knight. Later, in a battle with the most powerful machines of evil, the Megazords of the Rangers as well as their Legendary Megazords are destroyed. After that, Troy and Orion enter the ship of Vrak and Vekar's father the Warstar Emperor Marvo, fight him, and unleash the ship's power, which destroys every other ship in the Armada. Later they both succeed in destroying Marvo and then they return to the ground. The Rangers then find that thousands of X-Borgs, the innumerable soldiers of The Armada, have been let loose on them. At this point, all the Legendary Rangers, whose powers the Rangers have been using throughout the series, appear to help them. Together, all the Rangers destroy the X-Borgs, saving the Earth.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Power Rangers Megaforce characters}}\n\n=== Power Rangers ===\n\n* Andrew Gray as Troy

In course of time, due to their virtues and fighting spirit, they unlock various megazords of the past rangers (meeting several along the way.). An alien named Orion, whose home world was destroyed by the armada, then joins their ranks as the Silver Ranger, and gets all the legendary Sixth Ranger along with those of Robo Knight. Later, in a battle with the most powerful machines of evil, the Megazords of the Rangers as well as their Legendary Megazords are destroyed. After that, Troy and Orion enter the ship of Vrak and Vekar's father the Warstar Emperor Marvo, fight him, and unleash the ship's power, which destroys every other ship in the Armada. Later they both succeed in destroying Marvo and then they return to the ground. The Rangers then find that thousands of X-Borgs, the innumerable soldiers of The Armada, have been let loose on them. At this point, all the Legendary Rangers, whose powers the Rangers have been using throughout the series, appear to help them.

We are interested in estimating the shape of this function ''\u0192''. Its ''kernel density estimator'' is\n: <math>\n    \\widehat{f}_h(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n K_h (x - x_i) = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{i=1}^n K\\Big(\\frac{x-x_i}{h}\\Big),\n  </math>\nwhere ''K'' is the [[kernel (statistics)#In non-parametric statistics|kernel]] \u2014 a non-negative function \u2014 and {{nowrap|''h'' > 0}} is a [[smoothing]] parameter called the ''bandwidth''. A kernel with subscript ''h'' is called the ''scaled kernel'' and defined as {{nowrap|''K<sub>h</sub>''(''x'') {{=}} 1/''h K''(''x''/''h'')}}. Intuitively one wants to choose ''h'' as small as the data will allow; however, there is always a trade-off between the bias of the estimator and its variance. The choice of bandwidth is discussed in more detail below.\n\nA range of [[kernel (statistics)#Kernel functions in common use|kernel functions]] are commonly used: uniform, triangular, biweight, triweight, Epanechnikov, normal, and others. The Epanechnikov kernel is optimal in a mean square error sense,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1137/1114019 |author=Epanechnikov, V.A. |title=Non-parametric estimation of a multivariate probability density |journal=Theory of Probability and Its Applications |volume=14 |pages=153\u2013158 |year=1969}}</ref> though the loss of efficiency is small for the kernels listed previously.<ref name=\"WJ1995\">{{Cite book| author1=Wand, M.P |author2=Jones, M.C. |title=Kernel Smoothing |publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC |location=London |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-412-55270-0}}</ref> Due to its convenient mathematical properties, the normal kernel is often used, which means {{nowrap|''K''(''x'') {{=}} ''\u03d5''(''x'')}}, where ''\u03d5'' is the [[standard normal]] density function.\n\nThe construction of a kernel density estimate finds interpretations in fields outside of density estimation.<ref name=\"bo10\">{{Cite journal |author1=Botev, Z.I. |author2=Grotowski, J.F. |author3=Kroese, D.P. |title=Kernel density estimation via diffusion |journal=[[Annals of Statistics]] |volume= 38 |issue=5 |pages=2916\u20132957 |year=2010 |doi=10.1214/10-AOS799|arxiv=1011.2602 }}</ref> For example, in [[thermodynamics]], this is equivalent to the amount of heat generated when [[heat kernel]]s (the fundamental solution to the [[heat equation]]) are placed at each data point locations ''x<sub>i</sub>''. Similar methods are used to construct [[discrete Laplace operator]]s on point clouds for [[manifold learning]] (e.g. [[diffusion map]]).\n\n==Example==\nKernel density estimates are closely related to [[histograms]], but can be endowed with properties such as smoothness or continuity by using a suitable kernel. To see this, we compare the construction of histogram and kernel density estimators, using these 6 data points:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Sample \n| 1 \n| 2 \n| 3 \n| 4 \n| 5 \n| 6\n|-\n! Value \n| -2.1 \n| -1.3 \n| -0.4 \n| 1.9 \n| 5.1 \n| 6.2\n|}\n\nFor the histogram, first the horizontal axis is divided into sub-intervals or bins which cover the range of the data. In this case, we have six bins each of width 2. Whenever a data point falls inside this interval, we place a box of height 1/12. If more than one data point falls inside the same bin, we stack the boxes on top of each other.\n\nFor the kernel density estimate, we place a normal kernel with standard deviation 2.25 (indicated by the red dashed lines) on each of the data points ''x<sub>i</sub>''. The kernels are summed to make the kernel density estimate (solid blue curve). The smoothness of the kernel density estimate is evident compared to the discreteness of the histogram, as kernel density estimates converge faster to the true underlying density for continuous random variables.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scott, D. |title=On optimal and data-based histograms |journal=Biometrika |year=1979 |volume=66 |pages=605\u2013610 |doi=10.1093/biomet/66.3.605 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Comparison of 1D histogram and KDE.png|thumb|center|500px|alt=Comparison of the histogram (left) and kernel density estimate (right) constructed using the same data.

Grey: true density (standard normal). Red: KDE with h=0.05. Black: KDE with h=0.337. Green: KDE with h=2.]]\n\nThe bandwidth of the kernel is a [[free parameter]] which exhibits a strong influence on the resulting estimate. To illustrate its effect, we take a simulated [[Random number generator|random sample]] from the standard [[normal distribution]] (plotted at the blue spikes in the [[rug plot]] on the horizontal axis). The grey curve is the true density (a normal density with mean 0 and variance 1). In comparison, the red curve is ''undersmoothed'' since it contains too many spurious data artifacts arising from using a bandwidth ''h'' = 0.05, which is too small. The green curve is ''oversmoothed'' since using the bandwidth ''h'' = 2 obscures much of the underlying structure. The black curve with a bandwidth of ''h'' = 0.337 is considered to be optimally smoothed since its density estimate is close to the true density. An extreme situation is encountered in the limit <math>h \\to 0</math> (no smoothing), where the estimate is a sum of ''n'' [[Dirac delta function|delta functions]] centered at the coordinates of analyzed samples. In the other extreme limit <math>h \\to \\infty</math> the estimate retains the shape of the used kernel, centered on the mean of the samples (completely smooth).\n\nThe most common optimality criterion used to select this parameter is the expected ''L''<sub>2</sub> [[risk function]], also termed the [[mean integrated squared error]]:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{MISE} (h) = \\operatorname{E}\\!\\left[\\, \\int (\\hat{f}_h(x) - f(x))^2 \\, dx \\right].</math>\n\nUnder weak assumptions on ''\u0192''  and ''K'', -(''\u0192'' is the, generally unknown, real density function),<ref name=\"Ros1956\"/><ref name=\"Par1962\"/>\nMISE (''h'') = AMISE(''h'') + ''o(1/(nh) + h<sup>4</sup>)'' where ''o'' is the [[little o notation]].\nThe AMISE is the Asymptotic MISE which consists of the two leading terms\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{AMISE}(h) = \\frac{R(K)}{nh} + \\frac{1}{4} m_2(K)^2 h^4 R(f'')</math>\n\nwhere <math>R(g) = \\int g(x)^2 \\, dx</math> for a function ''g'', <math>m_2(K) = \\int x^2 K(x) \\, dx</math>\nand ''\u0192'''' is the second derivative of ''\u0192''. The minimum of this AMISE is the solution to this differential equation\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h} \\operatorname{AMISE}(h) = -\\frac{R(K)}{nh^2} +  m_2(K)^2 h^3 R(f'') = 0 </math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>h_{\\operatorname{AMISE}} = \\frac{ R(K)^{1/5}}{m_2(K)^{2/5}R(f'')^{1/5} n^{1/5}}.</math>\n\nNeither the AMISE nor the ''h''<sub>AMISE</sub> formulas are able to be used directly since they involve the unknown density function ''\u0192'' or its second derivative ''\u0192'''', so a variety of automatic, data-based methods have been developed for selecting the bandwidth.

One difficulty with applying this inversion formula is that it leads to a diverging integral, since the estimate <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\varphi(t)</math> is unreliable for large ''t''\u2019s. To circumvent this problem, the estimator <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\varphi(t)</math> is multiplied by a damping function {{nowrap|''\u03c8<sub>h</sub>''(''t'') {{=}} ''\u03c8''(''ht'')}}, which is equal to 1 at the origin and then falls to 0 at infinity. The \u201cbandwidth parameter\u201d ''h'' controls how fast we try to dampen the function <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\varphi(t)</math>. In particular when ''h'' is small, then ''\u03c8<sub>h</sub>''(''t'') will be approximately one for a large range of ''t''\u2019s, which means that <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\varphi(t)</math> remains practically unaltered in the most important region of ''t''\u2019s.\n\nThe most common choice for function ''\u03c8'' is either the uniform function {{nowrap|''\u03c8''(''t'') {{=}} '''1'''{\u22121 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1}}}, which effectively means truncating the interval of integration in the inversion formula to {{nowrap|[\u22121/''h'', 1/''h'']}}, or the [[Gaussian function]] {{nowrap|''\u03c8''(''t'') {{=}} ''e''<sup>''\u2212{{pi}}t''<sup>2</sup></sup>}}. Once the function ''\u03c8'' has been chosen, the inversion formula may be applied, and the density estimator will be\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    \\widehat{f}(x) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\widehat\\varphi(t)\\psi_h(t) e^{-itx} \\, dt\n                = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^n e^{it(x_j-x)} \\psi(ht) \\, dt \\\\[5pt]\n               &= \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} e^{-i(ht)\\frac{x-x_j}{h}} \\psi(ht) \\, d(ht)\n                = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{j=1}^n K\\Big(\\frac{x-x_j}{h}\\Big),\n  \\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''K'' is the [[Fourier transform]] of the damping function ''\u03c8''.

We are interested in estimating the shape of this function ''\u0192''. Its ''kernel density estimator'' is\n: <math>\n    \\widehat{f}_h(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n K_h (x - x_i) = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{i=1}^n K\\Big(\\frac{x-x_i}{h}\\Big),\n  </math>\nwhere ''K'' is the [[kernel (statistics)#In non-parametric statistics|kernel]] \u2014 a non-negative function \u2014 and {{nowrap|''h'' > 0}} is a [[smoothing]] parameter called the ''bandwidth''. A kernel with subscript ''h'' is called the ''scaled kernel'' and defined as {{nowrap|''K<sub>h</sub>''(''x'') {{=}} 1/''h K''(''x''/''h'')}}. Intuitively one wants to choose ''h'' as small as the data will allow; however, there is always a trade-off between the bias of the estimator and its variance. The choice of bandwidth is discussed in more detail below.\n\nA range of [[kernel (statistics)#Kernel functions in common use|kernel functions]] are commonly used: uniform, triangular, biweight, triweight, Epanechnikov, normal, and others.

Similar methods are used to construct [[discrete Laplace operator]]s on point clouds for [[manifold learning]] (e.g. [[diffusion map]]).\n\n==Example==\nKernel density estimates are closely related to [[histograms]], but can be endowed with properties such as smoothness or continuity by using a suitable kernel. To see this, we compare the construction of histogram and kernel density estimators, using these 6 data points:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Sample \n| 1 \n| 2 \n| 3 \n| 4 \n| 5 \n| 6\n|-\n! Value \n| -2.1 \n| -1.3 \n| -0.4 \n| 1.9 \n| 5.1 \n| 6.2\n|}\n\nFor the histogram, first the horizontal axis is divided into sub-intervals or bins which cover the range of the data. In this case, we have six bins each of width 2. Whenever a data point falls inside this interval, we place a box of height 1/12. If more than one data point falls inside the same bin, we stack the boxes on top of each other.\n\nFor the kernel density estimate, we place a normal kernel with standard deviation 2.25 (indicated by the red dashed lines) on each of the data points ''x<sub>i</sub>''. The kernels are summed to make the kernel density estimate (solid blue curve). The smoothness of the kernel density estimate is evident compared to the discreteness of the histogram, as kernel density estimates converge faster to the true underlying density for continuous random variables.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scott, D. |title=On optimal and data-based histograms |journal=Biometrika |year=1979 |volume=66 |pages=605\u2013610 |doi=10.1093/biomet/66.3.605 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Comparison of 1D histogram and KDE.png|thumb|center|500px|alt=Comparison of the histogram (left) and kernel density estimate (right) constructed using the same data.

Green: KDE with h=2.]]\n\nThe bandwidth of the kernel is a [[free parameter]] which exhibits a strong influence on the resulting estimate. To illustrate its effect, we take a simulated [[Random number generator|random sample]] from the standard [[normal distribution]] (plotted at the blue spikes in the [[rug plot]] on the horizontal axis). The grey curve is the true density (a normal density with mean 0 and variance 1). In comparison, the red curve is ''undersmoothed'' since it contains too many spurious data artifacts arising from using a bandwidth ''h'' = 0.05, which is too small. The green curve is ''oversmoothed'' since using the bandwidth ''h'' = 2 obscures much of the underlying structure. The black curve with a bandwidth of ''h'' = 0.337 is considered to be optimally smoothed since its density estimate is close to the true density. An extreme situation is encountered in the limit <math>h \\to 0</math> (no smoothing), where the estimate is a sum of ''n'' [[Dirac delta function|delta functions]] centered at the coordinates of analyzed samples. In the other extreme limit <math>h \\to \\infty</math> the estimate retains the shape of the used kernel, centered on the mean of the samples (completely smooth).\n\nThe most common optimality criterion used to select this parameter is the expected ''L''<sub>2</sub> [[risk function]], also termed the [[mean integrated squared error]]:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{MISE} (h) = \\operatorname{E}\\!\\left[\\, \\int (\\hat{f}_h(x) - f(x))^2 \\, dx \\right].</math>\n\nUnder weak assumptions on ''\u0192''  and ''K'', -(''\u0192'' is the, generally unknown, real density function),<ref name=\"Ros1956\"/><ref name=\"Par1962\"/>\nMISE (''h'') = AMISE(''h'') + ''o(1/(nh) + h<sup>4</sup>)'' where ''o'' is the [[little o notation]].\nThe AMISE is the Asymptotic MISE which consists of the two leading terms\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{AMISE}(h) = \\frac{R(K)}{nh} + \\frac{1}{4} m_2(K)^2 h^4 R(f'')</math>\n\nwhere <math>R(g) = \\int g(x)^2 \\, dx</math> for a function ''g'', <math>m_2(K) = \\int x^2 K(x) \\, dx</math>\nand ''\u0192'''' is the second derivative of ''\u0192''.

One difficulty with applying this inversion formula is that it leads to a diverging integral, since the estimate <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\varphi(t)</math> is unreliable for large ''t''\u2019s. To circumvent this problem, the estimator <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\varphi(t)</math> is multiplied by a damping function {{nowrap|''\u03c8<sub>h</sub>''(''t'') {{=}} ''\u03c8''(''ht'')}}, which is equal to 1 at the origin and then falls to 0 at infinity. The \u201cbandwidth parameter\u201d ''h'' controls how fast we try to dampen the function <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\varphi(t)</math>. In particular when ''h'' is small, then ''\u03c8<sub>h</sub>''(''t'') will be approximately one for a large range of ''t''\u2019s, which means that <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\varphi(t)</math> remains practically unaltered in the most important region of ''t''\u2019s.\n\nThe most common choice for function ''\u03c8'' is either the uniform function {{nowrap|''\u03c8''(''t'') {{=}} '''1'''{\u22121 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1}}}, which effectively means truncating the interval of integration in the inversion formula to {{nowrap|[\u22121/''h'', 1/''h'']}}, or the [[Gaussian function]] {{nowrap|''\u03c8''(''t'') {{=}} ''e''<sup>''\u2212{{pi}}t''<sup>2</sup></sup>}}. Once the function ''\u03c8'' has been chosen, the inversion formula may be applied, and the density estimator will be\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    \\widehat{f}(x) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\widehat\\varphi(t)\\psi_h(t) e^{-itx} \\, dt\n                = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^n e^{it(x_j-x)} \\psi(ht) \\, dt \\\\[5pt]\n               &= \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} e^{-i(ht)\\frac{x-x_j}{h}} \\psi(ht) \\, d(ht)\n                = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{j=1}^n K\\Big(\\frac{x-x_j}{h}\\Big),\n  \\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''K'' is the [[Fourier transform]] of the damping function ''\u03c8''.
