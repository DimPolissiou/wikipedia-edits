The film was directed by [[Ron Howard]], from a screenplay written by [[Akiva Goldsman]]. It was inspired by a bestselling, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated 1998 [[A Beautiful Mind (book)|book of the same name]] by [[Sylvia Nasar]]. The film stars [[Russell Crowe]], along with [[Ed Harris]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Adam Goldberg]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Anthony Rapp]], and [[Christopher Plummer]] in supporting roles. The story begins in Nash's days as a graduate student at [[Princeton University]]. Early in the film, Nash begins to develop [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and endures [[delusion]]al episodes while watching the burden his condition brings on wife [[Alicia Nash|Alicia]] and friends.\n\nThe film opened in the United States cinemas on December 21, 2001. It went on to gross over $313 million worldwide and won four [[Academy Awards]], for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0268978|A Beautiful Mind}}</ref>\n\nIt was well received by critics, but has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life, especially his other family and a son born out of wedlock. However, the filmmakers have stated that the film was not meant to be a literal representation of Nash's life.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--- PER WP:FILMPLOT, ALL PLOTS MUST BE BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS --->\nIn 1947, [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] arrives at [[Princeton University]]. He is a co-recipient, with Martin Hansen, of the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship for [[mathematics]]. At a reception, he meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Richard Sol, Ainsley, and Bender. He also meets his roommate Charles Herman, a literature student.\n\nNash is under extreme pressure to publish, but he wants to publish his own original idea. His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes [[Adam Smith]] and advocates \"every man for himself,\" but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. Nash develops a [[Nash equilibrium|new concept of governing dynamics]] and publishes an article on this. On the strength of this, he is offered an appointment at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] where Sol and Bender join him.\n\nSome years later, Nash is invited to [[the Pentagon]] to [[Cryptanalysis|crack]] [[Encryption|encrypted]] enemy telecommunications. Nash can decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other decrypters. He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by his mysterious supervisor, William Parcher of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. He offers Nash a job, in which Nash would help him to decode the messages to detect a bomb the Soviets had been hiding. The code is said to be found in normal magazines, newspapers and such. He is to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns and believes he is followed when he delivers his results to a secret mailbox.\n\nMeanwhile, a student, [[Alicia Nash|Alicia Larde]], asks him to dinner, and the two fall in love. On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into Charles and his niece, Marcee. With Charles' encouragement, he proposes to Alicia and they marry.\n\nNash begins to fear for his life after witnessing a shootout between Parcher and Soviet agents, but Parcher blackmails him into staying on his assignment. While delivering a guest lecture at [[Harvard University]], Nash tries to flee from people he thinks are foreign Soviet agents, led by Dr. Rosen. After punching Rosen in an attempt to flee, Nash is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility he believes is run by the Soviets.\n\nDr. Rosen tells Alicia that Nash has [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and that Charles, Marcee, and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia investigates and informs Nash that the Department of Defense does not have a \"William Parcher\" working for them and reveals the unopened documents he had delivered to the secret mailbox. Nash is given a course of [[insulin shock therapy]] and eventually released. Frustrated with the [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of the [[antipsychotic]] medication he is taking, which makes him lethargic and unresponsive, he secretly stops taking it. This causes a relapse and he \"meets\" Parcher again.\n\nShortly afterward, Alicia discovers Nash is once again working on his \"assignment\" in an abandoned shed not far from their house. Realizing he has relapsed, Alicia rushes into the house to find Nash had left their baby unsupervised and nearly submerged in the bathtub, which had been filling with water. Nash claims that Charles was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash believes Parcher is trying to kill her. He rushes in to push Parcher away, and accidentally knocks Alicia and the baby to the ground. As Alicia flees the house with their baby, Nash jumps in front of Alicia's car affirming to her: \"Marcee never gets old! She doesn't get old!\". Nash tells her that he realizes that he has never seen Marcee age, even though he has known her for three years. He finally accepts that Parcher and other figures are hallucinations. Against Dr. Rosen's advice, Nash decides not to restart his medication, believing that he can deal with his symptoms himself. Alicia decides to stay and support him in this.\n\nNash returns to Princeton and approaches his old rival, Hansen, now head of the mathematics department. Hansen grants Nash permission to work out of the library and to [[Academic audit|audit]] classes. Over the next two decades, Nash learns to ignore his hallucinations. By the late 1970s, he is allowed to teach again.\n\nIn 1994, Nash wins the [[Nobel Prize]] for his revolutionary work on [[game theory]], and is honored by his fellow professors, including Hansen. At the Nobel ceremony, he dedicates his prize to his wife, saying \"I'm only here because of you.\"  The movie ends as Nash, Alicia, and their son leave the auditorium in Stockholm; and although Nash sees Charles, Marcee, and Parcher standing to one side and watching him, he looks at them only briefly before departing.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]]\n* [[Ed Harris]] as William Parcher\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as [[Alicia Nash]]\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Dr. Rosen\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Charles Herman\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Richard Sol\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Martin Hansen\n* [[Anthony Rapp]] as Bender\n* [[Jason Gray-Stanford]] as Ainsley Neilson\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Helinger\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Thomas King\n* [[Vivien Cardone]] as Marcee Herman\n* Killian, Christian, and Daniel Coffinet-Crean as Baby\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nAfter producer [[Brian Grazer]] first read an excerpt of [[Sylvia Nasar]]'s book ''[[A Beautiful Mind (book)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine, he immediately purchased the rights to the film. He eventually brought the project to director [[Ron Howard]], who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many [[A-list]] directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was available only when Howard was also available. Grazer chose Howard.<ref name=\"Partners\">\"A Beautiful Partnership: Ron Howard and Brian Grazer\", from ''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD, 2002.</ref>\n\nGrazer met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of \"serious dramatists\", but he chose [[Akiva Goldsman]] because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to avoid having viewers understand they are viewing an alternative reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their understanding, to mimic how Nash comprehended his experiences.  Howard agreed to direct the film based on the first draft. He asked Goldsman to emphasize the love story of Nash and his wife; she was critical to his being able to continue living at home.<ref name=\"Screenplay\">\"Development of the Screenplay\", from ''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD, 2002.</ref>\n\n[[Dave Bayer]], a professor of Mathematics at [[Barnard College]], Columbia University,<ref name=\"Bayer\">{{cite web |title=Dave Bayer: Professor of Mathematics |url=https://barnard.edu/profiles/david-bayer |publisher=Barnard College, Columbia University |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511072702/https://barnard.edu/profiles/david-bayer |archivedate=May 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. For the scene where Nash has to teach a calculus class and gives them a complicated problem to keep them busy, Bayer chose a problem physically unrealistic but mathematically very rich, in keeping with Nash as \"someone who really doesn't want to teach the mundane details, who will home in on what's really interesting\". Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor who lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film.<ref name=\"Swarthmore\">{{cite web |url=http://media.swarthmore.edu/bulletin/wp-content/archived_issues_pdf/Bulletin_2002_06.pdf |title=Beautiful Math |date=2 June 2002 |format=PDF |access-date=20 October 2015 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119170159/http://media.swarthmore.edu/bulletin/wp-content/archived_issues_pdf/Bulletin_2002_06.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Greg Cannom]] was chosen to create the makeup effects for ''A Beautiful Mind'', specifically the age progression of the characters. Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]''. Howard had also worked with Cannom on ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''. Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of \"Older Nash\". The production team originally decided that the makeup department would age Russell Crowe throughout the film; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup was used to push his look to resemble the facial features of John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate skin and be used for overlapping applications; this shortened make-up application time from eight to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight [[Malocclusion|overbite]] in the film.<ref name=\"Makeup\">\"The Process of Age Progression\", from ''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD. 2002.</ref>\n\nHoward and Grazer chose frequent collaborator [[James Horner]] to score the film because they knew of his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, \"It's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director.\" A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a [[kaleidoscope]], in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: \"I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems.\" He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer [[Charlotte Church]] to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a \"purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument\" but also a [[vibrato]] to maintain the humanity of the voice.<ref name=\"Music\">\"Scoring the Film\", from ''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the [[Princeton University]] campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always be introduced first audibly and then visually. This provides a clue for the audience and establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The historic John Nash had only auditory delusions. The filmmakers developed a technique to represent Nash's mental epiphanies.

The film was directed by [[Ron Howard]], from a screenplay written by [[Akiva Goldsman]]. It was inspired by a bestselling, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated 1998 [[A Beautiful Mind (book)|book of the same name]] by [[Sylvia Nasar]]. The film stars [[Russell Crowe]], along with [[Ed Harris]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Adam Goldberg]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Anthony Rapp]], and [[Christopher Plummer]] in supporting roles. The story begins in Nash's days as a graduate student at [[Princeton University]]. Early in the film, Nash begins to develop [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and endures [[delusion]]al episodes while watching the burden his condition brings on wife [[Alicia Nash|Alicia]] and friends.\n\nThe film opened in the United States cinemas on December 21, 2001. It went on to gross over $313 million worldwide and won four [[Academy Awards]], for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0268978|A Beautiful Mind}}</ref>\n\nIt was well received by critics, but has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life, especially his other family and a son born out of wedlock. However, the filmmakers have stated that the film was not meant to be a literal representation of Nash's life.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--- PER WP:FILMPLOT, ALL PLOTS MUST BE BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS --->\nIn 1947, [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] arrives at [[Princeton University]]. He is a co-recipient, with Martin Hansen, of the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship for [[mathematics]]. At a reception, he meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Richard Sol, Ainsley, and Bender. He also meets his roommate Charles Herman, a literature student.\n\nNash is under extreme pressure to publish, but he wants to publish his own original idea. His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes [[Adam Smith]] and advocates \"every man for himself,\" but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. Nash develops a [[Nash equilibrium|new concept of governing dynamics]] and publishes an article on this. On the strength of this, he is offered an appointment at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] where Sol and Bender join him.\n\nSome years later, Nash is invited to [[the Pentagon]] to [[Cryptanalysis|crack]] [[Encryption|encrypted]] enemy telecommunications. Nash can decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other decrypters. He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by his mysterious supervisor, William Parcher of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. He offers Nash a job, in which Nash would help him to decode the messages to detect a bomb the Soviets had been hiding. The code is said to be found in normal magazines, newspapers and such. He is to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns and believes he is followed when he delivers his results to a secret mailbox.\n\nMeanwhile, a student, [[Alicia Nash|Alicia Larde]], asks him to dinner, and the two fall in love. On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into Charles and his niece, Marcee. With Charles' encouragement, he proposes to Alicia and they marry.\n\nNash begins to fear for his life after witnessing a shootout between Parcher and Soviet agents, but Parcher blackmails him into staying on his assignment. While delivering a guest lecture at [[Harvard University]], Nash tries to flee from people he thinks are foreign Soviet agents, led by Dr. Rosen. After punching Rosen in an attempt to flee, Nash is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility he believes is run by the Soviets.\n\nDr. Rosen tells Alicia that Nash has [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and that Charles, Marcee, and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia investigates and informs Nash that the Department of Defense does not have a \"William Parcher\" working for them and reveals the unopened documents he had delivered to the secret mailbox. Nash is given a course of [[insulin shock therapy]] and eventually released. Frustrated with the [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of the [[antipsychotic]] medication he is taking, which makes him lethargic and unresponsive, he secretly stops taking it. This causes a relapse and he \"meets\" Parcher again.\n\nShortly afterward, Alicia discovers Nash is once again working on his \"assignment\" in an abandoned shed not far from their house. Realizing he has relapsed, Alicia rushes into the house to find Nash had left their baby unsupervised and nearly submerged in the bathtub, which had been filling with water. Nash claims that Charles was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash believes Parcher is trying to kill her. He rushes in to push Parcher away, and accidentally knocks Alicia and the baby to the ground. As Alicia flees the house with their baby, Nash jumps in front of Alicia's car affirming to her: \"Marcee never gets old! She doesn't get old!\". Nash tells her that he realizes that he has never seen Marcee age, even though he has known her for three years. He finally accepts that Parcher and other figures are hallucinations. Against Dr. Rosen's advice, Nash decides not to restart his medication, believing that he can deal with his symptoms himself. Alicia decides to stay and support him in this.\n\nNash returns to Princeton and approaches his old rival, Hansen, now head of the mathematics department. Hansen grants Nash permission to work out of the library and to [[Academic audit|audit]] classes. Over the next two decades, Nash learns to ignore his hallucinations. By the late 1970s, he is allowed to teach again.\n\nIn 1994, Nash wins the [[Nobel Prize]] for his revolutionary work on [[game theory]], and is honored by his fellow professors, including Hansen. At the Nobel ceremony, he dedicates his prize to his wife, saying \"I'm only here because of you.\"  The movie ends as Nash, Alicia, and their son leave the auditorium in Stockholm; and although Nash sees Charles, Marcee, and Parcher standing to one side and watching him, he looks at them only briefly before departing.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]]\n* [[Ed Harris]] as William Parcher\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as [[Alicia Nash]]\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Dr. Rosen\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Charles Herman\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Richard Sol\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Martin Hansen\n* [[Anthony Rapp]] as Bender\n* [[Jason Gray-Stanford]] as Ainsley Neilson\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Helinger\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Thomas King\n* [[Vivien Cardone]] as Marcee Herman\n* Killian, Christian, and Daniel Coffinet-Crean as Baby\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nAfter producer [[Brian Grazer]] first read an excerpt of [[Sylvia Nasar]]'s book ''[[A Beautiful Mind (book)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine, he immediately purchased the rights to the film. He eventually brought the project to director [[Ron Howard]], who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many [[A-list]] directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was available only when Howard was also available. Grazer chose Howard.<ref name=\"Partners\">\"A Beautiful Partnership: Ron Howard and Brian Grazer\", from ''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD, 2002.</ref>\n\nGrazer met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of \"serious dramatists\", but he chose [[Akiva Goldsman]] because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to avoid having viewers understand they are viewing an alternative reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their understanding, to mimic how Nash comprehended his experiences.  Howard agreed to direct the film based on the first draft. He asked Goldsman to emphasize the love story of Nash and his wife; she was critical to his being able to continue living at home.<ref name=\"Screenplay\">\"Development of the Screenplay\", from ''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD, 2002.</ref>\n\n[[Dave Bayer]], a professor of Mathematics at [[Barnard College]], Columbia University,<ref name=\"Bayer\">{{cite web |title=Dave Bayer: Professor of Mathematics |url=https://barnard.edu/profiles/david-bayer |publisher=Barnard College, Columbia University |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511072702/https://barnard.edu/profiles/david-bayer |archivedate=May 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. For the scene where Nash has to teach a calculus class and gives them a complicated problem to keep them busy, Bayer chose a problem physically unrealistic but mathematically very rich, in keeping with Nash as \"someone who really doesn't want to teach the mundane details, who will home in on what's really interesting\". Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor who lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film.<ref name=\"Swarthmore\">{{cite web |url=http://media.swarthmore.edu/bulletin/wp-content/archived_issues_pdf/Bulletin_2002_06.pdf |title=Beautiful Math |date=2 June 2002 |format=PDF |access-date=20 October 2015 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119170159/http://media.swarthmore.edu/bulletin/wp-content/archived_issues_pdf/Bulletin_2002_06.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Greg Cannom]] was chosen to create the makeup effects for ''A Beautiful Mind'', specifically the age progression of the characters. Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]''. Howard had also worked with Cannom on ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''. Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of \"Older Nash\". The production team originally decided that the makeup department would age Russell Crowe throughout the film; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup was used to push his look to resemble the facial features of John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate skin and be used for overlapping applications; this shortened make-up application time from eight to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight [[Malocclusion|overbite]] in the film.<ref name=\"Makeup\">\"The Process of Age Progression\", from ''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD. 2002.</ref>\n\nHoward and Grazer chose frequent collaborator [[James Horner]] to score the film because they knew of his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, \"It's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director.\" A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a [[kaleidoscope]], in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: \"I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems.\" He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer [[Charlotte Church]] to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a \"purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument\" but also a [[vibrato]] to maintain the humanity of the voice.<ref name=\"Music\">\"Scoring the Film\", from ''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the [[Princeton University]] campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always be introduced first audibly and then visually. This provides a clue for the audience and establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The historic John Nash had only auditory delusions. The filmmakers developed a technique to represent Nash's mental epiphanies. Mathematicians described to them such moments as a sense of \"the smoke clearing\", \"flashes of light\" and \"everything coming together\", so the filmmakers used a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work.<ref name=\"DVD.com\">''A Beautiful Mind'' DVD commentary featuring Ron Howard, 2002.</ref> Two night shots were done at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s campus in [[Florham Park, New Jersey]], in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countingdown.com/movies/1398/news?item_id=18247 |title=Fairleigh Dickinson University turned into a 'different place' |date=April 30, 2001 |work=CountingDown.com |accessdate=May 10, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Portions of the film set at Harvard were filmed at [[Manhattan College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://manhattan.edu/news/10-movies-filmed-manhattan-colleges-backyard|title=10 Movies Filmed in Manhattan College's Backyard|publisher=|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025015155/http://manhattan.edu/news/10-movies-filmed-manhattan-colleges-backyard|archivedate=October 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMany actors were considered for the role of John Nash, including [[Bruce Willis]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[John Travolta]], [[Tom Cruise]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,180736,00.html|title=A Beautiful Mind Preview|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 24, 2001|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014063754/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,180736,00.html|archivedate=October 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Howard ultimately cast [[Russell Crowe]].\n\n===Writing===\nThe narrative of the film differs considerably from the events of Nash's life, as filmmakers made choices for the sense of the story.

Shortly thereafter, President Charles Blanchard died and Buswell was called to be the third president of Wheaton.  Upon his installation in April 1926, he became the nation's youngest college president at age 31. Buswell's tenure was characterized by expanding enrollment (from approximately 400 in 1925 to 1,100 in 1940), a building program, strong academic development, and a boom in the institution's reputation. It was also known for growing divisiveness over faculty scholarship and [[personality clashes]].

The Artist Series frequently partners with Wheaton College Conservatory graduates, including the soprano Sylvia McNair and the conductor John Nelson.\n\n===Graduate school===\nThe Wheaton College Graduate School was founded in 1937 to provide further theological training and ministry skills. Both the college and graduate school are on an 80-acre campus in Wheaton, Illinois, a 45-minute train ride straight west of downtown Chicago. There are approximately 550 graduate students enrolled, with a 14:1 student/faculty ratio.\n\nThe graduate school is composed of six academic departments; Biblical and Theological Studies, Christian Formation & Ministry, Evangelism and Leadership, Intercultural Studies, Psychology, and Teaching. The Graduate School offers 14 [[Master of Arts] programs and 2 doctoral programs, a Ph.D. in Biblical & Theological Studies and a [[Psy.D]]. in [[Clinical Psychology]].

Participants in Wheaton-in-England, one of the most popular annual programs, take 2\u20133 courses in literature while studying in London and [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St. Anne's College]], Oxford.\n\nMany students also participate in the Human Needs and Global Resources program. The HNGR program matches select students with six-month [[internship]]s in the [[Third World]], including opportunities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\nWheaton also sponsors a semester-long, experiential, residential program in Chicago, called Wheaton in Chicago. In Chicago, students complete internships and take advanced interdisciplinary coursework. Founded in 1998, has enrolled students from more than 20 different majors.\n\nIn 1935, the Wheaton College Science Station was established in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]] for field instruction in the natural sciences.\n\nIn 1951, HoneyRock, the outdoor center for leadership development at Wheaton College, was established in Three Lakes, Wisconsin. HoneyRock is not only a year-round camp for young people but it offers a variety of leadership schools and courses for students. Nearly 3000 people utilize HoneyRock each year.\n\nDue to Wheaton's membership in the [[Council for Christian Colleges & Universities]], Wheaton students may also study at the [[University of Oxford]], the Los Angeles Film Studies Center, [[Excelsia College]] in Australia, and [[Xi'an Foreign Language University]] in China. The CCCU also sponsors programs in American studies, Latin American studies, Middle Eastern studies, Russian studies, and journalism.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Blanchard Hall (5978664560).jpg|thumb|Blanchard Hall houses offices for departments in the Humanities, Social Sciences as well as the offices of the President, the Provost, Vice-Presidents and Academic Affairs.]]\nWheaton's most recognizable and oldest building is [[Blanchard Hall]], a limestone building built as the main College building in 1853.  At the time, the College building was one of only two on campus, the other (called the \"boarding hall\") being a frame building at the foot of the hill crowned by the two-story building.  Jonathan Blanchard had a vision for the expansion of this structure into its present castle-like architecture. The architectural influence is, supposedly, patterned after buildings at the University of Oxford which Blanchard admired on a trip to England in 1843. After four additions (1871, 1873, 1890, 1927) the Main Building was completed in 1927. In this year, under college president J. Oliver Buswell, Jr., the Main Building was renamed Blanchard Hall, to honor Wheaton's first two presidents, Jonathan Blanchard and his son Charles Blanchard.\n\nBlanchard Hall served as a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/>\n\n===Academic===\nIn 1900 the brick \"Industrial Building\" was built.  From 1917\u201345 it housed the Wheaton Academy, and from 1945\u201360 the Graduate School. In 1960 it was renamed Buswell Hall, and in 1980 renamed Schell Hall in honor of Edward R. Schell.\n\nThe science departments were housed in Breyer ([[Chemistry]]) and Armerding ([[Biology]], [[Geology]], [[Math]], and [[Physics]]) halls until the 2010\u201311 school year when Wheaton's new Meyer Science Center was completed.  Armerding Hall was also the home to the Wheaton College Observatory (a feature of the college since the presidency of Charles Blanchard in the late-nineteenth century) which was relocated to the Meyer science Center.\n\nThe Wheaton College Conservatory of Music, housed in the Armerding Center for Music and Arts (previously in McAlister Hall and Pierce Memorial Chapel), is an internationally recognized music school and holds the distinction of being the only conservatory within an Evangelical school of higher education. The approximately 200 students within the conservatory focus on a range of fields within music including education, performance, composition, and history. Student recitals, required for graduation with a music degree, are generally held in Pierce Memorial Chapel.\n\n==Athletics==\nWheaton College teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The Thunder are a member of the [[College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin]] (CCIW). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball. Wheaton College also competes with both in Men's and Women's collegiate rowing, lacrosse and club soccer.\n\nThe men's basketball team won the first NCAA Small College National Championship in 1958, defeating Kentucky Wesleyan in the finals, 89\u201365.

As a strictly oral tradition this cheer is unable to be written down for any purpose. Memorizing the cheer is known as a rite of passage for Wheaton rowers and is known for connecting current rowers with alumni.\n\n==== Captain's Flag and Oar; Golden Cox-Tool ====\nAt the transition of captains, both the Men's and Women's captains are given the first flag and oar of Wheaton Crew as a symbol of the passing of power from one generation of Wheaton oarsmen to another.

It was renovated in early 2010 and currently serves as home to the [[Art]] Department.\nAlumni Gymnasium (renamed the Edward A. Coray Alumni Gymnasium in 1968, in honor of Coach [[Ed Coray]]'s long service), was built during the Edman presidency and paid for by alumni.  The cornerstone was laid at homecoming on October 11, 1941.  A copper box placed in the cornerstone contained a copy of the Wheaton Record, the Wheaton Daily Journal, a college catalog, a student directory, and a copy of the Homecoming program. Wyngarten Health Center was built in 1958, followed by Centennial Gymnasium in 1959\u201360, which was extensively renovated and expanded in 2000. It is now known as King Arena and is part of the Chrouser Sports Complex (CSC) and houses the majority of the college's athletic and fitness facilities.\n\n==Library and collections==\nThe Library, named after college trustee Robert E. Nicholas, opened in January 1952. In 1975 Buswell Memorial Library, named for the college's third president J. Oliver Buswell, Jr., was built adjacent to the Nicholas Library and an interior corridor linked the two, creating the college's main library. The building also contains the Peter Stam Music Library, located downstairs and named in honor of the Conservatory of Music's first head, Peter Stam. Buswell Memorial Library's physical collections contain over one million items, making Buswell the largest library collection of liberal-arts colleges in the state of Illinois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.wheaton.edu/welcome|title=Welcome New Students! - Buswell Library|access-date=July 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804042938/http://library.wheaton.edu/welcome|archive-date=August 4, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nIn September 2001, the [[Marion E.

It was built in memory of over 1,600 former students and graduates who served in [[World War II]], and in honor of those 39 who gave their lives. It housed the Student Union Caf\u00e9, nicknamed \"the Stupe\" (which has since been moved to the Beamer Center). An early pamphlet described the new building and listed some of the rules for its use, such as No Rook Playing and No Playing of Boogie-Woogie, Jazz, or Otherwise Abusing the Piano. The MSC was remodeled during the Fall semester of 2007 for academic use, and is now home to the Business Economics department, the Political Science and International Relations department, and the Wheaton College Center for Faith, Politics and Economics.\n\nThe MSC was remodeled according to the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The MSC was the first building renovated according to these standards and sets higher standards than existing EPA standards. Many of the materials that were used were post-consumer and over 20% of the materials were manufactured within a {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of the College.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327214151/http://www.wheaton.edu/Leed/ Wheaton College, Wheaton Illinois: LEED Certification] The MSC remodeling is part of the current capital campaign, The Promise of Wheaton.\n\nThe Dining Hall (now the \"Student Services Building\") opened January 4, 1953. Today it houses Student Development, Undergraduate Admissions, and the College Bookstore.\n\nJenks Hall is home to the Arena Theater, which was established in the Fall of 1974 and has staged over 100 full length productions.\n\n[[File:Student Recreation Center.jpg|thumb|The Chrouser Sports Complex (CSC) features an 8,000 square foot weight room, three student recreational gyms, an elevated jogging track, a climbing wall, \"smart\" classrooms and conference rooms, and a new physiology lab.]]\nIn the fall of 2004, the [[Todd Beamer|Todd M. Beamer]] Student Center was completed. Beamer, a Wheaton alumnus, was part of a small group of passengers who stormed hijackers on [[United Flight 93]], bringing down the plane in rural Pennsylvania during the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], and preventing it from reaching its target. The building that bears his name was a $20+ million dollar project commissioned in order to meet the needs of the growing college community. Along with its spacious and sleek modern design, the Beamer Center features a convenience store known as the \"C-Store\", the \"Stupe\" (the name derives from students shortening the previous nickname for the campus Student Union, \"Stupid Onion\", which in turn is a jocular mispronunciation of Student Union), a bakery caf\u00e9 named \"Sam's\" (named after the former Vice President of Student Development Sam Shellhammer, who retired following the 2007\u201308 school year after serving Wheaton's campus community for thirty years), several reading rooms and lounges, a recreation/game room, a prayer chapel, an expanded college post office, the offices for several organizations and departments, and several other event rooms. In the fall of 2006, strong rain storms created a flood that destroyed the lower level of the Beamer Center. Wheaton College has since restored the flood-damaged building.\n\nThe official student newspaper at Wheaton College is the ''Wheaton Record'',<ref>[http://www.wheaton.edu/sao/record/ \"Wheaton Record\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008021503/http://www.wheaton.edu/sao/Record/ |date=October 8, 2007 }}. Wheaton College.</ref> a weekly publication with a circulation of 3400, in existence since 1876. ''The Record'' is produced by students, published by the college, and distributed each Friday after chapel free of charge. ''The Record'' was the recipient of the 2006 John David Reed General Excellence Award and has received 13 other awards from the Illinois College Press Association, of which it is a member. ''The Record'' is also a member of the Associated Collegiate Press.\n\nIn addition, Wheaton College has many organizations on campus that range from helping the poor and needy in Chicago to the arts and improvisation.\n\nJuniors and seniors are also eligible to live in one of thirteen campus houses, apartments (five complexes), or off-campus.\n\n===Spirituality===\nThe chapel, on the corner of Washington and Franklin streets, was dedicated on November 15, 1925. The building was also used by the college for commencements and other important assemblies. In 1936\u201337, it was renamed the Orlinda Childs Pierce Memorial Chapel. Neighboring McAlister Hall is home to the Conservatory of Music and houses conservatory faculty offices, several music classrooms, and the practice rooms used daily by conservatory students.\n\n[[College Church]], across Washington Street from the college, is not formally associated with the college, although it has long been informally closely associated with the college.<ref name=\"Schnurr\">Stephen J.

Raymond Edman, fourth president of the college. Edman died in 1967 while speaking in chapel.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} He was preaching on being in the presence of the King, and the recording is available in the Wheaton chapel archives. This chapel/auditorium is also used for many events of Wheaton's performing arts programs. In 2000, an entirely handcrafted organ made by the Casavant Organ Company of Quebec, Canada, was installed.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Wheatonbgc.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Billy Graham Center]]\nThe building housing the [[Billy Graham]] Center (BGC), named after one of the college's most well-known graduates, opened in September 1980. The [[Billy Graham Center]] itself, as the repository of the evangelist's corporate records, had existed since 1974.\n\nThe BGC houses an auditorium, classrooms and several evangelism institutes, a museum of the history of evangelism, the college's Archives and Special Collections, and the Wheaton College Graduate School. It also housed the school radio station, [[WAIW|WETN 88.1 FM]], until its sale in February 2017.\n\nThe Women's Building, renamed Williston Hall in 1930\u201331 (in honor of longtime Blanchard friend and donor J. P. Williston), was built in 1895. Its construction required the college to borrow $6,000. After seventy-eight years of housing only women, Williston Hall is now a coed dormitory for sophomore students. It opened to men starting in the fall semester of 2009 with the dream that it would become a creative hotspot on campus.\n\nThe President's House, or Westgate, formerly owned by college trustee John M. Oury, was presented to President Buswell on the tenth anniversary of his inauguration, April 23, 1936. This served as the home of three of Wheaton's subsequent presidents. It now houses the Office of Alumni Relations.\n\nIn 1951, HoneyRock, the outdoor center for leadership development at Wheaton College, was established in Three Lakes, Wisconsin. HoneyRock is not only a year-round camp for young people, but it offers a variety of leadership schools and courses for students. Nearly 3000 people utilize HoneyRock each year. Through HoneyRock the college owns nearly {{convert|800|acre|ha|1}} in Northern Wisconsin.\n\n==Activism and controversy==\n\nWheaton College has received criticism in recent years from both conservative and liberal alumni. Wheaton's acceptance of [[evolutionary biology]] in the science departments has proved controversial to some. Wheaton College was prominently featured in the 2001 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[PBS: Evolution|Evolution]]'', which showcased Wheaton professors' acceptance of [[theistic evolution]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/about/show07.html \"Evolution: Show 7: What About God?\"]. [[PBS]].</ref> On issues of religion and science, the college holds the view that religious teachings about God and modern science are not at odds.\n\nOn October 13, 2007, Wheaton College's Stanton L. Jones signed [[interfaith]] document \"Loving God and Neighbor Together: A Christian Response to A Common Word Between Us and You,\" agreeing that [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] can be at peace with each other.<ref>[http://www.acommonword.com/lib/downloads/fullpageadbold18.pdf \"Loving God and Neighbor Together: A Christian Response to A Common Word Between Us and You\"] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]).</ref>\n\nThe school's mascot was changed from the ''Crusaders'' to the ''Thunder'' in 2000, as the image of a mounted Crusader was deemed potentially offensive and reminiscent of a controversial period in Christian history. The change was noted in the national press, and some alumni objected to the change. Other suggestions for a new mascot name that were rejected included the ''Mastodons'' \u2014 a reference to [[Perry Mastodon]], which is a [[mastodon]] skeleton that was excavated nearby and is now on display on the college campus in the brand new science building. While still known as the \"Thunder\", in 2010 the mascot was officially changed to a mastodon named \"Tor Thunder\" to integrate the official and unofficial mascots.<ref>[http://www.wheaton.edu/Perry/start/entry.html Welcome to the Perry Mastodon Online<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118134812/http://www.wheaton.edu/Perry/start/entry.html |date=November 18, 2007 }}.

Wheaton's first president, [[Jonathan Blanchard (Wheaton)|Jonathan Blanchard]], was a former president of [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] in [[Galesburg, Illinois]] and a staunch abolitionist with ties to [[Oberlin College]].  Mired in financial trouble and unable to sustain the institution, the Wesleyans looked to Blanchard for new leadership.  He took on the role as president in 1860, having suggested several Congregationalist appointees to the board of trustees the previous year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bechtel|first=Paul M.|title=Wheaton College: A Heritage Remembered, 1860\u20131984|year=1984|publisher=H.

Buswell's tenure was characterized by expanding enrollment (from approximately 400 in 1925 to 1,100 in 1940), a building program, strong academic development, and a boom in the institution's reputation. It was also known for growing divisiveness over faculty scholarship and [[personality clashes]].

All of the teaching faculty in the conservatory hold doctorates. There are approximately 200 music majors in the conservatory, with a student-faculty ratio of 7:1. Music majors and liberal arts majors alike perform in the conservatory's six large ensembles: concert choir, jazz ensemble, [[Wheaton College Men's Glee Club|men's glee club]], symphonic band, symphony orchestra, and women's chorale.

The Artist Series frequently partners with Wheaton College Conservatory graduates, including the soprano Sylvia McNair and the conductor John Nelson.\n\n===Graduate school===\nThe Wheaton College Graduate School was founded in 1937 to provide further theological training and ministry skills. Both the college and graduate school are on an 80-acre campus in Wheaton, Illinois, a 45-minute train ride straight west of downtown Chicago. There are approximately 550 graduate students enrolled, with a 14:1 student/faculty ratio.\n\nThe graduate school is composed of six academic departments; Biblical and Theological Studies, Christian Formation & Ministry, Evangelism and Leadership, Intercultural Studies, Psychology, and Teaching. The Graduate School offers 14 [[Master of Arts] programs and 2 doctoral programs, a Ph.D. in Biblical & Theological Studies and a [[Psy.D]]. in [[Clinical Psychology]]. Programs in the Graduate School are accredited by the [[American Psychological Association]] and [[Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation]].\n\nFive of the masters programs provide a flexible degree option.  The Biblical Studies program is offered as a part-time, evening cohort model, Missional Church Movements and TESOL and Intercultural Studies are offered as a summers-only format, and Evangelism & Leadership the Christian Formation and Ministry \u2013 Outdoor and Adventure Ministry concentration are offered in a year-round modular format.\n\n===Off-campus study===\nWheaton gives students a number of off-campus study opportunities.\n\nThe college sponsors study-abroad programs in Asia, England, France, Germany, Israel, Latin America, and Spain, as well as a summer program in Washington, D.C. Participants in Wheaton-in-England, one of the most popular annual programs, take 2\u20133 courses in literature while studying in London and [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St. Anne's College]], Oxford.\n\nMany students also participate in the Human Needs and Global Resources program. The HNGR program matches select students with six-month [[internship]]s in the [[Third World]], including opportunities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\nWheaton also sponsors a semester-long, experiential, residential program in Chicago, called Wheaton in Chicago. In Chicago, students complete internships and take advanced interdisciplinary coursework. Founded in 1998, has enrolled students from more than 20 different majors.\n\nIn 1935, the Wheaton College Science Station was established in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]] for field instruction in the natural sciences.\n\nIn 1951, HoneyRock, the outdoor center for leadership development at Wheaton College, was established in Three Lakes, Wisconsin. HoneyRock is not only a year-round camp for young people but it offers a variety of leadership schools and courses for students. Nearly 3000 people utilize HoneyRock each year.\n\nDue to Wheaton's membership in the [[Council for Christian Colleges & Universities]], Wheaton students may also study at the [[University of Oxford]], the Los Angeles Film Studies Center, [[Excelsia College]] in Australia, and [[Xi'an Foreign Language University]] in China. The CCCU also sponsors programs in American studies, Latin American studies, Middle Eastern studies, Russian studies, and journalism.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Blanchard Hall (5978664560).jpg|thumb|Blanchard Hall houses offices for departments in the Humanities, Social Sciences as well as the offices of the President, the Provost, Vice-Presidents and Academic Affairs.]]\nWheaton's most recognizable and oldest building is [[Blanchard Hall]], a limestone building built as the main College building in 1853.  At the time, the College building was one of only two on campus, the other (called the \"boarding hall\") being a frame building at the foot of the hill crowned by the two-story building.  Jonathan Blanchard had a vision for the expansion of this structure into its present castle-like architecture. The architectural influence is, supposedly, patterned after buildings at the University of Oxford which Blanchard admired on a trip to England in 1843. After four additions (1871, 1873, 1890, 1927) the Main Building was completed in 1927. In this year, under college president J. Oliver Buswell, Jr., the Main Building was renamed Blanchard Hall, to honor Wheaton's first two presidents, Jonathan Blanchard and his son Charles Blanchard.\n\nBlanchard Hall served as a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/>\n\n===Academic===\nIn 1900 the brick \"Industrial Building\" was built.  From 1917\u201345 it housed the Wheaton Academy, and from 1945\u201360 the Graduate School. In 1960 it was renamed Buswell Hall, and in 1980 renamed Schell Hall in honor of Edward R. Schell.\n\nThe science departments were housed in Breyer ([[Chemistry]]) and Armerding ([[Biology]], [[Geology]], [[Math]], and [[Physics]]) halls until the 2010\u201311 school year when Wheaton's new Meyer Science Center was completed.  Armerding Hall was also the home to the Wheaton College Observatory (a feature of the college since the presidency of Charles Blanchard in the late-nineteenth century) which was relocated to the Meyer science Center.\n\nThe Wheaton College Conservatory of Music, housed in the Armerding Center for Music and Arts (previously in McAlister Hall and Pierce Memorial Chapel), is an internationally recognized music school and holds the distinction of being the only conservatory within an Evangelical school of higher education. The approximately 200 students within the conservatory focus on a range of fields within music including education, performance, composition, and history. Student recitals, required for graduation with a music degree, are generally held in Pierce Memorial Chapel.\n\n==Athletics==\nWheaton College teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The Thunder are a member of the [[College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin]] (CCIW). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball. Wheaton College also competes with both in Men's and Women's collegiate rowing, lacrosse and club soccer.\n\nThe men's basketball team won the first NCAA Small College National Championship in 1958, defeating Kentucky Wesleyan in the finals, 89\u201365. The Wheaton men's soccer team captured the [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA Division III Men's Soccer Championship]] in 1984 and 1997, to go with runner-up finishes in 1999, 2006 and 2014.

As a strictly oral tradition this cheer is unable to be written down for any purpose. Memorizing the cheer is known as a rite of passage for Wheaton rowers and is known for connecting current rowers with alumni.\n\n==== Captain's Flag and Oar; Golden Cox-Tool ====\nAt the transition of captains, both the Men's and Women's captains are given the first flag and oar of Wheaton Crew as a symbol of the passing of power from one generation of Wheaton oarsmen to another. The Golden Cox-Tool was introduced in 2017 as a similar relic for the transitioning of the Head Coxswain.\n\n====[[Victory in Jesus (hymn)|Victory in Jesus]]====\nThis 1939 hymn is sung at the end of every Wheaton Crew racing event following Wheaton College's affiliations as an Evangelical Christian establishment.\n\n=== Competition ===\n\nWheaton Crew competes and trains for [[Head race|Head Races]] in the fall season and 2&nbsp;km sprints in the spring. Wheaton competes in regattas including the [[Head of the Hooch]], [[Head of the Charles Regatta]] and the John Hunter Regatta on [[Lake Lanier]]'s Olympic Park and the Illinois Collegiate Rowing Invitational in [[Farmer City, Illinois]].\n\n==== Sunday Competition ====\nWheaton Crew does not compete on Sunday in agreement with Wheaton College and Wheaton College Thunder regulations.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe Gymnasium, later renamed Adams Hall, was built in 1898. It was renovated in early 2010 and currently serves as home to the [[Art]] Department.\nAlumni Gymnasium (renamed the Edward A. Coray Alumni Gymnasium in 1968, in honor of Coach [[Ed Coray]]'s long service), was built during the Edman presidency and paid for by alumni.  The cornerstone was laid at homecoming on October 11, 1941.  A copper box placed in the cornerstone contained a copy of the Wheaton Record, the Wheaton Daily Journal, a college catalog, a student directory, and a copy of the Homecoming program. Wyngarten Health Center was built in 1958, followed by Centennial Gymnasium in 1959\u201360, which was extensively renovated and expanded in 2000. It is now known as King Arena and is part of the Chrouser Sports Complex (CSC) and houses the majority of the college's athletic and fitness facilities.\n\n==Library and collections==\nThe Library, named after college trustee Robert E. Nicholas, opened in January 1952. In 1975 Buswell Memorial Library, named for the college's third president J. Oliver Buswell, Jr., was built adjacent to the Nicholas Library and an interior corridor linked the two, creating the college's main library. The building also contains the Peter Stam Music Library, located downstairs and named in honor of the Conservatory of Music's first head, Peter Stam. Buswell Memorial Library's physical collections contain over one million items, making Buswell the largest library collection of liberal-arts colleges in the state of Illinois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.wheaton.edu/welcome|title=Welcome New Students! - Buswell Library|access-date=July 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804042938/http://library.wheaton.edu/welcome|archive-date=August 4, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nIn September 2001, the [[Marion E. Wade Center]], formerly housed in Buswell Library, moved to its new purpose-built home. Established in 1965 by professor of English Clyde S. Kilby, the Wade Center is an extensive research library and museum of the books and papers of seven British writers: [[C. S. Lewis]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Owen Barfield]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], [[George MacDonald]], and [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]].  The Wade Center has memorabilia of the [[Inklings]], including C. S. Lewis' writing desk and a [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|wardrobe]] from his childhood home constructed by his grandfather widely thought to have inspired the Chronicles of Narnia series (although [[Westmont College]] also owns a wardrobe that once belonged to Lewis), [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]]'s bookcases, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s writing desk where he wrote the entirety of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and worked on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and [[Pauline Baynes]]'s original map of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]].<ref>[http://www.wheaton.edu/learnres/wade/ \"Marion E.

It was built in memory of over 1,600 former students and graduates who served in [[World War II]], and in honor of those 39 who gave their lives. It housed the Student Union Caf\u00e9, nicknamed \"the Stupe\" (which has since been moved to the Beamer Center). An early pamphlet described the new building and listed some of the rules for its use, such as No Rook Playing and No Playing of Boogie-Woogie, Jazz, or Otherwise Abusing the Piano. The MSC was remodeled during the Fall semester of 2007 for academic use, and is now home to the Business Economics department, the Political Science and International Relations department, and the Wheaton College Center for Faith, Politics and Economics.\n\nThe MSC was remodeled according to the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The MSC was the first building renovated according to these standards and sets higher standards than existing EPA standards. Many of the materials that were used were post-consumer and over 20% of the materials were manufactured within a {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of the College.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327214151/http://www.wheaton.edu/Leed/ Wheaton College, Wheaton Illinois: LEED Certification] The MSC remodeling is part of the current capital campaign, The Promise of Wheaton.\n\nThe Dining Hall (now the \"Student Services Building\") opened January 4, 1953. Today it houses Student Development, Undergraduate Admissions, and the College Bookstore.\n\nJenks Hall is home to the Arena Theater, which was established in the Fall of 1974 and has staged over 100 full length productions.\n\n[[File:Student Recreation Center.jpg|thumb|The Chrouser Sports Complex (CSC) features an 8,000 square foot weight room, three student recreational gyms, an elevated jogging track, a climbing wall, \"smart\" classrooms and conference rooms, and a new physiology lab.]]\nIn the fall of 2004, the [[Todd Beamer|Todd M. Beamer]] Student Center was completed. Beamer, a Wheaton alumnus, was part of a small group of passengers who stormed hijackers on [[United Flight 93]], bringing down the plane in rural Pennsylvania during the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], and preventing it from reaching its target. The building that bears his name was a $20+ million dollar project commissioned in order to meet the needs of the growing college community. Along with its spacious and sleek modern design, the Beamer Center features a convenience store known as the \"C-Store\", the \"Stupe\" (the name derives from students shortening the previous nickname for the campus Student Union, \"Stupid Onion\", which in turn is a jocular mispronunciation of Student Union), a bakery caf\u00e9 named \"Sam's\" (named after the former Vice President of Student Development Sam Shellhammer, who retired following the 2007\u201308 school year after serving Wheaton's campus community for thirty years), several reading rooms and lounges, a recreation/game room, a prayer chapel, an expanded college post office, the offices for several organizations and departments, and several other event rooms. In the fall of 2006, strong rain storms created a flood that destroyed the lower level of the Beamer Center. Wheaton College has since restored the flood-damaged building.\n\nThe official student newspaper at Wheaton College is the ''Wheaton Record'',<ref>[http://www.wheaton.edu/sao/record/ \"Wheaton Record\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008021503/http://www.wheaton.edu/sao/Record/ |date=October 8, 2007 }}. Wheaton College.</ref> a weekly publication with a circulation of 3400, in existence since 1876. ''The Record'' is produced by students, published by the college, and distributed each Friday after chapel free of charge. ''The Record'' was the recipient of the 2006 John David Reed General Excellence Award and has received 13 other awards from the Illinois College Press Association, of which it is a member. ''The Record'' is also a member of the Associated Collegiate Press.\n\nIn addition, Wheaton College has many organizations on campus that range from helping the poor and needy in Chicago to the arts and improvisation.\n\nJuniors and seniors are also eligible to live in one of thirteen campus houses, apartments (five complexes), or off-campus.\n\n===Spirituality===\nThe chapel, on the corner of Washington and Franklin streets, was dedicated on November 15, 1925. The building was also used by the college for commencements and other important assemblies. In 1936\u201337, it was renamed the Orlinda Childs Pierce Memorial Chapel. Neighboring McAlister Hall is home to the Conservatory of Music and houses conservatory faculty offices, several music classrooms, and the practice rooms used daily by conservatory students.\n\n[[College Church]], across Washington Street from the college, is not formally associated with the college, although it has long been informally closely associated with the college.<ref name=\"Schnurr\">Stephen J.

Raymond Edman, fourth president of the college. Edman died in 1967 while speaking in chapel.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} He was preaching on being in the presence of the King, and the recording is available in the Wheaton chapel archives. This chapel/auditorium is also used for many events of Wheaton's performing arts programs. In 2000, an entirely handcrafted organ made by the Casavant Organ Company of Quebec, Canada, was installed.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Wheatonbgc.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Billy Graham Center]]\nThe building housing the [[Billy Graham]] Center (BGC), named after one of the college's most well-known graduates, opened in September 1980. The [[Billy Graham Center]] itself, as the repository of the evangelist's corporate records, had existed since 1974.\n\nThe BGC houses an auditorium, classrooms and several evangelism institutes, a museum of the history of evangelism, the college's Archives and Special Collections, and the Wheaton College Graduate School. It also housed the school radio station, [[WAIW|WETN 88.1 FM]], until its sale in February 2017.\n\nThe Women's Building, renamed Williston Hall in 1930\u201331 (in honor of longtime Blanchard friend and donor J. P. Williston), was built in 1895. Its construction required the college to borrow $6,000. After seventy-eight years of housing only women, Williston Hall is now a coed dormitory for sophomore students. It opened to men starting in the fall semester of 2009 with the dream that it would become a creative hotspot on campus.\n\nThe President's House, or Westgate, formerly owned by college trustee John M. Oury, was presented to President Buswell on the tenth anniversary of his inauguration, April 23, 1936. This served as the home of three of Wheaton's subsequent presidents. It now houses the Office of Alumni Relations.\n\nIn 1951, HoneyRock, the outdoor center for leadership development at Wheaton College, was established in Three Lakes, Wisconsin. HoneyRock is not only a year-round camp for young people, but it offers a variety of leadership schools and courses for students. Nearly 3000 people utilize HoneyRock each year. Through HoneyRock the college owns nearly {{convert|800|acre|ha|1}} in Northern Wisconsin.\n\n==Activism and controversy==\n\nWheaton College has received criticism in recent years from both conservative and liberal alumni. Wheaton's acceptance of [[evolutionary biology]] in the science departments has proved controversial to some. Wheaton College was prominently featured in the 2001 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[PBS: Evolution|Evolution]]'', which showcased Wheaton professors' acceptance of [[theistic evolution]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/about/show07.html \"Evolution: Show 7: What About God?\"]. [[PBS]].</ref> On issues of religion and science, the college holds the view that religious teachings about God and modern science are not at odds.\n\nOn October 13, 2007, Wheaton College's Stanton L. Jones signed [[interfaith]] document \"Loving God and Neighbor Together: A Christian Response to A Common Word Between Us and You,\" agreeing that [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] can be at peace with each other.<ref>[http://www.acommonword.com/lib/downloads/fullpageadbold18.pdf \"Loving God and Neighbor Together: A Christian Response to A Common Word Between Us and You\"] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]).</ref>\n\nThe school's mascot was changed from the ''Crusaders'' to the ''Thunder'' in 2000, as the image of a mounted Crusader was deemed potentially offensive and reminiscent of a controversial period in Christian history. The change was noted in the national press, and some alumni objected to the change. Other suggestions for a new mascot name that were rejected included the ''Mastodons'' \u2014 a reference to [[Perry Mastodon]], which is a [[mastodon]] skeleton that was excavated nearby and is now on display on the college campus in the brand new science building. While still known as the \"Thunder\", in 2010 the mascot was officially changed to a mastodon named \"Tor Thunder\" to integrate the official and unofficial mascots.<ref>[http://www.wheaton.edu/Perry/start/entry.html Welcome to the Perry Mastodon Online<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118134812/http://www.wheaton.edu/Perry/start/entry.html |date=November 18, 2007 }}.
