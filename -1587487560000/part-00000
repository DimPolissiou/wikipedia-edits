It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Mike Colter]] stars as Cage, reprising his role from the series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''. He is joined by principal cast members [[Mahershala Ali]], [[Simone Missick]], [[Theo Rossi]], [[Erik LaRay Harvey]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Alfre Woodard]]. ''Luke Cage'' entered development in late 2013, and Colter was cast, to appear in ''Jessica Jones'' and star in ''Luke Cage'', in December 2014. Production took place in New York City from September 2015 to March 2016, with the season exploring race and politics while looking to replicate the atmosphere and culture of Harlem. Coker especially emphasized the use of music: [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] composed a \"90s hip-hop\" score; various artists give onscreen performances in the fictional nightclub Harlem's Paradise throughout the season; and each episode is named after a [[Gang Starr]] song. Visual effects, including for the depiction of Cage's abilities, were provided by FuseFX.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in Harlem on September 28, 2016, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on September 30 to an estimated high viewership\u2014it was believed to become the fourth most-viewed season on Netflix within 30 days of its release\u2014and positive reviews, particularly for the first 7 episodes. Critics praised the cast, especially the performances of Ali and Woodard, as well as the music and general style. Its pacing and some writing were viewed as some of the season's shortcomings. The series' approach to racial issues was discussed by many commentators. The season won several awards, including a [[69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]].

Cage spends one night as a bartender for Stokes, filling in for Dante, who calls in sick. Dante is actually attacking an arms deal between Stokes' men and gang leader Domingo Colon with his friends Shameek and Wilfredo \"Chico\" Diaz. Dante panics and is killed by Shameek, who escapes with Chico and the money. [[NYPD]] detectives [[Misty Knight]] and [[Rafael Scarfe]] investigate, and impound the [[Justin Hammer|Hammer Industries]] weapons that Stokes was selling.

Knight and Scarfe visit the barbershop looking for Chico, but Pop keeps his location secret, and instead sends Cage to offer a [[wikt:parlay|parlay]] to Cottonmouth. The gangster agrees due to growing up on the streets with Chico's father and Pop, but his right-hand man Tone is tipped off to Chico's location by [[Turk Barrett]]. Tone shoots up the barbershop, injuring Chico and killing Pop. Cottonmouth later throws Tone to his death from the roof of the nightclub, and mourns for Pop.

Lucas and Connors plan to expose Rackham's activities, but he learns of this (after torturing Squabbles to death) and has Lucas brutally beaten. Connors asks Dr. [[Noah Burstein]], a scientist conducting illegal experimental procedures on the inmates in exchange for reduced sentences, to try and save Lucas with a procedure that causes rapid healing.

Cage fights back, helping defend the citizens and return their property. Cage confronts Stokes to demand that he stop this, and Shades recognizes him as Carl Lucas. Shades reveals to Stokes a new type of weapon, the Judas bullet, built from alien metal and based on a prototype stolen from Hammer Industries, that could kill Cage. With Stokes unable to afford it, Diamondback will use it to kill Cage himself in exchange for control of Harlem. Stokes instead decides to steal the weapons from the failed deal with Colon and sell them to get the money to buy the Judas bullets. Scarfe takes the weapons from police evidence, but does not deliver them to Stokes.

The pair discuss his abilities as they walk to the barbershop, where they find Scarfe. Claire treats his injuries. Knight is teamed with Lieutenant Perez, who is also on Stokes' payroll and ordered to kill Scarfe. Knight deduces this, and tricks Perez into implicating himself before arresting him. Cage retrieves an incriminating ledger from Scarfe's apartment, but Knight sees him and he, Claire, and Scarfe go on the run. They are on their way to [[1 Police Plaza]] to turn over Scarfe and the evidence when they are ambushed by mercenaries working for Stokes. Cage fends them off, but Scarfe dies from his injuries.

Stokes reminisces about growing up with Dillard and their grandmother, mobster Mama Mabel. Stokes' musical talents were encouraged by his uncle Pete, whom Mabel later forced Stokes to kill after learning Pete had made side dealings with her rivals and had molested Dillard. Audrey stands down following the corruption at her precinct, and is replaced with Inspector Priscilla Ridley. After talking with Ridley, Knight begins to question Cage when he returns the stolen weapons (after taking them from Colon). Dillard is forced to resign from the council, leading to an argument with Stokes in which he insinuates that she liked being abused by Pete.

They take refuge in a women's clinic, where Claire examines Cage and realizes that they cannot get the Judas bullet shrapnel out of him due to his generally impenetrable skin. Candace, a waitress and hostess at Stokes' club, tells the police that it was Cage who killed Stokes, making Knight suspicious of Dillard. Knight calls Cage and informs him of the accusation, while another officer triangulates his location. She arrives at the clinic, attempting to arrest him, but they are attacked by Diamondback again. Cage recognizes him as his childhood friend Willis Stryker, who now blames Cage for leaving him to \"rot\", before escaping. Dillard secretly pays Candace for testifying against Cage. In custody, Claire insists that Cage is innocent, angering Knight to the point that she brutally assaults Claire. Ridley intervenes and has Claire released.

Dillard organizes a meeting with the other local crime bosses, hoping to sell Stokes' criminal resources and legitimize her family name. They are interrupted by Stryker, who kills all the bosses but Dillard and Colon. In an attempt to save herself, Dillard shows the dashcam footage to Stryker and convinces him to sell Judas bullets to the police as a means of defending themselves from Cage. Claire convinces Cage to get Burstein's help, and they find the doctor living in hiding.

Cage threatens Burstein to never replicate the accident, and takes all the data with him. Burstein secretly has a copy of the files. Claire and Cage go to his home in [[Savannah, Georgia]], where his memories of his father confirm that Stryker is telling the truth. Stryker meanwhile kills a policeman, and frames Cage. Angered, other police officers become more aggressive in their search for Cage, with one beating a teenage boy. Dillard holds a rally to support the boy, where she blames Cage for the behavior and promotes arming the police against him. Her political rival Damon Boone tells her that he knows the truth.

Candace meets Knight and says that she will testify against Dillard if Knight protects her. Knight takes her to Soledad's. Alvarez approaches Dillard and suggests they get Cage on their side by giving him the evidence he needs to clear his name, and then use him to defeat Stryker (with the hope that they kill each other).

Coker chose the Gang Starr songs ahead of his first pitch meeting with Marvel Television head [[Jeph Loeb]], to help organize his planned story arcs.<ref name=\"GangStarrTitles\" /> He chose the songs based on their titles only, so each episode's events does not necessarily reflect the respective song's lyrics.<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" />\n\nLoeb described the season as \"a fugitive story\",<ref name=\"LoebJan2016\" /> and \"a story of redemption\",<ref name=\"LoebSDCC2016\" /> and said it was about Luke Cage's \"story and where he came from and, most importantly, where he's going\" after telling an \"early part of the middle\" of his story on ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015JJ\" /> Colter noted that the series uses flashbacks to tell elements of the story like the previous Marvel Netflix shows.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Coker described the series as \"a powerful fusion of dark drama, hip-hop, and classic superhero action\" and ''The Wire'' of Marvel Television.<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> More specifically, Coker felt the season was a hip-hop [[Western (genre)#Contemporary Western|Western]], comparing it to [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' of films, with Cage the [[Man with No Name]] coming to a town, Harlem, where he is convinced to fight injustice. Coker further compared the characters Cottonmouth and Misty Knight to the resident villain and local law enforcement, respectively, of the Western genre, and described the Harlem's Paradise nightclub as the town's [[Western saloon|saloon]].<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" />\n\nThe season picks up \"a few months\" after ''Jessica Jones'',<ref name=\"ColterSetting\" /> with Luke Cage trying to stay off the radar.<ref name=\"ColterSetting\" /> The end of the second episode \"get[s] this series into forward action mode [by making Cage] see that he couldn't just sit back and do nothing.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2016TVLine\" /> Coker said the arc for Cage in the season was 'hero', and felt this was a more natural way of introducing the character than telling a traditional [[origin story]] as other Marvel properties have done. This also differentiated the show from the rest of the MCU. Coker had plotted the story of the first four episodes before the show's writers room began work, but had initially done so over two or three episodes, with the event at the end of the second episode originally taking place at the end of the first. Loeb and Marvel's Karim Zreik told Coker to slow the pace of the show down, which led to an approach that Coker compared to ''[[Unforgiven]].''<ref name=\"DeadlinePremiere\" /> Set in Harlem, rather than the Hell's Kitchen of the previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix series]], Colter described the season as \"a completely different world\".<ref name=\"ColterSetting\" /> Marvel Comics' [[editor-in-chief]] [[Joe Quesada]] said that unlike the fictionalized version of Hell's Kitchen depicted in ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', which was more inline with how it was when the comics were first written, the Harlem of ''Luke Cage'' represents the Harlem of \"today\", and is truer to the real-life modern New York.<ref name=\"QuesadaSDCC2016\" /> However, Colter admitted that the show's version of Harlem \"does resemble Harlem of maybe ten years ago.\"<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" /> Coker said that Harlem was a world for the series, but also about legacy. He wanted to replicate the experience of walking through Harlem and hearing different music coming from cars driving past and open windows, which he felt was unique to the neighborhood.<ref name=\"DeadlinePremiere\" /> Coker further described the Harlem's Paradise nightclub as the series' [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]],<ref name=\"/FilmTCA2016\" /> and wanted it to \"invoke the history of Harlem ... it's crime, politics, music, really the whole cornucopia of the black creative existence in one place.\"<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" />\n\nCage is seen wearing a black hoodie throughout the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to [[Trayvon Martin]] and Black Lives Matter. Colter said it was meant to invoke \"the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn't necessarily a threat. He might just be a hero.\"<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> The series also features a political campaign with the slogan \"Keep Harlem Black\", \"in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem's cultural history.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, \"how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That's one of the things I wanted to explore on the show\". He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on \"identity\", which he saw as a common element in all black art.<ref name=\"DeadlinePremiere\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes Colter as Cage;<ref name=\"Colter\" /> [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]];<ref name=\"Ali\" /><ref name=\"Ali2\" /> [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight]];<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> [[Theo Rossi]] as [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]];<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]],<ref name=\"Harvey\" /><ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> whose involvement was not officially announced by Marvel prior to the season's release, as he agreed not to do any publicity for the show to not \"ruin the twist\" of Stryker being the season's main villain;<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], reprising her role from ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' and ''Jessica Jones'';<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> and [[Alfre Woodard]] as [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]].<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> \n\nIn September 2015, [[Frank Whaley]] was cast as [[Rafael Scarfe]].<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Whaley\" /> [[Sean Ringgold]] and [[Karen Pittman]] were revealed to be involved in the series in March 2016,<ref name=\"WrapParty\" /> playing Sugar and Priscilla Ridley, respectively.<ref name=\"IWEE\" /> Also recurring throughout the season are [[Ron Cephas Jones]] as Bobby Fish,<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> [[Jacob Vargas]] as Domingo Colon,<ref name=\"Vargas\" /> Darius Kaleb as Lonnie Wilson,<ref name=\"Kaleb\" /> Jade Wu as Connie Lin,<ref name=\"Lins\" /> Deborah Ayorinde as Candace Miller,<ref name=\"SharpMagazine\" /> Justin Swain as Mark Bailey,<ref name=\"Swain\" /><ref name=\"SwainS2\" /> Jaiden Kaine as Zip,<ref name=\"IWEE\" /> [[Dawn-Lyen Gardner]] as [[Megan McLaren]],<ref name=\"DoGEE101\" /> Jeremiah Richard Craft as [[David Griffith (comics)|D.W.

Like the main characters of those shows, Cage has his own wardrobe evolution throughout the season after his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket was introduced in ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> The series opted to depict Cage in a Trayvon Martin-inspired hoodie, but introduces the character's classic costume for a brief flashback. Colter said that the costume, designed in the blacksploitation era, \"is not made for serious moments\", but the series was able to poke fun at it in the brief scene.<ref name=\"FlashbackFilming\" /> In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing, Maslansky and Coker considered having him wear gold clothing, but thought that would be too on the nose and impractical for someone trying not to draw attention. Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups.<ref name=\"MaslanskyVogue\" /> In contrast to Cage's hoodie, with jeans and T-shirts, many of the series' villains wear well-tailored suits. Stokes does this because he wants to present himself as \"a wealthy, successful businessman\", and wears a lot of suits from [[Dolce & Gabbana]] and [[Ermenegildo Zegna|Zegna]]. One of his suits for the show was custom made.<ref name=\"MaslanskyE\" /> To pay homage to the comics, Maslansky dressed Ali in a green suit for his introduction, using a subtle shade of green to avoid being flamboyant. The character subsequently is always wearing something green, like emerald earrings for one costume. The designer noted that many of these elements would not be noticed by the audience, but they made a difference to Ali when he was getting into character.<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbes\" /> For the character Shades, brands such as [[Hugo Boss]], [[Helmut Lang (fashion brand)|Helmut Lang]], [[Prada]], and [[Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A.|Ferragamo]] were used \"because he wasn't trying to hide who he was\",<ref name=\"MaslanskyE\" /> while Misty Knight, in her final shot of the season, is shown wearing a version of her own iconic comic costume.<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbes\" /> That look includes leather pants and an \"interesting cold-shoulder\"-shaped top; a cream-colored top that fit that shape was found and dyed red for the scene.<ref name=\"MaslanskyInverse\" />\n\nThe sets were designed and dressed to consist of strong colors that could be emphasized by the series' cinematography, to help differentiate the show from the noir look and tone of ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"BilleterMP\" /> The nightclub Harlem's Paradise was intended to invoke the real-life Harlem nightclubs the [[Cotton Club]] and the [[Lenox Lounge]],<ref name=\"CokerColterSDCCLAT\" /><ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> with production designer Loren Weeks, also returning from that capacity on ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', taking specific inspiration from [[The Apollo]] and [[Smalls Paradise]]. Because of the series' filming schedule and Coker's desire to film live musical performances in the club, it was decided that filming in an actual nightclub would be unrealistic. A set was built for the location, with Weeks using an [[Art Deco]] style to give the club \"a very distinctive look, and giving it an historical anchor\", and indicate that it had been a successful club around the 1920s and 1930s and was now being refurbished as part of Stokes and Dillard's \"New Harlem Renaissance\". Weeks felt the building could be a metaphor for the political undercurrents of the series. Set decorator Alison Froling, whom Weeks worked with on the other Marvel Netflix series, furbished the Harlem's Paradise set with contemporary furniture, finishes, and lighting fixtures to contrast the older architectural design. The lounge side of the club features two murals by [[Archibald Motley|Archibald J. Motley]], an artist from the original Harlem Renaissance. Coker insisted that the set for Pop's Barbershop be at street level, to connect it \"both visually and geographically\" with the Harlem street. For budget reasons, dressing an actual location as the barbershop was not going to work, but building a set to be at street level was also problematic since they would not be able to show people or cars driving past the window that you would see on an actual street. It was decided that a real location be found that is below street level so that scenes could be filmed on the street there, but would not have to match inside scenes filmed on the set because of the obstructed view of the street. To emphasize this, the set was built even lower than the actual store and a fake wall was added to the location.<ref name=\"WeeksSets\" /> Coker instructed the series' prop master to carefully choose a selection of books to appear in Cage's bedroom, including [[Ralph Ellison]]'s ''[[Invisible Man]]''.<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Malcolm X Boulevard, Harlem, New York.jpg|thumb|left|Filming took place on location in Harlem, which was important for showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker to accurately depict the neighborhood.]]\nMarvel announced in February 2014 that the series would be filmed in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> with Quesada stating in April that the show would be filming on location in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> In July 2015, Loeb stated that ''Luke Cage'' was prepping to begin filming,<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> and by September 2015, production had begun under the [[working title]] ''Tiara''.<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /><ref name=\"FilmingBegins2\" /> Filming concluded in March 2016.<ref name=\"WrapParty\" />\n\nFilming took place in Harlem, including [[Lenox Avenue]] and areas where ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'' was shot,<ref name=\"CokerColterSDCCLAT\" /><ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> the Mount Olivet Baptist Church, [[St. Nicholas Park]], [[Jackie Robinson]] Park, [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]], and the [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)#125th Street viaduct|Riverside Drive viaduct]];<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]],<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> including at the [[United Palace]];<ref name=\"EW108Recap\" /> Cortlandt Alley in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]];<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> in areas of [[Queens]] for when Cage escapes Seagate Prison and puts on the classic Power Man costume;<ref name=\"FlashbackFilming\" /> the [[Roosevelt Island]] steam plant and [[Queens Detention Facility]] for interiors of Seagate;<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /><ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" /> the [[Music Hall of Williamsburg]] for the exterior of Harlem's Paradise; the former Fulton Correctional Facility in [[The Bronx]] for the Crispus Attucks Complex; and the [[Long Island City]] portion of [[Newtown Creek]].<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> It was important to Coker for the series to film in Harlem, \"the only place in the city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets\".<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in [[Greenwich Village]], which would have been much easier for the production, but Coker said \"the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn't want us to talk about Harlem and then not film\" there.<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" /> Soundstage filming took place at Broadway Stages in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]. For the church that Cage and Temple visit in [[Savannah, Georgia]], an abandoned church in The Bronx was found that was being sold, and the production was able to \"graffiti up and sort of ruin\" it. They also had to spend two days carting snow from the site before filming, after a recent blizzard.<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" />\n\nManuel Billeter served as director of photography for the series, after doing the same for ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" /> He worked with director [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]] to establish the look of the show in the first two episodes, with Coker hiring McGuigan based on his direction of the ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' episode \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\". Coker was delighted to learn how little CGI McGuigan used to craft the visuals of that episode, and wanted the same approach for ''Luke Cage'', \"just old school camera stuff. He brought a very analogue perspective, analogue feel to the show.\" McGuigan, Coker explained, directed \"every scene [as] long takes, from multiple takes over and over again. We would run an entire eight-page scene almost like a play, so when it comes together it's seamless.\"<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> McGuigan was inspired by the works of photographers [[Gordon Parks]], [[Tony Ray-Jones]], and Jack Garofalo.<ref name=\"McGuiganInfluences\" /> Billeter looked to differentiate the look of ''Luke Cage'' from ''Jessica Jones'', using modified gels on lights, and saturating and warming colors in color correction to give Harlem a more glowing look.<ref name=\"BilleterMP\" /> Coker noted that the series' has a color scheme of yellow, brown, amber, and gold, in contrast to the violet tint Billeter gave ''Jessica Jones'' to reflect that series' villain, the Purple Man.<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> The series was shot on Netflix's standard [[4K resolution|4K]] cameras, with Billeter pairing them with [[Panavision]] Primo lenses that were \"custom treated with a reflective coating in between the glass elements in the interior of the lens, causing more flares and bringing down the contrast in addition to very slightly de-focusing them\" in order to \"add something magic, less controlled and more cinematic\". Billeter filmed Colter with a lot of low angles to make him look \"even more heroic\", and kept the camera close to him with Harlem in the background so that Cage \"is always the dominant force in his shots, but he also remains a part of the terrain. The shots aren't of him alone; they\u2019re of him in his home.\"<ref name=\"BilleterMP\" />\n\nCage's fight style in the series was called \"smack-fu\" by Coker, referring to the way he tried not to punch anybody since that would probably kill them with his super strength.<ref name=\"103Fight\" /> To film the effect of bullets bouncing off of Cage, remote controlled devices were attached to Colter and operated by somebody behind the cameras. The devices could burn his skin if not attached properly, and Colter almost lost hearing in one ear after forgetting to insert the required ear pieces.<ref name=\"WPBTS\" /> The third episode begins with a couch coming out of the window of the fictional [[Crispus Attucks]] complex in Harlem. This was a tease of a large fight scene, the series' version of the 'superhero hallway fight' made famous in ''Daredevil.''<ref name=\"103Fight\" /> Filming for the fight was influenced by \"[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]\u2019s invading the police station in ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]''\",<ref name=\"CokerS2IdeasSep2016\" /> and was one of the toughest sequences for the crew to shoot; it took a 14-hour day, and Colter attributed the successful completion of the sequence, including the couch shot, to director [[Guillermo Navarro]].<ref name=\"103Fight\" /> Colter also called the fourth episode particularly difficult to film, taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot. The episode was written by executive producer Charles Murray, who looked to organically transition the character's origin story from the original comics into the modern world of the series for the episode. This involved flashbacks with Colter in makeup and different costumes.<ref name=\"OriginFilming\" />\n\nScenes shot at the United Palace theater created new challenges for the series' stunt team due to not being able to drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to find other ways to weigh down the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles.<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" /> For the explosion at the restaurant \"Genghis Connie's\", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building.<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" /><ref name=\"VarietyFX\" /> A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that \"feels\" similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere.<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" /> Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said that the crew members working on each of the shows wanted them all to feel like they are set in the same city, but also for the world of each character to be distinct, and for this series they embraced Harlem \"for exactly what it is\" to differentiate the \"visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... the color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood\u2026 I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place\".<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" />\n\nThe series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'' as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over [[Lavalier microphone|lavaliers]] to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in \"naturalistic sound\". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded \"incredible on the boom\". Anderson also talked about ''Luke Cage'' adding a new layer of sound that the other series did not\u2014music. The captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later, and live performances in Harlem's Paradise had to be recorded for which Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]''.<ref name=\"Sound\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFuseFX provided 867 visual effects shots for the season, with a team of 15 to 20 members under FuseFX New York's production head and senior visual effects supervisor Greg Anderson. Anderson explained that the series' challenging schedule was made easier by the company's catalog of previously used digital assets and effect elements that can be reused, or partially reused, where appropriate in new projects. Several effects shots were created to show Cage's abilities, including a slow motion shot of a thug's fist collapsing into a compound fracture while punching Cage in the face. A standout effects sequence for the season was when Stokes fires a missile at a building, which took FuseFX 130 days to complete. It involved creating a CG building and integrating it into footage of a real New York City block, matching up with different camera angles and sources of light throughout the sequence. The effects team then had to digitally destroy the building, and create \"a complex array of fireballs and falling debris\".<ref name=\"VarietyFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{further|Luke Cage (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nIn April 2016, Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the series' score,<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> describing it as \"a confluence of multiple genres, a bit of ['90s] hip-hop, soul, psychedelic rock and classical\".<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /><ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Younge and Muhammad composed the score as if they were creating 13 albums, one for each episode,<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusicTVGuide\" /> with the music inspired by [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Ennio Morricone]], and Muhammad's group [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> The duo composed around twenty minutes of music for each episode, composing the entire season's score in nine months.<ref name=\"LCSpin\" /> Younge and Muhammad were encouraged to \"push\" the sound of the score as far as they could, and were allowed the use of a full, 30-piece orchestra for recording.<ref name=\"LCVulture\" /> They also arranged an original rap single, \"[[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\", which features [[Method Man]] (who performs it in the show).<ref name=\"BulletproofLove\" />\n\nSongs from [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"/FilmTCA2016\" /> [[John Lee Hooker]] (\"[[It Serves You Right to Suffer]]\" and \"I'm Bad Like Jesse James\"),<ref name=\"/FilmTCA2016\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE105\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE107\" /> [[Dusty Springfield]] (\"[[Son of a Preacher Man]]\"),<ref name=\"DoGEE111\" /> and Wu-Tang Clan (\"Bring da Ruckus\") are used in the season.<ref name=\"DoGEE103\" /><ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> It also features onscreen performances by various artists as the live performances in the Harlem's Paradise nightclub, which Coker wanted to use to help capture the vibe of the neighborhood.<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Coker wanted Prince to perform at the nightclub for the season finale, before his death in April 2016. The \"swear jar\" that appears in the season was designed by Coker in hopes of convincing the artist to make the cameo appearance, as he was known to have a \"swear jar\" himself since he was a devout [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]]. The role was ultimately filled by [[Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings]], which Coker said was \"the better choice\" because \"that sequence is about Mariah being crowned.\"<ref name=\"CokerPrince\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released on October 7, digitally and pressed on yellow vinyl by Mondo.<ref name=\"LiveScore\" /><ref name=\"VinylRelease\" />\n\nCoker said that \"one of the things that's really the cornerstone of 90s hip-hop is sampling, so we have a lot of influences that we wear openly\", which he compared to the style of [[Quentin Tarantino]]. He continued, \"I think what makes it feel new is the fact that we\u2019re showing you can be both. We\u2019re showing that you can do Ralph Ellison at the same times as you\u2019re doing [[Chester Himes]].\" Coker was as specific with his choices of music in the season as \"[[Martin Scorsese]] is with the rock 'n' roll references like in ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'' or in ''[[Goodfellas]]''\", rather than just adding hip-hop music for the sake of it. He highlighted the use of \"I'm Bad Like Jesse James\" in the seventh episode, which he had been trying to use in something for 20 years, that \"builds up and coincides with the explosion that happens on screen and it's so subtle. That's the kind of stuff I geek out over.\"<ref name=\"DeadlinePremiere\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nPart of the series takes place simultaneously with the events of the second season of ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"LCDDS2\" /> Throughout the season, the villains use Hammer Industries weapons to counter Cage's abilities. [[Justin Hammer]] and his company were introduced in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', and Hammer was last seen incarcerated in Seagate Prison in the [[Marvel One-Shot]] ''[[All Hail the King]]''; Seagate is depicted in ''Luke Cage'', as the prison where Carl Lucas was sent and where there are rumored \"millionaires hidden in the basement\".<ref name=\"DoGEE101\" /><ref name=\"JoBloEp1MCU\" /><ref name=\"SREE\" /> The series references the events of ''The Avengers'' and members of that team,<ref name=\"TVGuideEE\" /><ref name=\"JoBloEp1MCU\" /> as well as the future Defenders and [[The Defenders (miniseries)|their own series]].<ref name=\"TVGuideEE\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE110\" /> Specific mentions of the latter include Madame Gao's operations in ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"DoGEE109\" /> the widely known villains [[Wilson Fisk]] and [[Punisher|Frank Castle]],<ref name=\"TVGuideEE\" /> and a flier for [[Colleen Wing]]'s martial arts class, to then be introduced in ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]''.<ref name=\"DoGEE113\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''Luke Cage'' was released on September 30, 2016,<ref name=\"PremiereDate\" /> on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix worldwide,<ref name=\"Coker\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The 13 hour-long episodes were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been successful for other Netflix series.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" />\n\n===Marketing=== \nThe first trailer for the series debuted exclusively on Netflix, autoplaying after the final episode of the second season of ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"TrailerRelease\" /> In July 2016, Colter, Woodard, Ali, Rossi, Missick, Whaley, and Coker appeared at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] to promote the series and debut footage.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"SDCC20162\" /> At the end of August, Netflix released the first part of the \"Street Level Hero\" digital social video series. The series looked to \"blend fiction with history by taking audiences behind the curtain on the themes that give the show its street-level authenticity and cultural relevance.\" The first part was centered on the music of the series, with commentary from Coker, Colter, composers Younge and Muhammad, [[ASAP Ferg|A$AP Ferg]] and [[Method Man]].<ref name=\"StreetLevelHeroMusic\" /> At the end of September, the second part of the \"Street Level Hero\" series was released, focusing on Harlem, with commentary from Coker, Colter, A$AP Ferg, Method Man, and Harlem style icon [[Dapper Dan (designer)|Dapper Dan]].<ref name=\"StreetLevelHeroHarlem\" /> On September 28, 2016, a premiere for the series was held at the [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] [[Magic Johnson Theatres|Magic Johnson]] in Harlem.<ref name=\"HarlemPremiere\" /><ref name=\"HarlemPremiere2\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on November 27, 2017,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 6, 2017,<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on December 12, 2017.<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> In Region A, the season featured packaging designed by Quesada, and the bonus feature \"Offstage at Harlem's Paradise\", a roundtable discussion with Colter, Woodard, Rossi, and Missick discussing their time during filming on the season.<ref name=\"MarvelBluRay\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, [[Symphony Technology Group]] compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, ''Luke Cage'' opened stronger initially than the Netflix original series ''[[Making a Murderer]]'' and ''[[Stranger Things]]'', but its performance over its first month fell short of both, comparatively. Symphony estimated that 6.34% of viewers age 18\u201349 were watching ''Luke Cage'' in an average minute in the first 32 days following its release, with ''Making a Murderer'' and ''Stranger Things'' seeing 9.1% and 9.81% of viewers, respectively.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers\" /> Symphony also estimated that 3.388&nbsp;million viewers age 18\u201349 were watching an episode of ''Luke Cage'' over the average minute in its first weekend of release.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers2\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fourth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 27% of the viewers that the second season of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpstart. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 8.03/10 based on 71 reviews.

Keene specifically praised Colter.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Mike Cecchini of [[Den of Geek]] spoke positively of the season, particularly the cast, atmosphere, and \"willingness to go places that other Marvel Studios productions can't.\" He found Simone Missick to be the standout performer, praised the soundtrack which has \"the most active role in a superhero production since ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''\", and was equally impressed with the original score by Younge and Muhammad. However, Cecchini felt the season repeated some issues from previous Marvel Netflix series, such as the use of archetypes and monologues.<ref name=\"DenofGeekReview\" />\n\n''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''{{'s}} Dominic Patten called ''Luke Cage'' \"one of the most socially relevant and smartest shows on the small screen you will see this year... the series reaches both back and forward into the culture of heroes and an America looking for a true game-changer.\"<ref name=\"DeadlineReview\" /> David Milner for [[Digital Spy]] was also positive about the season's exploration of African-American history, but felt Ali's Cottonmouth did not reach the heights of previous Marvel Netflix villains.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt the season \"has a more than adequate supply of pleasures\", with a strong cast that could overcome some of its issues including a \"somewhat clunky pilot and a notable tendency to sprawl\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Merrill Barr, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', called the season \"another winner for Marvel and Netflix that shouldn't be missed,\" praising its story, twists, and \"the 70s stylings that shake things up real well.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\n\nGiving the season 4.5 stars out of 5, Cinema Blend's Eric Eisenberg felt ''Luke Cage'' \"has a unique flavor that could very well lead it to being called the best Netflix/Marvel series so far by the time its first season is over,\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlendReview\" /> a sentiment also shared by Helen O'Hara of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=\"DailyTelegraphReview\" /> Eisenberg also praised the members of the supporting cast, including Missick, Whaley, Frankie Faison as Pop, and Rossi, as well as Ali and Woodard as the main villains. Despite \"weak exposition delivery in the pilot, repetitive narrative structures, and individual arcs that are cut short too soon,\" Eisenberg concluded that ''Luke Cage'' presented an area of the MCU unlike any previous films or television series and had done so with \"a compelling vision and atmosphere\".<ref name=\"CinemaBlendReview\" /> David Betancourt, for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', concluded that ''Luke Cage'' is \"Netflix's best Marvel show to date. When given the chance to bring to life one of the most well-known heroes of color around, Marvel and Netflix produced something that is undeniably and unapologetically black and beautiful.\"<ref name=\"WPReview\" /> ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Alexander Zalban called the season one of 2016's \"most vital, important\" and \"timely\" television series, saying it had \"incredibly layered and iconic performances\" from the cast.<ref name=\"TVGuideReview\" />\n\nMatt Webb Mitovich of [[TVLine]], who gave the season a \"B\", felt Harlem was \"a wonderfully utilized character\" in the season and a welcome change from the Hell's Kitchen setting of the previous Marvel Netflix shows. He also praised the strong performances from Colter (bringing \"a needed intensity\") and Ali (\"compelling and threatening\"), but felt some of its \"talkier moments\" and pacing were issues.<ref name=\"TVLineReview\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen awarded the season a \"B-\", calling it a \"meaningful attempt at developing a new-model black hero. As entertaining drama, it's trapped in a not-so-Marvelous trapped cage\". He criticized the season as \"one more piece of Marvel pop that expresses its ballyhooed shared-world premise so poorly, it's jarring when it even happens,\" and also took issue with elements of the season's logic, pacing, and \"thinly stretched plot\".<ref name=\"EWReview\" /> Reviewing the entire season, Terri Schwartz of [[IGN]] awarded it an 8.4 out of 10, saying, \"''Marvel's Luke Cage'' doesn't reach the heights of ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', and its flawed second half ends up diminishing what was otherwise a fantastic season. But with something important to say and interesting new characters, ''Luke Cage'' is another win for Marvel's Netflix shows.\"<ref name=\"IGNReview\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nKeene highlighted the use of race in the season, and how it did not just study crime but also \"the beleaguered police, sleazy politicians, and the young people in the community who see guns and drugs as an easy way to make money.\"<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Zalban felt that, just like ''Jessica Jones'' \"sucked fans in by being a superhero detective story set in the Marvel Universe, while actually being one of the most powerful and thorough explorations of sexual assault ever committed to film,\" so too would ''Luke Cage'' with the racial aspects it covered.<ref name=\"TVGuideReview\" />\n\nLorraine Ali at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the season for giving an alternative perspective on \"black America\" to that provided by [[Donald Trump]], depicting a \"nuanced black and Latino community of professionals and working class people, trees and cityscapes, complex conversations and shorthand street slang.\" Ali felt that Cage's focus on teaching others about the culture of Harlem rather than always using his abilities made him one of the more interesting and relevant modern superheroes, but also noted that he could be old-fashioned in his earnestness at times, such as in his sensitivity towards the use of the word \"[[nigger]]\".<ref name=\"LATAnalysis\" /> Reed Ramsey highlighted the nods to the Black Lives Matter movement in the season for ''[[Odyssey (publication)|Odyssey]]'', especially the depiction of police brutality against black civilians and the use of hoodies covered in bullet holes as a symbol for standing up against the system. Ramsey also praised the fact that all the main characters in the season were not white, and that the characters in positions of power were women.<ref name=\"OdysseyAnalysis\" /> Writing for ''[[Study Breaks]]'', Aliyah Thomas found some of the season's symbolism to be \"hackneyed\", but still felt it was \"one of the most promising narratives I have yet to come across on the black experience\" and \"unapologetically black\". Thomas highlighted the humanity of Cage, as well as the use of music to evoke the [[blaxploitation]] era of films in which the comics were originally written which she felt accurately encompassed both the culture of Harlem and the exploitation that Cage and other black Americans have endured in the past.<ref name=\"StudyBreaksAnalysis\" />\n\nCommenting on the overall response to the season for ScreenPrism, Elyce Rae Helford claimed that the season is \"both progressive and regressive in its race politics\", with Coker actively trying to avoid the stereotypes of the blaxploitation era by featuring an anti-gun hero, strong black female characters, and other characters from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. However, the season was unable to completely avoid this because it also embraces music that was made famous to general audiences through blaxploitation films, and because it features a significant amount of crime and violence. Helford found a generally positive response to the show's use of the word \"nigger\" and Cage's dislike of it, but also detailed criticisms that some had regarding Cage's conservative personality and the fact that his political ideologies did not make him a true representation of past civil rights leaders as some may have expected.<ref name=\"ScreenPrismAnalysis\" /> For ''The Daily Fandom'', Rachel A. questioned why Cage was the right character to be the first black headliner of an MCU project, finding contrasting interpretations of his abilities: Cage could represent the fantasy of African-Americans \"who face the very real prospect of that harm, and find escapism in imagining a state of immunity from it\"; or he could represent the stereotype of African-Americans having \"a body that can endure endless abuse and exploitation and still produce economic value\". She also felt that Cage's apparent inability to be killed absolved Marvel from certain political issues, saying white audiences did not have to question whether Cage's life \"mattered\", as in \"Black Lives Matter\", because they would know that he is safe from harm.<ref name=\"DailyFandomAnalysis\" />\n\nTomi Obaro specifically highlighted the season's women of color for [[BuzzFeed]], finding the season to be a rare example of nuanced women of color who were not the main character. Obaro gave especial praise to the complex depictions of Dillard, Knight, and Temple, but noted that even the minor female characters were given exposition to add depth to their portrayals, and found many of these characters to be even more interesting than Cage and the other leading men of the season, feeling that Cage was boring and most of the male characters fit into simple archetypes.<ref name=\"BuzzfeedAnalysis\" /> Veronica Hillsbring of ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' and Charles Pulliam-Moore of [[Splinter News]] agreed,<ref name=\"EssenceAnalysis\" /><ref name=\"SplinterAnalysis\" /> with the latter calling the season's portrayal of women its \"real strength\" and praising it for \"expanding the scope\" of the MCU to include black women as both major heroes and villains.<ref name=\"SplinterAnalysis\" /> In response to these comments, Coker said, \"Black women are the most passionate commentators, and even as black female geeks and nerds, they are rarely acknowledged. So this show is kind of a love letter to them.\"<ref name=\"CokerBlackWomen\" /> Contrasting some of these opinions, Noah Berlatsky of ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' discussed some of the complexities of the male characters in the season, and how it questions the \"toxic black male stereotypes\" of masculinity and criminality, using the examples of Cage's intelligence and vulnerability, Pop's philosophy of peace and deescalation, and Stokes' love of music and unwillingness to become a criminal. However, Berlatsky felt the season failed to follow through with these questions, as \"from the moment [Pop] first appears on screen, it's clear the ideology he represents is going to be discarded. ''Luke Cage'' recognizes young Cornell's gentleness and vulnerability. But it still has to turn him into Cottonmouth.\"<ref name=\"QuartzAnalysis\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''Luke Cage'' was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2016 lists, ranking on the [[African-American Film Critics Association]]'s (5th),<ref name=\"AAFCATop2016\" /> [[NPR]]'s (6th),<ref name=\"NPRTop2016\" /> and [[FanSided|Hidden Remote]]'s (7th).<ref name=\"HiddenRemoteTop2016\" /> It was also included on un-ranked lists from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'',<ref name=\"HPTop2016\" /> ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'',<ref name=\"PlainDealerTop2016\" /> [[TheWrap]],<ref name=\"TheWrapTop2016\" /> and [[Yahoo!]]<ref name=\"YahooTop2016\" /> [[Comic Book Resources]] named \"Just to Get a Rep\" as the 9th best episode in 2016 among comic book-related television series.<ref name=\"CBRTopEpisodes\" /> Additionally, ''Luke Cage'' was the third most trending television series search on [[Google]] for 2016,<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" /> and the second highest rated

television]] series ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', which is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Luke Cage|of the same name]], follows a former convict with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin who fights crime in [[Harlem, New York]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Mike Colter]] stars as Cage, reprising his role from the series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''. He is joined by principal cast members [[Mahershala Ali]], [[Simone Missick]], [[Theo Rossi]], [[Erik LaRay Harvey]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Alfre Woodard]]. ''Luke Cage'' entered development in late 2013, and Colter was cast, to appear in ''Jessica Jones'' and star in ''Luke Cage'', in December 2014. Production took place in New York City from September 2015 to March 2016, with the season exploring race and politics while looking to replicate the atmosphere and culture of Harlem. Coker especially emphasized the use of music: [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] composed a \"90s hip-hop\" score; various artists give onscreen performances in the fictional nightclub Harlem's Paradise throughout the season; and each episode is named after a [[Gang Starr]] song. Visual effects, including for the depiction of Cage's abilities, were provided by FuseFX.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in Harlem on September 28, 2016, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on September 30 to an estimated high viewership\u2014it was believed to become the fourth most-viewed season on Netflix within 30 days of its release\u2014and positive reviews, particularly for the first 7 episodes. Critics praised the cast, especially the performances of Ali and Woodard, as well as the music and general style. Its pacing and some writing were viewed as some of the season's shortcomings. The series' approach to racial issues was discussed by many commentators. The season won several awards, including a [[69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]]. A [[Luke Cage (season 2)|second season]] of ''Luke Cage'' was ordered on December 3, 2016.<ref name=\"S2Order\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#3E290C|overall=5 |season=5 |title=20 |titleR={{efn|name=Titles|Each episode is named after a [[Gang Starr]] song, chosen based on their titles only, so each episode's events does not necessarily reflect the respective song's lyrics.<ref name=\"GangStarrTitles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2016/09/25/every-episode-luke-cage-tribute-gang-starr/IRitjpZgrNAz4aPC31FeON/story.html?event=event25 |title=In every episode of 'Luke Cage,' a tribute to Gang Starr |last=Sullivan |first=James |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=September 26, 2016 |accessdate=September 27, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kpV7PTV3?url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2016/09/25/every-episode-luke-cage-tribute-gang-starr/IRitjpZgrNAz4aPC31FeON/story.html?event=event25 |archivedate=September 27, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"CokerGQ\" />|group=lower-alpha}} |director=15 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-luke-cage/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's luke cage on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Moment of Truth\n |DirectedBy = [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Cheo Hodari Coker]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n |ShortSummary = [[Luke Cage]], a former convict with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin, keeps a low profile as a sweeper at ex-gangster Henry \"Pop\" Hunter's barbershop, and as a dishwasher at crime boss [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]]' nightclub, Harlem's Paradise. Cage spends one night as a bartender for Stokes, filling in for Dante, who calls in sick. Dante is actually attacking an arms deal between Stokes' men and gang leader Domingo Colon with his friends Shameek and Wilfredo \"Chico\" Diaz. Dante panics and is killed by Shameek, who escapes with Chico and the money. [[NYPD]] detectives [[Misty Knight]] and [[Rafael Scarfe]] investigate, and impound the [[Justin Hammer|Hammer Industries]] weapons that Stokes was selling. With help from [[Shades (comics)|\"Shades\" Alvarez]], who works for Stokes' supplier [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Diamondback]], Stokes tracks and kills Shameek and retrieves his share of the money. Stokes' men also support his cousin [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]], a [[New York City Council|councilwoman]], and demand contributions to her cause from Cage's landlords.

Pop wants Chico brought to the barbershop, which is considered to be the \"[[Neutral country|Switzerland]]\" of Harlem. While out, Cage sees Cottonmouth deliver Shameek's money to Dillard's memorial [[Crispus Attucks]] Complex; Dillard used her campaign donations to refurbish Harlem's Paradise for Cottonmouth, and he is repaying her with the money from the arms deal. Cage finds Chico and convinces him to hide out at the barbershop. Knight and Scarfe visit the barbershop looking for Chico, but Pop keeps his location secret, and instead sends Cage to offer a [[wikt:parlay|parlay]] to Cottonmouth. The gangster agrees due to growing up on the streets with Chico's father and Pop, but his right-hand man Tone is tipped off to Chico's location by [[Turk Barrett]]. Tone shoots up the barbershop, injuring Chico and killing Pop. Cottonmouth later throws Tone to his death from the roof of the nightclub, and mourns for Pop.

Cage finds out from a regular customer, Bobby Fish, that the barbershop is facing closure due to unpaid bills, and decides to take Stokes' money to cover the debt and re-open the shop. He visits Chico in the hospital and learns that Stokes' plans to move all of his money to Crispus Attucks during a crisis. Cage begins targeting Stokes' business, framing Colon. Stokes moves all his money to Crispus Attucks in response, and Cage attacks the complex while Dillard is out, taking out her guards and stealing a small share of the money to give to Fish. Knight and Scarfe arrive soon to impound the rest of the money. Chico approaches Scarfe, offering to testify against Stokes and revealing that it was Cage who attacked the complex. Scarfe, who is actually on Stokes' payroll, kills Chico and tells Stokes about Cage.

He befriends fellow inmate Squabbles; develops an attraction to psychologist [[Reva Connors]]; is forced to engage in illegal ring fights by Rackham; and crosses paths with Shades, also an inmate then. Lucas and Connors plan to expose Rackham's activities, but he learns of this (after torturing Squabbles to death) and has Lucas brutally beaten. Connors asks Dr. [[Noah Burstein]], a scientist conducting illegal experimental procedures on the inmates in exchange for reduced sentences, to try and save Lucas with a procedure that causes rapid healing. Rackham sabotages the experiment, and the resulting accident gives Lucas his abilities. He escapes and meets up with Connors, starting a new life with her under the name \"Luke Cage\". In the present, Cage pulls himself and his landlady out of the rubble, and reveals his abilities and name to the media.\n |LineColor = 3E290C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Just to Get a Rep\n |DirectedBy = Marc Jobst\n |WrittenBy = [[Jason Horwitch]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n |ShortSummary = [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] arrives in Harlem to visit her mother, Soledad Temple, in whom she confides about past experiences giving medical aid to enhanced people including Cage. Stokes begins extorting the citizens of Harlem to cover his debts, blaming Cage in an effort to turn the neighborhood against him. Cage fights back, helping defend the citizens and return their property. Cage confronts Stokes to demand that he stop this, and Shades recognizes him as Carl Lucas. Shades reveals to Stokes a new type of weapon, the Judas bullet, built from alien metal and based on a prototype stolen from Hammer Industries, that could kill Cage. With Stokes unable to afford it, Diamondback will use it to kill Cage himself in exchange for control of Harlem. Stokes instead decides to steal the weapons from the failed deal with Colon and sell them to get the money to buy the Judas bullets. Scarfe takes the weapons from police evidence, but does not deliver them to Stokes. By then, Knight is informed by NYPD Captain Betty Audrey that Scarfe is under investigation.\n{{hr}}\n[[Jidenna]] performs his single \"Long Live the Chief\" for a [[soundcheck]] at Harlem's Paradise, ahead of the release of his debut album of the same name.<ref name=\"7MusicCameos\" />\n |LineColor = 3E290C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Suckas Need Bodyguards\n |DirectedBy = [[Sam Miller]]\n |WrittenBy = Nathan Louis Jackson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n |ShortSummary = Scarfe attempts to blackmail Stokes, but is critically shot by him and forced to escape to Pop's barbershop.

The pair discuss his abilities as they walk to the barbershop, where they find Scarfe. Claire treats his injuries. Knight is teamed with Lieutenant Perez, who is also on Stokes' payroll and ordered to kill Scarfe. Knight deduces this, and tricks Perez into implicating himself before arresting him. Cage retrieves an incriminating ledger from Scarfe's apartment, but Knight sees him and he, Claire, and Scarfe go on the run. They are on their way to [[1 Police Plaza]] to turn over Scarfe and the evidence when they are ambushed by mercenaries working for Stokes. Cage fends them off, but Scarfe dies from his injuries.

He threatens to expose Cage's real identity and have him sent back to prison, and Cage decides to leave Harlem. Claire convinces him to stay and fight. Stokes reminisces about growing up with Dillard and their grandmother, mobster Mama Mabel. Stokes' musical talents were encouraged by his uncle Pete, whom Mabel later forced Stokes to kill after learning Pete had made side dealings with her rivals and had molested Dillard. Audrey stands down following the corruption at her precinct, and is replaced with Inspector Priscilla Ridley. After talking with Ridley, Knight begins to question Cage when he returns the stolen weapons (after taking them from Colon). Dillard is forced to resign from the council, leading to an argument with Stokes in which he insinuates that she liked being abused by Pete. Dillard kills Stokes, and Shades helps her frame Cage for the murder. Cage tells Claire about his past, just as he is shot by Diamondback\u2014who knows him as \"Carl\"\u2014with a Judas bullet.\n{{hr}}\nd-Nice appears again as the resident DJ at Harlem's Paradise.<ref name=\"dNiceResident\" />\n |LineColor = 3E290C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n |Title = Blowin' Up the Spot\n |DirectedBy = Magnus Martens\n |WrittenBy = A\u00efda Mashaka Croal\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n |ShortSummary = Claire gets Cage into an ambulance, but they are attacked by Diamondback en route to the hospital. They take refuge in a women's clinic, where Claire examines Cage and realizes that they cannot get the Judas bullet shrapnel out of him due to his generally impenetrable skin. Candace, a waitress and hostess at Stokes' club, tells the police that it was Cage who killed Stokes, making Knight suspicious of Dillard. Knight calls Cage and informs him of the accusation, while another officer triangulates his location. She arrives at the clinic, attempting to arrest him, but they are attacked by Diamondback again. Cage recognizes him as his childhood friend Willis Stryker, who now blames Cage for leaving him to \"rot\", before escaping. Dillard secretly pays Candace for testifying against Cage. In custody, Claire insists that Cage is innocent, angering Knight to the point that she brutally assaults Claire. Ridley intervenes and has Claire released.

Knight admits that she is struggling with her lack of control. An injured Cage limps through a predominantly white neighborhood, and is confronted by police officers. When they recognize him, he defends himself and runs, with [[dashcam]] footage of him using his abilities against one of the officers leaking onto the internet. Dillard organizes a meeting with the other local crime bosses, hoping to sell Stokes' criminal resources and legitimize her family name. They are interrupted by Stryker, who kills all the bosses but Dillard and Colon. In an attempt to save herself, Dillard shows the dashcam footage to Stryker and convinces him to sell Judas bullets to the police as a means of defending themselves from Cage. Claire convinces Cage to get Burstein's help, and they find the doctor living in hiding. He places Cage in acid that should soften his skin and allow them to remove the shrapnel, but the pain of the procedure causes Cage to go into cardiac arrest.\n{{hr}}\n[[The Delfonics]] perform \"Stop and Look (And You Have Found Love)\" in the episode.<ref name=\"DoGEE109\" />\n |LineColor = 3E290C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Take It Personal\n |DirectedBy = [[Stephen Surjik]]\n |WrittenBy = Jason Horwitch\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n |ShortSummary = Claire and Burstein manage to revive Cage and take out the shrapnel.

Cage threatens Burstein to never replicate the accident, and takes all the data with him. Burstein secretly has a copy of the files. Claire and Cage go to his home in [[Savannah, Georgia]], where his memories of his father confirm that Stryker is telling the truth. Stryker meanwhile kills a policeman, and frames Cage. Angered, other police officers become more aggressive in their search for Cage, with one beating a teenage boy. Dillard holds a rally to support the boy, where she blames Cage for the behavior and promotes arming the police against him. Her political rival Damon Boone tells her that he knows the truth.

Candace meets Knight and says that she will testify against Dillard if Knight protects her. Knight takes her to Soledad's. Alvarez approaches Dillard and suggests they get Cage on their side by giving him the evidence he needs to clear his name, and then use him to defeat Stryker (with the hope that they kill each other). Cage finds Barrett, who gives up Stryker's location, but Cage goes there to find the bodies of Colon and his men. As the parties converge on Pop's to parley, Stryker appears wearing a powered suit which allows him to match Cage's strength and invulnerability. Cage tasks Knight to go after Dillard and Alvarez while he engages Stryker.\n{{hr}}\n[[Method Man]] guest stars in the episode, performing the original rap song \"[[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\" after he is saved by Cage during a robbery.<ref name=\"7MusicCameos\" />\n |LineColor = 3E290C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n |Title = You Know My Steez\n |DirectedBy = [[Clark Johnson]]\n |WrittenBy = A\u00efda Mashaka Croal & Cheo Hodari Coker\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n |ShortSummary = In flashbacks, Stryker helps Lucas become a boxer, eventually leading to the latter winning an important match. In the present, Cage and Stryker continue their fight inside and outside the barber shop. In the confusion, Knight drops her phone and Dillard loses the files which prove Cage's innocence. Cage tries to reason with Stryker, but eventually knocks him out when the suit's power system fails. Dillard is arrested, after publicly outing Cage as Lucas. Alvarez uses Knight's phone to lure Candace out of hiding and kills her, without whose testimony Dillard walks free. Ridley blames Knight for keeping Candace at a private place instead of [[protective custody]]. Federal marshals arrest Cage for his escape from Seagate.

Coker chose the Gang Starr songs ahead of his first pitch meeting with Marvel Television head [[Jeph Loeb]], to help organize his planned story arcs.<ref name=\"GangStarrTitles\" /> He chose the songs based on their titles only, so each episode's events does not necessarily reflect the respective song's lyrics.<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" />\n\nLoeb described the season as \"a fugitive story\",<ref name=\"LoebJan2016\" /> and \"a story of redemption\",<ref name=\"LoebSDCC2016\" /> and said it was about Luke Cage's \"story and where he came from and, most importantly, where he's going\" after telling an \"early part of the middle\" of his story on ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015JJ\" /> Colter noted that the series uses flashbacks to tell elements of the story like the previous Marvel Netflix shows.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Coker described the series as \"a powerful fusion of dark drama, hip-hop, and classic superhero action\" and ''The Wire'' of Marvel Television.<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> More specifically, Coker felt the season was a hip-hop [[Western (genre)#Contemporary Western|Western]], comparing it to [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' of films, with Cage the [[Man with No Name]] coming to a town, Harlem, where he is convinced to fight injustice. Coker further compared the characters Cottonmouth and Misty Knight to the resident villain and local law enforcement, respectively, of the Western genre, and described the Harlem's Paradise nightclub as the town's [[Western saloon|saloon]].<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" />\n\nThe season picks up \"a few months\" after ''Jessica Jones'',<ref name=\"ColterSetting\" /> with Luke Cage trying to stay off the radar.<ref name=\"ColterSetting\" /> The end of the second episode \"get[s] this series into forward action mode [by making Cage] see that he couldn't just sit back and do nothing.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2016TVLine\" /> Coker said the arc for Cage in the season was 'hero', and felt this was a more natural way of introducing the character than telling a traditional [[origin story]] as other Marvel properties have done. This also differentiated the show from the rest of the MCU. Coker had plotted the story of the first four episodes before the show's writers room began work, but had initially done so over two or three episodes, with the event at the end of the second episode originally taking place at the end of the first. Loeb and Marvel's Karim Zreik told Coker to slow the pace of the show down, which led to an approach that Coker compared to ''[[Unforgiven]].''<ref name=\"DeadlinePremiere\" /> Set in Harlem, rather than the Hell's Kitchen of the previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix series]], Colter described the season as \"a completely different world\".<ref name=\"ColterSetting\" /> Marvel Comics' [[editor-in-chief]] [[Joe Quesada]] said that unlike the fictionalized version of Hell's Kitchen depicted in ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', which was more inline with how it was when the comics were first written, the Harlem of ''Luke Cage'' represents the Harlem of \"today\", and is truer to the real-life modern New York.<ref name=\"QuesadaSDCC2016\" /> However, Colter admitted that the show's version of Harlem \"does resemble Harlem of maybe ten years ago.\"<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" /> Coker said that Harlem was a world for the series, but also about legacy. He wanted to replicate the experience of walking through Harlem and hearing different music coming from cars driving past and open windows, which he felt was unique to the neighborhood.<ref name=\"DeadlinePremiere\" /> Coker further described the Harlem's Paradise nightclub as the series' [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]],<ref name=\"/FilmTCA2016\" /> and wanted it to \"invoke the history of Harlem ... it's crime, politics, music, really the whole cornucopia of the black creative existence in one place.\"<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" />\n\nCage is seen wearing a black hoodie throughout the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to [[Trayvon Martin]] and Black Lives Matter. Colter said it was meant to invoke \"the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn't necessarily a threat. He might just be a hero.\"<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> The series also features a political campaign with the slogan \"Keep Harlem Black\", \"in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem's cultural history.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, \"how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That's one of the things I wanted to explore on the show\". He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on \"identity\", which he saw as a common element in all black art.<ref name=\"DeadlinePremiere\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes Colter as Cage;<ref name=\"Colter\" /> [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]];<ref name=\"Ali\" /><ref name=\"Ali2\" /> [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight]];<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> [[Theo Rossi]] as [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]];<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]],<ref name=\"Harvey\" /><ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> whose involvement was not officially announced by Marvel prior to the season's release, as he agreed not to do any publicity for the show to not \"ruin the twist\" of Stryker being the season's main villain;<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], reprising her role from ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' and ''Jessica Jones'';<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> and [[Alfre Woodard]] as [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]].<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> \n\nIn September 2015, [[Frank Whaley]] was cast as [[Rafael Scarfe]].<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Whaley\" /> [[Sean Ringgold]] and [[Karen Pittman]] were revealed to be involved in the series in March 2016,<ref name=\"WrapParty\" /> playing Sugar and Priscilla Ridley, respectively.<ref name=\"IWEE\" /> Also recurring throughout the season are [[Ron Cephas Jones]] as Bobby Fish,<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> [[Jacob Vargas]] as Domingo Colon,<ref name=\"Vargas\" /> Darius Kaleb as Lonnie Wilson,<ref name=\"Kaleb\" /> Jade Wu as Connie Lin,<ref name=\"Lins\" /> Deborah Ayorinde as Candace Miller,<ref name=\"SharpMagazine\" /> Justin Swain as Mark Bailey,<ref name=\"Swain\" /><ref name=\"SwainS2\" /> Jaiden Kaine as Zip,<ref name=\"IWEE\" /> [[Dawn-Lyen Gardner]] as [[Megan McLaren]],<ref name=\"DoGEE101\" /> Jeremiah Richard Craft as [[David Griffith (comics)|D.W.

Like the main characters of those shows, Cage has his own wardrobe evolution throughout the season after his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket was introduced in ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> The series opted to depict Cage in a Trayvon Martin-inspired hoodie, but introduces the character's classic costume for a brief flashback. Colter said that the costume, designed in the blacksploitation era, \"is not made for serious moments\", but the series was able to poke fun at it in the brief scene.<ref name=\"FlashbackFilming\" /> In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing, Maslansky and Coker considered having him wear gold clothing, but thought that would be too on the nose and impractical for someone trying not to draw attention. Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups.<ref name=\"MaslanskyVogue\" /> In contrast to Cage's hoodie, with jeans and T-shirts, many of the series' villains wear well-tailored suits. Stokes does this because he wants to present himself as \"a wealthy, successful businessman\", and wears a lot of suits from [[Dolce & Gabbana]] and [[Ermenegildo Zegna|Zegna]]. One of his suits for the show was custom made.<ref name=\"MaslanskyE\" /> To pay homage to the comics, Maslansky dressed Ali in a green suit for his introduction, using a subtle shade of green to avoid being flamboyant. The character subsequently is always wearing something green, like emerald earrings for one costume. The designer noted that many of these elements would not be noticed by the audience, but they made a difference to Ali when he was getting into character.<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbes\" /> For the character Shades, brands such as [[Hugo Boss]], [[Helmut Lang (fashion brand)|Helmut Lang]], [[Prada]], and [[Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A.|Ferragamo]] were used \"because he wasn't trying to hide who he was\",<ref name=\"MaslanskyE\" /> while Misty Knight, in her final shot of the season, is shown wearing a version of her own iconic comic costume.<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbes\" /> That look includes leather pants and an \"interesting cold-shoulder\"-shaped top; a cream-colored top that fit that shape was found and dyed red for the scene.<ref name=\"MaslanskyInverse\" />\n\nThe sets were designed and dressed to consist of strong colors that could be emphasized by the series' cinematography, to help differentiate the show from the noir look and tone of ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"BilleterMP\" /> The nightclub Harlem's Paradise was intended to invoke the real-life Harlem nightclubs the [[Cotton Club]] and the [[Lenox Lounge]],<ref name=\"CokerColterSDCCLAT\" /><ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> with production designer Loren Weeks, also returning from that capacity on ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', taking specific inspiration from [[The Apollo]] and [[Smalls Paradise]]. Because of the series' filming schedule and Coker's desire to film live musical performances in the club, it was decided that filming in an actual nightclub would be unrealistic. A set was built for the location, with Weeks using an [[Art Deco]] style to give the club \"a very distinctive look, and giving it an historical anchor\", and indicate that it had been a successful club around the 1920s and 1930s and was now being refurbished as part of Stokes and Dillard's \"New Harlem Renaissance\". Weeks felt the building could be a metaphor for the political undercurrents of the series. Set decorator Alison Froling, whom Weeks worked with on the other Marvel Netflix series, furbished the Harlem's Paradise set with contemporary furniture, finishes, and lighting fixtures to contrast the older architectural design. The lounge side of the club features two murals by [[Archibald Motley|Archibald J. Motley]], an artist from the original Harlem Renaissance. Coker insisted that the set for Pop's Barbershop be at street level, to connect it \"both visually and geographically\" with the Harlem street. For budget reasons, dressing an actual location as the barbershop was not going to work, but building a set to be at street level was also problematic since they would not be able to show people or cars driving past the window that you would see on an actual street. It was decided that a real location be found that is below street level so that scenes could be filmed on the street there, but would not have to match inside scenes filmed on the set because of the obstructed view of the street. To emphasize this, the set was built even lower than the actual store and a fake wall was added to the location.<ref name=\"WeeksSets\" /> Coker instructed the series' prop master to carefully choose a selection of books to appear in Cage's bedroom, including [[Ralph Ellison]]'s ''[[Invisible Man]]''.<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Malcolm X Boulevard, Harlem, New York.jpg|thumb|left|Filming took place on location in Harlem, which was important for showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker to accurately depict the neighborhood.]]\nMarvel announced in February 2014 that the series would be filmed in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> with Quesada stating in April that the show would be filming on location in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> In July 2015, Loeb stated that ''Luke Cage'' was prepping to begin filming,<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> and by September 2015, production had begun under the [[working title]] ''Tiara''.<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /><ref name=\"FilmingBegins2\" /> Filming concluded in March 2016.<ref name=\"WrapParty\" />\n\nFilming took place in Harlem, including [[Lenox Avenue]] and areas where ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'' was shot,<ref name=\"CokerColterSDCCLAT\" /><ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> the Mount Olivet Baptist Church, [[St. Nicholas Park]], [[Jackie Robinson]] Park, [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]], and the [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)#125th Street viaduct|Riverside Drive viaduct]];<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]],<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> including at the [[United Palace]];<ref name=\"EW108Recap\" /> Cortlandt Alley in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]];<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> in areas of [[Queens]] for when Cage escapes Seagate Prison and puts on the classic Power Man costume;<ref name=\"FlashbackFilming\" /> the [[Roosevelt Island]] steam plant and [[Queens Detention Facility]] for interiors of Seagate;<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /><ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" /> the [[Music Hall of Williamsburg]] for the exterior of Harlem's Paradise; the former Fulton Correctional Facility in [[The Bronx]] for the Crispus Attucks Complex; and the [[Long Island City]] portion of [[Newtown Creek]].<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> It was important to Coker for the series to film in Harlem, \"the only place in the city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets\".<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in [[Greenwich Village]], which would have been much easier for the production, but Coker said \"the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn't want us to talk about Harlem and then not film\" there.<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" /> Soundstage filming took place at Broadway Stages in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]. For the church that Cage and Temple visit in [[Savannah, Georgia]], an abandoned church in The Bronx was found that was being sold, and the production was able to \"graffiti up and sort of ruin\" it. They also had to spend two days carting snow from the site before filming, after a recent blizzard.<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" />\n\nManuel Billeter served as director of photography for the series, after doing the same for ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" /> He worked with director [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]] to establish the look of the show in the first two episodes, with Coker hiring McGuigan based on his direction of the ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' episode \"[[A Scandal in Belgravia]]\". Coker was delighted to learn how little CGI McGuigan used to craft the visuals of that episode, and wanted the same approach for ''Luke Cage'', \"just old school camera stuff. He brought a very analogue perspective, analogue feel to the show.\" McGuigan, Coker explained, directed \"every scene [as] long takes, from multiple takes over and over again. We would run an entire eight-page scene almost like a play, so when it comes together it's seamless.\"<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> McGuigan was inspired by the works of photographers [[Gordon Parks]], [[Tony Ray-Jones]], and Jack Garofalo.<ref name=\"McGuiganInfluences\" /> Billeter looked to differentiate the look of ''Luke Cage'' from ''Jessica Jones'', using modified gels on lights, and saturating and warming colors in color correction to give Harlem a more glowing look.<ref name=\"BilleterMP\" /> Coker noted that the series' has a color scheme of yellow, brown, amber, and gold, in contrast to the violet tint Billeter gave ''Jessica Jones'' to reflect that series' villain, the Purple Man.<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> The series was shot on Netflix's standard [[4K resolution|4K]] cameras, with Billeter pairing them with [[Panavision]] Primo lenses that were \"custom treated with a reflective coating in between the glass elements in the interior of the lens, causing more flares and bringing down the contrast in addition to very slightly de-focusing them\" in order to \"add something magic, less controlled and more cinematic\". Billeter filmed Colter with a lot of low angles to make him look \"even more heroic\", and kept the camera close to him with Harlem in the background so that Cage \"is always the dominant force in his shots, but he also remains a part of the terrain. The shots aren't of him alone; they\u2019re of him in his home.\"<ref name=\"BilleterMP\" />\n\nCage's fight style in the series was called \"smack-fu\" by Coker, referring to the way he tried not to punch anybody since that would probably kill them with his super strength.<ref name=\"103Fight\" /> To film the effect of bullets bouncing off of Cage, remote controlled devices were attached to Colter and operated by somebody behind the cameras. The devices could burn his skin if not attached properly, and Colter almost lost hearing in one ear after forgetting to insert the required ear pieces.<ref name=\"WPBTS\" /> The third episode begins with a couch coming out of the window of the fictional [[Crispus Attucks]] complex in Harlem. This was a tease of a large fight scene, the series' version of the 'superhero hallway fight' made famous in ''Daredevil.''<ref name=\"103Fight\" /> Filming for the fight was influenced by \"[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]\u2019s invading the police station in ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]''\",<ref name=\"CokerS2IdeasSep2016\" /> and was one of the toughest sequences for the crew to shoot; it took a 14-hour day, and Colter attributed the successful completion of the sequence, including the couch shot, to director [[Guillermo Navarro]].<ref name=\"103Fight\" /> Colter also called the fourth episode particularly difficult to film, taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot. The episode was written by executive producer Charles Murray, who looked to organically transition the character's origin story from the original comics into the modern world of the series for the episode. This involved flashbacks with Colter in makeup and different costumes.<ref name=\"OriginFilming\" />\n\nScenes shot at the United Palace theater created new challenges for the series' stunt team due to not being able to drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to find other ways to weigh down the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles.<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" /> For the explosion at the restaurant \"Genghis Connie's\", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building.<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" /><ref name=\"VarietyFX\" /> A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that \"feels\" similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere.<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" /> Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said that the crew members working on each of the shows wanted them all to feel like they are set in the same city, but also for the world of each character to be distinct, and for this series they embraced Harlem \"for exactly what it is\" to differentiate the \"visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... the color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood\u2026 I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place\".<ref name=\"dnaSecrets\" />\n\nThe series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'' as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over [[Lavalier microphone|lavaliers]] to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in \"naturalistic sound\". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded \"incredible on the boom\". Anderson also talked about ''Luke Cage'' adding a new layer of sound that the other series did not\u2014music. The captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later, and live performances in Harlem's Paradise had to be recorded for which Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]''.<ref name=\"Sound\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFuseFX provided 867 visual effects shots for the season, with a team of 15 to 20 members under FuseFX New York's production head and senior visual effects supervisor Greg Anderson. Anderson explained that the series' challenging schedule was made easier by the company's catalog of previously used digital assets and effect elements that can be reused, or partially reused, where appropriate in new projects. Several effects shots were created to show Cage's abilities, including a slow motion shot of a thug's fist collapsing into a compound fracture while punching Cage in the face. A standout effects sequence for the season was when Stokes fires a missile at a building, which took FuseFX 130 days to complete. It involved creating a CG building and integrating it into footage of a real New York City block, matching up with different camera angles and sources of light throughout the sequence. The effects team then had to digitally destroy the building, and create \"a complex array of fireballs and falling debris\".<ref name=\"VarietyFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{further|Luke Cage (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nIn April 2016, Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the series' score,<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> describing it as \"a confluence of multiple genres, a bit of ['90s] hip-hop, soul, psychedelic rock and classical\".<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /><ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Younge and Muhammad composed the score as if they were creating 13 albums, one for each episode,<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusicTVGuide\" /> with the music inspired by [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Ennio Morricone]], and Muhammad's group [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> The duo composed around twenty minutes of music for each episode, composing the entire season's score in nine months.<ref name=\"LCSpin\" /> Younge and Muhammad were encouraged to \"push\" the sound of the score as far as they could, and were allowed the use of a full, 30-piece orchestra for recording.<ref name=\"LCVulture\" /> They also arranged an original rap single, \"[[Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#\"Bulletproof Love\"|Bulletproof Love]]\", which features [[Method Man]] (who performs it in the show).<ref name=\"BulletproofLove\" />\n\nSongs from [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"/FilmTCA2016\" /> [[John Lee Hooker]] (\"[[It Serves You Right to Suffer]]\" and \"I'm Bad Like Jesse James\"),<ref name=\"/FilmTCA2016\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE105\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE107\" /> [[Dusty Springfield]] (\"[[Son of a Preacher Man]]\"),<ref name=\"DoGEE111\" /> and Wu-Tang Clan (\"Bring da Ruckus\") are used in the season.<ref name=\"DoGEE103\" /><ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> It also features onscreen performances by various artists as the live performances in the Harlem's Paradise nightclub, which Coker wanted to use to help capture the vibe of the neighborhood.<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Coker wanted Prince to perform at the nightclub for the season finale, before his death in April 2016. The \"swear jar\" that appears in the season was designed by Coker in hopes of convincing the artist to make the cameo appearance, as he was known to have a \"swear jar\" himself since he was a devout [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]]. The role was ultimately filled by [[Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings]], which Coker said was \"the better choice\" because \"that sequence is about Mariah being crowned.\"<ref name=\"CokerPrince\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released on October 7, digitally and pressed on yellow vinyl by Mondo.<ref name=\"LiveScore\" /><ref name=\"VinylRelease\" />\n\nCoker said that \"one of the things that's really the cornerstone of 90s hip-hop is sampling, so we have a lot of influences that we wear openly\", which he compared to the style of [[Quentin Tarantino]]. He continued, \"I think what makes it feel new is the fact that we\u2019re showing you can be both. We\u2019re showing that you can do Ralph Ellison at the same times as you\u2019re doing [[Chester Himes]].\" Coker was as specific with his choices of music in the season as \"[[Martin Scorsese]] is with the rock 'n' roll references like in ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'' or in ''[[Goodfellas]]''\", rather than just adding hip-hop music for the sake of it. He highlighted the use of \"I'm Bad Like Jesse James\" in the seventh episode, which he had been trying to use in something for 20 years, that \"builds up and coincides with the explosion that happens on screen and it's so subtle. That's the kind of stuff I geek out over.\"<ref name=\"DeadlinePremiere\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nPart of the series takes place simultaneously with the events of the second season of ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"LCDDS2\" /> Throughout the season, the villains use Hammer Industries weapons to counter Cage's abilities. [[Justin Hammer]] and his company were introduced in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', and Hammer was last seen incarcerated in Seagate Prison in the [[Marvel One-Shot]] ''[[All Hail the King]]''; Seagate is depicted in ''Luke Cage'', as the prison where Carl Lucas was sent and where there are rumored \"millionaires hidden in the basement\".<ref name=\"DoGEE101\" /><ref name=\"JoBloEp1MCU\" /><ref name=\"SREE\" /> The series references the events of ''The Avengers'' and members of that team,<ref name=\"TVGuideEE\" /><ref name=\"JoBloEp1MCU\" /> as well as the future Defenders and [[The Defenders (miniseries)|their own series]].<ref name=\"TVGuideEE\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE110\" /> Specific mentions of the latter include Madame Gao's operations in ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"DoGEE109\" /> the widely known villains [[Wilson Fisk]] and [[Punisher|Frank Castle]],<ref name=\"TVGuideEE\" /> and a flier for [[Colleen Wing]]'s martial arts class, to then be introduced in ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]''.<ref name=\"DoGEE113\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''Luke Cage'' was released on September 30, 2016,<ref name=\"PremiereDate\" /> on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix worldwide,<ref name=\"Coker\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The 13 hour-long episodes were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been successful for other Netflix series.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" />\n\n===Marketing=== \nThe first trailer for the series debuted exclusively on Netflix, autoplaying after the final episode of the second season of ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"TrailerRelease\" /> In July 2016, Colter, Woodard, Ali, Rossi, Missick, Whaley, and Coker appeared at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] to promote the series and debut footage.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"SDCC20162\" /> At the end of August, Netflix released the first part of the \"Street Level Hero\" digital social video series. The series looked to \"blend fiction with history by taking audiences behind the curtain on the themes that give the show its street-level authenticity and cultural relevance.\" The first part was centered on the music of the series, with commentary from Coker, Colter, composers Younge and Muhammad, [[ASAP Ferg|A$AP Ferg]] and [[Method Man]].<ref name=\"StreetLevelHeroMusic\" /> At the end of September, the second part of the \"Street Level Hero\" series was released, focusing on Harlem, with commentary from Coker, Colter, A$AP Ferg, Method Man, and Harlem style icon [[Dapper Dan (designer)|Dapper Dan]].<ref name=\"StreetLevelHeroHarlem\" /> On September 28, 2016, a premiere for the series was held at the [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] [[Magic Johnson Theatres|Magic Johnson]] in Harlem.<ref name=\"HarlemPremiere\" /><ref name=\"HarlemPremiere2\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on November 27, 2017,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 6, 2017,<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on December 12, 2017.<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> In Region A, the season featured packaging designed by Quesada, and the bonus feature \"Offstage at Harlem's Paradise\", a roundtable discussion with Colter, Woodard, Rossi, and Missick discussing their time during filming on the season.<ref name=\"MarvelBluRay\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, [[Symphony Technology Group]] compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, ''Luke Cage'' opened stronger initially than the Netflix original series ''[[Making a Murderer]]'' and ''[[Stranger Things]]'', but its performance over its first month fell short of both, comparatively. Symphony estimated that 6.34% of viewers age 18\u201349 were watching ''Luke Cage'' in an average minute in the first 32 days following its release, with ''Making a Murderer'' and ''Stranger Things'' seeing 9.1% and 9.81% of viewers, respectively.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers\" /> Symphony also estimated that 3.388&nbsp;million viewers age 18\u201349 were watching an episode of ''Luke Cage'' over the average minute in its first weekend of release.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers2\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fourth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 27% of the viewers that the second season of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpstart. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 8.03/10 based on 71 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An immersive, socially conscious narrative and a confident, charismatic lead performance make ''Marvel's Luke Cage'' a stellar sampling of the new Marvel/Netflix universe.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s01/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 1 (2016)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 79 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|footer=The performances of Mahershala Ali and Alfre Woodard during the season were among those praised by critics.|image1=MahershalalhashbazAliCCJuly07.jpg|width1=140|image2=Alfre Woodard 12 Years a Slave 60.jpg|width2=150}}\nReviewing the first seven episodes of the season, Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] awarded it 5 stars out of 5, describing the episodes as an \"intimate\" portrait of the Harlem culture, and noting that each character had distinct personalities and memorable moments. Keene specifically praised Colter.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Mike Cecchini of [[Den of Geek]] spoke positively of the season, particularly the cast, atmosphere, and \"willingness to go places that other Marvel Studios productions can't.\" He found Simone Missick to be the standout performer, praised the soundtrack which has \"the most active role in a superhero production since ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''\", and was equally impressed with the original score by Younge and Muhammad. However, Cecchini felt the season repeated some issues from previous Marvel Netflix series, such as the use of archetypes and monologues.<ref name=\"DenofGeekReview\" />\n\n''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''{{'s}} Dominic Patten called ''Luke Cage'' \"one of the most socially relevant and smartest shows on the small screen you will see this year... the series reaches both back and forward into the culture of heroes and an America looking for a true game-changer.\"<ref name=\"DeadlineReview\" /> David Milner for [[Digital Spy]] was also positive about the season's exploration of African-American history, but felt Ali's Cottonmouth did not reach the heights of previous Marvel Netflix villains.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReview\" /> Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt the season \"has a more than adequate supply of pleasures\", with a strong cast that could overcome some of its issues including a \"somewhat clunky pilot and a notable tendency to sprawl\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Merrill Barr, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', called the season \"another winner for Marvel and Netflix that shouldn't be missed,\" praising its story, twists, and \"the 70s stylings that shake things up real well.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\n\nGiving the season 4.5 stars out of 5, Cinema Blend's Eric Eisenberg felt ''Luke Cage'' \"has a unique flavor that could very well lead it to being called the best Netflix/Marvel series so far by the time its first season is over,\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlendReview\" /> a sentiment also shared by Helen O'Hara of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=\"DailyTelegraphReview\" /> Eisenberg also praised the members of the supporting cast, including Missick, Whaley, Frankie Faison as Pop, and Rossi, as well as Ali and Woodard as the main villains. Despite \"weak exposition delivery in the pilot, repetitive narrative structures, and individual arcs that are cut short too soon,\" Eisenberg concluded that ''Luke Cage'' presented an area of the MCU unlike any previous films or television series and had done so with \"a compelling vision and atmosphere\".<ref name=\"CinemaBlendReview\" /> David Betancourt, for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', concluded that ''Luke Cage'' is \"Netflix's best Marvel show to date. When given the chance to bring to life one of the most well-known heroes of color around, Marvel and Netflix produced something that is undeniably and unapologetically black and beautiful.\"<ref name=\"WPReview\" /> ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Alexander Zalban called the season one of 2016's \"most vital, important\" and \"timely\" television series, saying it had \"incredibly layered and iconic performances\" from the cast.<ref name=\"TVGuideReview\" />\n\nMatt Webb Mitovich of [[TVLine]], who gave the season a \"B\", felt Harlem was \"a wonderfully utilized character\" in the season and a welcome change from the Hell's Kitchen setting of the previous Marvel Netflix shows. He also praised the strong performances from Colter (bringing \"a needed intensity\") and Ali (\"compelling and threatening\"), but felt some of its \"talkier moments\" and pacing were issues.<ref name=\"TVLineReview\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen awarded the season a \"B-\", calling it a \"meaningful attempt at developing a new-model black hero. As entertaining drama, it's trapped in a not-so-Marvelous trapped cage\". He criticized the season as \"one more piece of Marvel pop that expresses its ballyhooed shared-world premise so poorly, it's jarring when it even happens,\" and also took issue with elements of the season's logic, pacing, and \"thinly stretched plot\".<ref name=\"EWReview\" /> Reviewing the entire season, Terri Schwartz of [[IGN]] awarded it an 8.4 out of 10, saying, \"''Marvel's Luke Cage'' doesn't reach the heights of ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', and its flawed second half ends up diminishing what was otherwise a fantastic season. But with something important to say and interesting new characters, ''Luke Cage'' is another win for Marvel's Netflix shows.\"<ref name=\"IGNReview\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nKeene highlighted the use of race in the season, and how it did not just study crime but also \"the beleaguered police, sleazy politicians, and the young people in the community who see guns and drugs as an easy way to make money.\"<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Zalban felt that, just like ''Jessica Jones'' \"sucked fans in by being a superhero detective story set in the Marvel Universe, while actually being one of the most powerful and thorough explorations of sexual assault ever committed to film,\" so too would ''Luke Cage'' with the racial aspects it covered.<ref name=\"TVGuideReview\" />\n\nLorraine Ali at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the season for giving an alternative perspective on \"black America\" to that provided by [[Donald Trump]], depicting a \"nuanced black and Latino community of professionals and working class people, trees and cityscapes, complex conversations and shorthand street slang.\" Ali felt that Cage's focus on teaching others about the culture of Harlem rather than always using his abilities made him one of the more interesting and relevant modern superheroes, but also noted that he could be old-fashioned in his earnestness at times, such as in his sensitivity towards the use of the word \"[[nigger]]\".<ref name=\"LATAnalysis\" /> Reed Ramsey highlighted the nods to the Black Lives Matter movement in the season for ''[[Odyssey (publication)|Odyssey]]'', especially the depiction of police brutality against black civilians and the use of hoodies covered in bullet holes as a symbol for standing up against the system. Ramsey also praised the fact that all the main characters in the season were not white, and that the characters in positions of power were women.<ref name=\"OdysseyAnalysis\" /> Writing for ''[[Study Breaks]]'', Aliyah Thomas found some of the season's symbolism to be \"hackneyed\", but still felt it was \"one of the most promising narratives I have yet to come across on the black experience\" and \"unapologetically black\". Thomas highlighted the humanity of Cage, as well as the use of music to evoke the [[blaxploitation]] era of films in which the comics were originally written which she felt accurately encompassed both the culture of Harlem and the exploitation that Cage and other black Americans have endured in the past.<ref name=\"StudyBreaksAnalysis\" />\n\nCommenting on the overall response to the season for ScreenPrism, Elyce Rae Helford claimed that the season is \"both progressive and regressive in its race politics\", with Coker actively trying to avoid the stereotypes of the blaxploitation era by featuring an anti-gun hero, strong black female characters, and other characters from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. However, the season was unable to completely avoid this because it also embraces music that was made famous to general audiences through blaxploitation films, and because it features a significant amount of crime and violence. Helford found a generally positive response to the show's use of the word \"nigger\" and Cage's dislike of it, but also detailed criticisms that some had regarding Cage's conservative personality and the fact that his political ideologies did not make him a true representation of past civil rights leaders as some may have expected.<ref name=\"ScreenPrismAnalysis\" /> For ''The Daily Fandom'', Rachel A. questioned why Cage was the right character to be the first black headliner of an MCU project, finding contrasting interpretations of his abilities: Cage could represent the fantasy of African-Americans \"who face the very real prospect of that harm, and find escapism in imagining a state of immunity from it\"; or he could represent the stereotype of African-Americans having \"a body that can endure endless abuse and exploitation and still produce economic value\". She also felt that Cage's apparent inability to be killed absolved Marvel from certain political issues, saying white audiences did not have to question whether Cage's life \"mattered\", as in \"Black Lives Matter\", because they would know that he is safe from harm.<ref name=\"DailyFandomAnalysis\" />\n\nTomi Obaro specifically highlighted the season's women of color for [[BuzzFeed]], finding the season to be a rare example of nuanced women of color who were not the main character. Obaro gave especial praise to the complex depictions of Dillard, Knight, and Temple, but noted that even the minor female characters were given exposition to add depth to their portrayals, and found many of these characters to be even more interesting than Cage and the other leading men of the season, feeling that Cage was boring and most of the male characters fit into simple archetypes.<ref name=\"BuzzfeedAnalysis\" /> Veronica Hillsbring of ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' and Charles Pulliam-Moore of [[Splinter News]] agreed,<ref name=\"EssenceAnalysis\" /><ref name=\"SplinterAnalysis\" /> with the latter calling the season's portrayal of women its \"real strength\" and praising it for \"expanding the scope\" of the MCU to include black women as both major heroes and villains.<ref name=\"SplinterAnalysis\" /> In response to these comments, Coker said, \"Black women are the most passionate commentators, and even as black female geeks and nerds, they are rarely acknowledged. So this show is kind of a love letter to them.\"<ref name=\"CokerBlackWomen\" /> Contrasting some of these opinions, Noah Berlatsky of ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' discussed some of the complexities of the male characters in the season, and how it questions the \"toxic black male stereotypes\" of masculinity and criminality, using the examples of Cage's intelligence and vulnerability, Pop's philosophy of peace and deescalation, and Stokes' love of music and unwillingness to become a criminal. However, Berlatsky felt the season failed to follow through with these questions, as \"from the moment [Pop] first appears on screen, it's clear the ideology he represents is going to be discarded. ''Luke Cage'' recognizes young Cornell's gentleness and vulnerability. But it still has to turn him into Cottonmouth.\"<ref name=\"QuartzAnalysis\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''Luke Cage'' was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2016 lists, ranking on the [[African-American Film Critics Association]]'s (5th),<ref name=\"AAFCATop2016\" /> [[NPR]]'s (6th),<ref name=\"NPRTop2016\" /> and [[FanSided|Hidden Remote]]'s (7th).<ref name=\"HiddenRemoteTop2016\" /> It was also included on un-ranked lists from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'',<ref name=\"HPTop2016\" /> ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'',<ref name=\"PlainDealerTop2016\" /> [[TheWrap]],<ref name=\"TheWrapTop2016\" /> and [[Yahoo!]]<ref name=\"YahooTop2016\" /> [[Comic Book Resources]] named \"Just to Get a Rep\" as the 9th best episode in 2016 among comic book-related television series.<ref name=\"CBRTopEpisodes\" /> Additionally, ''Luke Cage'' was the third most trending television series search on [[Google]] for 2016,<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" /> and the second highest rated

Kappeler and Christian Roos described a new species of giant mouse lemur, the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;zaza'').{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} Their studies compared the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[Cytochrome b|mitochondrial cytochrome b]] [[Sequencing|sequences]] of specimens from both [[Kirindy Forest]] in central-western Madagascar and around [[Ambato, Madagascar|Ambato]] in northwestern Madagascar,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} part of the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano valley]].{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, [[sociality]], and [[Reproduction|breeding]], as well as sufficient [[genetic distance]] to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description was based on a southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}\n\nThe [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced in 2010 that a [[biodiversity]] study from 2009 in the [[gallery forest]] of [[Ranobe, Madagascar|Ranobe]] near [[Toliara]] in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. They noted a significant difference in coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed.

Gray often created mysterious and unexplained [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic names]]\u2014a trend continued with his description of not only ''Mirza'' in 1870, but also the genera ''Phaner'' (fork-marked lemurs) and ''Azema'' (for ''[[Brown mouse lemur|M.&nbsp;rufus]]'', now a synonym for ''Microcebus''), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]] attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For ''Mirza'', Palmer only noted that it derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] title [[Mirza|m\u00eerz\u00e2]] (\"prince\"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel ''et al.'' also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], which premiered in London on 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (''sic''), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===Evolution===\nBased on studies using morphology, [[immunology]], [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]], [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINE]] analysis, [[Locus (genetics)|multilocus]] phylogenetic tests,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}} and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] (mtDNA),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a [[Cladistics|clade]] with the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus''). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} with fork-marked lemurs being either a [[sister group]] of all cheirogaleids,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} or more closely related to [[sportive lemur]]s (''Lepilemur'').{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}\n\nAlthough ''Mirza'', ''Microcebus'', and ''Allocebus'' form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, the three lineages are thought to have [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research.{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|pp=1627\u20131628}} All three are thought to have diverged at least 20&nbsp;[[myr|mya]] (million years ago),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}} although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between ''Mirza'' and ''Microcebus'' at 24.2&nbsp;mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1&nbsp;mya.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=15}}\n\n==Description==\nThough giant mouse lemurs are relatively small cheirogaleids,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} they are more than three times larger than the smallest members of the family, the mouse lemurs.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Their body weight averages {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} At around {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}}, their bushy and long tail is longer than their head-body length, which averages {{convert|233|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} Their forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs (with an [[intermembral index]] of 70), a trait shared with mouse lemurs.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|pp=60\u201361}} The skull is similar to that of dwarf and mouse lemurs,{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} and the [[Tympanic part of the temporal bone|auditory bullae]] are small.{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=70}}\n\nLike other cheirogaleids, the [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental formula]] for giant mouse lemurs is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.3|lower=2.1.3.3|total=36}}; on each side of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two [[incisor]]s, one [[Canine tooth|canine]], three premolars, and three [[Molar (tooth)|molars]]\u2014a total of 36&nbsp;teeth.{{Sfn|Swindler|2002|p=73}} Their upper teeth converge towards the front of the mouth, but are straighter than those in mouse lemurs.{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=70}} The first upper premolar (P<sup>2</sup>) is relatively small, but nearly as tall as the next premolar (P<sup>3</sup>). Unlike mouse lemurs and more like dwarf lemurs, giant mouse lemurs have a prominent [[Anatomical terms of location#anterior and posterior|anterior]] lower premolar (P<sub>2</sub>). Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs, the first two upper molars (M<sup>1\u20132</sup>) have a more anterior [[Molar (tooth)|hypocone]] that sits opposite the [[Molar (tooth)|metacone]], compared to the mouse lemurs' more [[Anatomical terms of location#anterior and posterior|posterior]] hypocone, which is presumably a [[Symplesiomorphy|symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait]].{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} Also on M<sup>1</sup> and M<sup>2</sup>, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small [[Cusp (anatomy)|cuspules]].{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=70}} In all other dental characteristics, giant mouse lemurs are noticeably similar to both dwarf and mouse lemurs.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs have two pairs of [[Mammary gland|mammae]], one on the chest (pectoral) and one on the [[abdomen]] (abdominal).{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=128}} Their fur is typically grayish-brown on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] (back) side and more gray in color on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] (front) side.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=18}} The tail is typically black-tipped.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs.

Both northern and southern populations were studied intermittently between 1978 and 1981, and in 1993, long-term social and genetic studies began in Kirindy Forest. Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] (DLC) in [[Durham, North Carolina]] during the 1990s.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}}\n\n===Population density and territory===\nBefore the recognition of more than one species, differences in [[population density]] were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near [[Ambanja]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=168\u2013170}} The former range between 30 and 210&nbsp;individuals per square kilometer (250&nbsp;acres),{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} with lower densities in open areas of the forest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086&nbsp;individuals per km<sup>2</sup>. However, in the case of the northern giant mouse lemur, populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of [[Introduced species|introduced]] cashew and [[mango]] help sustain these higher populations.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=168\u2013170}}\n\nAccording to studies of Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, [[home range]]s of both sexes vary from {{convert|1|to|4|ha|acre|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} with frequent overlap,{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} particularly on the periphery of their range.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=46}} Individuals most heavily use and aggressively defend a smaller core area within their range.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=46}} Individuals can have up to eight neighbors.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Home ranges of males tend to overlap with those of both females and other males,{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} and typically expand to four times the size during the mating season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Female home ranges show no variability in size, and can remain stable for years. At Kirindy Forest, genetic studies showed that the home ranges of related females tend to clump closely together, while unrelated males may overlap their range, suggesting male [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and migration is responsible for [[gene flow]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}\n\n===Activity patterns===\nBoth species are strictly [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} leaving their nests around sunset to stretch and [[Personal grooming|self-groom]] for a few minutes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Both species typically forage between {{convert|5|and|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the forest floor, though Coquerel's giant mouse lemur has been observed on the ground.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} They primarily move by [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] running and occasionally leaping between branches, and use the same feeding postures as mouse lemurs, such as clinging to tree trunks.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} When moving through the trees, giant mouse lemurs scurry rapidly like mouse lemurs, unlike dwarf lemurs, which use more deliberate movement.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} Slow movements are usually seen in lower, denser foliage when hunting for insects, while more rapid motion and leaping is typically seen at moderate heights of {{convert|2|\u2013|5|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. Surveillance of the home range involves slower movements in lighter foliage near the tops of large trees, while movements along the border of a home range is more rapid and occurs at a lower height. Similar movement patterns have been observed in captivity as well.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs begin foraging moments before the sun disappears,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} occasionally participate in social activities during the last half of the night,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}} and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal [[torpor]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}\n\n===Nesting===\nBoth species sleep in round nests up to {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} across made of interlaced [[liana]]s, branches, leaves, and twigs gathered from nearby trees and woven using the mouth and hands. Nests are typically between {{convert|2|and|10|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the ground in the fork of large tree branches or surrounded by dense lianas.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Trees covered in thick lianas as well as trees with year-round leaf cover (e.g. [[Euphorbiaceae]]) are favored for nest construction, though large bare trees may be used by building the nest higher.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} In addition to nesting in dense lianas, individual giant mouse lemurs will rotate between 10 and 12&nbsp;nests every few days to avoid predators.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Only females have been observed building nests in the wild,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} though males, females, and young have been observed building nests in captivity.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Multiple nests are sometimes built in the same tree or in nearby trees and are shared by neighboring giant mouse lemurs, fork-marked lemurs, and the introduced [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''). Unlike most other nocturnal lemurs, giant mouse lemurs do not appear to sleep in tree holes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}}\n\n===Social structure===\nBoth species usually are solitary foragers,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=170}} although the northern giant mouse lemur tends to be the most social, possibly due to its higher population density.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=170\u2013171}} whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}} Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to [[Telemetry|radio-tracking]] and direct observations at [[Analabe]] near Kirindy, they form [[pair bond]]s,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other [[agonistic behavior]], and only rarely [[social grooming]].{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs use at least eight vocalizations, the most common of which are contact calls, which sound like \"hum\" or a \"hein\" and are used when moving and when meeting familiar individuals. A \"mother-infant meeting call\" used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like \"pfiou\" and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a \"croak\", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated \"tisk-tisk-tisk\" sounds.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=108}} Females exhibit a \"waking call sequence\",{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} sometimes referred to as \"loud calls\", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter \"hon\" calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} A long \"sexual call sequence\" consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse \"brroak\" calls is used by both sexes during [[Estrous cycle|estrus]].{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]] on small branches and other objects.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Taking measurements of a male Mirza zaza.JPG|thumb|right|Measurements are taken on a northern giant mouse lemur of its testicle size, which relative to its body size is the largest among living primates.|alt=Male northern giant mouse lemur being held while calipers are used to measure its testicle size.]]\nReproduction starts in November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} the estrous cycle runs approximately 22&nbsp;days, while estrus lasts only a day or less.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} The mating season in this southern population is limited to a few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the [[aye-aye]] (''Daubentonia madagascariensis'') and the [[red-bellied lemur]] (''Eulemur rubriventer'').{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed,{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}}\n\nOne to three offspring (typically two) are born after 90&nbsp;days of [[gestation]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} weighing approximately {{convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}}.

Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] for [[mining]] activities.{{r|WWF_25Mar2010}}\n\nAs with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \"Class A\" of the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would be given only for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under [[CITES#Appendix I|CITES Appendix I]], which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily.

Two [[species]] have been formally described; the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza zaza'') and [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli''). Like all other [[lemur]]s, they are native to [[Madagascar]], where they are found in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|western dry deciduous forests]] and further to the north in the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano Valley]] and [[Sahamalaza National Park|Sahamalaza Peninsula]]. First [[Species description|described]] in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with [[mouse lemur]]s and [[dwarf lemur]]s. In 1870, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] assigned them to their own genus, ''Mirza''. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs, weighing approximately {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within [[Cheirogaleidae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of small, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit, [[Natural gum|tree gum]], insects, and small [[vertebrate]]s. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of [[torpor]] during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form [[pair bond]]s. The northern species also has the largest [[testicle]] size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of [[Seasonal breeder|seasonally]]. [[Home range]]s often overlap, with related females living closely together while males [[Biological dispersal|disperse]]. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]].\n\nPredators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Madagascar buzzard]], [[Madagascar owl]], [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]], and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]]. Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day [[gestation]]. Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years. Both species are listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[habitat destruction]] and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under [[CITES|CITES Appendix I]], which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The [[Duke Lemur Center]] coordinated the [[captive breeding]] of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62&nbsp;individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Mirza coquereli 1868.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Artistic illustration of a giant mouse lemur climbing on a branch|The giant mouse lemur described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen|Pollen]] in 1868 (illustrated above) was considered [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the species described by [[Alfred Grandidier|Grandidier]] (1867), but was shown to be a distinct species in 2005.]]\nThe first species of giant mouse lemur was [[Species description|described]] by the French naturalist [[Alfred Grandidier]] in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near [[Morondava]] in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] was selected in 1939 as MNHN&nbsp;1867\u2013603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist [[Charles Coquerel]],{{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Grandidier placed [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;coquereli'') with the [[dwarf lemur]]s in the [[genus]] ''Cheirogaleus'' (which he spelled ''Cheirogalus'') as ''C.&nbsp;coquereli''. He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with [[fork-marked lemur]]s (''Phaner''), which he considered to also be members of ''Cheirogaleus''. The following year, the German naturalist [[Hermann Schlegel]] and Dutch naturalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen]] independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, ''coquereli'', basing theirs on an individual from around the [[Bay of Ampasindava]] in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus ''Microcebus'' ([[mouse lemur]]s); however, these authors also listed all ''Cheirogaleus'' under ''Microcebus'' and based the classification of their species on similarities with the [[greater dwarf lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;typicus'', now ''C.&nbsp;major'').{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1870, the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, ''Mirza''. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], [[Guillaume Grandidier]], and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=325}} British anatomist [[William Charles Osman Hill]] also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to ''Cheirogaleus''), its first upper [[premolar]] was proportionally small as in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=333}} In 1977, French zoologist [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] also favored the ''Microcebus'' classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}\n\nThe genus ''Mirza'' was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]]{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} to represent an intermediate branch between ''Microcebus'' and ''Cheirogaleus'',{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}} citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest ''Microcebus'' and [[Animal locomotion|locomotor behavior]] more closely aligned with ''Cheirogaleus''.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Adoption of ''Mirza'' was slow,{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of ''[[Lemurs of Madagascar (book)|Lemurs of Madagascar]]'' by [[Conservation International]].{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}{{LoM1 Sfn|p=80}} In 1993, primatologist [[Colin Groves]] initially favored the ''Microcebus'' classification in the second edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'',{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but began supporting the resurrection of ''Mirza'' in 2001.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=70\u201371}} In 1991, prior to adopting ''Mirza'', Groves was the first to use the [[common name]] \"giant mouse lemur\". Prior to that, they were popularly referred to as \"Coquerel's mouse lemur\".{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|p=67}}\n\nIn 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos described a new species of giant mouse lemur, the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;zaza'').{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} Their studies compared the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[Cytochrome b|mitochondrial cytochrome b]] [[Sequencing|sequences]] of specimens from both [[Kirindy Forest]] in central-western Madagascar and around [[Ambato, Madagascar|Ambato]] in northwestern Madagascar,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} part of the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano valley]].{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, [[sociality]], and [[Reproduction|breeding]], as well as sufficient [[genetic distance]] to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description was based on a southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}\n\nThe [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced in 2010 that a [[biodiversity]] study from 2009 in the [[gallery forest]] of [[Ranobe, Madagascar|Ranobe]] near [[Toliara]] in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species.

Gray often created mysterious and unexplained [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic names]]\u2014a trend continued with his description of not only ''Mirza'' in 1870, but also the genera ''Phaner'' (fork-marked lemurs) and ''Azema'' (for ''[[Brown mouse lemur|M.&nbsp;rufus]]'', now a synonym for ''Microcebus''), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]] attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For ''Mirza'', Palmer only noted that it derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] title [[Mirza|m\u00eerz\u00e2]] (\"prince\"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel ''et al.'' also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], which premiered in London on 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (''sic''), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===Evolution===\nBased on studies using morphology, [[immunology]], [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]], [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINE]] analysis, [[Locus (genetics)|multilocus]] phylogenetic tests,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}} and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] (mtDNA),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a [[Cladistics|clade]] with the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus'').

In the wild, the lifespan of giant mouse lemurs is thought to rarely exceed five or six years,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} though in captivity they can live up to 15&nbsp;years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Madagascar buzzard.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Madagascar buzzard sitting on a branch|The [[Madagascar buzzard]] preys on giant mouse lemurs.]]\nBoth species are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, [[Natural gum|tree gums]], large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} and eggs.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is thought to opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} after an individual was found with a half-eaten [[gray mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;murinus'') in a trap.{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|p=1222}} During June and July, at the peak of the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the [[larva]]e of [[hemiptera]]n and [[cochineal]] insects as well as tree gums.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on [[cashew]] fruits during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are often [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with mouse lemurs, such as ''M.&nbsp;murinus'', though they are typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} At the [[Marosalaza]] forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages [[niche differentiation]] by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=115}}\n\n[[Diurnality|Diurnal]] [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] such as the [[Madagascar buzzard]] (''Buteo brachypterus'') are their most significant predators. Other documented predators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] (''Cryptoprocta ferox''), [[Madagascar owl]] (''Asio madagascariensis''), and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]] (''Mungotictis decemlineata'').{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|pp=1222\u20131223}}\n\n==Conservation==\nIn 2012, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) assessed both Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the northern giant mouse lemur as [[Endangered species|endangered]]. Prior to that, both species had been listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Populations of both species are in decline due to [[habitat destruction]], primarily for [[Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and [[charcoal]] production. Also, they are both hunted for [[bushmeat]].{{R|IUCN_Mirza_coquereli|IUCN_Mirza_zaza}} The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] for [[mining]] activities.{{r|WWF_25Mar2010}}\n\nAs with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \"Class A\" of the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would be given only for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under [[CITES#Appendix I|CITES Appendix I]], which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive population (45 of 62&nbsp;individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a [[captive breeding]] program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} from the region around Ambanja.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} As of 2009 the [[International Species Information System]] (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe, all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} in 2015 only a single female remained on record.{{R|ISIS_Mirza_2015}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"WWF_25Mar2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |title=New population of rare giant-mouse lemurs found in Madagascar |date=25 March 2010 |publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] |accessdate=1 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101100750/http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |archivedate=1 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBC_03Jul2015\">{{cite news |last=Walker |first=M. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Lemur found with giant testicles |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZphzXWDh?url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |archive-date=2015-07-07 |access-date=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_coquereli\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13584/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza coquereli'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_zaza\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136684/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza zaza'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ISIS_Mirza_2015\">{{cite report |title=Species holding report for: ''Mirza'' / Mouse lemur |year=2015 |publisher=[[International Species Information System]] (ISIS)}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CITES\">{{cite web |url=http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Mirza |title=Checklist of CITES Species |website=CITES |publisher=UNEP-WCMC |accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Literature cited===\n{{refbegin}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009}} -->{{cite book |last1=Beolens |first1=B. |last2=Watkins |first2=M. |last3=Grayson |first3=M. |title=The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I-kSmWLc6vYC |isbn=978-0-8018-9304-9 |oclc=270129903 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012}} -->{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=A.R. |last2=Zijlstra |first2=J.S. |last3=Groves |first3=C.P. |authorlink3=Colin Groves |title=Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 |url=http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf |journal=[[Lemur News]] |volume=16 |year=2012 |issn=1608-1439 |pages=64\u201370 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Fleagle|2013}} -->{{cite book |last1=Fleagle |first1=J.G. |authorlink1=John G.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]] and is the third in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|series of shows]] that lead to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover miniseries. The series is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with Coker serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Mike Colter]] stars as Luke Cage, a former convict with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin who now fights crime and corruption. [[Simone Missick]], [[Theo Rossi]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Alfre Woodard]] also star, with [[Mahershala Ali]] and [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] joining them for [[Luke Cage (season 1)|season one]], and [[Mustafa Shakir]] and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] joining for [[Luke Cage (season 2)|season two]]. Development of the series began in late 2013. In December 2014, Colter was cast as Cage, to appear first in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', with Coker hired as the showrunner in March 2015. The series is filmed in New York City, looking to replicate the unique culture and atmosphere of [[Harlem]].\n\nAll episodes of the first season premiered on September 30, 2016. They were met with positive reviews. In December 2016, Netflix renewed ''Luke Cage'' for a second season, which was released on June 22, 2018. Following creative differences between Netflix and the series' writers during the development of a third season, Netflix canceled the series on October 19, 2018.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nWhen a sabotaged experiment gives him super strength and unbreakable skin, [[Luke Cage]] becomes a fugitive attempting to rebuild his life in [[Harlem]] and must soon confront his past and fight a battle for the heart of his city.<ref name=\"Dillard\" /> After clearing his name, Cage becomes a hero and celebrity in Harlem, only to encounter a new threat that makes him confront the line between hero and villain.<ref name=\"S2Premiere\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Luke Cage characters}}\n<!-- Order per the series' opening credits, specifically episode 107 where all names are listed. -->\n* [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]]: <br />Former convict Carl Lucas was given superhuman strength and unbreakable skin, and now fights crime under the name Luke Cage.<ref name=\"Colter\" /><ref name=\"NetflixPosts\" /><ref name=\"Colter2\" /><ref name=\"CarlLucas\" /> Colter portrayed the character differently in the series than he had previously in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', explaining, \"You're not always the same person around everyone you know ... you might not necessarily behave the same way around your mom that you would with your wife or your boss\".<ref name=\"JJLCDiff\" /> The character uses his signature catch phrase 'Sweet Christmas' from the comics in the series,<ref name=\"ColterPhrase\" /> but sparingly, with the character often \"opting instead for pensive silence\"; composer [[Adrian Younge]] said, \"He's a black superhero, but he's a different type of black alpha male. He's not bombastic. You rarely see a modern black male character who is soulful and intelligent.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Colter put on {{convert|30|lb|kg}} of muscle for the role.<ref name=\"ColterAol\" /> David Austin and Clifton Cutrary portray a young and teenage Lucas, respectively.\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]]: <br />The owner of the Harlem's Paradise nightclub and the cousin of Mariah Dillard who deals in illegal operations.<ref name=\"Ali\" /><ref name=\"Ali2\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016TVLine\" /> Ali described Stokes as \"a ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]''-type villain\",<ref name=\"AliGodfather\" /> while Head of [[Marvel Television]] [[Jeph Loeb]] referred to him as \"the other hero of the story\", continuing the tradition of previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix]] villains [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] and [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]].<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Showrunner [[Cheo Hodari Coker]], a former music journalist, said that the attitude of rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]] particularly influenced his version of Cottonmouth.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /><ref name=\"CokerSmalls\" /> Ali took the role knowing that Stokes would die early on in the series, saying the experience \"was like shooting a film ... I found myself excited by a character's departure, because I felt like this was something I could give my all to for a period of time before saying 'peace' to him\".<ref name=\"AliEW\" /> Elijah Boothe portrays a young Stokes.\n* [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight|Mercedes \"Misty\" Knight]]: <br />A Harlem NYPD Detective with a strong sense of justice, who is determined to learn about Cage.<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> Missick said, \"She's her own person. She's not the wife. She's not a girlfriend. She's not a sidepiece or a sidekick.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Missick described Misty Knight as \"a person who has a very strong moral compass who is absolutely dedicated to protecting her community\", adding her proudest moment in playing the character, was the fact that she \"believes in the system, even though... [with] our current times, it's difficult to believe in the system.\"<ref name=\"MissickWhaleyCBR\" /> In the series, Knight has what Missick called a \"superpower\" referred to as 'Misty Vision' that allows her to look at a crime scene and deduce what happened.<ref name=\"MissickH&F\" />\n* [[Theo Rossi]] as [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]]: <br />A relentless, menacing, smooth and manipulative, street smart criminal working for Diamondback with ties to Cage's past.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Villains\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE112\" /> Loeb called Shades \"kind of the [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] of ''Luke Cage''\", \"the ultimate opportunist\".<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" />\n* [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]]: <br />A powerful arms dealer who is Cage's half-brother and the one who framed him for the crime that sent him to Seagate Prison.<ref name=\"Harvey\" /><ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> Harvey talked about the character's illegitimacy, saying being  \"called a bastard his whole life... [is] what drives Willis ... He gets sent away because of his father's actions and then once he's in the jail system, he just gets tortured. After all that, his mind's been twisted and warped, and he's developed this sensitivity that's almost psychopathic.\" The character is always seen smiling when killing or defaming Cage's name, which is \"just his way of dealing with his pain. He smiles through his pain.\"<ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> Jared Kemp portrays a teenage Stryker.\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]: <br />A former nurse in Hell's Kitchen, whose friendship with Cage will affect both of their lives.

It is ultimately used by Stokes as a personal insult from their past growing up together, in retaliation to Dillard verbally attacking him.<ref name=\"BlackMariah\" /> Megan Miller portrays a young Dillard.\n* [[Gabrielle Dennis]] as [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]]: An [[Alternative medicine#Holistic therapy|holistic doctor]] and the daughter of Mariah Dillard who cannot stay out of trouble in Harlem.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> \n* [[Mustafa Shakir]] as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver / Bushmaster]]: The leader of a Jamaican gang called the Stylers, who uses folk magic to gain powers almost equal to Cage's and who obsessively pursues revenge against the Stokes family.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| released     = y\n| allreleased  = y\n\n| color1       = #3E290C\n| link1        = #Season 1 (2016)\n| episodes1    = 13\n| start1       = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n\n| color2       = #93A9A7\n| link2        = #Season 2 (2018)\n| episodes2    = 13\n| start2       = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (2016)===\n{{main|Luke Cage (season 1)}}\n{{:Luke Cage (season 1)}}\n<!-- To edit the episodes in this section, you need to edit the article listed above. -->\n\n===Season 2 (2018)===\n{{main|Luke Cage (season 2)}}\n{{:Luke Cage (season 2)}}\n<!-- To edit the episodes in this section, you need to edit the article listed above. -->\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|1=Luke Cage (season 1)#Production|label 1=Production of season 1|2=Luke Cage (season 2)#Production|label 2=season 2}}\n\n===Development===\nIn May 2013, [[Marvel Studios]] reacquired the rights to [[Luke Cage]] from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] / [[Columbia Pictures]],<ref name=\"MarvelRights\" /> after a feature film had been in development at Columbia since 2003,<ref name=\"ColumbiaFilm\" /> to no avail. By October 2013, [[Marvel Television]] was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]], and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct2013\" /> A few weeks later, Marvel and Disney announced that Marvel Television and [[ABC Studios]] would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Luke Cage, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" />\n\nMarvel began their search for a showrunner in 2014,<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> and in late March 2015, Netflix and Marvel announced [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] in that role and revealed the title of the series to be ''Marvel's Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Coker\" /> Coker was inspired to become the series showrunner \"when he realized the ramifications of a series about a black man with impenetrable skin and how that might empower him to take on both criminals and crooked authority figures\";<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> he pitched the series to Netflix as an examination of Harlem, \"like what ''[[The Wire]]'' did for Baltimore.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Charles Murray, Alison Engel, Allie Goss, Kris Henigman, Cindy Holland, [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Joe Queseda]], [[Dan Buckley]], and Jim Chory also serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> The series was originally intended to be the fourth of the announced series from Netflix, debuting after ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Marvel's Iron Fist]]'', but it was fast-tracked to be the third series, after Cage was introduced in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'' and became a breakout star, with Marvel wanting to \"follow the momentum\".<ref name=\"OriginallyFourth\" /> In December 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.<ref name=\"Season2\" />\n\n===Writing===\nCharles Murray, Kayla Cooper, and Nathan Jackson served as writers on the series.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel3\" /> Coker noted that the majority of the series' writers are African-American, \"a rarity on television\".<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> After signing on to the series, Coker was able to read the first two scripts of both ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Marvel's Daredevil]]'' and ''Jessica Jones'', giving him an idea of the quality of writing for those series, and how important the development of their villains was.<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> Actor [[Mike Colter]] described the series as having \"soul\" and \"intensity\", compared to the \"dark action\" of ''Daredevil'' and the \"noir feel\" of ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Coker described \"a powerful fusion of dark drama, hip-hop, and classic superhero action\" while being \"''The Wire'' of Marvel television, because we really deal with a lot of different issues.\"<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Jason Tanz of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' likened the series to [[Blaxploitation|neo-blaxploitation]],<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> which Coker agreed with in that \"blaxploitation is [just] black characters being able to assert themselves in a visual world\", stating that he felt the series was more specifically a \"hip-hop [[Western (genre)#Contemporary Western|Western]]\", comparing its characters and setting to [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' of films (with Cage the [[Man with No Name]], for example).<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> Each episode title of the series is named after a song title from hip-hop duos: the first season's from [[Gang Starr]],<ref name=\"GangStarrTitles\" /> and the second season's from [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]].<ref name=\"S2EpTitles\" />\n\nWhen asked whether the series would feel as \"adult\" as ''Jessica Jones'', Colter replied, \"if you think ''Jessica'' is adult then we're still keeping up with that pace ... we'll continue along those lines of PG-16+\".<ref name=\"MossColterJJNYCC\" /> On whether ''Luke Cage'' would address current race issues, including [[Black Lives Matter]], given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, \"this is not necessarily the platform to hit it head on\" but \"the things that he's going through will ring true for a lot of people in law enforcement\" and on the street.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Loeb said on the issue, \"Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what's going on present day, it just resonates.\" Coker stated that Cage is \"someone that the community can touch and go to\", adding, \"There's never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man\" has been so important.<ref name=\"SDCC2016EW\" /> ''Luke Cage'' was also the first MCU property to use the word \"[[nigger]]\" or \"[[nigga]]\", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it \"in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, when would this word be used and how would it get used.\" Coker also likened the use in the series to \"the way music used to treat it,\" not having it be \"every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly.\"<ref name=\"WPBTS\" />\n\n===Casting===\nBy November 2014, [[Lance Gross]], Colter, and [[Cleo Anthony]] were in contention for the role of Luke Cage, which was envisioned as a recurring role on ''Jessica Jones'' before headlining ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Casting\" /> Colter was confirmed in the role the next month, as a series regular.<ref name=\"Colter\" /> He signed on for the two series without reading any scripts.<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> In August 2015, [[Alfre Woodard]], who portrays [[Miriam Sharpe]] in the MCU film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"WoodardCapCW\" /> was in talks to join the cast,<ref name=\"Woodard\" /> and the following month she was confirmed as a series regular, portraying [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]].<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Also announced as cast in September were [[Theo Rossi]] as Shades,<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight]],<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> and [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]].<ref name=\"Ali\" /> In November, [[Rosario Dawson]] was confirmed to be reprising her role of [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] from previous MCU Netflix series.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> In March 2016, set photos revealed [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] had been cast as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]].<ref name=\"Harvey\" /> Harvey's involvement was not officially announced by Marvel prior to the series' release, and he agreed not to do any publicity for it to not \"ruin the twist\" of Stryker being the series' main villain.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nColter, Missick, Rossi, Dawson, and Woodard returned for the second season.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> In July 2017, [[Mustafa Shakir]] and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] joined the cast, as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver]] and [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]], respectively.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky, the costume designer for ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', serves as costume designer for ''Luke Cage'' as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that was introduced in ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the \"rich and colorful history\" of Harlem, and Coker's own vision.<ref name=\"MaslanskyE\" /> In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered \"the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who is trying to keep his identity quiet.\" Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups.<ref name=\"MaslanskyVogue\" /> The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the series takes place in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> significantly in Harlem, where the series is set. Coker described the neighborhood as \"the only place in the city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets\".<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in [[Greenwich Village]] \"that would've been a little easier for us to shoot in\", but Coker said \"the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn't want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem.\"<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" /> Sound stage work also takes place in New York.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography for the series, after doing the same for ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by FuseFX,<ref name=\"FuseFX\" /> with Greg Anderson serving as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VarietyFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{further|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nIn April 2016, Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the series' score,<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> describing it as \"a confluence of multiple genres, a bit of ['90s] hip-hop, soul, psychedelic rock and classical\",<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /><ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> with \"a lot of different musical appearances\".<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Coker had contacted Younge and Muhammad separately, asking if they would like to work together on the series, not knowing that the pair were already working together on an album.<ref name=\"LCSpin\" /> Younge and Muhammad took inspiration from [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Ennio Morricone]], and Muhammad's group [[A Tribe Called Quest]],<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> with Younge saying, \"we wanted to make something great. Not just for black people or minorities, just something great that just happens to be based on our culture.\"<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Luke Cage (soundtrack)|first season]] was released on October 7, digitally and pressed on yellow vinyl by Mondo.<ref name=\"LiveScore\" /><ref name=\"VinylRelease\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\n''Luke Cage'' is the third of the ordered Netflix series after ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', and was followed by ''Iron Fist'', which lead to the miniseries, ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"OriginallyFourth\" /><ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"CageThird\" /> In November 2013, [[Disney]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that if the characters prove popular on Netflix, \"It's quite possible that they could become feature films,\"<ref name=\"VarietyTVNov2013\" /> which was echoed by Sarandos in July 2015.<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\" /> In August 2014, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', stated that after the \"series stuff with Netflix\", Marvel has \"a bigger plan to branch out\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioFuture\" /> In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]] and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC television series]], saying, \"It all exists in the same universe. As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', it became more practical for [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] to do a little crossover into ''[[Thor: The Dark World|Thor 2]]'' and for [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to appear at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going.\"<ref name=\"LoebDigitalSpy\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Luke Cage'' is available on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"Coker\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> The first season was enhanced to be available in HDR after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The episodes of each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been successful for [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|other Netflix original series]].<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" />\n\n===Marketing===\n[[Disney Consumer Products]] created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show's edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets like [[Hot Topic]]. Additionally, a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series, which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products.

The data, which came from Netflix's \"1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch\", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with ''Jessica Jones'', then ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and finally ''Iron Fist''. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series \"in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them.\" Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching ''Luke Cage'' would most often then move on to ''Iron Fist'', with Yellin figuring that ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' would have paired up more, given that Cage was introduced on ''Jessica Jones''. The data also revealed that fans of ''[[Stranger Things]]'' and other series that explore \"the dark side of society\" such as ''[[Black Mirror]]'', ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and the documentary ''[[Amanda Knox (film)|Amanda Knox]]'' led viewers to starting ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"NetflixAug2017ViewingPatterns\" /> In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the \"social-media buzz\" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in September 2016, the season had over 300,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it, and when the second season was released in June 2018, the posts had declined dramatically to under 50,000.<ref name=\"CrimsonHexagonData\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#3E290C;\"|\n| [[Luke Cage (season 1)#Critical response|1]]\n| 92% (72 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS1RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s01/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 1 (2016)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n| 79 (30 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS1MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 1|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#93a9a7;\"|\n| [[Luke Cage (season 2)#Critical response|2]]\n| 85% (62 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS2RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s02/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 2 (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n| 64 (13 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS2MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage/season-2|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 2|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 7.95/10 based on 72 reviews.

During the week of October 15, detailed scripts for the first half of those 10 episodes were delivered to Netflix and Marvel, incorporating ideas that had been plotted out for six months and notes received from Netflix and Marvel executives. Some of the executives had issues with these scripts, despite featuring many of the notes they asked to be included, with the creative differences devolving into \"behind-the-scenes turmoil\" by the end of the week, with some demands that a new showrunner be found for the season. With Marvel and Netflix on opposite sides of this disagreement, and the series being costly for Netflix even though they do not own the property, \"the only viable exit strategy\" was cancellation, with the series officially canceled by Netflix on October 19, 2018. ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted that, unlike fellow series ''Iron Fist'' which had been canceled a week earlier, Marvel had no plans to continue or revive the series on another platform such as [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"Cancellation\" /> especially since, per the original deal between Marvel and Netflix for the series, the characters cannot appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellation of ''Luke Cage'', as reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=\"TwoYearWait\" /> [[Kevin A. Mayer]], chairman of [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]], noted that, while it had not yet been discussed, it was a possibility that Disney+ could revive the series.<ref name=\"Disney+Possible\" /> In February 2019, [[Hulu]]'s senior vice president of originals Craig Erwich said that the streaming service was open to reviving the series, along with the other former Netflix series.<ref name=\"HuluInterestFeb2019\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelRights\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837 |title=A Spago dinner sets the stage for Downey's epic contract talks that could lead to more \"Avengers\" and \"Iron Man 4\" \u2013 or a new Tony Stark |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |last2=Bond |first2=Paul |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=May 8, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GgpzZ0sH?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837 |archivedate=May 17, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ColumbiaFilm\">{{cite web |url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-103449310/col-locks-up-cage-rights-marvel-character-screenbound |title=Col locks up 'Cage' rights: Marvel character screen-bound.

[[Marvel Comics]] [[Luke Cage|character of the same name]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]] and is the third in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|series of shows]] that lead to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover miniseries. The series is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with Coker serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Mike Colter]] stars as Luke Cage, a former convict with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin who now fights crime and corruption. [[Simone Missick]], [[Theo Rossi]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Alfre Woodard]] also star, with [[Mahershala Ali]] and [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] joining them for [[Luke Cage (season 1)|season one]], and [[Mustafa Shakir]] and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] joining for [[Luke Cage (season 2)|season two]]. Development of the series began in late 2013. In December 2014, Colter was cast as Cage, to appear first in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', with Coker hired as the showrunner in March 2015. The series is filmed in New York City, looking to replicate the unique culture and atmosphere of [[Harlem]].\n\nAll episodes of the first season premiered on September 30, 2016. They were met with positive reviews. In December 2016, Netflix renewed ''Luke Cage'' for a second season, which was released on June 22, 2018. Following creative differences between Netflix and the series' writers during the development of a third season, Netflix canceled the series on October 19, 2018.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nWhen a sabotaged experiment gives him super strength and unbreakable skin, [[Luke Cage]] becomes a fugitive attempting to rebuild his life in [[Harlem]] and must soon confront his past and fight a battle for the heart of his city.<ref name=\"Dillard\" /> After clearing his name, Cage becomes a hero and celebrity in Harlem, only to encounter a new threat that makes him confront the line between hero and villain.<ref name=\"S2Premiere\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Luke Cage characters}}\n<!-- Order per the series' opening credits, specifically episode 107 where all names are listed. -->\n* [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]]: <br />Former convict Carl Lucas was given superhuman strength and unbreakable skin, and now fights crime under the name Luke Cage.<ref name=\"Colter\" /><ref name=\"NetflixPosts\" /><ref name=\"Colter2\" /><ref name=\"CarlLucas\" /> Colter portrayed the character differently in the series than he had previously in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', explaining, \"You're not always the same person around everyone you know ... you might not necessarily behave the same way around your mom that you would with your wife or your boss\".<ref name=\"JJLCDiff\" /> The character uses his signature catch phrase 'Sweet Christmas' from the comics in the series,<ref name=\"ColterPhrase\" /> but sparingly, with the character often \"opting instead for pensive silence\"; composer [[Adrian Younge]] said, \"He's a black superhero, but he's a different type of black alpha male. He's not bombastic. You rarely see a modern black male character who is soulful and intelligent.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Colter put on {{convert|30|lb|kg}} of muscle for the role.<ref name=\"ColterAol\" /> David Austin and Clifton Cutrary portray a young and teenage Lucas, respectively.\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]]: <br />The owner of the Harlem's Paradise nightclub and the cousin of Mariah Dillard who deals in illegal operations.<ref name=\"Ali\" /><ref name=\"Ali2\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016TVLine\" /> Ali described Stokes as \"a ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]''-type villain\",<ref name=\"AliGodfather\" /> while Head of [[Marvel Television]] [[Jeph Loeb]] referred to him as \"the other hero of the story\", continuing the tradition of previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix]] villains [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] and [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]].<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Showrunner [[Cheo Hodari Coker]], a former music journalist, said that the attitude of rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]] particularly influenced his version of Cottonmouth.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /><ref name=\"CokerSmalls\" /> Ali took the role knowing that Stokes would die early on in the series, saying the experience \"was like shooting a film ... I found myself excited by a character's departure, because I felt like this was something I could give my all to for a period of time before saying 'peace' to him\".<ref name=\"AliEW\" /> Elijah Boothe portrays a young Stokes.\n* [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight|Mercedes \"Misty\" Knight]]: <br />A Harlem NYPD Detective with a strong sense of justice, who is determined to learn about Cage.<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> Missick said, \"She's her own person. She's not the wife. She's not a girlfriend. She's not a sidepiece or a sidekick.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Missick described Misty Knight as \"a person who has a very strong moral compass who is absolutely dedicated to protecting her community\", adding her proudest moment in playing the character, was the fact that she \"believes in the system, even though... [with] our current times, it's difficult to believe in the system.\"<ref name=\"MissickWhaleyCBR\" /> In the series, Knight has what Missick called a \"superpower\" referred to as 'Misty Vision' that allows her to look at a crime scene and deduce what happened.<ref name=\"MissickH&F\" />\n* [[Theo Rossi]] as [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]]: <br />A relentless, menacing, smooth and manipulative, street smart criminal working for Diamondback with ties to Cage's past.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Villains\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /><ref name=\"DoGEE112\" /> Loeb called Shades \"kind of the [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] of ''Luke Cage''\", \"the ultimate opportunist\".<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" />\n* [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]]: <br />A powerful arms dealer who is Cage's half-brother and the one who framed him for the crime that sent him to Seagate Prison.<ref name=\"Harvey\" /><ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> Harvey talked about the character's illegitimacy, saying being  \"called a bastard his whole life... [is] what drives Willis ... He gets sent away because of his father's actions and then once he's in the jail system, he just gets tortured. After all that, his mind's been twisted and warped, and he's developed this sensitivity that's almost psychopathic.\" The character is always seen smiling when killing or defaming Cage's name, which is \"just his way of dealing with his pain. He smiles through his pain.\"<ref name=\"HarveyEW\" /> Jared Kemp portrays a teenage Stryker.\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]: <br />A former nurse in Hell's Kitchen, whose friendship with Cage will affect both of their lives. Dawson reprises her role from the previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> \"Because she plays a nurse that basically seems to be in the right place at the right time, and she's very good at helping out superheroes who are in need, and I think you will see some of that in ''Luke Cage'',\" said Colter. \"Ultimately I think she's going to be a very good companion for Luke. I think she's someone that Luke needs in his life at this time.\"<ref name=\"ClaireTemple\" />\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]]: <br />A local councilwoman and Stokes' cousin looking to bring change to Harlem, whose life is \"thrown into turmoil\" by the actions of Cage and Stokes.<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Though Dillard is not necessarily a criminal herself, she does feel a responsibility to her family, including Stokes.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Villains\" /> Woodard, who lives in Harlem, was convinced to join the project after Coker proved his love of Harlem and its culture.<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> The series' version of the character is significantly different from the comics' Black Mariah, but Coker wanted to pay homage to her origins by using \"Black Mariah\" as a nickname. It is ultimately used by Stokes as a personal insult from their past growing up together, in retaliation to Dillard verbally attacking him.<ref name=\"BlackMariah\" /> Megan Miller portrays a young Dillard.\n* [[Gabrielle Dennis]] as [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]]: An [[Alternative medicine#Holistic therapy|holistic doctor]] and the daughter of Mariah Dillard who cannot stay out of trouble in Harlem.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> \n* [[Mustafa Shakir]] as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver / Bushmaster]]: The leader of a Jamaican gang called the Stylers, who uses folk magic to gain powers almost equal to Cage's and who obsessively pursues revenge against the Stokes family.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| released     = y\n| allreleased  = y\n\n| color1       = #3E290C\n| link1        = #Season 1 (2016)\n| episodes1    = 13\n| start1       = {{Start date|2016|9|30}}\n\n| color2       = #93A9A7\n| link2        = #Season 2 (2018)\n| episodes2    = 13\n| start2       = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (2016)===\n{{main|Luke Cage (season 1)}}\n{{:Luke Cage (season 1)}}\n<!-- To edit the episodes in this section, you need to edit the article listed above. -->\n\n===Season 2 (2018)===\n{{main|Luke Cage (season 2)}}\n{{:Luke Cage (season 2)}}\n<!-- To edit the episodes in this section, you need to edit the article listed above. -->\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|1=Luke Cage (season 1)#Production|label 1=Production of season 1|2=Luke Cage (season 2)#Production|label 2=season 2}}\n\n===Development===\nIn May 2013, [[Marvel Studios]] reacquired the rights to [[Luke Cage]] from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] / [[Columbia Pictures]],<ref name=\"MarvelRights\" /> after a feature film had been in development at Columbia since 2003,<ref name=\"ColumbiaFilm\" /> to no avail. By October 2013, [[Marvel Television]] was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]], and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct2013\" /> A few weeks later, Marvel and Disney announced that Marvel Television and [[ABC Studios]] would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Luke Cage, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" />\n\nMarvel began their search for a showrunner in 2014,<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> and in late March 2015, Netflix and Marvel announced [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] in that role and revealed the title of the series to be ''Marvel's Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Coker\" /> Coker was inspired to become the series showrunner \"when he realized the ramifications of a series about a black man with impenetrable skin and how that might empower him to take on both criminals and crooked authority figures\";<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> he pitched the series to Netflix as an examination of Harlem, \"like what ''[[The Wire]]'' did for Baltimore.\"<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> Charles Murray, Alison Engel, Allie Goss, Kris Henigman, Cindy Holland, [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Joe Queseda]], [[Dan Buckley]], and Jim Chory also serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> The series was originally intended to be the fourth of the announced series from Netflix, debuting after ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Marvel's Iron Fist]]'', but it was fast-tracked to be the third series, after Cage was introduced in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'' and became a breakout star, with Marvel wanting to \"follow the momentum\".<ref name=\"OriginallyFourth\" /> In December 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.<ref name=\"Season2\" />\n\n===Writing===\nCharles Murray, Kayla Cooper, and Nathan Jackson served as writers on the series.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel3\" /> Coker noted that the majority of the series' writers are African-American, \"a rarity on television\".<ref name=\"TimeTeam\" /> After signing on to the series, Coker was able to read the first two scripts of both ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Marvel's Daredevil]]'' and ''Jessica Jones'', giving him an idea of the quality of writing for those series, and how important the development of their villains was.<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> Actor [[Mike Colter]] described the series as having \"soul\" and \"intensity\", compared to the \"dark action\" of ''Daredevil'' and the \"noir feel\" of ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Coker described \"a powerful fusion of dark drama, hip-hop, and classic superhero action\" while being \"''The Wire'' of Marvel television, because we really deal with a lot of different issues.\"<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Jason Tanz of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' likened the series to [[Blaxploitation|neo-blaxploitation]],<ref name=\"WiredAug2016\" /> which Coker agreed with in that \"blaxploitation is [just] black characters being able to assert themselves in a visual world\", stating that he felt the series was more specifically a \"hip-hop [[Western (genre)#Contemporary Western|Western]]\", comparing its characters and setting to [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' of films (with Cage the [[Man with No Name]], for example).<ref name=\"CokerGQ\" /> Each episode title of the series is named after a song title from hip-hop duos: the first season's from [[Gang Starr]],<ref name=\"GangStarrTitles\" /> and the second season's from [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]].<ref name=\"S2EpTitles\" />\n\nWhen asked whether the series would feel as \"adult\" as ''Jessica Jones'', Colter replied, \"if you think ''Jessica'' is adult then we're still keeping up with that pace ... we'll continue along those lines of PG-16+\".<ref name=\"MossColterJJNYCC\" /> On whether ''Luke Cage'' would address current race issues, including [[Black Lives Matter]], given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, \"this is not necessarily the platform to hit it head on\" but \"the things that he's going through will ring true for a lot of people in law enforcement\" and on the street.<ref name=\"ColterDec2015\" /> Loeb said on the issue, \"Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what's going on present day, it just resonates.\" Coker stated that Cage is \"someone that the community can touch and go to\", adding, \"There's never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man\" has been so important.<ref name=\"SDCC2016EW\" /> ''Luke Cage'' was also the first MCU property to use the word \"[[nigger]]\" or \"[[nigga]]\", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it \"in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, when would this word be used and how would it get used.\" Coker also likened the use in the series to \"the way music used to treat it,\" not having it be \"every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly.\"<ref name=\"WPBTS\" />\n\n===Casting===\nBy November 2014, [[Lance Gross]], Colter, and [[Cleo Anthony]] were in contention for the role of Luke Cage, which was envisioned as a recurring role on ''Jessica Jones'' before headlining ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Casting\" /> Colter was confirmed in the role the next month, as a series regular.<ref name=\"Colter\" /> He signed on for the two series without reading any scripts.<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> In August 2015, [[Alfre Woodard]], who portrays [[Miriam Sharpe]] in the MCU film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"WoodardCapCW\" /> was in talks to join the cast,<ref name=\"Woodard\" /> and the following month she was confirmed as a series regular, portraying [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]].<ref name=\"Dillard\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" /> Also announced as cast in September were [[Theo Rossi]] as Shades,<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight]],<ref name=\"Missick\" /><ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /> and [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes]].<ref name=\"Ali\" /> In November, [[Rosario Dawson]] was confirmed to be reprising her role of [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] from previous MCU Netflix series.<ref name=\"MarvelCast\" /><ref name=\"Rossi\" /> In March 2016, set photos revealed [[Erik LaRay Harvey]] had been cast as [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker / Diamondback]].<ref name=\"Harvey\" /> Harvey's involvement was not officially announced by Marvel prior to the series' release, and he agreed not to do any publicity for it to not \"ruin the twist\" of Stryker being the series' main villain.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nColter, Missick, Rossi, Dawson, and Woodard returned for the second season.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> In July 2017, [[Mustafa Shakir]] and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] joined the cast, as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver]] and [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]], respectively.<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky, the costume designer for ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', serves as costume designer for ''Luke Cage'' as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that was introduced in ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the \"rich and colorful history\" of Harlem, and Coker's own vision.<ref name=\"MaslanskyE\" /> In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered \"the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who is trying to keep his identity quiet.\" Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups.<ref name=\"MaslanskyVogue\" /> The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the series takes place in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> significantly in Harlem, where the series is set. Coker described the neighborhood as \"the only place in the city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets\".<ref name=\"CokerTCA2016\" /> For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in [[Greenwich Village]] \"that would've been a little easier for us to shoot in\", but Coker said \"the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn't want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem.\"<ref name=\"CBRHarlem\" /> Sound stage work also takes place in New York.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography for the series, after doing the same for ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by FuseFX,<ref name=\"FuseFX\" /> with Greg Anderson serving as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VarietyFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{further|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nIn April 2016, Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the series' score,<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> describing it as \"a confluence of multiple genres, a bit of ['90s] hip-hop, soul, psychedelic rock and classical\",<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /><ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> with \"a lot of different musical appearances\".<ref name=\"CokerApril2016\" /> Coker had contacted Younge and Muhammad separately, asking if they would like to work together on the series, not knowing that the pair were already working together on an album.<ref name=\"LCSpin\" /> Younge and Muhammad took inspiration from [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Ennio Morricone]], and Muhammad's group [[A Tribe Called Quest]],<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> with Younge saying, \"we wanted to make something great. Not just for black people or minorities, just something great that just happens to be based on our culture.\"<ref name=\"StreetLevelMusic/Film\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Luke Cage (soundtrack)|first season]] was released on October 7, digitally and pressed on yellow vinyl by Mondo.<ref name=\"LiveScore\" /><ref name=\"VinylRelease\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\n''Luke Cage'' is the third of the ordered Netflix series after ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'', and was followed by ''Iron Fist'', which lead to the miniseries, ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"OriginallyFourth\" /><ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"CageThird\" /> In November 2013, [[Disney]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that if the characters prove popular on Netflix, \"It's quite possible that they could become feature films,\"<ref name=\"VarietyTVNov2013\" /> which was echoed by Sarandos in July 2015.<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\" /> In August 2014, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', stated that after the \"series stuff with Netflix\", Marvel has \"a bigger plan to branch out\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioFuture\" /> In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]] and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC television series]], saying, \"It all exists in the same universe. As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', it became more practical for [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] to do a little crossover into ''[[Thor: The Dark World|Thor 2]]'' and for [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to appear at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going.\"<ref name=\"LoebDigitalSpy\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Luke Cage'' is available on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"Coker\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> The first season was enhanced to be available in HDR after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The episodes of each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been successful for [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|other Netflix original series]].<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" />\n\n===Marketing===\n[[Disney Consumer Products]] created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show's edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets like [[Hot Topic]]. Additionally, a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series, which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products.

The data, which came from Netflix's \"1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch\", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with ''Jessica Jones'', then ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and finally ''Iron Fist''. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series \"in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them.\" Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching ''Luke Cage'' would most often then move on to ''Iron Fist'', with Yellin figuring that ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' would have paired up more, given that Cage was introduced on ''Jessica Jones''. The data also revealed that fans of ''[[Stranger Things]]'' and other series that explore \"the dark side of society\" such as ''[[Black Mirror]]'', ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and the documentary ''[[Amanda Knox (film)|Amanda Knox]]'' led viewers to starting ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"NetflixAug2017ViewingPatterns\" /> In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the \"social-media buzz\" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in September 2016, the season had over 300,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it, and when the second season was released in June 2018, the posts had declined dramatically to under 50,000.<ref name=\"CrimsonHexagonData\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#3E290C;\"|\n| [[Luke Cage (season 1)#Critical response|1]]\n| 92% (72 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS1RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s01/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 1 (2016)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n| 79 (30 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS1MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 1|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#93a9a7;\"|\n| [[Luke Cage (season 2)#Critical response|2]]\n| 85% (62 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS2RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s02/|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 2 (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n| 64 (13 reviews)<ref name=\"LCS2MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage/season-2|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 2|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 7.95/10 based on 72 reviews.

During the week of October 15, detailed scripts for the first half of those 10 episodes were delivered to Netflix and Marvel, incorporating ideas that had been plotted out for six months and notes received from Netflix and Marvel executives. Some of the executives had issues with these scripts, despite featuring many of the notes they asked to be included, with the creative differences devolving into \"behind-the-scenes turmoil\" by the end of the week, with some demands that a new showrunner be found for the season. With Marvel and Netflix on opposite sides of this disagreement, and the series being costly for Netflix even though they do not own the property, \"the only viable exit strategy\" was cancellation, with the series officially canceled by Netflix on October 19, 2018. ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted that, unlike fellow series ''Iron Fist'' which had been canceled a week earlier, Marvel had no plans to continue or revive the series on another platform such as [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"Cancellation\" /> especially since, per the original deal between Marvel and Netflix for the series, the characters cannot appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellation of ''Luke Cage'', as reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=\"TwoYearWait\" /> [[Kevin A. Mayer]], chairman of [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]], noted that, while it had not yet been discussed, it was a possibility that Disney+ could revive the series.<ref name=\"Disney+Possible\" /> In February 2019, [[Hulu]]'s senior vice president of originals Craig Erwich said that the streaming service was open to reviving the series, along with the other former Netflix series.<ref name=\"HuluInterestFeb2019\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelRights\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837 |title=A Spago dinner sets the stage for Downey's epic contract talks that could lead to more \"Avengers\" and \"Iron Man 4\" \u2013 or a new Tony Stark |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |last2=Bond |first2=Paul |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=May 8, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GgpzZ0sH?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837 |archivedate=May 17, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ColumbiaFilm\">{{cite web |url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-103449310/col-locks-up-cage-rights-marvel-character-screenbound |title=Col locks up 'Cage' rights: Marvel character screen-bound.

Many of the first anarchists in Belarus were dissatisfied with the moderate positions and \"generality\" of existing socialist parties like the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Labour Bund]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), and the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]].

For these anarchists, [[democracy]] was not a viable alternative, as the word meant \"''kriya''\", or power, specifically of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe most decisive tactics used by these anarchists were [[expropriation]] and the incitation of [[individual terror]], which created a halo of the \"defenders of the working class\" around them.

Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon Lenin's party will even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]]. But to distinguish itself from the anarchist-communists and Esser-communists, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] stresses in his name - \"Communist Bolsheviks\"...\n\nIf in the central part of Russia this union was soon broken up, in German-occupied Belarus, the united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. But then repressions - on the one hand, attracting loyal anarchist Communists to the Communist Party - on the other, the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. But until the early 1920s, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles were still operating in Belarus. Soon, however, the Councils of People's Self-Government, which was the dream of Peter Kropotkin's supporters, were finally turned by the party bureaucracy into its auxiliary bodies. The anarchists added to the exiles and political isolators.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430! \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f!|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|publisher=\u0428SS|year=2015|isbn=|location=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Anarchism in Republic Belarus ==\nThe revival of anarchism takes place already in the years of [[perestroika]]. However, in the 60-70s in Minsk, [[Gomel]] and other cities there were \"hippies,\" which can be referred to as anarchist subculture with a certain degree of tension. However, there were no organizations in this case.\n\nIn the spring of 1991, Gomel anarchists took part in a citywide strike, helping the workers of the \"Polespechat\" factory to join it.\n\nIn summer 1992, at the initiative of Oleg Novikov, at a congress in Minsk, activists from Minsk, Gomel and Svetlogorsk joined the Federation of Anarchists of Belarus (FAB).\n\nOn October 6th, 1992, International Unemployment Day, Gomel anarchists held an unsanctioned rally, which ended in clashes with police and arrests. The same year the \"Union of the Unemployed\" was created with the participation of Gomel anarchists and agitation campaigns were organized at the city enterprises. The Anarchy newspaper, the first anarchist edition in Belarus, was published in Gomel in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 in Minsk the anti-party group \"Chyrvony Zhong\" also started its activity, which played a significant role in the development of the anarchist movement in Belarus.\n\nSince the beginning of 1998, the Navinki newspaper has been published. At the beginning of 1999, as a result of the happening campaign \"Legalize It\", the newspaper Navinki was officially registered, which had previously been published illegally. At the same time, Chyrvonyi Zhong, which originally issued Navinki, was banned in Belarus.\n\nOne of the longest and at the same time the most successful actions, conducted with the participation of Belarusian anarchists, can be considered the environmental campaign \"Viasiolka\", launched in 1998. The campaign was directed against the plans of the [[Belarusian nuclear power plant|Belarusian NPP]] construction developed by the government. With the participation of the FAB activists, an independent environmental initiative Ecasupraciou was created, which took upon itself the organization of the whole campaign, to which were drawn employees of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, interested scientists, press, as well as activists of the Russian radical environmental movement Rainbow Keepers, who had experience of such events. The newspaper Viasiolka started to be published. Its pages covered all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and radioecology. During 1998-99 with the help of scientists several seminars were organized on the expediency of NPP construction. In summer 1998, the activists of Ekasupravu organized a \"March for Nuclear Free Belarus\" on the planned sites of the NPP construction in [[Mogilev Region|Mahiliou voblast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy in By - \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0437\u043c \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a|first=\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\u043a|publisher=Samizdat|year=2003|isbn=|location=Minsk|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
