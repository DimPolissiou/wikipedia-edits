It serves as the official [[app store]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018.\n\nApplications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name=\"3.5 million apps\"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\n\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], [[Google Play Movies & TV]] and [[Google Play Music]]. Following their re-branding, Google has gradually expanded the geographical support for each of the services.\n\n== Catalog content ==\n\n=== Android applications ===\n{{Further|Android

As stated in a help page for the Android Open Source Project, \"Devices that are \"Android compatible\" may participate in the Android ecosystem, including Android Market; devices that don't meet the compatibility requirements exist outside that ecosystem.

It serves as the official [[app store]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018.\n\nApplications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name=\"3.5 million apps\"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\n\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], [[Google Play Movies & TV]] and [[Google Play Music]]. Following their re-branding, Google has gradually expanded the geographical support for each of the services.\n\n== Catalog content ==\n\n=== Android applications ===\n{{Further|Android (operating

The application used a [[JavaScript]] exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\".

A drop in the oxygen carried in blood is known as [[hypoxemia]]; a rise in arterial [[carbon dioxide]] levels is called [[hypercapnia]]. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level, and can be either [[acute respiratory failure|acute]] or [[chronic respiratory failure|chronic]]. The definition of respiratory failure in clinical trials usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and  evidence of increased work of breathing.

These include [[thromboembolism|thromboembolic conditions]] and conditions which reduce the output of the [[right heart]], such as [[right heart failure]] and some [[myocardial infarction]]s.\n*Conditions which limit the ability of the lung tissue to [[gas exchange|exchange]] oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air within the lungs. Any disease which can damage the lung tissue can fit into this category. The most common causes are (in no particular order) [[lower respiratory tract infection|infections]], [[interstitial lung disease]], and [[pulmonary oedema]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===Type 1===\nType 1 respiratory failure is defined as a [[hypoxemia|low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia)]] with either a normal (normocapnia) or low (hypocapnia) level of carbon dioxide (P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) but not an increased level (hypercapnia). It is typically caused by a ventilation/perfusion ([[V/Q]]) mismatch; the volume of air flowing in and out of the lungs is not matched with the flow of blood to the lungs. The basic defect in type 1 respiratory failure is failure of oxygenation characterized by:\n\n:::{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || decreased (< {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})\n|-\n| P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> || normal or decreased (<{{convert|50|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})\n|-\n| P<sub>A-a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || increased\n|}\n\nThis type of respiratory failure is caused by conditions that affect [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] such as:\n* Low ambient oxygen (e.g. at high altitude)\n* Ventilation-perfusion mismatch (parts of the lung receive oxygen but not enough blood to absorb it, e.g. [[pulmonary embolism]])\n* Alveolar hypoventilation (decreased [[respiratory minute volume|minute volume]] due to reduced respiratory muscle activity, e.g. in acute [[neuromuscular disease]]); this form can also cause type 2 respiratory failure if severe\n* Diffusion problem (oxygen cannot enter the capillaries due to parenchymal disease, e.g. in [[pneumonia]] or [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]])\n* Shunt (oxygenated blood mixes with non-oxygenated blood from the venous system, e.g. [[Right-to-left shunt|right to left shunt]])\n\n===Type 2===\n[[Hypoxemia]] (PaO2 <8kPa or normal) with hypercapnia (PaCO2 >6.0kPa).\n\nThe basic defect in type 2 respiratory failure is characterized by:\n\n:::{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || decreased (< {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})or normal\n|-\n| P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> || increased (> {{convert|50|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})\n|-\n| P<sub>A-a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || normal\n|-\n|pH || <7.35\n|}\n\nType 2 respiratory failure is caused by inadequate alveolar ventilation; both oxygen and carbon dioxide are affected.

A drop in the oxygen carried in blood is known as [[hypoxemia]]; a rise in arterial [[carbon dioxide]] levels is called [[hypercapnia]].
