It is very closely related to [[Nukumanu language|Nukumanu]] and [[Nukuria language|Nukuria]] from Papua New Guinea and to [[Ontong Java language|Ontong Java]] and [[Sikaiana language|Sikaiana]] from Solomon Islands.<ref name=\"e18\"/>\n\n==Population==\nThe Takuu language is spoken in Mortlock village on the Takuu atoll (Marqueen Islands) off the east coast of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. Takuu lies about 250&nbsp;km to the northeast of Kieta, capital of Bougainville. The atoll consists of about 13 islands, but most of the population lives on a small neighboring island named Nukutoa. The islands are inhabited by approximately, 400 people of Polynesian origin. The people who speak the Takuu language are known \u201cthe people of Takuu\u201d or just Takuu. According to [[Ethnologue]], there are about 1,750 speakers of the Takuu language.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class\u201dwikitable \u201c\n![[Labial consonant|labial]]\n![[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]]\n![[Velar consonant|velar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|glottal]]\n|-\n| m || n \n|-\n| p || t || k\n|-\n| f v || s || || h\n|-\n| || l r \n|}\nTakuu has eleven consonants: f, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, and h. Moyle states that the consonants containing stops consist of the letters, p, t and k. The consonants named fricatives are, f/v, s and h. The nasal consonants are m and n, the lateral consonant is, l, and the approximant is r. The labial consonants consist of p, f/v and m. The apical consonants consist of, t, s, n, l and r. The velar consonant is k and the glottal is h (Moyle 2011). According to Moyle, \u201cthere is a length distinction in the vowels and between single and geminate consonants that is phonemic and important for correct pronunciation.\u201d Moyle states that these distinctions affect not only the vowel length but also the stress patterns when saying different words. Moyle says that very often will you find people who pronounce the same words with a vowel between those consonants. There are also expanded forms of different words when used in songs.\n\n===Vowels===\nAccording to Richard Moyle from the Takuu grammar and dictionary book, the vowels that are in the Takuu language consist of, \u201ca, e, i, o, and u\u201d.\n\nHe stated that the high vowels /u/ and /i/ are pronounced as glides /w/ and /j/ respectively, especially when they precede the low back vowel /a/, or when /u/ precedes /i/.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Basic Word Order===\nThe basic word order in the Takuu language is [[Subject-Object-Verb]].\n\n*\u201cNaa tama raa ku honusia ttai\u201d. \u2192 The tide overtook the people.\n*\u201cAku karamata e ausia te au\u201d. \u2192 The smoke is irritating my eyes.\n\n===Reduplication===\nThe Takuu language also uses [[reduplication]] in their language.

There are exceptions: some verbs have only one form. When the first syllable is reduplicated, the vowel is omitted, forming an initial geminate consonant. However, among older speakers, the syllable reduplication is retained. It is also routinely retained in singing to achieve a predetermined number of syllables in a poetic line.

The Takuu language has a unique counting system of words just like any other language in the world, but use different words for counting different things. The Takuu [[counting system]] doesn\u2019t have one set of words, but many different sets of words. According to Richard Moyle\u2019s research on the Takuu language, they have words for counting cardinals, coin money, net mesh, coconuts and stones, fish, length of ropes, length of woods, humans, and canoes. According to Moyle, the counting system of the Takuu language extends from 1 to 1000 (Moyle, 2011).\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n===Indigenous Vocabulary===\n*Sell \u2192 \u201cTaavi\u201d\n*Sennit \u2192\u201cKaha\u201d\n*Shade \u2192 \u201cShade\u201d\n*Severe \u2192 \u201cMahi\u201d\n*Wavy \u2192 \u201cMana\u201d\n*Way \u2192 \u201cAva\u201d\n*War \u2192 \u201cUoo\u201d\n\n===Comparative Vocabulary===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" |\n!\n!Takuu\n![[Samoan language|Samoan]]\n![[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]]\n![[Rarotongan language|Rarotongan]]\n![[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]]\n![[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]\n|-\n|''sky''\n|{{IPA|/\u027eani/}}\n|{{IPA|/la\u014bi/}}\n|\n|{{IPA|/\u027ea\u014bi/}}\n|{{IPA|/\u027ea\u014bi/}}\n|{{IPA|/lani/}}\n|-\n|''north wind''\n|{{IPA|/toko\u027eau/}}\n|{{IPA|/to\u0294elau/}}\n|{{IPA|/tokelau/}}\n|{{IPA|/toke\u027eau/}}\n|{{IPA|/toke\u027eau/}}\n|{{IPA|/ko\u0294olau/}}\n|-\n|''woman''\n|{{IPA|/ffine/}}\n|{{IPA|/fafine/}}\n|{{IPA|/fafine/}}\n|{{IPA|/va\u0294ine/}}\n|{{IPA|/wahine/}}\n|{{IPA|/wahine/}}\n|-\n|''house''\n|{{IPA|/fa\u027ee/}}\n|{{IPA|/fale/}}\n|{{IPA|/fale/}}\n|{{IPA|/\u0294a\u027ee/}}\n|{{IPA|/\u0278a\u027ee/}}\n|{{IPA|/hale/}}\n|-\n|''parent''\n|{{IPA|/ma\u02d0tua/}}\n|{{IPA|/matua/}}\n|\n|{{IPA|/metua/}}\n|{{IPA|/matua/}}\n|{{IPA|/makua/}}\n|-\n|''mother''\n|{{IPA|/tinna/, /tinna\u02d0/}}\n|{{IPA|/tina\u02d0/}}\n|{{IPA|/ma\u02d0tua/}}\n|{{IPA|/ma\u02d0ma\u02d0/}}\n|{{IPA|/\u0278aea/}}\n|{{IPA|/makuahine/}}\n|-\n|''father''\n|{{IPA|/tama/, /tamana/}}\n|{{IPA|/tama\u02d0/}}\n|{{IPA|/tama/, /tamana/}}\n|{{IPA|/metua/, /pa\u02d0pa\u02d0/}}\n|{{IPA|/matua/, /pa\u02d0pa\u02d0/}}\n|{{IPA|/makua ka\u02d0ne/}}\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Endangerment==\nWhile Takuu is not presently considered seriously endangered as it is vigorously spoken throughout the island, it is becoming increasingly threatened as an ever greater number of the island's inhabitants are leaving the island because of economic hardships and the impact of climate change and rising sea levels. Many of Takuu's younger generations living abroad no longer use Takuu in everyday conversation while the population of the island itself is becoming more and more depleted. Takuu activist Raroteone Tefuarani said that she was shocked when seeing the rapid loss of language and cultural identity among the Takuu population which had been resettled in Buka, Bougainville in 2012.

[[Music]] is a fundamental part of their life and because of their \u201clong periods of isolation\u201d; many of the indigenous songs, stories and dances have survived till this day. This shows that the Takuu people place great value on their indigenous practices and religious belief. Although there are numerous churches established on Nukutoa, they did not seem to bother to push out their old culture for a new one, making them an independent culture. Just like how the Hawaiian language uses a danced called hula to tell stories, the Takuu use the musical side of their language to tell stories of \u201cvoyages between the islands, as well as celebrations of successful relationships, whether relationships that link extended families together, in productive activity or relationships binding people with their ancestors in time of need\u201d through songs.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Irwin, H.
