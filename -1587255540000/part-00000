It is a branch of the '''Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County (PLSJ)''', which services a large area in southeast Ohio \u2013 otherwise known as the [[Ohio Valley]].  Besides the Schiappa Library, PLSJ has branches all over [[Jefferson County, Ohio]] located in [[Toronto, Ohio|Toronto]], [[Brilliant, Ohio|Brilliant]], [[Tiltonsville, Ohio|Tiltonsville]], [[Dillonvale, Jefferson County, Ohio|Dillonvale]] and [[Adena, Ohio|Adena]] with the Main Library located in Steubenville.  The Schiappa branch is located at the west end of Steubenville on the [[Fort Steuben Mall]] property.  It not only serves as an additional library for the city of Steubenville, but also as a library for the neighboring village of [[Wintersville, Ohio]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Schiappa Branch Library opened its doors on February 2, 1987 in the west end of Steubenville, Ohio at 4141 Mall Drive, where it still sits on property donated by the Siciliano family.  This plot of land was one of many looked at in the time leading up to a final decision, but it was this area's location being adjacent to a large [[shopping center]] attracting people from all over the Ohio Valley that made it so desirable.  Huberta Siciliano made it clear that if she donated the land to the library, she would like the facility to be named after her parents: Albert and Mary A. Schiappa.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\">Lash, John.  ''The history of the Schiappa Branch Library in Steubenville, Ohio''.  May 2005.</ref>\n\nOne concern with the property that the Schiappa Library now sits upon was that the land was a former [[strip-mining]] area.  This caused many to note that the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] would be in danger of cracking and heaving once the [[pyrites]] swelled with moisture.  To resolve this, the library was built upon 110 [[concrete]] [[pylon (disambiguation)|pylons]], drilled to solid rock, which is between 4 and 14 feet deep at the site.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\">Hall, Alan.

To remedy this, returned books were shelved quickly and the State Regional Library sent over boxes of books to make the shelves more full temporarily.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\"/>   Over the years, the collection of books has grown exponentially to include [[VHS|videotapes]], [[DVDs]], [[CDs]], [[audiobook]]s, [[periodicals]], and [[graphic novels]].\n\n==Renovations==\n\nBy 1990, the collection at Schiappa Branch Library had grown so large that talk of expanding the building had begun.  A larger children's area was needed, more [[Reference#Libraries|reference]] shelving would be required, and the collection in Schiappa's Ohio History and [[Genealogy]] room was beginning to take up more space than the shelves could fit.  There was also talk of adding a conference room, a children's activity room, and offices for the branch manager.  The project went forward in 1992 and the library was renovated with all of the above changes while the building itself stayed open to the public.  An extra wing was added for the children's area and activity room, a conference room and three study rooms were built, offices for the branch manager and extra workspaces were added behind the [[library circulation|Circulation]] desk, and the Reference and Genealogy departments were given their own closed in space for quiet studying and for keeping reference materials from leaving the room.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\"/>\n\nBeginning in 2007, plans were drawn up for another renovation project.  This time, it was the front [[lobby (room)|lobby]] and adult fiction/nonfiction areas that would be getting a makeover.  New flooring was put into the front lobby and periodical section.  New furniture was brought in, including new desks, workspaces, chairs and a counter for the Circulation department.  [[Vending machines]] were added beside new study areas for a more modern and customer friendly look.<ref>Hall, Alan.  [http://www.steubenvillelibrary.org/Director/DCdetail.asp?dcID=138 \"Library Cafe\"], ''Herald-Star'', February 24, 2008, retrieved October 20, 2008.</ref>  The project was essentially complete in spring of 2008.\n\n==Departments==\n\n===General circulation===\n\nThe Circulation department is located in the front lobby of the library.  Items may be returned or taken out at the circulation desk.  Borrowers may also pick up items that have been placed on hold (brought in from other libraries).  The [[librarian|library assistants]] at Circulation will help you locate items throughout the building or assist in ordering items that are not currently stocked.  A borrower may also take care of any pending [[Fine (penalty)|overdue fines]] in this department.\n\n===Children/teens===\n\nLocated in the rear of the Schiappa Library, this area includes a listening center for audio books, toys for young ones, couches for parents, a youthful reading area for teens<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Services/YoungAdults/index.asp PLSJ Website: YoungAdults]</ref> and several desks for studying and activities.  There is also an activity room used for hosting children's programming and large group activities.\n\n===Reference===\n\nThe Reference department is mostly for quiet study and Internet usage.  The room is equipped with eight [[computers]] wired to the Internet.  The computers use timed software to allow each borrower up to an hour and twenty minutes of Internet time each day.  The Reference staff will assist in [[technical support]], [[troubleshooting]], and will answer questions both in person and online through the [[Meebo]] chat service.  The Reference librarian will also assist in ordering material not currently in the libraries [[database]].\n\n===Ohio Room/genealogy===\n\nThe Ohio History/Genealogy department is unique to the Schiappa Branch Library.  Nowhere else in the Jefferson County library system will one find this information.  The room is filled with books not only helping with basic genealogy techniques, but also books specific to the Steubenville and Jefferson County region that the library serves.  The collection consists of birth, death and marriage [[record (computer science)|records]], newspaper clippings, [[photo albums]], [[high school]] [[yearbooks]], and United States [[census]] materials, among other things.  There is also a large collection the Steubenville area's local newspaper, [http://www.hsconnect.com The ''Herald-Star''], dating back to the early 19th century on [[microfilm]].  The [[genealogist]] on duty can assist in using these materials as well as the wide variety of [[online]] materials.<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Services/History/index.asp PLSJ Website]</ref>\n\n==Services and programs==\n\nThe Schiappa Branch offers many free services, such as [[notary public|public notaries]] on duty during working hours, Internet access, [[Wi-Fi]] availability, and beginner computer instruction.  The library also houses public [[photocopier|copy machines]] and [[computer printer|printers]] for a fee.\n\nThe library offers many programs for people of all ages.  Children can visit the Tot Time, Babygarten, and Story Hour programs.<ref>[http://kids.steubenvillelibrary.com/Events/index.asp PLSJ Kids Webpage].</ref>  Teen programs include bi-monthly [[videogame]] nights<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/plsjgames Schiappa Game Nights MySpace Page]</ref> and an all-ages movie is shown once a month.<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/plsjmovies Schiappa Movie Nights MySpace Page].</ref>  Adult programs vary from month to month,<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Events/index.asp PLSJ Events Webpage].</ref> but have \u2013 in the past \u2013 included wine tasting, cooking demonstrations, and author visits.

It consisted of 24 episodes, split into 12-episode winter and summer segments. The series stars [[Valerie Bertinelli]], [[Wendie Malick]], [[Jane Leeves]], and [[Betty White]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPicking up from where the last season's cliffhanger left off, the baby left on the girls' doorstep turns out to be Wilbur, Owen's son from a one-night stand. Although Owen seemingly decides to put him up for adoption as he doesn't know how to raise him, it's a decision neither he nor the girls are happy with, and Elka's new boyfriend Pierre calls them out on it. Joy then offers to help Owen raise his son if he relocates permanently to Cleveland, which he agrees to. This storyline spawns several more season-long storylines; while Victoria babysits Wilbur and takes him to a baby audition, she manages to land a leading part in a movie directed by Woody Allen. After having somehow misplaced the baby on the way back, the girls go back to the movie studio retrieve him. Whilst there, Melanie reprimands a spiteful actress and talks about the perks of living in Cleveland, which gets her noticed by PR director Chloe, who gives her a job at a PR firm. Things soon get complicated when Melanie finds out that her new boss, Alec, who she ends up falling in love with, is Chloe's ex-husband, and Melanie finds herself trying to control her feelings for Alec as Chloe is still in love with and wants to get back together with him even though he is dating someone else and is preparing to go on vacation with his new girlfriend. To cope, Melanie invents a lie involving a fake boyfriend, actor Emmett Lawson. However, after the encounter with Emmett in person, Alec overhears Melanie's reaction and realizes that she lied and has feelings for him, which Melanie doesn't realize he did until he's gone and Victoria points it out. After several attempts to clarify herself to Alec while he is on vacation, Melanie is surprised when Alec returns and admits that he has feelings for her, though he insists that Chloe shouldn't know yet. However, he accidentally blurts it out while Melanie is trying to save Chloe from falling off the ledge of the workplace building. Chloe accepts the relationship and leaves the firm, and Melanie and Alec begin to form a stable relationship. Eventually, Melanie begins to wonder where their relationship is going when Alec keeps returning her toothbrush that she left at his apartment. After much discussion, they decide to move in together, and Melanie moves out of the house into Alec's apartment.\n\nSpeaking of Emmett, who is Victoria's co-star in her movie, although she is suspicious of his motives, the two develop chemistry between each other, especially when rumors circulate of a secret relationship between them. Although they initially play along with the false rumors, this relationship quickly becomes real as the two fall in love with each other. The relationship is cemented near the end of filming, when Emmett invites Victoria on a romantic trip to Morocco with him after filming concludes. On the night of their departure, Emmett plans to propose to Victoria. However, just as he does so, police officers arrest him for tax fraud, which Emmett's business manager had committed under shady deals for which Emmett blindly signed contracts which implicated him as well. Victoria nevertheless accepts his proposal, and hires a wedding planner for their wedding in prison. However, she struggles to cope with the fact that Emmett is in jail and does not know how long he will be there. On the day of her bachelorette party, she suffers an accident and takes it as a sign she needs to figure out what went wrong in her previous marriages before she marries Emmett. After condescending advice from most of her exes, the one ex who truly broke her heart tells her that she puts emotional walls up around the people she loves most and makes them feel like they are not needed when they need to be. Realizing that he is right and fearing she will do this to Emmett, Victoria decides to break off her engagement to him, but Melanie and Joy stop her from doing so, noting that she is already open and happy with him. After Victoria realizes she needs Emmett, she decides to stay with him.\n\nRealizing she wants to set a good example for her grandson, Joy decides to enrol at college, taking up a course in economics. However she quickly feels left out of place due to her age, especially upon learning that Elka goes to the same college and is one of the popular kids, though Elka hesitantly helps her feel more welcome at the college. A storyline running in parallel with this is the fact that Elka and her friend Mamie-Sue are running a shady venture together. Although Joy is suspicious of this when she sees the cash Elka has been hiding, she doesn't find out more information until she takes an internship at a private investigation firm run by Detective Bob Moore. They both spy on Elka where she hands out pills to a crowd of strangers for cash, and then Joy confronts Elka on seeing the stash of drugs in the oven, where Elka confesses that she and Mamie are running an illegal drug business. Although Joy contemplates turning in Elka to the police, she ultimately decides to help Elka and Mamie quickly sell off all of their unsold drug stock (including the large inventory in the basement), with the help of Victoria and Melanie. Their efforts occur as part of the show's first live episode, where they successfully manage to do so as well as avoid trouble with a former drug lord and a major mob boss.\n\nAlso, when Joy's mother Philippa is visiting Cleveland for Wilbur's christening, Joy asks Owen to lie about his entire life to appease her mother. When both begin to slip on the lie, a huge argument breaks out during the christening, when Philippa reveals that the man who got Joy pregnant was planning to propose but that she made him leave instead, believing he wasn't right for Joy. Whilst Joy is initially furious with Philippa because of the revelation, she eventually agrees that what her mother did was for the best, and that it wouldn't have worked out anyway. When Joy celebrates Wilbur's birthday, this causes Melanie and Alec to think about the idea of having kids together. Although Alec is eager to raise kids, Melanie is concerned that she is too old for motherhood and they decide to shelve the idea. However, Melanie later decides to break up with Alec to give him a chance at fatherhood, and she quits her job and moves out of his apartment and back into the house with the girls.\n\nOn their wedding day, due to the new prison warden's budget and security constraints, Victoria and Emmett marry in a small prison cell ceremony, with an ordained minister, though on their wedding night in a private prison trailer, Emmett reveals that more charges have been filed against him that could see him incarcerated for up to ten years. Meanwhile, the minister, a man working at press magazine who Victoria arranged to secretly photograph the wedding, turns out to be Simon, the man who left Joy while she was pregnant with Owen. Though Joy is angry with him for abandoning her, Simon expresses regret over this and reconciles with Joy, vowing to return soon to be there for her and their family. The season ends on a double cliffhanger as Victoria wakes up to find Emmett gone and Melanie is stunned to find out that she is pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Betty White]] as Elka Ostrovsky\n* [[Valerie Bertinelli]] as Melanie Moretti\n* [[Jane Leeves]] as Rejoyla \"Joy\" Scroggs\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Victoria Chase\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Georgia Engel]] as Mamie Sue Johnson\n* [[Jay Harrington]] as Alec\n* [[Michael McMillian]] as Owen\n* [[Alan Dale]] as Emmet\n* [[Eddie Cibrian]] as Sean\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Bob\n\n===Special guest stars===\n* [[Regis Philbin]] as Pierre\n* [[Heather Locklear]] as Chloe\n* [[Pat Harrington Jr.]] as Mr. Sherden\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Doctor Hill\n* [[Juliet Mills]] as Philipa Scroggs\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Yogi\n* [[Carter Oosterhouse]] as himself\n* [[William Shatner]] as Sally\n* [[Shirley Jones]] as Sophie\n* [[Carol Burnett]] as Penny Chase\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Bess Chase\n* [[Tim Conway]] as Nick\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as Danny\n* [[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]] as Dr. Aaron Everett\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as herself\n* [[Mary Tyler Moore]] as Diane\n* [[Valerie Harper]] as Angie\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Peg\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Robin\n* [[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]] as Wes\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Simon\n\n{{Col-break}}\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Lauren Lapkus]] as Oscar\n* Kelly Schumann as Sally\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Reverend Lare\n* [[Nic Bishop]] as Liam\n* [[Heather Dubrow]] as Nikki\n* [[Marshall Manesh]] as Ye'arj\n* [[Robbie Amell]] as Lloyd\n* [[Cameron Mathison]] as Bill\n* [[Kevin Farley]] as Ranger Murphy\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Tommy\n* [[Brian Baumgartner]] as Claude\n* John Colella as Rusty\n* Jill Benjamin as Brenda\n* [[Sam Daly]] as Milo\n* Carole Gutierrez as Dr. Hernandez\n* Samantha Martin as Jenna\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as Professor Zucker\n* [[Michael Urie]] as Jeffrey\n* [[Alice Amter]] as Dr. Kapoor\n* [[Pej Vahdat]] as Ravi\n* [[Parvesh Cheena]] as Manu\n* [[Chris Williams (actor)|Chris Williams]] as Dr. Greenly\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Margaret\n* [[Enrico Colantoni]] as Julian\n* [[Brody Hutzler]] as Andy\n* [[Edward Kerr]] as Rex\n* [[Echo Kellum]] as Johnny\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Warden Burkhalter\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Hot in Cleveland'' was renewed for a 24-episode fourth season on January 12, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/01/tv-land-renews-hot-in-cleveland-picks-up-cedric-the-entertainer-spinoff-to-series/ |title=TV Land Renews \u2018Hot In Cleveland\u2019, Picks Up Cedric The Entertainer Spinoff To Series |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |publisher=Deadline.com |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> The summer premiere on June 19, 2013 aired live at 10:00 PM EDT/9:00 PM CDT (live-to-tape in the Mountain and Pacific time zones).<ref name=tfc>{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/showatch/hot-in-cleveland/listings|title=Shows A-Z \u2013 hot in cleveland on tv land|publisher=the Futon Critic|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Heather Locklear]], [[Jay Harrington]], and [[Alan Dale]] all had recurring roles in season four.

It consisted of 24 episodes, split into 12-episode winter and summer segments. The series stars [[Valerie Bertinelli]], [[Wendie Malick]], [[Jane Leeves]], and [[Betty White]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPicking up from where the last season's cliffhanger left off, the baby left on the girls' doorstep turns out to be Wilbur, Owen's son from a one-night stand. Although Owen seemingly decides to put him up for adoption as he doesn't know how to raise him, it's a decision neither he nor the girls are happy with, and Elka's new boyfriend Pierre calls them out on it. Joy then offers to help Owen raise his son if he relocates permanently to Cleveland, which he agrees to. This storyline spawns several more season-long storylines; while Victoria babysits Wilbur and takes him to a baby audition, she manages to land a leading part in a movie directed by Woody Allen. After having somehow misplaced the baby on the way back, the girls go back to the movie studio retrieve him. Whilst there, Melanie reprimands a spiteful actress and talks about the perks of living in Cleveland, which gets her noticed by PR director Chloe, who gives her a job at a PR firm. Things soon get complicated when Melanie finds out that her new boss, Alec, who she ends up falling in love with, is Chloe's ex-husband, and Melanie finds herself trying to control her feelings for Alec as Chloe is still in love with and wants to get back together with him even though he is dating someone else and is preparing to go on vacation with his new girlfriend. To cope, Melanie invents a lie involving a fake boyfriend, actor Emmett Lawson. However, after the encounter with Emmett in person, Alec overhears Melanie's reaction and realizes that she lied and has feelings for him, which Melanie doesn't realize he did until he's gone and Victoria points it out. After several attempts to clarify herself to Alec while he is on vacation, Melanie is surprised when Alec returns and admits that he has feelings for her, though he insists that Chloe shouldn't know yet. However, he accidentally blurts it out while Melanie is trying to save Chloe from falling off the ledge of the workplace building. Chloe accepts the relationship and leaves the firm, and Melanie and Alec begin to form a stable relationship. Eventually, Melanie begins to wonder where their relationship is going when Alec keeps returning her toothbrush that she left at his apartment. After much discussion, they decide to move in together, and Melanie moves out of the house into Alec's apartment.\n\nSpeaking of Emmett, who is Victoria's co-star in her movie, although she is suspicious of his motives, the two develop chemistry between each other, especially when rumors circulate of a secret relationship between them. Although they initially play along with the false rumors, this relationship quickly becomes real as the two fall in love with each other. The relationship is cemented near the end of filming, when Emmett invites Victoria on a romantic trip to Morocco with him after filming concludes. On the night of their departure, Emmett plans to propose to Victoria. However, just as he does so, police officers arrest him for tax fraud, which Emmett's business manager had committed under shady deals for which Emmett blindly signed contracts which implicated him as well. Victoria nevertheless accepts his proposal, and hires a wedding planner for their wedding in prison. However, she struggles to cope with the fact that Emmett is in jail and does not know how long he will be there. On the day of her bachelorette party, she suffers an accident and takes it as a sign she needs to figure out what went wrong in her previous marriages before she marries Emmett. After condescending advice from most of her exes, the one ex who truly broke her heart tells her that she puts emotional walls up around the people she loves most and makes them feel like they are not needed when they need to be. Realizing that he is right and fearing she will do this to Emmett, Victoria decides to break off her engagement to him, but Melanie and Joy stop her from doing so, noting that she is already open and happy with him. After Victoria realizes she needs Emmett, she decides to stay with him.\n\nRealizing she wants to set a good example for her grandson, Joy decides to enrol at college, taking up a course in economics. However she quickly feels left out of place due to her age, especially upon learning that Elka goes to the same college and is one of the popular kids, though Elka hesitantly helps her feel more welcome at the college. A storyline running in parallel with this is the fact that Elka and her friend Mamie-Sue are running a shady venture together. Although Joy is suspicious of this when she sees the cash Elka has been hiding, she doesn't find out more information until she takes an internship at a private investigation firm run by Detective Bob Moore. They both spy on Elka where she hands out pills to a crowd of strangers for cash, and then Joy confronts Elka on seeing the stash of drugs in the oven, where Elka confesses that she and Mamie are running an illegal drug business. Although Joy contemplates turning in Elka to the police, she ultimately decides to help Elka and Mamie quickly sell off all of their unsold drug stock (including the large inventory in the basement), with the help of Victoria and Melanie. Their efforts occur as part of the show's first live episode, where they successfully manage to do so as well as avoid trouble with a former drug lord and a major mob boss.\n\nAlso, when Joy's mother Philippa is visiting Cleveland for Wilbur's christening, Joy asks Owen to lie about his entire life to appease her mother. When both begin to slip on the lie, a huge argument breaks out during the christening, when Philippa reveals that the man who got Joy pregnant was planning to propose but that she made him leave instead, believing he wasn't right for Joy. Whilst Joy is initially furious with Philippa because of the revelation, she eventually agrees that what her mother did was for the best, and that it wouldn't have worked out anyway. When Joy celebrates Wilbur's birthday, this causes Melanie and Alec to think about the idea of having kids together. Although Alec is eager to raise kids, Melanie is concerned that she is too old for motherhood and they decide to shelve the idea. However, Melanie later decides to break up with Alec to give him a chance at fatherhood, and she quits her job and moves out of his apartment and back into the house with the girls.\n\nOn their wedding day, due to the new prison warden's budget and security constraints, Victoria and Emmett marry in a small prison cell ceremony, with an ordained minister, though on their wedding night in a private prison trailer, Emmett reveals that more charges have been filed against him that could see him incarcerated for up to ten years. Meanwhile, the minister, a man working at press magazine who Victoria arranged to secretly photograph the wedding, turns out to be Simon, the man who left Joy while she was pregnant with Owen. Though Joy is angry with him for abandoning her, Simon expresses regret over this and reconciles with Joy, vowing to return soon to be there for her and their family. The season ends on a double cliffhanger as Victoria wakes up to find Emmett gone and Melanie is stunned to find out that she is pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Betty White]] as Elka Ostrovsky\n* [[Valerie Bertinelli]] as Melanie Moretti\n* [[Jane Leeves]] as Rejoyla \"Joy\" Scroggs\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Victoria Chase\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Georgia Engel]] as Mamie Sue Johnson\n* [[Jay Harrington]] as Alec\n* [[Michael McMillian]] as Owen\n* [[Alan Dale]] as Emmet\n* [[Eddie Cibrian]] as Sean\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Bob\n\n===Special guest stars===\n* [[Regis Philbin]] as Pierre\n* [[Heather Locklear]] as Chloe\n* [[Pat Harrington Jr.]] as Mr. Sherden\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Doctor Hill\n* [[Juliet Mills]] as Philipa Scroggs\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Yogi\n* [[Carter Oosterhouse]] as himself\n* [[William Shatner]] as Sally\n* [[Shirley Jones]] as Sophie\n* [[Carol Burnett]] as Penny Chase\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Bess Chase\n* [[Tim Conway]] as Nick\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as Danny\n* [[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]] as Dr. Aaron Everett\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as herself\n* [[Mary Tyler Moore]] as Diane\n* [[Valerie Harper]] as Angie\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Peg\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Robin\n* [[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]] as Wes\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Simon\n\n{{Col-break}}\n\n===Guest stars=== \n* [[Lauren Lapkus]] as Oscar\n* Kelly Schumann as Sally\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Reverend Lare\n* [[Nic Bishop]] as Liam\n* [[Heather Dubrow]] as Nikki\n* [[Marshall Manesh]] as Ye'arj\n* [[Robbie Amell]] as Lloyd\n* [[Cameron Mathison]] as Bill\n* [[Kevin Farley]] as Ranger Murphy\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Tommy\n* [[Brian Baumgartner]] as Claude\n* John Colella as Rusty\n* Jill Benjamin as Brenda\n* [[Sam Daly]] as Milo\n* Carole Gutierrez as Dr. Hernandez\n* Samantha Martin as Jenna\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as Professor Zucker\n* [[Michael Urie]] as Jeffrey\n* [[Alice Amter]] as Dr. Kapoor\n* [[Pej Vahdat]] as Ravi\n* [[Parvesh Cheena]] as Manu\n* [[Chris Williams (actor)|Chris Williams]] as Dr. Greenly\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Margaret\n* [[Enrico Colantoni]] as Julian\n* [[Brody Hutzler]] as Andy\n* [[Edward Kerr]] as Rex\n* [[Echo Kellum]] as Johnny\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Warden Burkhalter\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Hot in Cleveland'' was renewed for a 24-episode fourth season on January 12, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/01/tv-land-renews-hot-in-cleveland-picks-up-cedric-the-entertainer-spinoff-to-series/ |title=TV Land Renews \u2018Hot In Cleveland\u2019, Picks Up Cedric The Entertainer Spinoff To Series |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |publisher=Deadline.com |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> The summer premiere on June 19, 2013 aired live at 10:00 PM EDT/9:00 PM CDT (live-to-tape in the Mountain and Pacific time zones).<ref name=tfc>{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/showatch/hot-in-cleveland/listings|title=Shows A-Z \u2013 hot in cleveland on tv land|publisher=the Futon Critic|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Heather Locklear]], [[Jay Harrington]], and [[Alan Dale]] all had recurring roles in season four.

The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only [[Interchange station|transfer point]] in the MAX system where riders can board any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project\u2014Portland's first light rail line. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. The Red Line began serving the stations in September 2001, initially connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. In 2003, the Red Line extended westward to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The Yellow Line also served the stations from 2004 to 2009, connecting downtown to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]]; TriMet rerouted this line to serve the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block bound by Southwest Morrison and Yamhill streets to the north and south, and 6th Avenue and Broadway to the east and west had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage. In March 1856, a proclamation created School District No. 1, which built the city's first permanent public school at this location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/#.XnI3dKhKhhE |title=Central School |publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]] |date=March 17, 2018 |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930101129/https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/ |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> Referred to as Central School, it opened on May 7, 1858.<ref>{{cite news |last=Killen |first=John |title=Throwback Thursday: Portland public schools, started in 1850s, took awhile to catch on |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=June 11, 2015 |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318151006/https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> With the arrival of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to Portland in 1883, [[Henry Villard]] purchased the site of Central School for $75,000 and began building a first class hotel.

[[Portland, Oregon]], United States, served by [[TriMet]] as part of its [[MAX Light Rail]] system. The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only [[Interchange station|transfer point]] in the MAX system where riders can board any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project\u2014Portland's first light rail line. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. The Red Line began serving the stations in September 2001, initially connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. In 2003, the Red Line extended westward to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The Yellow Line also served the stations from 2004 to 2009, connecting downtown to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]]; TriMet rerouted this line to serve the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block bound by Southwest Morrison and Yamhill streets to the north and south, and 6th Avenue and Broadway to the east and west had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage. In March 1856, a proclamation created School District No. 1, which built the city's first permanent public school at this location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/#.XnI3dKhKhhE |title=Central School |publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]] |date=March 17, 2018 |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930101129/https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/ |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> Referred to as Central School, it opened on May 7, 1858.<ref>{{cite news |last=Killen |first=John |title=Throwback Thursday: Portland public schools, started in 1850s, took awhile to catch on |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=June 11, 2015 |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318151006/https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> With the arrival of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to Portland in 1883, [[Henry Villard]] purchased the site of Central School for $75,000 and began building a first class hotel.

Mitch finds out immediately, as he had bugged the house, while Melanie takes the task of telling Bob, only to end up sleeping with him after. Joy tells Simon \"yes\" and he is thrilled, but the moment is spoiled when Simon introduces his current 23-year-old wife to Joy. Simon explains he had to marry the woman to get her out of a dangerous situation in her home country, but vows to divorce her as soon as it is safe. When circumstances call for Simon to leave the country again, Joy realizes they shouldn't be together. Bob tries to swoop in and propose to Joy, but she says she is not looking to marry anyone at the moment. Nonetheless, Bob says he will keep trying, announcing that he's bought back the detective agency from Mitch.

Mitch finds out immediately, as he had bugged the house, while Melanie takes the task of telling Bob, only to end up sleeping with him after. Joy tells Simon \"yes\" and he is thrilled, but the moment is spoiled when Simon introduces his current 23-year-old wife to Joy. Simon explains he had to marry the woman to get her out of a dangerous situation in her home country, but vows to divorce her as soon as it is safe. When circumstances call for Simon to leave the country again, Joy realizes they shouldn't be together. Bob tries to swoop in and propose to Joy, but she says she is not looking to marry anyone at the moment. Nonetheless, Bob says he will keep trying, announcing that he's bought back the detective agency from Mitch.

Melanie is seated on a Paris-bound plane next to a handsome stranger, Tom ([[Thomas Gibson]]), and tells him the story of how she got to this point. The girls are all set to leave for Joy and Bob\u2019s wedding in Paris, when Joy gets a call that a baby girl is available to adopt, but she and Bob have to go to [[Las Vegas]] right away to complete the process and pick up the baby. Before they depart, Bob\u2019s father, Bob Sr. ([[Bob Newhart]]) shows up, saying he and Bob\u2019s mother are now divorced and he is now ready to try dating again. Meanwhile, Victoria announces that she\u2019s meeting an agent in Vegas, and will likely be moving back to California to reboot her acting career. In Vegas, Melanie, Mamie Sue, Elka and Bob Sr. all end up in jail, while Victoria has a chance encounter with old flame Johnny Revere ([[Huey Lewis]]). The two ponder why they are still chasing career dreams at their age. Joy and Bob find out that the adoption agency is highly religious, and they must be married before adopting the baby. They go to a quickie wedding chapel, only to find that Elka and Bob Sr. are already there to marry each other (having developed an attraction to one another), with everyone else as guests. As Elka/Bob Sr. and Joy/Bob get married in a double ceremony, Victoria and Johnny decide to get married in the near-future and have a more Hollywood-style wedding. The gang, now with baby Elizabeth, finally board a plane to Paris for the wedding reception. Melanie finishes her story just as the plane is shaken by a storm, and she grabs Tom\u2019s hand. In a flash-forward to Elizabeth\u2019s fifth birthday, Melanie and Tom are married, Bob Sr. and Elka (now 98) are still married, and Victoria and Johnny are now hitched. It is then revealed that the girls still get together every Wednesday night.\n| LineColor       = B10C28\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n;General references <!-- These references will apply to most, if not all, episodes -->\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/hot-cleveland/episodes-season-6/304735|title=''Hot in Cleveland'' Season 6 episodes|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/showatch/hot-in-cleveland/listings|title=Shows A-Z \u2013 hot in cleveland on tv land|publisher=the Futon Critic|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/series-episodes/hot-in-cleveland|title=Hot in Cleveland: Episode Guide|publisher=[[MSN TV]]|accessdate=November 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319185139/http://tv.msn.com/tv/series-episodes/hot-in-cleveland/|archive-date=March 19, 2011|url-status=dead}}\n<!-- Do not include tv.com episode lists here.
