Her mother was a housewife and her father an engineer for [[Exide|Exide Batteries]]. The family moved to New Zealand in 1939 to set up a battery factory there, but were unable to return to Australia when WWII broke out.<ref name=\":1\"/> At 12 years of age Taylor contracted [[polio]] during the [[1948 polio epidemic]]. Isolated from her family, friends and schooling she slowly recovered with the support of the \u2018[[Sister Kenny]] Treatment and Rehabilitation Method\u2019. Taylor fell behind in her studies and left school at 15 years of age to work for the NZ Film Unit drawing for an animation studio. She was already showing her talents as an artist.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nTaylor turned to Sydney with her family to settle in the beach side suburb of [[Port Hacking]] where she took up spearfishing to provide food for the family. Spearfishing opened her eyes to the underwater world. She became an Australian champion spearfisher and met her future husband, [[Ron Taylor (diver)|Ron Taylor]], at the St George's Spearfishing Club.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11700946/The-most-glamorous-shark-hunter-in-the-world.html|title=The most glamorous shark hunter in the world|last=Hart|first=Anna|date=2015-06-28|access-date=2019-11-15|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref name=\"docs.google.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V_aoM5e4uBnGjGJgWzmbGQ7Cy5Z-40aWlNXoq7cJGkc/pub?single=true&gid=0&output=html|title=AUF Spearfishing Championship Trophies|website=docs.google.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nAlthough starting their aquatic careers as competitive spearfishers,<ref name=\"docs.google.com\"/> Valerie and Ron's respect for the underwater world grew.

Isolated from her family, friends and schooling she slowly recovered with the support of the \u2018[[Sister Kenny]] Treatment and Rehabilitation Method\u2019. Taylor fell behind in her studies and left school at 15 years of age to work for the NZ Film Unit drawing for an animation studio. She was already showing her talents as an artist.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nTaylor turned to Sydney with her family to settle in the beach side suburb of [[Port Hacking]] where she took up spearfishing to provide food for the family. Spearfishing opened her eyes to the underwater world.

His newly founded company, the Home Electric Lighting Company (later abbreviated to Homelite), made it possible for thousands of rural farms and households to enjoy the convenience of electricity, where it would be years before land lines would reach many of these remote areas. In addition, many of Mr. Ferguson's generators played a significant role in the [[war effort]], providing portable electricity on demand for the troops during World War II.\n\n'''Chainsaws'''\n\n[[Image:Homelite1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Homelite 330 chainsaw flanked by two Homelite Super XL Automatic Chainsaws.]]\n\nIn 1946, Homelite manufactured its first chainsaw, an electrical model, and in 1949, released another power-equipment innovation in the form of the first chainsaw that featured '''one-man operation''' (previous saws were generally too large and bulky to be operated by a single individual). By the mid-1960s, Homelite had been firmly established as one of the largest manufacturers of chainsaws in the world, with models ranging from small brush cutters, to the most advanced professional [[logging]] saws. The year 1963 saw the introduction of the world's first \"lightweight\" chainsaw, the magnesium-alloy framed Homelite XL-12; the numeral twelve denoting that the power-head weighed a mere twelve pounds. This saw is widely regarded as one of the most recognizable and well-known chainsaws of all time. In addition, the XL-12 achieved notoriety among [[horror film]] aficionados, being used in films like [[The Evil Dead]] and its sequels.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Homelite gradually expanded its power equipment line to include [[string trimmer]]s, leaf blowers, and [[hedge trimmer]]s. John Deere acquired the brand in the 1980s.\n\n[[Techtronic Industries]] acquired Homelite from John Deere in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawnandlandscape.com/article/john-deere---company-sells-homelite-brand/|title=John Deere & Company Sells Homelite Brand|last=|first=|date=2001-11-21|website=Lawn & Landscape|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Homelite has shifted its production primarily to consumer level lawn and garden equipment and light duty chainsaws. Replacement parts for the older, professional-grade, saws are generally limited to [[new old stock]] (NOS) and salvage parts. However, these saws were built to last, and a good percentage of them are still in use to this day.

In addition, the XL-12 achieved notoriety among [[horror film]] aficionados, being used in films like [[The Evil Dead]] and its sequels.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Homelite gradually expanded its power equipment line to include [[string trimmer]]s, leaf blowers, and [[hedge trimmer]]s. John Deere acquired the brand in the 1980s.\n\n[[Techtronic Industries]] acquired Homelite from John Deere in 2001<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawnandlandscape.com/article/john-deere---company-sells-homelite-brand/|title=John Deere & Company Sells Homelite Brand|last=|first=|date=2001-11-21|website=Lawn & Landscape|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>. Homelite has shifted its production primarily to consumer level lawn and garden equipment and light duty chainsaws. Replacement parts for the older, professional-grade, saws are generally limited to [[new old stock]] (NOS) and salvage parts. However, these saws were built to last, and a good percentage of them are still in use to this day. Homelite's [[Holding company|parent company]] is headquartered in Hong Kong.[[Image:TexasChainsawMassacreTNG.jpg|200px|thumb|Homelite XL-12 Chainsaw featured on poster for ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre - The Next Generation'' film.]]\n<br />\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.homelite.com/}}\n{{Techtronic Industries}}\n{{Power tool manufacturers}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural machinery manufacturers of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelite_Corporation"}

A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and State, Varick became the [[List of mayors of New York City|45th Mayor of New York City]] in 1789 and served eleven concurrent one-year terms until 1801.<ref name=\"dlib\">{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Richard Varick 1743-1871 (Bulk 1775-1830)  MS 655|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/varick/|website=dlib.nyu.edu|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nPrevious to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the [[Recorder of New York City|14th Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for Varick to institute the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]] during his terms as mayor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>.

Varick's body of work from this era would lead to the ''Varick Transcripts'' which now live in the [[Library of Congress]].

He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d.

Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]].

Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government.

Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm.

The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]].

An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

These have been used in railcars for many years, providing up to 17 days temperature regulation.<ref name=\"cryopower\"/> Whilst refrigerated containers are not common for air transport, total loss dry ice systems are usually used.<ref name=\"IIR2003\">{{cite web|\ntitle = Refrigerated transport: Progress achieved and challenges to be met|\nwork = International Institute of Refrigeration|\nurl= http://www.iifiir.org/en/doc/1014.pdf|\ndate = August 2003|\naccessdate=2010-05-01\n}}</ref> These containers have a chamber which is loaded with solid carbon dioxide and the temperature is regulated by a thermostatically controlled electric fan, and the air freight versions are intended to maintain temperature for up to around 100 hours.<ref name=\"envirotainer\">{{cite book\n |title       = Refrigerated container with temperature control RKN series and RAP series Operation manual\n |publisher   = Envirotainer Engineering\n |url         = http://www.jalcargobkk.com/info/envirotainer_operation_manual.pdf\n |date        = August 2001\n |accessdate  = 2010-05-01\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171008232330/http://www.jalcargobkk.com/info/envirotainer_operation_manual.pdf\n |archivedate = 2017-10-08\n}}</ref>\n\nFull-size intermodal containers equipped with these \"cryogenic\" systems can maintain their temperature for the 30 days needed for sea transport.<ref name=\"cryopower\">{{cite web|title=History |work=Cryo-Power Enterprises LLC |url=http://www.containerserviceco.com/history.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627104857/http://www.containerserviceco.com/history.html |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref> Since they do not require an external power supply, cryogenically refrigerated containers can be stored anywhere on any vessel that can accommodate \"dry\" (un-refrigerated) ocean freight containers.\n\n==Redundant refrigeration==\n[[File:Redundantreefer.JPG|thumb|A container fitted with two refrigeration units and a single diesel generator]]\nValuable, temperature-sensitive, or hazardous cargo often require the utmost in system reliability.  This type of reliability can only be achieved through the installation of a '''redundant refrigeration system'''.\n\nA redundant refrigeration system consists of integrated primary and back-up refrigeration units. If the primary unit malfunctions, the secondary unit automatically starts. To provide reliable power to the refrigeration units, these containers are often fitted with one or more [[diesel generator]] sets.\n\nContainers fitted with these systems may be required for transporting certain [[dangerous goods]] in order to comply with the [[International Maritime Organization]]\u2019s regulations.\n\n==Reefer types and dimensions==\nThe reefer cannot be loaded in double-stack on rail flatcar.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cold chain]]\n* [[Insulated shipping container]]\n* [[Reefer ship]]\n* [[Refrigerator car]]\n* [[Refrigerator truck]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Intermodal containers}}\n{{Commonscat|Refrigerated containers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Refrigerated Container}}\n[[Category:Freight rolling stock]]\n[[Category:Cooling technology]]\n[[Category:Intermodal containers]]\n[[Category:Port infrastructure]]\n", "name_user": "Bhushan.surve", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Dead link deleted and provided reference page link.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerated_container"}
