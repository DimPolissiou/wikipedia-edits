Armies were sometimes known to sever the penises of their enemies to count the dead, as well as for trophies. The practice of [[castration]] (removal of the testicles) sometimes involved the removal of all or part of the penis, generally with a tube inserted to keep the [[urethra]] open for urination. Castration has been used to create a class of servants or slaves called [[eunuch]]s in many different places and eras.\nIn modern day era 2020 A 27 year old boy from Pakistan hyderabad were forced to cut his entire penis off and now he is living a dickless life. He is available to share his story on his watsapp 0544929270\n\nIn [[Russia]], men of a devout group of [[Spiritual Christianity|Spiritual Christians]] known as the [[Skoptsy]] were castrated, either undergoing \"greater castration\", which entailed removal of the penis, or \"lesser castration\", in which the penis remained in place, while Skoptsy women underwent [[mastectomy]]. These procedures were performed in an effort to eliminate lust and to restore the Christian to a pristine state that existed prior to [[original sin]]. \n\nIn the modern era, removing the human penis for any such activity is very rare (with some exceptions listed below), and references to removal of the penis are almost always symbolic. Castration is less rare, and is performed as a last resort in the treatment of [[androgen]]-sensitive [[prostate cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Loblaw |first=DA |title=American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for the initial hormonal management of androgen-sensitive metastatic, recurrent, or progressive prostate cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology |date= July 15, 2004 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.04.579| pmid = 15184404 | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = 2927\u201341 | author2 = Mendelson DS | author3 = Talcott JA | author4 = Virgo KS | display-authors = 3 | last5 = Somerfield | first5 = MR | last6 = Ben-Josef | first6 = E | last7 = Middleton | first7 = R | last8 = Porterfield | first8 = H | last9 = Sharp | first9 = SA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Terris | first = Martha K |author2=Audrey Rhee | title = Prostate Cancer: Metastatic and Advanced Disease | publisher = eMedicine |date= August 1, 2006 | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/454114-overview | accessdate = January 11, 2007|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Myers | first = Charles E | title = Androgen Resistance, Part 1 | publisher = Prostate Cancer Research Institute | date = August 24, 2006 | url = http://www.prostate-cancer.org/education/andeprv/Myers_AndrogenResistance1.html | accessdate = January 11, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928024603/http://www.prostate-cancer.org/education/andeprv/Myers_AndrogenResistance1.html | archive-date = September 28, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Penis removal in medicine and psychology==\n{{main article|Penectomy}}\nSome men have penile [[amputation]]s, known as [[penectomy|penectomies]], for medical reasons.

Armies were sometimes known to sever the penises of their enemies to count the dead, as well as for trophies. The practice of [[castration]] (removal of the testicles) sometimes involved the removal of all or part of the penis, generally with a tube inserted to keep the [[urethra]] open for urination. Castration has been used to create a class of servants or slaves called [[eunuch]]s in many different places and eras.\n\nIn [[Russia]], men of a devout group of [[Spiritual Christianity|Spiritual Christians]] known as the [[Skoptsy]] were castrated, either undergoing \"greater castration\", which entailed removal of the penis, or \"lesser castration\", in which the penis remained in place, while Skoptsy women underwent [[mastectomy]]. These procedures were performed in an effort to eliminate lust and to restore the Christian to a pristine state that existed prior to [[original sin]]. \n\nIn the modern era, removing the human penis for any such activity is very rare (with some exceptions listed below), and references to removal of the penis are almost always symbolic. Castration is less rare, and is performed as a last resort in the treatment of [[androgen]]-sensitive [[prostate cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Loblaw |first=DA |title=American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for the initial hormonal management of androgen-sensitive metastatic, recurrent, or progressive prostate cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology |date= July 15, 2004 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.04.579| pmid = 15184404 | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = 2927\u201341 | author2 = Mendelson DS | author3 = Talcott JA | author4 = Virgo KS | display-authors = 3 | last5 = Somerfield | first5 = MR | last6 = Ben-Josef | first6 = E | last7 = Middleton | first7 = R | last8 = Porterfield | first8 = H | last9 = Sharp | first9 = SA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Terris | first = Martha K |author2=Audrey Rhee | title = Prostate Cancer: Metastatic and Advanced Disease | publisher = eMedicine |date= August 1, 2006 | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/454114-overview | accessdate = January 11, 2007|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Myers | first = Charles E | title = Androgen Resistance, Part 1 | publisher = Prostate Cancer Research Institute | date = August 24, 2006 | url = http://www.prostate-cancer.org/education/andeprv/Myers_AndrogenResistance1.html | accessdate = January 11, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928024603/http://www.prostate-cancer.org/education/andeprv/Myers_AndrogenResistance1.html | archive-date = September 28, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Penis removal in medicine and psychology==\n{{main article|Penectomy}}\nSome men have penile [[amputation]]s, known as [[penectomy|penectomies]], for medical reasons.

The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces.

A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as [[The Empty Quarter]]. [[Seismic]]ally, Dubai is in a very stable zone\u2014the nearest seismic fault line, the Zagros Fault, is {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=off}} from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai.<ref name=seismic>[http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster Far enough from the fault lines.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727103103/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster |date=27 July 2012 }} The National, 23 April 2008</ref> Experts also predict that the possibility of a [[tsunami]] in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.<ref name=seismic/>\n\n[[File:Dubai Creek Harbour 1.jpg|left|thumb|A view of the [[Dubai Creek]] from a harbour]]\nThe sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the ''sabkha'' plains east of the city, while acacia and [[prosopis cineraria|ghaf]] trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and [[neem]] as well as imported trees such as the [[eucalypts]] grow in Dubai's natural parks. The [[houbara bustard]], [[striped hyena]], [[caracal]], [[fennec fox|desert fox]], falcon and [[Arabian oryx]] are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the [[hammour]]. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish, jellyfish, coral, [[dugong]], dolphins, whales and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the [[hawksbill|hawksbill turtle]] and [[green turtle]], which are listed as endangered species.<ref>[http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html Flora and fauna of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html |date=2 July 2009 }} gowealthy.com</ref><ref>[http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp Natural UAE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126010401/http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp |date=26 January 2010 }} UAE Interact.

This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce \u2013 a healthy markup.

The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners.

Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nCritically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of [[Port Rashid]], a deep water free port constructed by British company [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]]. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nPort Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Father of Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 1999|isbn = 9789948856450|location = UAE|page = 151}}</ref>\n\n===Reaching the UAE's Act of Union===\n[[File:Adi with the three rulers of Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adi Bitar]] in a meeting with Sheiks [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Al Maktoum]], [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammad Al Maktoum]] and [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maktoum Al Maktoum]] in Dubai, 1968]]\nDubai and the other '[[Trucial States]]' had long been a British [[protectorate]] where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'.

Departures. 2002, 30 June 2014. </ref>\n\nFrom an early age, she was interested in archaeology and art history, encouraged experts who frequented her parents' home, such as Director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] [[James Rorimer]] and archaeologist [[Gisela Richter]].<ref> Bob Morris: In Iris Love\u2019s Wide Circle of Friends. In: The New York Times. 2. May 2012, 30. June 2014, Lincoln Evening Journal, 9 November 1970 </ref> \n\nLove completed her Bachelor of Arts at [[Smith College]], which included a year abroad at the [[University of Florence]]. During the pursuit of her bachelor's thesis in Italy, she compared Etruscan warrior figures at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Florence]] with those at the Met in New York and concluded the latter was housing fakes. Out of respect for her connections in New York, she initially hesitated to publish her substantiations, and decided to warn them when she was ready to release the findings in 1960. The museum retaliated by announcing the forgeries to ''[[The New York Times]]'', without acknowledging her work.<ref>Iris Love in the Internet Movie Database (English)</ref> \n\nLove never finished the beginnings of her doctorate at [[New York University]], instead working on an excavation on the island of [[Samothrace]] in the Aegean Sea from 1957 to 1965. She later became assistant professor at C.W. Post Long Island University ([[LIU Post]]).<ref> Finger im Staub. Nomen est omen: Eine Dame namens Love entdeckte den Tempel der Liebe. Der Spiegel 4/1970. 19 January 1970, published 30 June 2014. </ref>\n\n== Knidos and controversy ==\n\nLove is perhaps best known for her archaeological work in [[Knidos]], which began when she traveled there with Turkish archaeologist A\u015fk\u0131dil Akarca and continued after raising funds from Long Island University for further excavation on an annual basis. In 1969, her team discovered a foundation that Love thought was the remains of the Temple of [[Aphrodite]], confirming the instinct with inscriptions found the following year.<ref> Christine Mitchell Havelock: The Aphrodite of Knidos and her successors. A historical review of the female nude in Greek art. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor 1995, {{ISBN|0-472-10585-X}}, S. 60\u201361. </ref> \n\nThe discovery attracted international media attention when it was presented at the annual meeting of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], and attracted many famous guests to the excavation site, including [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Bianca Jagger]]. This fanfare called Love's interpretation into question, with critics accusing her of converting the excavation into an exclusive holiday spot. \n\nThe year 1970 also found Love involved in another controversial research discussion. She believed she had found the original head of Aphrodite by the artist [[Praxiteles]] in the depots of the [[British Museum]], which would have been one of the most spectacular discoveries in the history of ancient art. Greco-Roman Curator [[Bernard Ashmole]] vehemently contested this interpretation (and the implication that he had overlooked the masterpiece by then), stirring a dispute in the press. With this rebuke, Love concentrated on the search for the statue in continued excavations, with numerous deep search trenches created that still shape the area of \u200b\u200bancient Knidos.<ref> Christine Bruns-\u00d6zgan: Knidos.

Ege Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, Istanbul 2006, {{ISBN|975-8071-24-6}}, S. 168. </ref> \n\nThe Turkish government revoked her research license for Knidos and Love began several new research projects, including in Ancona and the Gulf of Naples, where she primarily searched for other Aphrodite shrines. She subsequently retired from archeology, living between Greece, Italy, and New York where she lived for many years with the well-known tabloid journalist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] and devoted herself to breeding [[dachshund]]s, for which she won several prizes.<ref> Judy Wieder: Liz Smith Tells on Herself.

Departures. 2002, 30 June 2014. </ref>\n\nFrom an early age, she was interested in archaeology and art history, encouraged experts who frequented her parents' home, such as Director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] [[James Rorimer]] and archaeologist [[Gisela Richter]].<ref> Bob Morris: In Iris Love\u2019s Wide Circle of Friends. In: The New York Times. 2. May 2012, 30. June 2014, Lincoln Evening Journal, 9 November 1970 </ref> \n\nLove completed her Bachelor of Arts at [[Smith College]], which included a year abroad at the [[University of Florence]]. During the pursuit of her bachelor's thesis in Italy, she compared Etruscan warrior figures at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Florence]] with those at the Met in New York and concluded the latter was housing fakes. Out of respect for her connections in New York, she initially hesitated to publish her substantiations, and decided to warn them when she was ready to release the findings in 1960. The museum retaliated by announcing the forgeries to ''[[The New York Times]]'', without acknowledging her work.<ref>Iris Love in the Internet Movie Database (English)</ref> \n\nLove never finished the beginnings of her doctorate at [[New York University]], instead working on an excavation on the island of [[Samothrace]] in the Aegean Sea from 1957 to 1965. She later became assistant professor at C.W. Post Long Island University ([[LIU Post]]).<ref> Finger im Staub. Nomen est omen: Eine Dame namens Love entdeckte den Tempel der Liebe. Der Spiegel 4/1970. 19 January 1970, published 30 June 2014. </ref>\n\n== Knidos and controversy ==\n\nLove is perhaps best known for her archaeological work in [[Knidos]], which began when she traveled there with Turkish archaeologist A\u015fk\u0131dil Akarca and continued after raising funds from Long Island University for further excavation on an annual basis. In 1969, her team discovered a foundation that Love thought was the remains of the Temple of [[Aphrodite]], confirming the instinct with inscriptions found the following year.<ref> Christine Mitchell Havelock: The Aphrodite of Knidos and her successors. A historical review of the female nude in Greek art. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor 1995, {{ISBN|0-472-10585-X}}, S. 60\u201361. </ref> \n\nThe discovery attracted international media attention when it was presented at the annual meeting of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], and attracted many famous guests to the excavation site, including [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Bianca Jagger]]. This fanfare called Love's interpretation into question, with critics accusing her of converting the excavation into an exclusive holiday spot. \n\nThe year 1970 also found Love involved in another controversial research discussion. She believed she had found the original head of Aphrodite by the artist [[Praxiteles]] in the depots of the [[British Museum]], which would have been one of the most spectacular discoveries in the history of ancient art. Greco-Roman Curator [[Bernard Ashmole]] vehemently contested this interpretation (and the implication that he had overlooked the masterpiece by then), stirring a dispute in the press. With this rebuke, Love concentrated on the search for the statue in continued excavations, with numerous deep search trenches created that still shape the area of \u200b\u200bancient Knidos.<ref> Christine Bruns-\u00d6zgan: Knidos.

Ege Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, Istanbul 2006, {{ISBN|975-8071-24-6}}, S. 168. </ref> \n\nThe Turkish government revoked her research license for Knidos and Love began several new research projects, including in Ancona and the Gulf of Naples, where she primarily searched for other Aphrodite shrines. She subsequently retired from archeology, living between Greece, Italy, and New York where she lived for many years with the well-known tabloid journalist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] and devoted herself to breeding [[dachshund]]s, for which she won several prizes.<ref> Judy Wieder: Liz Smith Tells on Herself.
