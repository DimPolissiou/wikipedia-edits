It was around this time that he met [[Tex Winter]] and became a devotee of Winter's [[triangle offense]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktka.com/news/2007/feb/22/Former_K_State_basketball/|publisher=KTKA.com|work=ABC News|title=Former K-State basketball star dies at 72|date=February 22, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=87&id=1161&PHPSESSID=1f02554bda44c6de62046f6a3f345ec6|work=Canada Basketball|title=Candidates for the 2007 Class of the FIBA Hall of Fame announced|date=May 25, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212173724/http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=87&id=1161&PHPSESSID=1f02554bda44c6de62046f6a3f345ec6|archivedate=February 12, 2008}}</ref> Over nine seasons, Jackson coached the Bulls to six championships, winning three straight championships over separate three-year periods. The \"three-peat\" was the first since the [[Boston Celtics]] won eight titles in a row from [[1959 NBA Finals|1959]] through [[1966 NBA Finals|1966]].\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|150px|left|[[Michael Jordan]] (left) and Phil Jackson]]\nJackson and the Bulls made the playoffs every year, and failed to win the title only three times. [[Michael Jordan]]'s first retirement after the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u20131993 season]] marked the end of the first \"three-peat\", and although Jordan returned just before the [[1995 NBA Playoffs|1995 playoffs]], it was not enough to prevent a playoff elimination by the [[1994\u201395 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]].\n\nDespite the Bulls' success, tension between Jackson and Bulls general manager [[Jerry Krause]] grew. Some believed that Krause felt under-recognized for building a championship team and believed that Jackson was indebted to him for giving him his first NBA coaching job. In the summer of 1997, Jackson was not invited to the wedding of Krause's stepdaughter, although all of the Bulls' assistant coaches were, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], Jackson's eventual successor.<ref name=Halberstam/> After contentious negotiations, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing by emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. Jackson then told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side, to which Krause responded, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref name=Halberstam/> Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches.\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again.<ref>{{cite news|title=The head Bull rides off into the sunset|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1998/06/22/jackson_update/|work=CNN.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 9, 2011|date=June 22, 1998}}</ref> However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the [[1999\u20132000 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] in 1999.\n\n===Los Angeles Lakers (1999\u20132004)===\nJackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he did in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67\u201315 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the [[1999\u20132000 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in a tough seven-game series and then won the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000 NBA championship]] by beating the [[1999\u20132000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]].\n\nWith the talented superstar duo of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], the strong supporting cast of [[Glen Rice]], [[Derek Fisher]], [[Rick Fox]], [[Devean George]], [[A. C. Green]], [[Robert Horry]], and [[Brian Shaw]], and the assistance of former Bulls [[Horace Grant]], [[Ron Harper]], and [[John Salley]], Jackson would lead the Lakers to two additional titles in [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], against the [[2000\u201301 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[2001\u201302 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], adding up to his third [[three-peat]] as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n[[File:Phil Jackson coaching LAL.jpg|thumb|Phil Jackson coaching the Lakers]]\n\nHowever, injuries, weak bench play, and [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|full-blown public tension]] between Bryant and O'Neal slowed the team down, and they were beaten in the second round of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2003]] NBA Playoffs by the eventual champion [[2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\nAfterward, Jackson clashed frequently with Bryant. While remarkably efficient in Jackson's \"[[triangle offense]]\", Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson's brand of basketball and subsequently called it \"boring\". In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, infuriating the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson's patience enough that the \"Zen Master\" even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Laker management rejected the request.\n\nPrior to the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], the Lakers signed NBA star veterans [[Karl Malone]] and [[Gary Payton]], who had been franchise players for the [[Utah Jazz]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], respectively, leading to predictions by some that the team would finish with the best record in NBA history. But from the first day of training camp, the Lakers were beset by distractions. Bryant's [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|trial for alleged sexual assault]], continued public sniping between O'Neal and Bryant, and repeated disputes between Jackson and Bryant all affected the team during the season. Despite these distractions, the Lakers beat the defending champion Spurs en route to advancing to the [[2004 NBA Finals]] and were heavy favorites to regain the title. However, they were upset by the [[2003\u201304 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], who used their strong defense to dominate the Lakers, winning the title four games to one. This marked the first time in ten attempts as head coach that Jackson had lost in the [[NBA Finals]].\n\nOn June 18, 2004, three days after the loss to the Pistons, the Lakers announced that Jackson would leave his position as Lakers coach. Jackson was seeking to double his salary from $6&nbsp;million to $12&nbsp;million on his expiring contract. He had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423>[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.423</ref> Winter said Jackson announced at the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423/> Many fans attributed Jackson's departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, as Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss|Dr. Jerry Buss]] reportedly sided with Bryant. Jackson, Bryant and Buss all denied that Bryant had made any explicit demand regarding Jackson. However, O'Neal, upon hearing General Manager [[Mitch Kupchak]]'s announcement of the team's willingness to trade O'Neal and its intention to keep Bryant, indicated that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant's wishes with the departure of Jackson. O'Neal's trade to the [[2004\u201305 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] was the end of the \"Trifecta\" that had led the Lakers to three championship titles.\n\nThat fall, Jackson released ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul|The Last Season]]'', a book which describes his point of view of the tensions that surrounded the 2003\u201304 Lakers team. The book was pointedly critical of [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\nWithout Jackson and O'Neal, the Lakers were forced to become a faster paced team on the court. Though they achieved some success in the first half of the season, injuries to several players including Kobe Bryant and [[Lamar Odom]] forced the team out of contention, going 34\u201348 in [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305]] and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]], Jackson's successor as coach, resigned midway through the season after coaching just 41 games, citing health issues not relating to his past bout with [[bladder]] cancer, which immediately led to speculation that the Lakers might bring Jackson back.\n\n===Return to the Lakers (2005\u20132011)===\n\nOn June 15, 2005, the Lakers rehired Jackson. Jackson led the Lakers to a seventh-seed playoff berth. Once again promoting the notion of selfless team play embodied by the [[triangle offense]], the team achieved substantial results, especially in the last month of the season. Jackson also worked seamlessly with Bryant, who had earlier shown his desire to bring back Jackson to the bench. Bryant's regular-season performance won him the league scoring title and made him a finalist in MVP voting. However, the Lakers faced a tough 2006 first-round matchup against the second-seeded [[2005\u201306 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]], who were led by eventual MVP winner [[Steve Nash]]. It was the first time that Jackson's team had failed to reach the second round of the playoffs. The Lakers jumped out to a 3\u20131 lead following a dramatic last second shot by Bryant in overtime to win game four, but the Suns recovered to win the last three and take the series.\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson 08.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson (right) in 2008, standing next to Lakers assistant coach [[Frank Hamblen]] (left).]]\nOn January 7, 2007, Jackson won his 900th game, then placing him 9th on the all-time win list for NBA coaches. With this win, Jackson became the fastest to reach 900 career wins, doing so in only 1,264 games and beating [[Pat Riley]]'s previous record of 900 in 1,278 games.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, after announcing he would return to his position as coach just a few days prior, Jackson inked a 2-year contract extension to continue his tenure with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] through the end of the 2009\u20132010 season.\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, the Lakers were able to obtain [[Pau Gasol]] in a trade with the [[2007\u201308 Memphis Grizzlies season|Memphis Grizzlies]]. With another star to pair with Bryant, Jackson coached the Lakers to an appearance in the [[2008 NBA Finals]] against the [[2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]]. Boston went on to win the series 4\u20132, in the process handing Jackson and the Lakers their worst playoff loss ever in Game 6, a 39-point defeat. It was only the 2nd time in 11 appearances that Jackson had lost an NBA Finals.\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Jackson became the sixth coach to win 1,000 games, with the Lakers defeating the Celtics in their first matchup since the last year's finals. He was the fastest to win 1,000 games, surpassing Pat Riley, who had taken 11 more games than Jackson.\n\nJackson again coached the Lakers to the NBA Finals in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]], defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], [[2008\u201309 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in the process. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the [[2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] 4\u20131, clinching Jackson's 10th NBA championship as head coach and surpassing the record for most championships won by a head coach previously held by him and [[Red Auerbach]].\n\nOn February 3, 2010, Jackson recorded his 534th win as Lakers head coach, surpassing Pat Riley to become the most successful coach in franchise history. The Lakers would go on to a fifth consecutive playoff berth in [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]]. They defeated the [[2009\u201310 Oklahoma City Thunder season|Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[2009\u201310 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], and [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in the playoffs before defeating the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in the [[2010 NBA Finals]], earning Jackson his 11th NBA championship as head coach and his fifth with the Lakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300617013|title=Bryant, Artest rally Lakers to 16th championship |date=June 17, 2010|work=ESPN|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2010, Jackson, after giving it tremendous thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, announced that he would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010\u201311 season.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AgEulkIpjiJ1N3Saog.Z3rzYrYZ4?slug=ap-lakers-jackson Phil Jackson returning to coach Lakers next season] Yahoo!

Jackson's 11 [[List of NBA championship head coaches|NBA titles as a coach]] surpassed the previous record of nine set by [[Red Auerbach]]. He also holds the NBA record for the most combined championships, winning a total of 13 as a player and a coach.\n\nJackson is known for his use of [[Tex Winter]]'s [[triangle offense]] as well as a [[holistic]] approach to coaching that was influenced by [[Eastern philosophy]], garnering him the nickname \"[[Zen master|Zen Master]]\". Jackson cited [[Robert Pirsig]]'s book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'' as one of the major guiding forces in his life. He also applied Native American spiritual practices, as documented in his book ''Sacred Hoops''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/sports/jan-june00/jackson_6-16.html|title=Basketball Court Zen|work=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref> He is the author of several candid books about his teams and his basketball strategies.

Elisabeth came from a long line of German [[Mennonite]]s before her conversion to the Assemblies of God. In the churches that they served, his father generally preached on Sunday mornings and his mother on Sunday evenings. Eventually, his father became a ministerial supervisor.<ref name=Halberstam/> Phil, his two brothers, and his half-sister grew up in a remote area of Montana in an austere environment, in which no dancing or television was allowed. Jackson did not see his first movie until he was a senior in high school, and went to a dance for the first time in college.<ref name=Halberstam /> Growing up, he assumed he would become a minister.\n\n==High school career==\nJackson attended high school in [[Williston, North Dakota]], where he played varsity basketball and led the team to two state titles. He also played [[American football|football]], was a [[pitcher]] on the baseball team, and threw the [[discus]] in track and field competitions.<ref name=Halberstam/> The high school now has a sports complex named after him.<ref>Burnes, Jerry.

Their notes found their way to future NBA coach [[Bill Fitch]], who had previously coached baseball, and had been doing some scouting for the [[Atlanta Braves]]. Fitch took over as head basketball coach at the [[University of North Dakota]] in the spring of 1962, during Jackson's junior year of high school.<ref name=Halberstam/>\n\n==College career==\n\nBill Fitch successfully recruited Jackson to the [[University of North Dakota]], where he was a member of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity.<ref name=Halberstam/><ref name=SAE>[http://www.sae.net/index.asp?r=fraternity&sr=facts&ssr=facts Facts and History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106124035/http://www.sae.net/index.asp?r=fraternity&sr=facts&ssr=facts |date=January 6, 2007 }}, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.</ref> Jackson did well there, helping the [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's basketball|Fighting Sioux]] to third- and fourth-place finishes in the [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship|NCAA Division II tournament]] in his sophomore and junior years ([[1965 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1965]] and [[1966 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1966]]). Both years, they were beaten by the [[Southern Illinois Salukis men's basketball|Southern Illinois Salukis]].<ref name=Halberstam/> Jackson's future Knicks teammate [[Walt Frazier]] was the Salukis' biggest star, but the two only faced off in 1965, as Frazier was academically ineligible in 1966.\n\n==NBA playing career==\n[[File:Phil Jackson 1968.jpeg|thumb|150px|Jackson circa 1968]]\nIn [[1967 NBA draft|1967]], Jackson was drafted in the second round by the [[New York Knicks]]. While he was a good all-around athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively and compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense.<ref name=Halberstam/> Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA's leading substitutes, although he had very little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1973]]. Jackson did not play during New York's 1969\u201370 championship season due to [[spinal fusion]] surgery; however, he authored a book entitled ''Take It All'', a photo diary of the Knicks' 1970 championship run.\n\nSoon after the 1973 title, several key starters retired, creating an opening for Jackson in the starting lineup.<ref name=Halberstam/> In the [[1974\u201375 NBA season]], Jackson and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]' [[Bob Dandridge]] shared the lead for total [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal fouls]], with 330 each.<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1975_stats.html 1974\u201375 NBA Player Register], basketball-reference.com</ref> Jackson lived in [[Leonia, New Jersey]], during this time.<ref>Adamek, Steve; and Iannazzone, Al.

While in the CBA, he won his first coaching championship, leading the [[Albany Patroons]] to their first title in 1984. In Puerto Rico, he coached the [[Piratas de Quebradillas]] (1984 and 1987) and the [[Gallitos de Isabela]] (1984\u20131986). He regularly sought NBA jobs, but was turned down. Jackson had acquired a reputation for being sympathetic to the [[counterculture]] during his playing years, which may have scared off potential NBA employers.<ref name=\"Halberstam\"/>\n\n===Chicago Bulls (1987\u20131998)===\nIn 1987, Jackson was hired as an assistant coach by the Chicago Bulls under [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. He was promoted to [[head coach]] in 1989. It was around this time that he met [[Tex Winter]] and became a devotee of Winter's [[triangle offense]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktka.com/news/2007/feb/22/Former_K_State_basketball/|publisher=KTKA.com|work=ABC News|title=Former K-State basketball star dies at 72|date=February 22, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=87&id=1161&PHPSESSID=1f02554bda44c6de62046f6a3f345ec6|work=Canada Basketball|title=Candidates for the 2007 Class of the FIBA Hall of Fame announced|date=May 25, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212173724/http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=87&id=1161&PHPSESSID=1f02554bda44c6de62046f6a3f345ec6|archivedate=February 12, 2008}}</ref> Over nine seasons, Jackson coached the Bulls to six championships, winning three straight championships over separate three-year periods. The \"three-peat\" was the first since the [[Boston Celtics]] won eight titles in a row from [[1959 NBA Finals|1959]] through [[1966 NBA Finals|1966]].\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|150px|left|[[Michael Jordan]] (left) and Phil Jackson]]\nJackson and the Bulls made the playoffs every year, and failed to win the title only three times. [[Michael Jordan]]'s first retirement after the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u20131993 season]] marked the end of the first \"three-peat\", and although Jordan returned just before the [[1995 NBA Playoffs|1995 playoffs]], it was not enough to prevent a playoff elimination by the [[1994\u201395 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]].\n\nDespite the Bulls' success, tension between Jackson and Bulls general manager [[Jerry Krause]] grew. Some believed that Krause felt under-recognized for building a championship team and believed that Jackson was indebted to him for giving him his first NBA coaching job. In the summer of 1997, Jackson was not invited to the wedding of Krause's stepdaughter, although all of the Bulls' assistant coaches were, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], Jackson's eventual successor.<ref name=Halberstam/> After contentious negotiations, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing by emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. Jackson then told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side, to which Krause responded, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref name=Halberstam/> Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches.\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again.<ref>{{cite news|title=The head Bull rides off into the sunset|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1998/06/22/jackson_update/|work=CNN.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 9, 2011|date=June 22, 1998}}</ref> However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the [[1999\u20132000 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] in 1999.\n\n===Los Angeles Lakers (1999\u20132004)===\nJackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he did in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67\u201315 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the [[1999\u20132000 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in a tough seven-game series and then won the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000 NBA championship]] by beating the [[1999\u20132000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]].\n\nWith the talented superstar duo of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], the strong supporting cast of [[Glen Rice]], [[Derek Fisher]], [[Rick Fox]], [[Devean George]], [[A. C. Green]], [[Robert Horry]], and [[Brian Shaw]], and the assistance of former Bulls [[Horace Grant]], [[Ron Harper]], and [[John Salley]], Jackson would lead the Lakers to two additional titles in [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], against the [[2000\u201301 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[2001\u201302 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], adding up to his third [[three-peat]] as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n[[File:Phil Jackson coaching LAL.jpg|thumb|Phil Jackson coaching the Lakers]]\n\nHowever, injuries, weak bench play, and [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|full-blown public tension]] between Bryant and O'Neal slowed the team down, and they were beaten in the second round of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2003]] NBA Playoffs by the eventual champion [[2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\nAfterward, Jackson clashed frequently with Bryant. While remarkably efficient in Jackson's \"[[triangle offense]]\", Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson's brand of basketball and subsequently called it \"boring\". In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, infuriating the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson's patience enough that the \"Zen Master\" even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Laker management rejected the request.\n\nPrior to the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], the Lakers signed NBA star veterans [[Karl Malone]] and [[Gary Payton]], who had been franchise players for the [[Utah Jazz]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], respectively, leading to predictions by some that the team would finish with the best record in NBA history. But from the first day of training camp, the Lakers were beset by distractions. Bryant's [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|trial for alleged sexual assault]], continued public sniping between O'Neal and Bryant, and repeated disputes between Jackson and Bryant all affected the team during the season. Despite these distractions, the Lakers beat the defending champion Spurs en route to advancing to the [[2004 NBA Finals]] and were heavy favorites to regain the title. However, they were upset by the [[2003\u201304 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], who used their strong defense to dominate the Lakers, winning the title four games to one. This marked the first time in ten attempts as head coach that Jackson had lost in the [[NBA Finals]].\n\nOn June 18, 2004, three days after the loss to the Pistons, the Lakers announced that Jackson would leave his position as Lakers coach. Jackson was seeking to double his salary from $6&nbsp;million to $12&nbsp;million on his expiring contract. He had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423>[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.423</ref> Winter said Jackson announced at the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423/> Many fans attributed Jackson's departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, as Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss|Dr. Jerry Buss]] reportedly sided with Bryant. Jackson, Bryant and Buss all denied that Bryant had made any explicit demand regarding Jackson. However, O'Neal, upon hearing General Manager [[Mitch Kupchak]]'s announcement of the team's willingness to trade O'Neal and its intention to keep Bryant, indicated that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant's wishes with the departure of Jackson. O'Neal's trade to the [[2004\u201305 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] was the end of the \"Trifecta\" that had led the Lakers to three championship titles.\n\nThat fall, Jackson released ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul|The Last Season]]'', a book which describes his point of view of the tensions that surrounded the 2003\u201304 Lakers team. The book was pointedly critical of [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\nWithout Jackson and O'Neal, the Lakers were forced to become a faster paced team on the court. Though they achieved some success in the first half of the season, injuries to several players including Kobe Bryant and [[Lamar Odom]] forced the team out of contention, going 34\u201348 in [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305]] and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]], Jackson's successor as coach, resigned midway through the season after coaching just 41 games, citing health issues not relating to his past bout with [[bladder]] cancer, which immediately led to speculation that the Lakers might bring Jackson back.\n\n===Return to the Lakers (2005\u20132011)===\n\nOn June 15, 2005, the Lakers rehired Jackson. Jackson led the Lakers to a seventh-seed playoff berth. Once again promoting the notion of selfless team play embodied by the [[triangle offense]], the team achieved substantial results, especially in the last month of the season. Jackson also worked seamlessly with Bryant, who had earlier shown his desire to bring back Jackson to the bench. Bryant's regular-season performance won him the league scoring title and made him a finalist in MVP voting. However, the Lakers faced a tough 2006 first-round matchup against the second-seeded [[2005\u201306 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]], who were led by eventual MVP winner [[Steve Nash]]. It was the first time that Jackson's team had failed to reach the second round of the playoffs. The Lakers jumped out to a 3\u20131 lead following a dramatic last second shot by Bryant in overtime to win game four, but the Suns recovered to win the last three and take the series.\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson 08.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson (right) in 2008, standing next to Lakers assistant coach [[Frank Hamblen]] (left).]]\nOn January 7, 2007, Jackson won his 900th game, then placing him 9th on the all-time win list for NBA coaches. With this win, Jackson became the fastest to reach 900 career wins, doing so in only 1,264 games and beating [[Pat Riley]]'s previous record of 900 in 1,278 games.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, after announcing he would return to his position as coach just a few days prior, Jackson inked a 2-year contract extension to continue his tenure with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] through the end of the 2009\u20132010 season.\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, the Lakers were able to obtain [[Pau Gasol]] in a trade with the [[2007\u201308 Memphis Grizzlies season|Memphis Grizzlies]]. With another star to pair with Bryant, Jackson coached the Lakers to an appearance in the [[2008 NBA Finals]] against the [[2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]]. Boston went on to win the series 4\u20132, in the process handing Jackson and the Lakers their worst playoff loss ever in Game 6, a 39-point defeat.

On September 12, 1885, two young men walked along a county road south of Dixon, one a [[Farmworker|farm hand]] named Joseph M. Mosse and the other, Frank C. Thiel, a [[Door-to-door|traveling salesman]] from Elgin, IL. The unemployed farmhand told the salesman of a place he could sell his [[Bible]]s and proceeded to take him to a farm where he had worked. As the two men passed a [[gulch]] the farmhand struck and killed the salesman with a knife and a [[walnut]] [[baluster]] he was seen carrying under his arm. He then buried the body in the [[culvert]]. The body was later discovered when [[cattle]] refused to use the underpass en route to a milking barn.

One aspect of this small town is that an individual can kayak the Rock River to the city's downtown docks and join a public Yoga session on the riverfront.\n\nThe Petunia Festival was conceived after Dutch Elm Disease and highway expansion wiped out the trees along the major roads in the late 1950s. In response to the dramatic change the streetscape underwent, the Dixon Men's Garden Club planted petunias along Galena Avenue to regain some sort of streetscape identity once again in the early 1960s. Before this annual festival, volunteers plant thousands of pink petunias along the main streets.

On September 12, 1885, two young men walked along a county road south of Dixon, one a [[Farmworker|farm hand]] named Joseph M. Mosse and the other, Frank C. Thiel, a [[Door-to-door|traveling salesman]] from Elgin, IL. The unemployed farmhand told the salesman of a place he could sell his [[Bible]]s and proceeded to take him to a farm where he had worked. As the two men passed a [[gulch]] the farmhand struck and killed the salesman with a knife and a [[walnut]] [[baluster]] he was seen carrying under his arm. He then buried the body in the [[culvert]]. The body was later discovered when [[cattle]] refused to use the underpass en route to a milking barn. An overnight rain had washed away some of the dirt exposing a limb. When the sheriff arrived to question the farm hand, since he was seen leaving Dixon with the deceased, he pretended to get a drink while throwing a watch chain taken from the salesman in the bushes. The evidence was found and the farmhand was eventually put in jail for life, with evidence that today \"the evidence used to convict Mosse is now considered somewhat questionable.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406190118/https://www.wqad.com/article/news/local/drone/8-in-the-air/dixons-bloody-gulch-road-has-haunting-history/526-637f340d-3cff-4d46-9932-c02d2b8e89e3|title=Dixon\u2019s Bloody Gulch Road has haunting history {{!}} wqad.com|date=2020-04-06|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  The road over the underpass began to be called Bloody Gulch Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leecountyhistory.com/articles/930805.htm|title=Bloody Gulch Road and Early Justice|publisher=Lee County Historical Society|accessdate=2012-09-06|dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2012, Dixon Municipal Comptroller [[Rita Crundwell]] was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury for embezzlement.

At an early age, he showed unusual ability as a painter and sketcher. Another childhood passion was cinema; his interest in filmmaking was abetted by his parents' giving him an 8&nbsp;mm camera, which he used to produce home-made movies with his friends.\n \nAt the age of eight, he made his first trip to Spain. In Madrid, he sang for the first time in public with the Hotel Aveneda orchestra, interpreting the song \"Las hojas muertas\" (\"The Dead Leaves\"). At age 9 he watched ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a movie that had a powerful influence on him and inspired him to write his first poems in English. Another cinematic influence at that age was the movie ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'', where he discovered the eroticism and sensuality of [[Marilyn Monroe]].\n\n===Return to Spain===\nIn 1954, after a short stay in [[Barcelona]], Aute returned definitively to [[Madrid]], where he studied at the [[Colegio Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Maravillas]]. At 15, with his new guitar received as a birthday present, he performed at an end of school party, as part of a trio with two friends. Although he enjoyed music, art remained his primary passion. During these early years he was strongly influenced by [[German Expressionism]] and dedicated most of his time to painting, winning a silver medal in a Spanish Juvenile Art Contest.\n\n====1960s and 1970s====\nAute initially planned to be an architect but left school almost immediately to pursue a variety of career paths\u2014music, art, and film. He also wrote screenplays and several short stories (science fiction). Aute spent more than a year in France, working mainly in film. One of his first jobs was working as a translator and second assistant for the film ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Music===\nWhen he returned to Spain, he began writing songs for other artists like [[Massiel]] (''[[Rosas en el mar]]''). His song \"Aleluya #1\" became a huge hit in the United States when recorded in the United States by [[Ed Ames]] as \"[[Who Will Answer]]\". Although his friends and colleagues encouraged him to record his own songs, Aute initially refused, saying he didn't enjoy performing publicly.\n \nEventually, he pushed past his shyness and began a successful career with singles like \"Don Ram\u00f3n\" and \"Made in Spain\". His first album was ''Di\u00e1logos de Rodrigo y Ximena'' in 1968. By the 1970s, he was creating soundtracks for films directed by [[Jaime Ch\u00e1varri]], [[Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga]], [[Fernando Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez]], [[Fernando M\u00e9ndez]], and others.\n \nIn 1977, Aute performed in his first large public concert in Spain. Invited by the Cuban government to participate in the [[World Festival of Youth and Students|World Festival of Youth]] in Havana, Aute contracted tuberculosis and spent five months in Cuba recovering. This enforced downtime cemented his friendship with a Cuban musician, [[Silvio Rodr\u00edguez]], whom he later shared a concert stage with. That concert, [[Mano a Mano (Silvio Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Eduardo Aute album)|Mano a Mano]], became the basis of an international best-selling album.\n\n===Art===\nAute had his first individual exhibit in the gallery Alcon de Madrid in 1960. He was just sixteen. Two years later, he had his second exhibit in Madrid's Gallery Quixote. By 1964, his work was being sold in the United States at the Juarez Gallery in [[Palm Beach, Florida]].\n \nIn 1966, he was selected to participate in the Nona Biennial de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, where he brought three large pieces. During a brief break with music, he designed album covers that have become collectibles. In 1974, Aute won first prize for painting in the XXVIII Mostra Michetti in Italy. His work was featured in galleries and museums all over Europe.\n\n===Film===\nAute's interest in film showed up early in his life. In 1961, he created ''Senses'', a short film. In 1970, he wrote and directed another short film, ''Minutos despu\u00e9s'', which was selected for the II [[festival de Cine de Autor de Benalm\u00e1dena]]. In 1974 he wrote and directed ''A flor de piel'', his last short film for over ten years.\n\n===Poetry===\nAlthough he'd written poetry in both English and Spanish as a youth, Aute made a big splash in 1970 when he published a poem and drawing in Poesia 70 that managed to get the magazine shut down in conservative, Franco-controlled Spain. In 1975, he published \"Mathematics of the Mirror\" and followed it up a year later with \"Songs and Poems.\" In 1978, he published ''Liturgy of Disorder''.\n\n====1980 and 1990s====\n=====Music=====\nIn 1980, Aute began a long musical association with Luis Mendo, who arranged many of his songs. In 1983, Aute performed in a concert, \"Entre Amigos\", with [[Silvio Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Pablo Milan\u00e9s]], Teddy Bautista, and [[Joan Manuel Serrat]]. The concert, held in the Salamanca Theater in Madrid, was recorded live.\n \nThe prize-winning album resulting from the concert was a huge hit in both Spain and Latin America. In 1984, he released \"Cuerpo a cuerpo\", the first time he combined his music and art thematically. In 1992, \"Slowly\" climbed the charts and was followed one year later by ''[[Mano a Mano (Silvio Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Eduardo Aute album)|Mano a Mano]]'' with [[Silvio Rodriguez]].\n\n=====Art=====\nIn the 1980s, Aute's work was exhibited in galleries and shows all over Europe. In 1987, he combined an album, \"Templo\", with an art exhibit. He followed this pattern with a successful tour of Latin America and Spain with an exhibit called ''Ad Libidum'' in the mid 1990s.\n\n=====Film=====\nIn 1986, Aute wrote and directed ''El muro de las lamentaciones''; it was followed by ''La pupila del extasis'', several years later.\n\n=====Poetry=====\nIn 1980, he put out a revised edition of ''Songs and Poems''. Six years later, he released \"Temple of flesh\". Along the way, he developed a type of poetry he calls \"poemigas\", short poems that often feature plays on words. He also developed a series called ''Animal'', which combined poetry, art, and music.\n\n====2000 to 2020====\n=====Music=====\nIn 2000, a number of Aute's peers produced a tribute album called \"Mira que eres canalla, Aute\" as a tribute to him. Fifteen years later, another generation of musicians released a second tribute, Giraluna. Aute has continued his successful practice of combining music and art, adding poetry and film to the mix as well.\n \nIn 2001, he was awarded the Premio Luigi Tenco for his body of work. In 2003, he released ''Alas and Balas'', his first album in four years and \"Auterretratos,\" a collection of his work that was completed later with \"Auterretratos Volumes Two and Three.\" In 2012, he released ''El nino que miraba el mar'', an animated film, scored by Aute himself, that also featured his own drawings.\n \nIn 2015, Aute released Canciones de Amor y Destruccion, an album he combined with 3D art work and toured with Giraluna, a concert featuring a short film animated and produced by Aute.\n\n=====Art=====\nThe 21st century brought a new twist to his work with a film called \"A Dog Called Pain.\" Aute created over 4,000 drawings to animate the film. He also toured with an exhibit called \"Transfigurations\" that had venues in Cuba, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, and Italy between 2004 and 2010. This was followed by a retrospective of his work in Zaragosa. Rarely has a year gone by since his first exhibit in 1960 without an Aute show somewhere in the world.\n\n=====Film=====\nIn 2001, Aute released \"A Dog Called Pain,\" an animated film that he wrote, directed, and scored. The firm was featured in the film festivals of San Sebastian, Valladolid, Havana, and Tribeca (in the United States) as well as other venues. This successful format was followed by \"El nino y el basilisco\" and \"Giraluna.\"\n\n=====Poetry=====\nIn 2002, Aute released \"Volver al agua,\" a compilation of his work.

At an early age, he showed unusual ability as a painter and sketcher. Another childhood passion was cinema; his interest in filmmaking was abetted by his parents' giving him an 8&nbsp;mm camera, which he used to produce home-made movies with his friends.\n \nAt the age of eight, he made his first trip to Spain. In Madrid, he sang for the first time in public with the Hotel Aveneda orchestra, interpreting the song \"Las hojas muertas\" (\"The Dead Leaves\"). At age 9 he watched ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a movie that had a powerful influence on him and inspired him to write his first poems in English. Another cinematic influence at that age was the movie ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'', where he discovered the eroticism and sensuality of [[Marilyn Monroe]].\n\n===Return to Spain===\nIn 1954, after a short stay in [[Barcelona]], Aute returned definitively to [[Madrid]], where he studied at the [[Colegio Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Maravillas]]. At 15, with his new guitar received as a birthday present, he performed at an end of school party, as part of a trio with two friends. Although he enjoyed music, art remained his primary passion. During these early years he was strongly influenced by [[German Expressionism]] and dedicated most of his time to painting, winning a silver medal in a Spanish Juvenile Art Contest.\n\n====1960s and 1970s====\nAute initially planned to be an architect but left school almost immediately to pursue a variety of career paths\u2014music, art, and film. He also wrote screenplays and several short stories (science fiction). Aute spent more than a year in France, working mainly in film. One of his first jobs was working as a translator and second assistant for the film ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Music===\nWhen he returned to Spain, he began writing songs for other artists like [[Massiel]] (''[[Rosas en el mar]]''). His song \"Aleluya #1\" became a huge hit in the United States when recorded in the United States by [[Ed Ames]] as \"[[Who Will Answer]]\". Although his friends and colleagues encouraged him to record his own songs, Aute initially refused, saying he didn't enjoy performing publicly.\n \nEventually, he pushed past his shyness and began a successful career with singles like \"Don Ram\u00f3n\" and \"Made in Spain\". His first album was ''Di\u00e1logos de Rodrigo y Ximena'' in 1968. By the 1970s, he was creating soundtracks for films directed by [[Jaime Ch\u00e1varri]], [[Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga]], [[Fernando Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez]], [[Fernando M\u00e9ndez]], and others.\n \nIn 1977, Aute performed in his first large public concert in Spain. Invited by the Cuban government to participate in the [[World Festival of Youth and Students|World Festival of Youth]] in Havana, Aute contracted tuberculosis and spent five months in Cuba recovering. This enforced downtime cemented his friendship with a Cuban musician, [[Silvio Rodr\u00edguez]], whom he later shared a concert stage with. That concert, [[Mano a Mano (Silvio Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Eduardo Aute album)|Mano a Mano]], became the basis of an international best-selling album.\n\n===Art===\nAute had his first individual exhibit in the gallery Alcon de Madrid in 1960. He was just sixteen. Two years later, he had his second exhibit in Madrid's Gallery Quixote. By 1964, his work was being sold in the United States at the Juarez Gallery in [[Palm Beach, Florida]].\n \nIn 1966, he was selected to participate in the Nona Biennial de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, where he brought three large pieces. During a brief break with music, he designed album covers that have become collectibles. In 1974, Aute won first prize for painting in the XXVIII Mostra Michetti in Italy. His work was featured in galleries and museums all over Europe.\n\n===Film===\nAute's interest in film showed up early in his life. In 1961, he created ''Senses'', a short film. In 1970, he wrote and directed another short film, ''Minutos despues'', which was selected for the II festival de Cine de Autor de Benalmadena. In 1974 he wrote and directed ''A flor de piel'', his last short film for over ten years.\n\n===Poetry===\nAlthough he'd written poetry in both English and Spanish as a youth, Aute made a big splash in 1970 when he published a poem and drawing in Poesia 70 that managed to get the magazine shut down in conservative, Franco-controlled Spain. In 1975, he published \"Mathematics of the Mirror\" and followed it up a year later with \"Songs and Poems.\" In 1978, he published ''Liturgy of Disorder''.\n\n====1980 and 1990s====\n=====Music=====\nIn 1980, Aute began a long musical association with Luis Mendo, who arranged many of his songs. In 1983, Aute performed in a concert, \"Entre Amigos\", with [[Silvio Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Pablo Milan\u00e9s]], Teddy Bautista, and [[Joan Manuel Serrat]]. The concert, held in the Salamanca Theater in Madrid, was recorded live.\n \nThe prize-winning album resulting from the concert was a huge hit in both Spain and Latin America. In 1984, he released \"Cuerpo a cuerpo\", the first time he combined his music and art thematically. In 1992, \"Slowly\" climbed the charts and was followed one year later by ''[[Mano a Mano (Silvio Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Eduardo Aute album)|Mano a Mano]]'' with [[Silvio Rodriguez]].\n\n=====Art=====\nIn the 1980s, Aute's work was exhibited in galleries and shows all over Europe. In 1987, he combined an album, \"Templo\", with an art exhibit. He followed this pattern with a successful tour of Latin America and Spain with an exhibit called ''Ad Libidum'' in the mid 1990s.\n\n=====Film=====\nIn 1986, Aute wrote and directed ''El muro de las lamentaciones''; it was followed by ''La pupila del extasis'', several years later.\n\n=====Poetry=====\nIn 1980, he put out a revised edition of ''Songs and Poems''. Six years later, he released \"Temple of flesh\". Along the way, he developed a type of poetry he calls \"poemigas\", short poems that often feature plays on words. He also developed a series called ''Animal'', which combined poetry, art, and music.\n\n====2000 to 2020====\n=====Music=====\nIn 2000, a number of Aute's peers produced a tribute album called \"Mira que eres canalla, Aute\" as a tribute to him. Fifteen years later, another generation of musicians released a second tribute, Giraluna. Aute has continued his successful practice of combining music and art, adding poetry and film to the mix as well.\n \nIn 2001, he was awarded the Premio Luigi Tenco for his body of work. In 2003, he released ''Alas and Balas'', his first album in four years and \"Auterretratos,\" a collection of his work that was completed later with \"Auterretratos Volumes Two and Three.\" In 2012, he released ''El nino que miraba el mar'', an animated film, scored by Aute himself, that also featured his own drawings.\n \nIn 2015, Aute released Canciones de Amor y Destruccion, an album he combined with 3D art work and toured with Giraluna, a concert featuring a short film animated and produced by Aute.\n\n=====Art=====\nThe 21st century brought a new twist to his work with a film called \"A Dog Called Pain.\" Aute created over 4,000 drawings to animate the film. He also toured with an exhibit called \"Transfigurations\" that had venues in Cuba, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, and Italy between 2004 and 2010. This was followed by a retrospective of his work in Zaragosa. Rarely has a year gone by since his first exhibit in 1960 without an Aute show somewhere in the world.\n\n=====Film=====\nIn 2001, Aute released \"A Dog Called Pain,\" an animated film that he wrote, directed, and scored. The firm was featured in the film festivals of San Sebastian, Valladolid, Havana, and Tribeca (in the United States) as well as other venues. This successful format was followed by \"El nino y el basilisco\" and \"Giraluna.\"\n\n=====Poetry=====\nIn 2002, Aute released \"Volver al agua,\" a compilation of his work. This was followed by \"What Things Are\" in 2005. He has continued throughout his career to combine poetry with other art forms.\n\n==Discography==\n*''Di\u00e1logos de Rodrigo y Gimena'' (RCA-Victor, 1968)\n*''24 Canciones Breves (1967-68)'' (RCA-Victor, 1968)\n*''\u00c1lbum 1966-67'' (1972)\n*''Rito'' (Ariola, 1973)\n*''Espuma'' (Ariola, 1974)\n*''Babel'' (Ariola, 1975)\n*''Sarc\u00f3fago'' (Ariola, 1976)\n*''Forgesound'' (Ariola, 1977)\n*''Albanta'' (Ariola, 1978)\n*''De Par en Par'' (Ariola, 1979)\n*''Alma'' (Movieplay, 1980)\n*''Fuga'' (Movieplay, 1981)\n*''Entre Amigos'' (Movieplay, 1983)\n*''Cuerpo a Cuerpo'' (Ariola, 1984)\n*''Nudo'' (Ariola, 1985)\n*''20 Canciones de Amor y un Poema Desesperado'' (Ariola, 1986)\n*''Templo'' (Ariola, 1987)\n*''Segundos Fuera'' (Ariola, 1989)\n*''Ufff!''

When Mark and Becky come to visit Harris, it is revealed that they too are expecting; Mark wants to spread the news, but Becky opts to keep it quiet until things are going more smoothly with Harris. Darlene is apprehensive about overstaying their welcome but when she questions her mother, Roseanne says she wants them to stay forever. Darlene would like that too, so she's relieved. Leon and his husband announce that they will be adopting a little girl, Nadia, who needs a family.<hr />In the first half, the family talks about life after winning the lottery. Then Roseanne reflects about her fictional life as a voiceover monologue reveals that the show itself has really been her writing. She says that while the book she was writing was based on her life, she changed what she didn't like. For instance: in reality, the Conners did not win the lottery; Dan had in real life died of the heart attack he suffered the day of Darlene and David's wedding; Jackie\u2014not Bev\u2014was gay; and Mark and Darlene, and Becky and David, were the Conner-Healy couples. In the final moments, after looking over her book and telling the audience about her depression after Dan's death and how the difficult birth of the baby snapped her back into reality, she goes upstairs and sits on the couch. As the show fades to black, [[Phoebe Snow]] sings the theme song one last time and Roseanne's trademark laugh is heard one last time.

It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991), released on [[DGC Records]]. The unexpected success of the song propelled ''Nevermind'' to the top of several albums charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where [[Grunge#Adoption by mainstream|grunge entered the mainstream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nirvana-mn0000357406|title=Nirvana \u2013 Biography|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was Nirvana's biggest hit in most countries, charting high on music industry charts around the world in 1991 and 1992, including topping the charts of Belgium, France, New Zealand and Spain. The song received critical plaudits, including topping the ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll. The song was dubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of [[Generation X]], but Nirvana grew uncomfortable with the attention it brought them. In the years since [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as one of the greatest songs in the history of music.\n\nThe music video for the song is based on the concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot, inspired by [[Jonathan Kaplan]]'s 1979 film ''[[Over the Edge (film)|Over the Edge]]'' and the [[Ramones]]' film ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]''. It won two [[MTV Video Music Awards]], which was in heavy rotation on music television. In subsequent years Amy Finnerty, formerly of [[MTV]]'s programming department, claimed the video \"changed the entire look of MTV\" by giving the channel \"a whole new generation to sell to\". In 2000 the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' named \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" the \"Most Played Video\" on [[MTV Europe]]. \n\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was included in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s list of [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame#\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\"|The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]]. In 2001, The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) ranked the song at number 80 on their [[Songs of the Century]] list. In 2002, ''[[NME]]'' ranked the song the number two on its list of \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\", while ''[[Kerrang!]]'' ranked it at number one on its list of the \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\".<ref name=\"Kerrang! 2002\" /> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" ninth on its list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref name=\"RS 2004\" /> In 2017, it was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]]. <!--See section \"Release, success, and acclaim\"-->\n\n==Origins and recording==\nNirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] said that \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was an attempt to write a song in the style of the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], a band he greatly admired:\n\n{{quote|I was trying to write the ultimate pop song.

On September 10, it was released as the lead single from ''Nevermind'', Nirvana's major label debut on [[DGC Records]]. The song did not initially chart, and sold well only in regions of the United States with an established Nirvana fanbase.<ref>Berkenstadt; Cross, p. 111.</ref>\n\nThe single was intended to be a base-building alternative rock cut from the album, and not expected to be a hit; the follow-up single \"Come as You Are\" was planned as the single that could cross over to mainstream formats. However, [[campus radio]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations placed \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on heavy rotation. Danny Goldberg of Nirvana's management firm Gold Mountain said: \"None of us heard it as a crossover song, but the public heard it and it was instantaneous ... They heard it on alternative radio, and then they rushed out like lemmings to buy it.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 227.</ref>\n\nThe video received its world premiere on MTV's late-night alternative rock program ''[[120 Minutes]]'', and proved so popular that the channel began to air it during its regular daytime rotation.<ref name=\"Azerrad199\">Azerrad, p. 199.</ref> MTV added the video to its \"Buzz Bin\" selection in October, where it stayed until mid-December. By the end of the year, the song, music video, and the ''Nevermind'' album had become hits. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and ''Nevermind'' became a rare cross-format phenomenon, reaching all the major rock radio formats including modern rock, hard rock, album rock, and college radio.<ref>Berkenstadt; Cross, pp. 124\u201325.</ref>\n\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was also a critical success.

Our posting them would be a violation. --->\n\nThe lyrics to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" were often difficult for listeners to decipher, both due to their nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was compounded by the fact that the ''Nevermind'' album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, \"We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying.\"<ref>Cross, pp. 204\u201305.</ref> MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule.<ref name=\"Azerrad199\"/> The lyrics for the album\u2014and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs\u2014were later released with the liner notes of the \"[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]\" single in 1992. American rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was \"the '[[Louie Louie]]' of the nineties\" and wrote, \"Like 'Louie', only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently.\"<ref>Marsh, p. 204.</ref> Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that \"what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang,\" and added, \"Worst of all, I'm not sure that I know more about [the meaning of] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts.\"<ref>Marsh, p. 206.</ref>\n\nThe book ''Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song'' describes \"Teen Spirit\" as \"a typically murky Cobain exploration of meaning and meaninglessness\".<ref>Crisafulli, p. 37.</ref> Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain's contradictory lyrics (such as \"It's fun to lose and to pretend\") and states \"the point that emerges isn't just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator\u2014he's angry that he's confused\". Azerrad's conclusion is that the song is \"alternately a sarcastic reaction to the idea of actually having a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea\". Additionally, the \"famously obscure couplet\"\u2014\"A mulatto, an albino / A mosquito, my libido\"\u2014is, according to Azerrad, \"nothing more than two pairs of opposites, a funny way of saying the narrator is very horny\".<ref name=\"Azerrad213\">Azerrad, p. 213.</ref> In ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]'', [[Charles R. Cross]]' biography of Cobain, Cross argues that the song is a reference to Cobain's relationship with ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. Cross cites the line \"She's over-bored and self-assured\" and states the song \"could not have been about anyone else\". Cross backs up his argument with lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, such as \"Who will be the King & Queen of the outcasted{{sic}} teens.\"<ref>Cross, p. 169.</ref><ref>Earlier drafts of the lyrics to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" have been reprinted in Kurt Cobain's ''Journals'' (2002).</ref>\n\n\"Teen Spirit\" is widely interpreted as a [[Adolescence|teen]] revolution anthem, an interpretation reinforced by the music video.<ref name=\"Crisafulli38\" /> In an interview conducted the day ''Nevermind'' was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, \"We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults ... It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme.\"<ref name=\":0\">Berkenstadt; Cross, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> In Michael Azerrad's biography ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'', Cobain said he felt a duty \"to describe what I felt about my surroundings and my generation and people my age\".<ref name=\"Azerrad21112\" /> He also said, \"The entire song is made up of contradictory ideas ... It's just making fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad213\" /> As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the meaning.<ref name=\":0\" /> Grohl stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, \"Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has a lot to say about something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 214.</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:Kurt Cobain, Smells Like Teen Spirit guitar, EMP Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fender Mustang]] guitar played by Kurt Cobain in the \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" music video.]]\n[[File:CastingCallSmellsLikeTeenSpirit.jpg|left|thumb|Announcement from the band encouraging people to participate in the making of the music video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"]]\nThe music video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was the first for director [[Samuel Bayer]].

The video ends with the students destroying the set and the band's gear. The discontent was genuine; the extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to [[moshing|mosh]], and the set became a scene of chaos. \"Once the kids came out dancing they just said 'fuck you', because they were so tired of his shit throughout the day,\" Cobain said.<ref name=\"Azerrad19091\">Azerrad, pp. 190\u201391.</ref> Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and oversaw a re-edit of the video, creating the final version.<ref name=\"qpg54\" /> One of Cobain's major additions was the penultimate shot, a close-up of his face after it had been obscured for most of the video.<ref name=\"Azerrad19091\" /> Another major change involved two sequences of a principal standing next to a loudspeaker and getting sprayed with confetti, and a teacher dressed like a nerd dancing to the song with a \"Dunce\" cap before being tied to a basketball hoop pole.

A recording of the earlier version appears on ''With the Lights Out'' and again on ''[[Sliver: The Best of the Box]]''. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary ''[[1991: The Year Punk Broke]]'', filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with [[Sonic Youth]].\n\nNirvana often altered the song's lyrics and [[tempo]] for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \"our little group has always been\" changed to \"our little tribe has always been\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album ''[[From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]]''. ''Rolling Stone'' remarked that the ''Wishkah'' version of \"Teen Spirit\" \"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\".<ref>{{cite web | author=Ali, Lorraine | date = February 2, 1998 | title=''From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah'' (review) |work=Rolling Stone | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/from-the-muddy-banks-of-the-wishkah-19980202 | accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref> A notable alternate performance of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" occurred on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \"Load up on guns, bring your friends\" became \"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\").   Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] frontman [[Morrissey]].<ref>Cross, p. 208.</ref> When ''Top of the Pops'' was cancelled in 2006, ''The Observer'' listed Nirvana's performance of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as the third greatest in the show's history.<ref>{{cite web | date = July 16, 2006 | title=\"Top of the Pops\" shows |work=Guardian |location=UK | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/32 | accessdate=October 18, 2006}}</ref> This performance can be found on the 1994 home video ''[[Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!]]''.\n\n==Parodies and appearances in other media==\n{{In popular culture|date=October 2018}}\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" has inspired a few parodies. [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] parodied the song in 1992 with \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\", a song about Nirvana itself. Yankovic parodied the difficulty in understanding Cobain's singing as well as the lyrics and their meaning. Yankovic has said Cobain told him he realized that Nirvana had \"made it\" when he heard the parody.<ref>{{cite web| date = September 19, 2006 | title=Weird Al Yankovic Dishes On James Blunt, Discusses His Role As the Whitest, Nerdiest Rock Star Ever |work=Rolling Stone | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/weird-al-yankovic-dishes-on-james-blunt-discusses-his-role-as-the-whitest-nerdiest-rock-star-ever-20060919 | accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> In 1995, the [[queercore]] band [[Pansy Division]] recorded a parody of the song called \"Smells Like Queer Spirit\" for its ''[[Pile Up]]'' album. Pansy Division guitarist [[Jon Ginoli]] insisted that his band's version of the song was not a parody but \"an affectionate tribute\".<ref name=\"Teen Spirit at ten\" /> In 2018, a video of the original Nirvana version was posted on [[Vimeo]] that had been [[autotune|auto-tuned]] to be in a major key. This resulted in the song sounding like a \"mainstream pop song\" or a [[Top 40|Top 40 Rock]] song.<ref>[http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a14759352/smells-like-teen-spirit-nirvana-wrong-key/ 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' in the Wrong Key Proves That Nirvana Could Have Been a Great Pop Band].</ref>\n\nIn 1996, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) debuted a theme song for a [[Wrestling|wrestler]] known as [[Diamond Dallas Page]]. The song, named \"Self High-Five\", resembled \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" very closely. Dave Grohl took notice and called it a \"rip-off\", saying, \"WCW owes us money.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/253249-dave-grohl-had-heat-with-ddpwcw-over-qself-high-fiveq|title=Dave Grohl Had Heat With DDP/WCW Over \"Self High Five\" - Wrestlezone|date=April 17, 2012|work=Wrestlezone|access-date=June 1, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> The music was subsequently altered to sound different enough from \"Teen Spirit\". No lawsuits or further action took place, but on WWE Network that version was dubbed over an alternative version known as \"Diamonds\".\n\nThe song has also appeared in films. In the 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', the song was sung during the \"Can Can\" scene introducing the titular nightclub.<ref>{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Kate|date=June 1, 2016|title=Ranking the

It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991), released on [[DGC Records]]. The unexpected success of the song propelled ''Nevermind'' to the top of several albums charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where [[Grunge#Adoption by mainstream|grunge entered the mainstream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nirvana-mn0000357406|title=Nirvana \u2013 Biography|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was Nirvana's biggest hit in most countries, charting high on music industry charts around the world in 1991 and 1992, including topping the charts of Belgium, France, New Zealand and Spain. The song received critical plaudits, including topping the ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll. The song was dubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of [[Generation X]], but Nirvana grew uncomfortable with the attention it brought them. In the years since [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as one of the greatest songs in the history of music.\n\nThe music video for the song is based on the concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot, inspired by [[Jonathan Kaplan]]'s 1979 film ''[[Over the Edge (film)|Over the Edge]]'' and the [[Ramones]]' film ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]''. It won two [[MTV Video Music Awards]], which was in heavy rotation on music television. In subsequent years Amy Finnerty, formerly of [[MTV]]'s programming department, claimed the video \"changed the entire look of MTV\" by giving the channel \"a whole new generation to sell to\". In 2000 the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' named \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" the \"Most Played Video\" on [[MTV Europe]]. \n\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was included in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s list of [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame#\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\"|The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]]. In 2001, The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) ranked the song at number 80 on their [[Songs of the Century]] list. In 2002, ''[[NME]]'' ranked the song the number two on its list of \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\", while ''[[Kerrang!]]'' ranked it at number one on its list of the \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\".<ref name=\"Kerrang! 2002\" /> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" ninth on its list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref name=\"RS 2004\" /> In 2017, it was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]]. <!--See section \"Release, success, and acclaim\"-->\n\n==Origins and recording==\nNirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] said that \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was an attempt to write a song in the style of the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], a band he greatly admired:\n\n{{quote|I was trying to write the ultimate pop song.

''Guitar World'', December 1995.</ref>\n\nDuring the verses, the band maintains the same chord progression as the chorus. Cobain plays a two-note guitar line over Novoselic's root-note [[eighth note]] bassline, which outlines the chord progression. Approaching the chorus, Cobain begins to play the same two notes on every beat of the measure and repeats the word \"Hello\".<ref name=\"Rooksby133\"/> Following the first and second choruses, Cobain simultaneously sings the word \"Yay\" and performs a unison bend on his guitar.<ref>Rooksby, p. 134.</ref> After the second chorus, Cobain plays a 16-bar guitar solo restating his vocal melody from the verse and pre-chorus.<ref name=\"Starr\">Starr; Waterman, pp. 434\u20135.</ref> During the closing refrain, Cobain sings \"A denial\" repeatedly; his voice becomes strained from the force of yelling.<ref name=classicalbums />\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was released to radio on August 27, 1991. On September 10, it was released as the lead single from ''Nevermind'', Nirvana's major label debut on [[DGC Records]]. The song did not initially chart, and sold well only in regions of the United States with an established Nirvana fanbase.<ref>Berkenstadt; Cross, p. 111.</ref>\n\nThe single was intended to be a base-building alternative rock cut from the album, and not expected to be a hit; the follow-up single \"Come as You Are\" was planned as the single that could cross over to mainstream formats. However, [[campus radio]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations placed \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on heavy rotation. Danny Goldberg of Nirvana's management firm Gold Mountain said: \"None of us heard it as a crossover song, but the public heard it and it was instantaneous ... They heard it on alternative radio, and then they rushed out like lemmings to buy it.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 227.</ref>\n\nThe video received its world premiere on MTV's late-night alternative rock program ''[[120 Minutes]]'', and proved so popular that the channel began to air it during its regular daytime rotation.<ref name=\"Azerrad199\">Azerrad, p. 199.</ref> MTV added the video to its \"Buzz Bin\" selection in October, where it stayed until mid-December. By the end of the year, the song, music video, and the ''Nevermind'' album had become hits. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and ''Nevermind'' became a rare cross-format phenomenon, reaching all the major rock radio formats including modern rock, hard rock, album rock, and college radio.<ref>Berkenstadt; Cross, pp. 124\u201325.</ref>\n\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was also a critical success. It topped the 1991 ''[[Village Voice]]'' \"[[Pazz & Jop]]\" and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' year-end polls, and reached number two on ''Rolling Stone's'' list of best singles of the year.

Our posting them would be a violation. --->\n\nThe lyrics to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" were often difficult for listeners to decipher, both due to their nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was compounded by the fact that the ''Nevermind'' album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, \"We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying.\"<ref>Cross, pp. 204\u201305.</ref> MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule.<ref name=\"Azerrad199\"/> The lyrics for the album\u2014and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs\u2014were later released with the liner notes of the \"[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]\" single in 1992. American rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was \"the '[[Louie Louie]]' of the nineties\" and wrote, \"Like 'Louie', only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently.\"<ref>Marsh, p. 204.</ref> Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that \"what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang,\" and added, \"Worst of all, I'm not sure that I know more about [the meaning of] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts.\"<ref>Marsh, p. 206.</ref>\n\nThe book ''Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song'' describes \"Teen Spirit\" as \"a typically murky Cobain exploration of meaning and meaninglessness\".<ref>Crisafulli, p. 37.</ref> Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain's contradictory lyrics (such as \"It's fun to lose and to pretend\") and states \"the point that emerges isn't just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator\u2014he's angry that he's confused\". Azerrad's conclusion is that the song is \"alternately a sarcastic reaction to the idea of actually having a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea\". Additionally, the \"famously obscure couplet\"\u2014\"A mulatto, an albino / A mosquito, my libido\"\u2014is, according to Azerrad, \"nothing more than two pairs of opposites, a funny way of saying the narrator is very horny\".<ref name=\"Azerrad213\">Azerrad, p. 213.</ref> In ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]'', [[Charles R. Cross]]' biography of Cobain, Cross argues that the song is a reference to Cobain's relationship with ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. Cross cites the line \"She's over-bored and self-assured\" and states the song \"could not have been about anyone else\". Cross backs up his argument with lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, such as \"Who will be the King & Queen of the outcasted{{sic}} teens.\"<ref>Cross, p. 169.</ref><ref>Earlier drafts of the lyrics to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" have been reprinted in Kurt Cobain's ''Journals'' (2002).</ref>\n\n\"Teen Spirit\" is widely interpreted as a [[Adolescence|teen]] revolution anthem, an interpretation reinforced by the music video.<ref name=\"Crisafulli38\" /> In an interview conducted the day ''Nevermind'' was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, \"We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults ... It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme.\"<ref name=\":0\">Berkenstadt; Cross, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> In Michael Azerrad's biography ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'', Cobain said he felt a duty \"to describe what I felt about my surroundings and my generation and people my age\".<ref name=\"Azerrad21112\" /> He also said, \"The entire song is made up of contradictory ideas ... It's just making fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad213\" /> As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the meaning.<ref name=\":0\" /> Grohl stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, \"Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has a lot to say about something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 214.</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:Kurt Cobain, Smells Like Teen Spirit guitar, EMP Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fender Mustang]] guitar played by Kurt Cobain in the \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" music video.]]\n[[File:CastingCallSmellsLikeTeenSpirit.jpg|left|thumb|Announcement from the band encouraging people to participate in the making of the music video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"]]\nThe music video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was the first for director [[Samuel Bayer]].

The video ends with the students destroying the set and the band's gear. The discontent was genuine; the extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming.

The band performs the song at a faster tempo than the studio recording. }}\n\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the [[OK Hotel]] in [[Seattle]], Washington.<ref>''With the Lights Out'' (p. 23) [CD liner notes]. Santa Monica: Geffen Records. 2004.</ref> The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set ''[[With the Lights Out]]'', while shorter clips are included on the ''[[Nevermind]]'' ''[[Classic Albums]]'' DVD, as well as the documentary film ''[[Hype!]]'' As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \"Come out and play, make up the rules\" instead of the eventual opening of \"Load up on guns, bring your friends\". A recording of the earlier version appears on ''With the Lights Out'' and again on ''[[Sliver: The Best of the Box]]''. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary ''[[1991: The Year Punk Broke]]'', filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with [[Sonic Youth]].\n\nNirvana often altered the song's lyrics and [[tempo]] for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \"our little group has always been\" changed to \"our little tribe has always been\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album ''[[From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]]''. ''Rolling Stone'' remarked that the ''Wishkah'' version of \"Teen Spirit\" \"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\".<ref>{{cite web | author=Ali, Lorraine | date = February 2, 1998 | title=''From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah'' (review) |work=Rolling Stone | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/from-the-muddy-banks-of-the-wishkah-19980202 | accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref> A notable alternate performance of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" occurred on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \"Load up on guns, bring your friends\" became \"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\").   Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] frontman [[Morrissey]].<ref>Cross, p. 208.</ref> When ''Top of the Pops'' was cancelled in 2006, ''The Observer'' listed Nirvana's performance of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as the third greatest in the show's history.<ref>{{cite web | date = July 16, 2006 | title=\"Top of the Pops\" shows |work=Guardian |location=UK | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/32 | accessdate=October 18, 2006}}</ref> This performance can be found on the 1994 home video ''[[Live!

[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] parodied the song in 1992 with \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\", a song about Nirvana itself. Yankovic parodied the difficulty in understanding Cobain's singing as well as the lyrics and their meaning. Yankovic has said Cobain told him he realized that Nirvana had \"made it\" when he heard the parody.<ref>{{cite web| date = September 19, 2006 | title=Weird Al Yankovic Dishes On James Blunt, Discusses His Role As the Whitest, Nerdiest Rock Star Ever |work=Rolling Stone | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/weird-al-yankovic-dishes-on-james-blunt-discusses-his-role-as-the-whitest-nerdiest-rock-star-ever-20060919 | accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> In 1995, the [[queercore]] band [[Pansy Division]] recorded a parody of the song called \"Smells Like Queer Spirit\" for its ''[[Pile Up]]'' album. Pansy Division guitarist [[Jon Ginoli]] insisted that his band's version of the song was not a parody but \"an affectionate tribute\".<ref name=\"Teen Spirit at ten\" /> In 2018, a video of the original Nirvana version was posted on [[Vimeo]] that had been [[autotune|auto-tuned]] to be in a major key. This resulted in the song sounding like a \"mainstream pop song\" or a [[Top 40|Top 40 Rock]] song.<ref>[http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a14759352/smells-like-teen-spirit-nirvana-wrong-key/ 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' in the Wrong Key Proves That Nirvana Could Have Been a Great Pop Band].</ref>\n\nIn 1996, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) debuted a theme song for a [[Wrestling|wrestler]] known as [[Diamond Dallas Page]]. The song, named \"Self High-Five\", resembled \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" very closely. Dave Grohl took notice and called it a \"rip-off\", saying, \"WCW owes us money.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/253249-dave-grohl-had-heat-with-ddpwcw-over-qself-high-fiveq|title=Dave Grohl Had Heat With DDP/WCW Over \"Self High Five\" - Wrestlezone|date=April 17, 2012|work=Wrestlezone|access-date=June 1, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> The music was subsequently altered to sound different enough from \"Teen Spirit\". No lawsuits or further action took place, but on WWE Network that version was dubbed over an alternative version known as \"Diamonds\".\n\nThe song has also appeared in films. In the 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', the song was sung during the \"Can Can\" scene introducing the titular nightclub.<ref>{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Kate|date=June 1, 2016|title=Ranking the
