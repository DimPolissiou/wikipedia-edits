He has been an important figure in German leftist circles since the 1970s, with his songs covering such themes as socialist and communist resistance to oppression in Europe and other places like Latin America. He both wrote new songs and played versions of older historical works.\n\n== Life and work ==\n[[File:Com L24-0331-0006-0003.tif|thumb|Hannes Wader 1975 at the Lenzburg Folkfestival in Switzerland]]\nWader was born in Bethel, near [[Bielefeld]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. His works are mostly based on German [[Folk song|folk songs]]. Aside from his own lyrics, he also performs works of famous poets like [[Eichendorff]]. He now rarely sings the workers' songs and socialist hymns that used to be a large part of his repertoire. He recently published an album exclusively with songs by [[Franz Schubert]]. He also performed translated works from [[Carl Michael Bellman]] on the album ''Liebe, Schnaps & Tod''.\n\nIn the 1970s, Hannes Wader became one of the stars of the political left through his provocative songs. He was a member of the [[German Communist Party]] from 1977 to 1991. Wader even came under suspicions of [[terrorism]] because of his song ''Der Tankerk\u00f6nig'', a spoken song about kidnapping a tycoon.\n\nIn 1973, he moved to [[Struckum]], in [[Nordfriesland]], where he published some of his later albums. In 1998, he and his family moved to the [[Steinburg]] district of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].

He has been an important figure in German leftist circles since the 1970s, with his songs covering such themes as socialist and communist resistance to oppression in Europe and other places like Latin America. He both wrote new songs and played versions of older historical works.\n\n== Life and work ==\n[[File:Com L24-0331-0006-0003.tif|thumb|Hannes Wader 1975 at the Lenzburg Folkfestival in Switzerland]]\nWader was born in Bethel, near [[Bielefeld]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. His works are mostly based on German [[Folk song|folk songs]]. Aside from his own lyrics, he also performs works of famous poets like [[Eichendorff]]. He now rarely sings the workers' songs and socialist hymns that used to be a large part of his repertoire. He recently published an album exclusively with songs by [[Franz Schubert]]. He also performed translated works from [[Carl Michael Bellman]] on the album ''Liebe, Schnaps & Tod''.\n\nIn the 1970s, Hannes Wader became one of the stars of the political left through his provocative songs. He was a member of the [[German Communist Party]] from 1977 to 1991. Wader even came under suspicions of [[terrorism]] because of his song ''Der Tankerk\u00f6nig'', a spoken song about kidnapping a tycoon.\n\nIn 1973, he moved to [[Struckum]], in [[Nordfriesland]], where he published some of his later albums. In 1998, he and his family moved to the [[Steinburg]] district of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. He now lives in [[Kassel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hna.de/kultur/hannes-wader-singen-lebensrettend-mich-4710019.html |title=\"Singen war lebensrettend f\u00fcr mich\" - Interview mit Hannes Wader |trans-title=Interview with Hannes Wader |work=HNA |language=German |first=Matthias |last=Lohr |date=6 February 2015 |accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe has published numerous albums and appeared in [[open-air concert]]s and clubs until 2017.

Montoya and Bullock are two of the many Gotham police officers to stay behind with James Gordon in order to keep the peace among the people who remain.\n\nRenee is the focus of an uneasy truce between Gordon's forces and the crime boss [[Two-Face]]. She reaches out to Two-Face's Harvey Dent [[persona]] in helping with aid and relief efforts, and he falls in love with her. In fact, he keeps her restrained in his headquarters against her will. She becomes involved when Two-Face puts James Gordon on trial for perceived wrongdoing. Renee persuades Two-Face to offer a more fair trial, giving Gordon a defense lawyer. Two-Face's Harvey Dent persona takes on this role, and ultimately convinces Two-Face to allow everyone to go free.\n\nGotham City is later re-opened thanks to humanitarian efforts spearheaded by [[Lex Luthor]].

Believing that the only way to have Montoya is to take everything away from her, Two-Face [[outing|outs]] her as a [[lesbian]] to the public and frames her for [[murder]]. He then kidnaps her, making it look like Montoya has escaped. Two-Face becomes more unstable and the two fight for control of his gun until Batman arrives to save them. Montoya is cleared of all charges and Two-Face returns to Arkham, but Montoya's personal life becomes chaotic, especially with her family: while her younger brother knows about and, to a limited extent, accepts her [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], her religious parents disown her.<ref>''Gotham Central'' (Vol 2) trade paperback, DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn the 2004\u20132005 \"[[Batman: War Games|War Games]]\" storyline, Montoya and [[Crispus Allen]] are ambushed by the [[Black Spider#Johnny LaMonica|Black Spider]], and Allen shoots the villain.<ref>''Gotham Central'' #23 (November 2004).

At the same time numerous other devices are also activated, as Intergang attempts to destroy Gotham by fire. Montoya wears Charlie's mask for the first time, going after [[Bruno \"Ugly\" Mannheim]] as the Question, and finds Mannheim and [[Whisper A'Daire]] about to use Kate as a sacrificial victim. Montoya sets Whisper A'Daire on fire, but is about to be killed by Mannheim when Kate stabs him with the ceremonial knife and collapses in Montoya's arms.{{issue|date=November 2017}}\n\n===\"One Year Later\" and \"Final Crisis\"===\nMontoya appears in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #40 when [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] solicits her help in capturing the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], suspected of the murder of [[Bart Allen]]. The two criminals escape the [[Suicide Squad]] only to be apprehended by Montoya and [[Batwoman]]. Montoya agrees to their release, concluding they are too stupid to be murderers. Montoya maintains that she will not become a member of the [[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]], but Oracle calls upon her to accompany the Birds of Prey in ''Gotham Underground'' #2.\n\nShe later stars in [[Greg Rucka]]'s 2007 limited series, ''[[Crime Bible]]: Five Lessons of Blood'', in which she pursues the Crime Bible and withstands its adherents' efforts to convert her to their cause. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (2008), Montoya informs [[Dan Turpin]] that she is investigating the [[Dark Side Club]]. She later battles [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] and the agents of [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#S.H.A.D.E.|S.H.A.D.E.]] during her investigation of an apocalyptic conspiracy related to the Crime Bible (now in possession of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]) and Darkseid. She is accosted by S.H.A.D.E. agents in her civilian identity when she assists a dying [[Alternative versions of Supergirl#Alternate universe depictions|German Supergirl from a parallel world]].\n\nMontoya appears in the ''[[Final Crisis: Revelations]]'' miniseries by [[Greg Rucka]]. While trying to stop members of the Religion of Crime from obtaining a mystic weapon, she is confronted by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] (whose current host is Crispus Allen, Montoya's former partner). The Spectre states that she is about to receive judgment. He is stopped by Radiant, the Spirit of Mercy, who embodies the ideal of [[Christianity|Christian]] love as introduced by [[Jesus]].\n\n[[Maggie Sawyer]], corrupted by the [[Anti-Life Equation]], emerges from Gotham Central along with the rest of the brainwashed police force. They attempt to unleash the Equation on Montoya, but are stopped by the intervention of the Spectre and Radiant. The Spectre is not able to hold them off for long, because they are protected by the same force that protects Libra. Radiant makes sure that Montoya cannot be brainwashed, and teleports her away. Observing the surroundings, she finds Batwoman lying in the streets. Batwoman reveals that she now obeys Darkseid as well, and starts to recite the Equation. It appears, however, that Montoya is completely immune to the Equation; in the following issue, she is seen in complete control of her own mind.\n\nMontoya appears in ''Final Crisis'' #5, recruited by the underground resistance movement organized by [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]].

The two women engage in a brutal fist fight, only to be interrupted when Victor, now reanimated as a [[Black Lantern]], arrives on the scene and attacks them. After a drawn out battle, Renee discovers that Black Lanterns feed on emotions, and that if she is able to cut herself off from her feelings, she will become invisible. She does so, and angered, Victor stalks off into the night, searching for easier prey. Shiva reveals that she never intended to actually fight Montoya, but felt that attacking her would draw Victor out into the open so she could face him again.<ref>''The Question'' #37. DC Comics</ref>\n\nSome time after this, Montoya teams up with the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] in order to bring down the criminal network that Renee had earlier encountered. Eventually, the hitman known as [[Zeiss (comics)|Zeiss]] attacks the women, having been ordered by an unknown client to kill them. Renee appeals to the hitman's greed, offering him more money if he simply fakes their deaths and leaves them be. After this, Huntress takes Renee to [[Oracle (DC Comics)|Oracle]] for help in tracking down the client who put out the hit, and is flabbergasted upon discovering that Oracle is in fact \"Commissioner Gordon's daughter\". The two women eventually make their way to Oolong Island (home of the [[Doom Patrol]]), where they are arrested.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #862. DC Comics</ref> After escaping from police custody, Huntress and the Question discovered that [[Vandal Savage]] is behind the human trafficking network they had been trying to shut down.

At the 2014 [[Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo]], James Tynion IV, a writer on ''[[Batman Eternal]]'', revealed that the creative team almost included Montoya, but they decided against it, saying, \"We cut her out because we didn't want her to just be in the background of the GCPD.

In addition, Rodor provided Montoya with a shampoo that causes her hair to change color when exposed to the gas. According to the ''Question: Secret Origin'' backup in ''52'', this substance was developed using technology lifted from an old Batman foe named Bart Magan (Dr. No Face) and Gingold Extract, a fruit derivative associated with the [[Elongated Man]]. The Question's series by Denny O'Neil presented Pseudoderm as Rodor's attempt to build an [[artificial skin]] for humanitarian purposes.\n* The mask adheres to her face and renders it as a featureless blank when exposed to the binary gas. The binary gas is expelled from a special belt buckle worn by Montoya. The gas also causes her chemically treated costume, fedora, and trench coat to change color, typically to a dark blue.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Titans Tomorrow===\nIn the alternate future seen in the \"[[Titans Tomorrow]]\" storyline, Renee Montoya has become the commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department long after a crisis claimed the life of Batman.

Renee's \"evil\" counterpart appears in [[Outsider (comics)|Alfred Pennyworth]]'s flashback. This version of Renee Montoya is still a member of Gotham City Police Department. However, she is a corrupt cop and like the rest of GCPD of this universe who works under Owlman. She is seen with the Earth-3 version of [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] in an alleyway pulling their guns out and stopping a family who was out watching a movie nearby. They demand the family to empty out their purses and wallets \"in the name of the law.\" The family, however, are also armed with guns and begin firing. They request for backup, but it is denied as the rest of the police are currently helping Owlman track down the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (who is a hero in this universe). Renee and Bullock are then run over by Alfred despite them being allies since the Outsider was trying his best to follow Owlman. It is unclear whether Alfred did not see them or he simply did not care as he was in a high-speed chase with the Joker. Renee was either killed from her injuries or when Earth-3 was destroyed by the Anti-Monitor.<ref>''Justice League'' #23.4. DC Comics</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Renee was married to Kate Kane, and part of the Insurgency group in a world oppressed by Superman's Regime. Both sides use performance-enhancing pills granting them superhuman strength, speed, and durability. After the loss of [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], Renee became enraged, taking all the pills she could find and heavily overdosed on them with the intention of gaining enough strength to take down Superman on her own, well aware she would die from the drug. She then took out Cyborg in a single blow, took [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] hostage, and challenged Superman to a duel. During the fight, she kept taking additional pills (tripling the already deadly dosage) in an attempt to match or exceed her opponent, until her heart failed because of the strain the chemicals put on her body. Bruce Wayne collected her body and buried her next to the graves of Green Arrow and Black Canary.\n\n===''DC Comics Bombshells''===\nIn ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', set in an [[alternate history]] 1941, Montoya is a [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] veteran of the [[Spanish Civil War]], now in Berlin fighting with the [[German resistance to Nazism|German resistance]] group led by Countess [[Catwoman|Selina Digatti]].

She and Allen find a witness at the Gotham pier who saw the shooting, and they promptly issue a warrant for Gordon's arrest at Barbara's apartment. However, her case is ruined when Cobblepot turns up, alive, at GCPD headquarters. She later saves Gordon during a shootout with [[Victor Zsasz]], and promises to help him take on the mob.

She appears to be a loyal member of the GCPD and ally of Jim Gordon until Sal Maroni outs her as one of his moles in the GCPD to Harvey Dent who is forced to kidnap Rachel Dawes so her mother won't be killed which resulted in Rachel's death. Dent forces Ramirez to send Gordon's family to the location of Rachel's death before flipping his coin for her fate. Since it landed on heads Dent spares her but still knocks her out in spite.

Montoya sets Whisper A'Daire on fire, but is about to be killed by Mannheim when Kate stabs him with the ceremonial knife and collapses in Montoya's arms.{{issue|date=November 2017}}\n\n===\"One Year Later\" and \"Final Crisis\"===\nMontoya appears in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #40 when [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] solicits her help in capturing the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], suspected of the murder of [[Bart Allen]]. The two criminals escape the [[Suicide Squad]] only to be apprehended by Montoya and [[Batwoman]]. Montoya agrees to their release, concluding they are too stupid to be murderers. Montoya maintains that she will not become a member of the [[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]], but Oracle calls upon her to accompany the Birds of Prey in ''Gotham Underground'' #2.\n\nShe later stars in [[Greg Rucka]]'s 2007 limited series, ''[[Crime Bible]]: Five Lessons of Blood'', in which she pursues the Crime Bible and withstands its adherents' efforts to convert her to their cause. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (2008), Montoya informs [[Dan Turpin]] that she is investigating the [[Dark Side Club]]. She later battles [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] and the agents of [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#S.H.A.D.E.|S.H.A.D.E.]] during her investigation of an apocalyptic conspiracy related to the Crime Bible (now in possession of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]) and Darkseid.

While trying to stop members of the Religion of Crime from obtaining a mystic weapon, she is confronted by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] (whose current host is Crispus Allen, Montoya's former partner). The Spectre states that she is about to receive judgment. He is stopped by Radiant, the Spirit of Mercy, who embodies the ideal of [[Christianity|Christian]] love as introduced by [[Jesus]].\n\n[[Maggie Sawyer]], corrupted by the [[Anti-Life Equation]], emerges from Gotham Central along with the rest of the brainwashed police force. They attempt to unleash the Equation on Montoya, but are stopped by the intervention of the Spectre and Radiant. The Spectre is not able to hold them off for long, because they are protected by the same force that protects Libra. Radiant makes sure that Montoya cannot be brainwashed, and teleports her away. Observing the surroundings, she finds Batwoman lying in the streets. Batwoman reveals that she now obeys Darkseid as well, and starts to recite the Equation. It appears, however, that Montoya is completely immune to the Equation; in the following issue, she is seen in complete control of her own mind.\n\nMontoya appears in ''Final Crisis'' #5, recruited by the underground resistance movement organized by [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]. She is told that she must travel the [[DC Multiverse]] and gather help for [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]]. In ''Final Crisis'' #7 she is seen accompanied by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] (of Earth 5) where she gathers a group of [[alternative versions of Superman]] that help end the Final Crisis and defeat Mandrakk the Dark Monitor. She identifies herself as a \"[[Global Peace Agency|Global Peace agent]]\" in ''Final Crisis'' #7\u2014an allusion to the faceless agents of the GPA from the original OMAC series.\n\nStarting in ''Detective Comics'' #854, Montoya appeared in an ongoing backup feature written by [[Greg Rucka]], with art by [[Cully Hamner]].\n\n===''Batwoman: Detective Comics''===\n{{further|Batwoman: Detective Comics}}\nMontoya takes the case of a missing [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]]\u2014the young sister of the man named Hector Soliz seeking her detective services.

After a brief fight with several henchmen, the police arrive and rescue the women, reuniting Hector with his sister.\n\nWhen Montoya briefly returned to Gotham City, she worked with the new Batman and quickly realized that he was Nightwing. Her old partner Bullock also discovered that Renee is the new Question, pointing out that he worked with her long enough to be able to recognize her rear end.<ref>Detective Comics Annual #11</ref>\n\n===\"Blackest Night\"===\nDuring the events of the 2009\u20132010 \"[[Blackest Night]]\" storyline, Montoya is tracked down by [[Lady Shiva]], who claims that she wishes to test her in combat to see if she is a worthy successor to Victor. The two women engage in a brutal fist fight, only to be interrupted when Victor, now reanimated as a [[Black Lantern]], arrives on the scene and attacks them. After a drawn out battle, Renee discovers that Black Lanterns feed on emotions, and that if she is able to cut herself off from her feelings, she will become invisible. She does so, and angered, Victor stalks off into the night, searching for easier prey. Shiva reveals that she never intended to actually fight Montoya, but felt that attacking her would draw Victor out into the open so she could face him again.<ref>''The Question'' #37. DC Comics</ref>\n\nSome time after this, Montoya teams up with the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] in order to bring down the criminal network that Renee had earlier encountered. Eventually, the hitman known as [[Zeiss (comics)|Zeiss]] attacks the women, having been ordered by an unknown client to kill them. Renee appeals to the hitman's greed, offering him more money if he simply fakes their deaths and leaves them be. After this, Huntress takes Renee to [[Oracle (DC Comics)|Oracle]] for help in tracking down the client who put out the hit, and is flabbergasted upon discovering that Oracle is in fact \"Commissioner Gordon's daughter\". The two women eventually make their way to Oolong Island (home of the [[Doom Patrol]]), where they are arrested.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #862. DC Comics</ref> After escaping from police custody, Huntress and the Question discovered that [[Vandal Savage]] is behind the human trafficking network they had been trying to shut down. Savage offers to shut down his criminal network in exchange for one of them taking the [[Mark of Cain]], which had been branded onto his face by the Spectre during the events of ''Final Crisis''.

At the 2014 [[Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo]], James Tynion IV, a writer on ''[[Batman Eternal]]'', revealed that the creative team almost included Montoya, but they decided against it, saying, \"We cut her out because we didn't want her to just be in the background of the GCPD.

The two eventually became a couple again in the final issue of the Rebirth ''Batwoman'' series,<ref>''Batwoman'' #18 (August 2018)</ref> a development that has continued into the present.\n\nIn July 2019, Montoya debuted as the Question in ''Lois Lane'' #1 as a supporting character.<ref>''Lois Lane'' #1 (July 2019)</ref> As the Question, she also plays a minor role in ''Event Leviathan'', also from 2019.\n\n==Equipment==\n* Montoya uses an advanced energy pistol she found while fighting with Intergang, as well as her police sidearm.\n* After the death of Vic Sage, Montoya inherited his costume, mask, fedora and trench coat, all of which have been treated to react to the binary gas created by Aristotle Rodor. In addition, Rodor provided Montoya with a shampoo that causes her hair to change color when exposed to the gas. According to the ''Question: Secret Origin'' backup in ''52'', this substance was developed using technology lifted from an old Batman foe named Bart Magan (Dr. No Face) and Gingold Extract, a fruit derivative associated with the [[Elongated Man]]. The Question's series by Denny O'Neil presented Pseudoderm as Rodor's attempt to build an [[artificial skin]] for humanitarian purposes.\n* The mask adheres to her face and renders it as a featureless blank when exposed to the binary gas. The binary gas is expelled from a special belt buckle worn by Montoya. The gas also causes her chemically treated costume, fedora, and trench coat to change color, typically to a dark blue.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Titans Tomorrow===\nIn the alternate future seen in the \"[[Titans Tomorrow]]\" storyline, Renee Montoya has become the commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department long after a crisis claimed the life of Batman.

DC Comics</ref>\n\n===Earth-3===\nDuring the 2013\u20132014 \"[[Forever Evil]]\" storyline, a version of Renee Montoya appears on Earth-3 where all heroes are villains and vice versa. Renee's \"evil\" counterpart appears in [[Outsider (comics)|Alfred Pennyworth]]'s flashback. This version of Renee Montoya is still a member of Gotham City Police Department. However, she is a corrupt cop and like the rest of GCPD of this universe who works under Owlman. She is seen with the Earth-3 version of [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] in an alleyway pulling their guns out and stopping a family who was out watching a movie nearby. They demand the family to empty out their purses and wallets \"in the name of the law.\" The family, however, are also armed with guns and begin firing. They request for backup, but it is denied as the rest of the police are currently helping Owlman track down the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (who is a hero in this universe). Renee and Bullock are then run over by Alfred despite them being allies since the Outsider was trying his best to follow Owlman. It is unclear whether Alfred did not see them or he simply did not care as he was in a high-speed chase with the Joker. Renee was either killed from her injuries or when Earth-3 was destroyed by the Anti-Monitor.<ref>''Justice League'' #23.4. DC Comics</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Renee was married to Kate Kane, and part of the Insurgency group in a world oppressed by Superman's Regime. Both sides use performance-enhancing pills granting them superhuman strength, speed, and durability. After the loss of [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], Renee became enraged, taking all the pills she could find and heavily overdosed on them with the intention of gaining enough strength to take down Superman on her own, well aware she would die from the drug. She then took out Cyborg in a single blow, took [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] hostage, and challenged Superman to a duel. During the fight, she kept taking additional pills (tripling the already deadly dosage) in an attempt to match or exceed her opponent, until her heart failed because of the strain the chemicals put on her body. Bruce Wayne collected her body and buried her next to the graves of Green Arrow and Black Canary.\n\n===''DC Comics Bombshells''===\nIn ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', set in an [[alternate history]] 1941, Montoya is a [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] veteran of the [[Spanish Civil War]], now in Berlin fighting with the [[German resistance to Nazism|German resistance]] group led by Countess [[Catwoman|Selina Digatti]]. Montoya was a lover of [[Batwoman|Kate Kane]] when the latter fought in the Civil War as one of the [[XV International Brigade|American volunteers]], though they were driven apart after the death of [[Jason Todd|Jas\u00f3n]], whom they considered their son.

She and Allen find a witness at the Gotham pier who saw the shooting, and they promptly issue a warrant for Gordon's arrest at Barbara's apartment. However, her case is ruined when Cobblepot turns up, alive, at GCPD headquarters. She later saves Gordon during a shootout with [[Victor Zsasz]], and promises to help him take on the mob.

She appears to be a loyal member of the GCPD and ally of Jim Gordon until Sal Maroni outs her as one of his moles in the GCPD to Harvey Dent who is forced to kidnap Rachel Dawes so her mother won't be killed which resulted in Rachel's death. Dent forces Ramirez to send Gordon's family to the location of Rachel's death before flipping his coin for her fate. Since it landed on heads Dent spares her but still knocks her out in spite.

In the course of the film, she is suspended for her fixation on crime lord Roman Sionis as she is unable to provide any evidence of his criminal activities, which leads to her joining the other characters as she tries to track down orphan pickpocket [[Cassandra Cain]] after the girl inadvertently steals a vital diamond from Sionis's associate [[Victor Zsasz]]. After helping Harley Quinn, Helena Bertinelli and Dinah Lance fight off Sionis's men, Montoya officially resigns from the force to join Dinah and Helena in a new crime-fighting team known as the 'Birds of Prey', funded by money from the bank accounts of the former Bertinelli crime family.\n\n===Web series===\nRenee Montoya appears in ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', voiced by [[Adrienne Barbeau]].\n\n===Video games===\n* Renee Montoya appears in a short [[cutscene]] in ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]'', voiced by Erin Quinn Purcell.<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* Renee Montoya as the Question appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.\n* Renee Montoya is referenced in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''.

When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F.

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]].

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

He also erected several iron rolling mills\u2014including the first one in Australia to enter  commercial production, in 1860\u2014in both Australia and New Zealand. He seems to have been less successful as a works manager and businessman, with some of his efforts ending in financial losses and in great acrimony.\n\nHe was also a significant figure in the brickmaking industry of New South Wales.\n\nLater in the 19th century, when the industry required more scientific and engineering knowledge, 'practical men' like Hughes became less appreciated and less influential.\n\n== Early life in England ==\nEnoch Hughes was born at [[Dudley]], in what was then [[Evolution of Worcestershire county boundaries since 1844|Worcestershire]] and is now [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England, in 1829. He was apprenticed to an ironworks at fourteen, spending the next fourteen years working in the English iron industry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Australian iron and Steel Industry 1848\u20131962.|last=Hughes|first=Helen|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=6}}</ref> Hughes stated that he had worked at the Bloomfield Ironworks of BBH, at [[Tipton]], and  Chillington, Lea Brooke, Bilston Forge, and Spring Vale Ironworks, near [[Wolverhampton]].<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28410140|title=IRON RAILS FOR THE GREAT SOUTHERN RAILWAY EXTENSION.|date=1873-09-22|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2019-07-16|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nHe migrated to Australia in 1857, arriving in Melbourne in January 1858.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/156757606|title=Furnace, fire & forge : Lithgow's iron and steel industry, 1874-1932|last=McKillop, Robert F.|first=|date=2006|publisher=Light Railway Research Society of Australia|others=Light Railway Research Society of Australia.|year=|isbn=0909340447|location=Melbourne, Australia|pages=15|oclc=156757606}}</ref>\n\n== Australia ==\nBy 1858, no iron was being made in Australia but there was an accumulation of scrap iron.

BROSIO, University of Michigan, Professor Emeritus, USA''\n \n* Jeton Kelmendi is a poet of continual longing, love, and hope. People and things he has loved most, he has lost and longs for them so strongly\nThat they seep into his dreams \u2026which give him a new hope for their renewal upon waking. Kelmendi is a walking cemetery. Each of his poems is a celebration of a life fully risked, and its death notice. However these poems translate into English, I leave to the wide expanses of your minds while you\u2019re reading. I thank Kelmendi for tunneling into my ghosts, as all poetry should, where lost conversations continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Craig Czury thoughts on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n*   -                                                                              ''Craig Czury, Soncino, Italia 13.2.18''\n \n* I intuitively feel the poetry of Jeton Kelmend as part that starts at the forefront of a current update in the new European poetry of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Juri Talvet thoughts on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n*  -                                                                              ''Prof. Dr. J\u00fcri Talvet, Estonia''\n \n* Written in different places and cities with dates that give the birth of poetry timeliness, which is emblematic in the inadequacy of this poem, in touch with the domestic environment, which, though far away in the world, it does not interrupt the links.

People and things he has loved most, he has lost and longs for them so strongly\nThat they seep into his dreams \u2026which give him a new hope for their renewal upon waking. Kelmendi is a walking cemetery. Each of his poems is a celebration of a life fully risked, and its death notice. However these poems translate into English, I leave to the wide expanses of your minds while you\u2019re reading. I thank Kelmendi for tunneling into my ghosts, as all poetry should, where lost conversations continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Craig Czury thoughts on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n*   -                                                                              ''Craig Czury, Soncino, Italia 13.2.18''\n \n* I intuitively feel the poetry of Jeton Kelmend as part that starts at the forefront of a current update in the new European poetry of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Juri Talvet thoughts on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n*  -                                                                              ''Prof. Dr. J\u00fcri Talvet, Estonia''\n \n* Written in different places and cities with dates that give the birth of poetry timeliness, which is emblematic in the inadequacy of this poem, in touch with the domestic environment, which, though far away in the world, it does not interrupt the links. I dare to say that Jeton Kelmendi is a great poet! The poetry I read, anticipating what I will write, give me the right to say this. In this poem there are nuances and weaves that Vasko Popa would have had greed for.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Miras Martinovic thoughts on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n*  -                                                                                  ''Mira\u0161 Martinovi\u0107, Castel Nuovo, Montenegro''\n \n* Do thought is a kind of \u201cconciliator\u201d?

The author himself has a complete conscience of what he or she is feeling and full consciousness, intends to distinguish, to give the true space. The word, in the thought and expression of the poet Jeton Kelmendi, becomes a real stitch with full colors, just as soon as you see it, but as soon as you see, it reflects breathing and feeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Dinos Koubatis thoughts on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n*     -                                                                                ''Dinos Kubatis, Greece''\n \n* If we say that poetry is a sacred bird, then love and humanity are two wings of its powerful and immortal, which fly to the future of the fraught with wonderful poems. Love and humanity are, of course, also the two main themes of the poems of Jeton Kelmendi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Zhang Zhi thoughts on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n*      -                                                                    ''Dr. Zhang Zhi Diablo, China''\n \n* It is not surprising that the representative of Kelmendi\u2019s clan became a writer. So the Arb\u00ebr\u2019s poetic tradition takes its origin from the early Middle Ages. Jeton Kelmendi, continuing this tradition, achieves neatly in his words to describe the Albanian powerful spirit through generations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Zhang Ivan Rijebci on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>       \n*       -                                                                              ''Ivan Rijebci, Ukraine''\n \n* The poetry of Jeton Kelmendi is not an ordinary phenomenon in contemporary poetics in Europe. Known in many places, to the thirty-year-old poet-academician was given to create an original artistic world, that shines with a spiritual light in the dark depths of matter and enables the reader to find the roots of his \u201cunit\u201d.

He unites its exile- the distance from the place of birth of all that is dear and near to others. Kelmendi\u2019s poetic writing which is based on the views of the meaning of which is skewed towards surprising situation, which the poet transforms into a positive dialogue with footage of life that seem to be common, which he presents with different, special and artistic views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJ5UDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=jeton+kelmendi+zhang+zhi&source=bl&ots=_CZnUgaBdt&sig=ACfU3U3NyrU5uoLp8Z9hUOAWGbrq-YSUDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigxdT59MnoAhUxpIsKHVssCwAQ6AEwDHoECAoQJg#v=onepage&q=jeton%20kelmendi%20zhang%20zhi&f=false//|title=Resem El-Med-hun thoughts on Jeton Kelmendi|publisher=Thaoghts hunt the loves=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n \n* -                                                                    ''Rasim El-Med-hum, Palestine'' \n \n* Meeting with the poetry of the poet Jeton Kelmendi, he has reserved tremendous moments in the depths of being.
