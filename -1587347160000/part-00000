At the time he was living in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]] in New York City so he had to travel between there and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] frequently for the recording sessions,<ref name=\"Dopesickrecordingnotes\">Williams, Mike. ''[[Dopesick]]''. Recording notes on the 2007 European reedition. [[Century Media Records]].</ref> which took place at Side One Studios.<ref name=\"Dopesickcredits\"/> He attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for the introduction to the album, by smashing a bottle on the floor of the studio. In the process he slashed his hand open badly and bled all over the studio floor. One of the band members then apparently smeared the words \"Hell\" and \"Death to Pigs\" in his blood.<ref name=\"Dopesickrecordingnotes\"/> The studio owner reportedly called [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] to ask if the band were insane, and threatened to kick them out because of this.<ref name=\"Dopesickrecordingnotes\"/>\n\n===Role in the band===\nThe band's lyrics and themes are completely conceived by Williams. He always has lyrics written by him ready so when the other members of the band send him songs he just decides which lyrics he wants for each song.

Each character includes a summary when possible, the voice actor or actors associated with the character, and a description of the character along with any aliases, spouses and the character's species.\n\n==The Herd==\n===Manny===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Manfred\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002)\n| voice              = [[Ray Romano]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Dark Brown\n| alias              = Manny\n| species            = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| spouse             = Unnamed female mammoth (first wife, deceased)<br> Ellie (second wife)\n| children           = Unnamed calf (son, deceased)<br >Peaches (daughter)\n}}\n\n'''Manfred \"Manny\"''', is a [[woolly mammoth]], in all five ''[[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]]'' films. His personality is shown to be aloof, grumpy, and standoffish, but is otherwise loving and courageous. In the first film, while passing through the icy cave, the herd discovers [[cave painting]]s of Manny with his wife and child, who were killed by [[human]]s; this is a very sentimental moment for Manny, since he failed to protect them. Manny finds love with Ellie in ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''. In ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', he is anxious when Ellie is pregnant. At the end of the film, he becomes the proud father of a baby daughter named Peaches. In ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', he gets into an argument with his teenage daughter before being pulled away in by the drift with Diego, Sid and Granny. He and the team later encounter a group of pirates led by Captain Gutt. When the team escaped they destroy the ship and take Shira with them. This enrages the Captain who hunts them down. Later on, he is almost manipulated by [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]].\n\nA running gag for Manny, shown in four of the five films, is that if a certain character were to refer to him as fat, he would often deny it, saying that \"his fur is what makes him look big\" and that \"it's poofy\".

Little is known from Sid's life other than that Sid once lived in a tree with other sloths that always wanted to leave Sid behind when the migration occurred, using several different ways to leave him behind. What is clear is that Sid's mother always told him that \"bad news is just good news in disguise\" prior to abandoning him for good. He accidentally starts a fire in the first film and learns how to do it properly towards the end; he also shows this skill in the second film, where he is worshiped by a tribe of \"mini-sloths\" who call him \"Fire King\" and try to sacrifice him. In the third film, he adopts a trio of baby T-Rexes, and is forcibly taken to the underground dinosaur land by their mother, requiring the others to come and save him. In the fourth film, it is revealed that his full name is Sidney, though this name was also used in a deleted scene of the first film. When he, Diego and Manny are on the ice and are forced up by a [[Waterspout|water spout]], they see a [[rainbow]] in the bright blue sky as he told them that \"there is a rainbow at the end of every corner.\"\n\nA mechanical version of Sid appears in ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'' during the miming scene.\n\nSid was built along the form typical of ground sloths, short, brushy tail, clawed hands and feet, a long thin neck, ovular head with bulbous eye on both sides and a pair of buckteeth. Sid's right front tooth was slightly bigger than the left, similar to his right eye, which was also somewhat bigger than the left, both eyes of which were pale green. Sid's pelt was dirty and tan, and became brown when the fungus it carried dried out, Sid attributing the state of his pelt to his vegetarian diet, which he said led to a younger-looking pelt. In his films, Sid faints at certain times when he's getting hit - e.g. he faints when he gets hit on the nose by a block of ice and apparently get his tongue stuck to the floor of an ice cave.\n\nIn the behind the scenes, the creators combined the traits of [[three-toed sloth]]s and [[ground sloth]]s while designing Sid and the other sloth characters.\n\n===Diego===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Diego\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002)\n| voice              = [[Denis Leary]] (films)<br>[[Rick Pasqualone]] (''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (video game)]]'')\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel/green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Orange\n| species            = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n}}\n'''Diego''' is a saber-toothed cat found in all five of the films. He is Shira's love interest. He has a [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] personality, although it is not intended to be nasty. He was sent by his pack to retrieve the human baby called Roshan; When he found Roshan in Manny and Sid's care, he pretended to lead them to the humans, but instead planned to lead them into an ambush by the pack. However, when Manny saved his life, Diego had a change of heart, confessing about the pack and sacrifices himself to help them escape. He was seemingly killed by the pack's leader, Soto, but survived and joined Manny and Sid on their travels. In the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown|second film]], he was revealed to suffer from [[aquaphobia]], but he eventually conquered it in order to save Sid, Crash and Eddie. In the third film, he began to fear that he was losing his predatory abilities from being in the \"herd\" too long, and considered staying in the underground dinosaur world with Buck. He changed his mind after managing to save the labored Ellie from a dinosaur attack. In [[Ice Age: Continental Drift]], another ''[[Smilodon]]'' named Shira joins the group, and Diego feels attracted to her. During the end credits, Diego and Shira are seen nuzzling each other showing that they have now become a couple.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Ellie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Ellie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006)\n| voice              = [[Queen Latifah]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light brown\n| spouse             = Manny\n| children           = Peaches (daughter)\n}} \n'''Ellie''' is a female woolly mammoth, whom Manny, Diego, and Sid meet during their migration to escape the flood in the second movie, ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''.\n\nIt was revealed that when Ellie was young, she was separated from her herd during the [[ice age]]. She came across two [[opossums]] named Crash and Eddie, along with their mother. She later forgot her origins and thought that she was an opossum.\n\nInitially Manny was overjoyed that he had found another of his kind, but got somewhat dismayed when he realized that Ellie believed that she was an opossum. Nevertheless, Sid welcomed Ellie and her brothers to travel with them, much to Manny's annoyance. During this time, Ellie displayed the mannerisms pertaining to an opossum as well as insisting (despite obvious proof that she was not a possum) and this tested Manny's patience, namely when she claimed that the act of bravery that he had done of fighting off the sea reptile Cretaceous was dumb.\n\nSoon, Manny got his time to be alone with Ellie when he and Ellie went for a walk through a wooded area, where Ellie had a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that told her of her past. Upon remembering this, she knew that she was a mammoth. When Manny later implied that they must mate in order to save the mammoths from extinction, she was initially angered, but in time she apologized for overreacting.\n\nSoon, however, this new \"herd\" reached a horrible obstacle between them and safety from the oncoming flood: a field of geysers, which Manny explained must be crossed, but Ellie would not listen: she and her brothers felt that they must go around. But this proved to be disastrous: as they were trying to reach their destination, some rocks caved down and nearly crushed Ellie and her brothers, but trapped them instead in a sort of cave. Manny rescued Ellie, for the water was flooding into the cave where she was trapped and had nearly drowned Ellie. She and Manny escaped and regrouped with the others, but faced another problem, for the waters were still rising.\n\nAfter the waters had subsided a herd of mammoths made their way into the valley. Manny thought that because the mammoths had come, that Ellie would not want to remain with him. He was persuaded otherwise by Sid and Diego and confronted Ellie confessing his feelings, saying that he wanted to be together not because they had to be, but because he himself wanted to. Ellie accepted him as her mate. The mammoths trumpet while Manny and Ellie embrace. Manny and Ellie decide to stay with their old friends, taking along Sid, Diego, and the possum brothers.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', she and Manny are mates and Ellie is pregnant with their first child. When they find the Dinosaur World under their feet, they have to go in and search for Sid in Lava Falls. When very close to Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labour, and gives birth to Peaches (which was named after the codeword that was for if Ellie went into labor on the trip). When they reunite with Sid and return to the surface, Ellie introduces Peaches to the herd's new home.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', she is an understanding wife and a mother. Ellie supports Peaches, when she had an argument with Manny. When the Ice Age: Continental Drift happens she aids the herd to the Land Bridge. In the end, she also fights with the Pirates.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Crash and Eddie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Crash and Eddie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006)\n| voice              = Crash: [[Seann William Scott]] <br>Eddie: [[Josh Peck]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Virginia opossum]]s\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Crash: Blue <br> Eddie: Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Dark brown striped\n}}\n'''Crash''' and '''Eddie''' are two twin brother opossums. Adoptive brothers of Ellie, they cared for her and taught her to hang by her tail from a tree branch when she slept, as they did. They are shown to be adventurous and fun-loving, courtesy of the fact that they're both very stupid.\n\nThey first made their presence known to the opening characters by means of shooting pebbles through reeds at Sid and Diego, then roasting them so as to humiliate them, but Diego began chasing them, leading both Sid and Diego to Ellie. After Sid invites them to travel with them, Ellie and her brothers agreed, much to the annoyance of Manny.\n\nAs they traveled with Manny and his friends, Ellie grew closer to Manny, putting both Crash and Eddie somewhat closer to Manny and his friends, but creating a short feud when Manny tried \"hitting on\" Ellie. They even play dead when crows are nearby. In time, however, they saw behind the petty grudges and worked together with Manny, Sid, and Diego to escape the flood, but left with Ellie when she left Manny and his friends to cross the minefield, as she claimed that it was suicide to cross it. Crash and Eddie joined Ellie in trying to escape the flood, but soon ran into trouble when they were trapped in a cave.\n\nEllie insisted that they leave her to the point of pushing them outwards from a small crevice, but they promised to return with help, and true to their word, persuaded Manny to try and free Ellie. They eventually made their way into a rushing current of water and were almost swept away when an overzealous Sid came along to jump into the current, leaving them, in addition to holding onto a branch for dear life against the current of water, trying to hold onto an unconscious Sid. Diego eventually helped when he jumped in and saved them from drowning along with Sid. When Manny had saved Ellie from drowning, they helped Ellie back onto solid ground, but almost drowned when the flood was encroaching.\n\nEventually however, the waters drained, leaving Crash, Eddie, and all of the others alive. When a herd of mammoths came by (as mammoths were presumed all but extinct), they thought that Ellie would go with them and leave Manny, so they went with her. But as it turned out, Manny and Ellie stayed together because they wanted to, rather than being obligated to, and so they left onwards with Sid and Diego, as well as Crash and Eddie.\n\nIn the third film, Crash and Eddie travel with the others to the dino jungle to save Sid from Momma, and both grow to idolize Buck, the one-eyed dinosaur-hunting weasel who helped them find Sid. In the third film, they also mentioned they never liked Sid. This is not true however, due to helping Buck save Sid from his incoming death.\n\nOverall, they are very close and almost inseparable as brothers, as shown in the sequels. They are near-on identical: Crash has blue eyes and a flatter nose with ridges, and was voiced by [[Seann William Scott]] while Eddie has brown eyes and a pointier nose with a brown stripe, and was voiced by [[Josh Peck]]. Their mom is Mother Opossum, who first saved Ellie when Crash and Eddie were very small.\n \nIn ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', Crash and Eddie, along with Buck, ride a pterosaur and save Sid from a lava flow heading downwards.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', they have more minor roles than in the previous films but do partake in the final battle with Gutt's crew fighting Dobson by hopping on his back and having a rodeo, but accidentally let him charge into Manny and, later Shira, knocking them onto the other ship.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Peaches===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Peaches\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' (2009)\n| voice              = [[Ciara Bravo]] (''[[Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas]]'')<br>[[Keke Palmer]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Light green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Auburn\n| spouse             = Julian\n| family             = Manny (father)<br>Ellie (mother)\n| relatives          = Crash and Eddie (adoptive uncles)\n}}\n'''Peaches''' is the daughter of [[Manny (Ice Age)#Manny|Manny]] and [[List of Ice Age characters#Ellie|Ellie]], born in the Dinosaurs' world whilst they were under attack by a pack of Guanlong. She appeared close to end of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and was named after the code-word that was thought up to say that Ellie was going into labour. Manny also claims that [[peach]]es are sweet, round and fuzzy, just like Peaches and Ellie. She looks exactly like her mother, Ellie (which Sid thinks is very lucky). At the end of the film, she returned to the surface with her parents and the rest of the group. She is voiced by [[Ciara Bravo]] in ''[[Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas]]'' as a kid, and [[Keke Palmer]] in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as a teenager, and also as a young adult in ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]''.\n\nPeaches appears as a teenager in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''. She is self-taught to do some possum moves just like her mother. Shortly after Scrat sets off a domino effect of the continents breaking apart, she is shown sneaking up in the morning going to the falls with Louis, a molehog who is also her best friend. After Manny embarrasses her in front of Ethan, her crush, and the other mammoths by grounding her, she and her father get into a fight, and as a result, when he, Diego, and Sid get separated from them on an iceberg, she feels not only helpless to stop it but also guilty. Later during the events of the film, it is Ethan who shows an interest in her hanging out with him and his friends. As a kind of condition, he suggests for her to leave Louis behind. Convinced he'd start to like her, she readily agrees. The following day, while walking with Ethan and the other mammoths, unbeknownst to them that Louis was looking for her, they begin to question her about her friendship with him. When she claims to have none so as to gain their approval, Louis overhears, also making himself known. Shortly after Louis leaves, Peaches begins to grow tired of the other mammoths' teasing, as immediately afterwards a tremor causes a dangerous moving cloud of dust, and instead of expressing concern they try to convince her that it was fun escaping the blast. Upon calling them out on their stupid behaviour, Ethan and the others carelessly judge her by her family being part possum, causing her to get upset, confront Ethan, then leave. At the end of the movie, she and her herd are, in part, saved by Louis, who bravely challenges Captain Gutt, and distracts him from Peaches by slamming a chunk of ice on his foot. His bravery, as well as Peaches' own heroics in saving her mother, impress Ethan and his friends, who ask to hang out with them instead. Louis casually agrees.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', Peaches is now a young adult and prepares to marry a male mammoth named Julian.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Granny===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Granny\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Wanda Sykes]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = Faded purple with scraggly grey scalp hair\n| family             = Milton (son)<br>Fungus (son)<br>Eunice (daughter-in-law)<br>Sid (grandson)<br>Marshall (grandson)\n}}\n'''Granny''' is a Megalonyx and also [[Sid (Ice Age)#Sid|Sid]]'s grandmother. She joins the herd after her own family abandons her, calling her \"dead weight\" to save their own skins before the earthquake (that and to avoid Sid). Despite, how Granny sometimes picks on and berates her grandson, Sid is very happy to have her around. Granny is loud, abrasive, tough, sarcastic, somewhat crazy, as she once thought Gutt was actually being nice to her. Over time she begins to warm up to the group, as Sid asked Granny why their own family abandoned him and Granny; for a moment, Granny sympathetically answers \"because they think we're screw-ups and can't do anything right\". She even helps out in several attempts to get back home. At the end Granny admits that Sid is lucky to have a real family (his herd) that care so much about him. She quickly asks Sid to chew her food, but Sid had fixed her a new set of teeth, a pair of shark teeth that were originally Raz's weapon but Granny uses them quite well as they are very sharp.\n\nIt is shown in the film she had an allegedly imaginary pet named Precious, which showed up at the end and turned out to be real: a giant whale who defeats Gutt's crew (minus Squint) by blasting them away. Precious then helped the group to Switchback Cove and Granny bids her pet a fond good-bye.\n\n===Louis===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Louis\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Josh Gad]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = Molehog\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = White, grey brown, and brown\n}}\nPeaches' best friend '''Louis''', is a timid, well-spoken, and cute molehog (a small mammal that lives during the [[ice age]]s. The molehog's name is a portmanteau of [[Mole (animal)|mole]] and [[hedgehog]]), who is always dutifully by her side and eager to help, even if it is to help her get closer to pretty boy Ethan. When Peaches' heart is ultimately broken by Ethan, Louis secretly wishes that she could see that he is the only one who adores her just as she is. Peaches is very oblivious to his crush on her. He tries to be the voice of reason when she is up to some things, because of his soft-spoken demeanor and his somewhat cowardice, Manny alongside Crash and Eddie, have dubbed him \"Wiener\". Even after having his feelings hurt by Peaches, Louis comes to his friends side when she is held hostage by Gutt. He fends off Gutt long enough for Peaches to escape, impressed by his bravery, Manny even encourages Louis to be more open minded to adventures like Peaches. Ethan and his posse even ask to hang out with him, as they seem to move on in life as friends. The only flaw with Louis' life in Ice Age is, along with \"The Brat Pack\", he seems to lack parents and other family members that he would live with.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Shira===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Shira\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Jennifer Lopez]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur Color\n| data3              = White with black stripes\n| lbl4               = Accessories\n| data4              = 2 earrings in each ear, one blue and one green.\n}}\n'''Shira''' appears in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as part of Gutt's crew, and is Captain Gutt's pawn. She is a dazzlingly beautiful, female saber-toothed cat and Diego's lover resembling a [[snow leopard]]. She makes her first appearance in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift#Marketing|Scrat's Continental Crack-up: Part 2]]'' standing next to Captain Gutt, who is holding Scrat.\n\nShira first appears when Gutt's crew attacks the herds \"ship\". Diego is smitten upon his first sight on her as she is the most beautiful creature he has ever seen. Diego, wanting himself, Manny, Sid, and Granny to get back home, tries to chomp off all the pirates' ropes from their \"ship\", but is too late as Shira arrives and restrains him, mocking him for his declaration of \"I don't fight girls\" by pinning him down and saying, \"I can see why\". After Manny and the others escape by capsizing Gutt's iceberg, Shira is seen in the water, calling out for her crewmates' help; only Flynn is concerned over Shira's whereabouts, but Gutt ignores this and demands his crew to move on forward without her. She is rescued against her will by Manny, and is angered when Diego calls her \"Kitty\" for calling them a \"bad joke\" of a herd. She journeyed with the herd to an island. Once there, she attempts to escape, but Diego catches up to her and she is imprisoned in a tree, much to her anger.\n\nThat night, Shira is approached by Diego, who learns she left her pack as he once did. Diego tells her that she simply traded one pack for another, and that his herd always has each other's backs, pointing out that Gutt hadn't made any thoughts of planning a search party for her in the first place. The next morning, Shira escapes and finds Gutt making a new ship on the other side of the island. Gutt angrily berates her for not killing the herd, and punishes her by making Squint his new first mate while she gets demoted. Gutt then orders Shira to target Diego, declaring that he would have a tiger-skin rug when it ended, he didn't care whose (somewhat proving Diego's point to Shira that Gutt never had his back on her or anyone else). When the herd enacts their plans to take Gutt's new ship back home, Shira once again tackles Diego, who convinces her to turn against Gutt and come with him. Because of their newfound love, she follows Diego to the ship, but on seeing that Gutt is catching up to them, secretly puts ice in his way. As the herd floats away, Shira tells Diego that she has his back, while both looking at each other longingly as the boat leaves implying they have feelings for each other.\n\nDuring the return home, Diego realized he had fallen in love with Shira, despite denying it to Manny and Sid. Later, when Gutt is holding Peaches hostage, Shira is seen struggling to get up, implying that Gutt had physically punished Shira for her betrayal. During the fight, she protects Ellie from Squint, mocking the rabbit's \"cute little bunny nose\". After the defeat of Gutt's crew, Shira joins the herd, sharing a loving look with Diego. She also rests her head on Diego's shoulder during the herd's landing on switchback cove.

He has his own stories in the films which are mostly independent of those of the main characters, though the two do intersect at times.\n\nIn a special feature in the second film's DVD, his name has been stated to be a mix of the words \"[[squirrel]]\" and \"[[rat]]\", his species allegedly believed to have been a common ancestor of both. In the ''Ice Age'' [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], he is referred to as \"The Scrat\" by directors [[Chris Wedge]] and [[Carlos Saldanha]].\n\nScrat is voiced in all ''Ice Age'' movies and short films by director Chris Wedge. He directly interacts with the story's main characters on eight occasions, mostly with Sid. In the first film, he attacks Sid when the latter tries to eat his acorn, successfully regaining it. He later meets Manny, Sid, and Diego asking him where the baby's family is and Scrat attempts to tell them about nearby saber-toothed tigers, but Diego kicks Scrat away before he could do so. At the end of the second film, after Scrat created a hole in the valley and released all the melted ice, later attacks Sid for saving his life (when he had already almost died and gone to paradise and was about to get a giant acorn). In the third film, Scrat is stepped on by Manny and falls onto Sid's head while chasing his acorn. Next, he appears when Sid's \"children\" are batting a ball around, the ball actually being Scrat. Also, when Scratte rips off his fur, he screams so loud the herd can hear him, causing Crash and Eddie to deem the place a \"Jungle of Misery\". Lastly, while Diego is sleeping, he wakes up when he gets hit with Scrat's acorn. In the fourth film, when Sid pries open a clam, he finds Scrat inside. Sid's grandmother mistakes Scrat for a rat and continuously hits him with her cane until he falls into the ocean.\n\nScrat constantly hunts for his acorn either to bury it or eat it, but fate always gets in the way. He invariably ends up in humorous or painful situations: being struck by lightning, pursued by avalanches, and repeatedly knocked unconscious while fighting for his acorn. Yet he never gives up. Scrat generally loses, except when he defeats a school of piranhas and successfully \"battles\" Sid.\n\nScrat is the main character in four short films. In the first, ''[[Gone Nutty]]'', he loses his collection of [[acorn]]s in a catastrophic chain of events. He jams his acorn into a hole in the middle of the collection, which shatters the pile and with it the entire continent - which begins the [[continental drift]].\n\nIn the second film, ''[[No Time for Nuts]]'', Scrat finds a [[time travel|time machine]] left by a time-traveler and visits several historical events. He becomes trapped in a frightening future when oak trees have become extinct, but somehow manages to return to the series' time period.\n\nA third Scrat short, ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]'', was released in 2010 accompanying the feature ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'', and later with ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' as a promotion for the fourth Ice Age movie ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]].''<ref>{{cite news |title=Swift injustice |first=James |last=Verniere |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330&position=also |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date=2010-12-25 |accessdate=2 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226092036/http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330 |archive-date=26 December 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA fourth and most recent short film, ''[[Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe]]'', was released in 2015 preceding ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''.\n\nScrat has a cameo in ''[[Surviving Sid]]'', that is important to the plot.\n\nScrat is the main character in the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown#Video game|''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' video game]]. He is also playable in the other two games based on the series.\n\nScrat makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Sibling Rivalry (Family Guy)|Sibling Rivalry]]\", in a cutaway gag in which [[Peter Griffin]] says Scrat's nuts are his, leading Scrat to attack Peter.\n\nThe origin of Scrat is disputed. Cartoon designer [[Ivy Supersonic]] claims she created the character in 1999, after seeing a squirrel-rat hybrid in [[Skidmore College]]'s Case Green. She called her character \"Sqrat\" and says she presented the idea to 20th Century Fox movie executives. A CNN report by Jeanne Moos of Ivy's discovery was aired in 2000, two years before ''Ice Age'' went into development. Supersonic claims the studio's own documents actually identified the character in ''Ice Age'' as \"Sqrat\", though her creation was not sabre-toothed.<ref name=\"sqrat\">{{cite web| last = Supersonic| first = Ivy| title = A Scrat is a Sqrat / Scrat - by Ivy Supersonic| url = http://ivysmedia.com/scrat/| accessdate = 11 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIvy Supersonic was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox Studios. She turned it down and subsequently lost in court. The case is currently in appeal (Case # 04401 Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, NYC). She still has hopes of receiving damages for her claimed infringement.<ref name=sqrat/>\n\nSupersonic did win a partial summary judgement from the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] in a reverse suit, Fox Film Corporation v.

Wedge called it \"sort of a squirrel based on some lemur.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/110509845.html?dids=110509845:110509845&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+15%2C+2002&author=Susan+Wloszczyna&pub=USA+TODAY&desc=Scrounging%2C+screeching+Scrat+is+nutty+hit+of+%27Ice+Age%27&pqatl=google|title=Scrounging, screeching Scrat is nutty hit of 'Ice Age'|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|date=15 March 2002|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\nWhile initially created as a fictional species for comedic purposes, in 2011 a mammal quite similar to Scrat was described.

While sleeping one morning, his tribe is attacked by a pack of smilodons. The leader of the pack, Soto, wants to kill the baby as revenge for the baby's father killing half the pack and using their skin as clothes and their flesh as food. His mother is able to fend off Diego, whose mission is to retrieve him. However, she is cornered over a waterfall. In a desperate attempt to save her son, leaps over the waterfall, holding the baby tightly in her arms. They are both found by Manny and Sid at the riverside. Using what little strength she has left, she gives the baby to Manny and Sid in hopes that he will be safe with them.\n\nRoshan's primary care-provider is Sid, the only member of the group who initially has concern for him, Manny being too disillusioned to care and Diego secretly planning to kill him. Manny, scarred by his previous experience with humans, is reluctant to have anything to do with the baby, but eventually bonds with him. At the end of the movie, the baby is reunited with his tribe.\n\n===Soto's Pack===\n'''Soto's Pack''' is a group of [[saber-toothed cat]]s that are the primary antagonists of ''Ice Age''. They targeted Roshan as revenge on his tribe of Neanderthals because half of their pack was killed by them. Diego was formerly of this group before he defected to Manny and Sid's side.\n\n====Soto====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Soto\n| voice              = [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Dark orange\n}}\n'''Soto''' is the violent and sadistic Smilodon who is the leader of a pack of saber-toothed cats. He wants to eat Roshan in vengeance for the murders of several of his pack-mates. He is the main antagonist of the first film.\n\nAs part of his plan to kidnap Roshan, Soto plans an attack on the human camp so that while he and three other pack members would attack the humans, Diego would sneak in, unnoticed, and abduct Roshan. Diego fails at this task, leaving Soto furious, telling Diego to bring Roshan to Half-Peak where he would meet with the others and threatens have him served as a replacement if he fails. Soto dispatched his fellow pack members Zeke and Oscar to warn Diego to hurry and bring Roshan or not return at all, though was reciprocated with the news that alongside Roshan, Soto would receive a mammoth.\n\nSoto eventually made it with his pack to Half Peak and informed Diego that while he had his doubts, he was pleased that Diego had made it. Soon it would happen that unbeknownst to Soto, Diego was in league with both Manny and Sid, and so Sid would lure Soto and his pack-mates away from both Manny and Roshan with a decoy made of snow.\n\nSoto fought viciously in the altercation in which he made an attempt to kill Manny, but was stopped by the now-reformed Diego, whom he severely maimed. Out of anger, Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice, knocking loose a row of icicles, the sharp ice formations falling, and end up killing Soto offscreen.\n\n====Zeke====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Zeke\n| voice              = [[Jack Black]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Grayish-brown\n}}\n'''Zeke''' is an overactive Smilodon and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nHe is led by Soto who is out to seek Roshan and kill him. Zeke is dark-gray and looked rough, as well as acting the part of a suck up. It is revealed in a deleted scene that he, like the other members of his pack, wanted very much to follow the \"walking buffet\" south, but Soto would not hear of it. Zeke accompanied Oscar to tell Diego to hurry up and bring back Roshan or not to come back. Diego had him inform Soto that there will be a mammoth traveling with the baby as well. He soon made it along with the rest of his pack to Half Peak, where he tried to kill Sid and Roshan, but was outwitted by Sid who stomped him into a tiny crevice with his hindquarters sticking out. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards.\n\n====Oscar====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Oscar\n| voice              = [[Diedrich Bader]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light Brown\n}}\n'''Oscar''' is a tall Smilodon and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nOscar is shown to doubting Diego's abilities because he messed up once in bringing Roshan to Soto. In a deleted scene, he is seen telling his packmates of his disapproval of Soto's plans to stay and hunt the humans instead of following the migrating herds traveling south. Oscar went along with Zeke to find Diego and warn him to hurry and bring Roshan. Oscar made it with the rest of the pack to Half Peak where he attempted to kill Manny but was defeated along with the others. He is last seen running away after he and Lenny see Soto killed by Manny, leaving him and Lenny's fates unknown.\n\n====Lenny====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Lenny\n| voice              = [[Alan Tudyk]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Homotherium]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light Brown\n}}\n'''Lenny''' is a rotund Homotherium and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nLenny, along with the rest of the pack, attacked the human encampment but were fended off by the humans' dogs who fought alongside the humans against the pack sending them off. One of the pack members Diego was expected to steal the baby Roshan from the humans but missed his chance when Roshan's mother Nadia escaped with her child through a waterfall. Bitter at Diego's failure the pack leader Soto orders Diego to retrieve Roshan and bring him to Half Peak where the others will be waiting. Soto was later informed by other pack members Zeke and Oscar that Diego will bring Roshan back along with a wooly Mammoth called Manny who has been caring for Roshan along with Sid the sloth.\n\nLenny met up with Diego along with the other members of the pack at Half Peak where Zeke reminisced the joys of mammoth flesh much to Lenny's displeasure (saying his only lines in the film, \"Hey, knock it off. I'm starving!\" and \"I told you to knock it off!\"). He then demanded Zeke to stop talking about food and then tries to strike him but is stopped by Soto who tells him to save energy as mammoths don't go down easily. Soto plans an ambush on Manny so he would be caught by surprise and so he ordered the pack not to attack until they saw Manny but Diego secretly turned on his pack after he had been shown real friendship and appreciation from Manny and Sid so he tempted Zeke to leap into action and attack. The surprise given away, the pack pursue Sid as he slides down a snowy slope on a piece of bark soon after Lenny and Oscar who had been chasing Sid where hit by a large log Manny threw at them. Once they recovered they saw that Soto had been killed when he tried to attack Manny and that Diego had thwarted Soto's attacks. Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice and a number of icicles fall down and kill him. Seeing the death of their leader, Lenny and Oscar run off. It is unknown what happened to them afterwards.\n\nUnlike the rest of his pack who are all [[saber-toothed cat]]s, Lenny is a [[Homotherium|scimitar-toothed cat]] as stated in the book ''Ice Age: The Essential Guide''.\n\n===Runar===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Runar\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Neanderthal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Hair\n| data3              = Dark brown\n| spouse             = Nadia (deceased)\n| children           = Roshan (son)\n}}\n'''Runar''' was the [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] of the Neanderthal tribe shown in the first film.\n\nRunar was a leader for a tribe of Neanderthals (referred in the film as humans). He was the father of Roshan and husband of Nadia, and cared greatly for his family, all the while leading them and the rest of the tribe as a nomadic group to travel from place to place. In one encampment that his tribe set up, half a pack of saber-toothed tigers was killed and the furs taken as coats and clothing. In vengeance, the leader saber-tooth named Soto decided to plan an attack on Runar's tribe so as to take his son Roshan and kill him in vengeance for those saber-teeth slain in battle by Runar's tribe. The attack almost worked, but Runar's tribe had trained [[Dire wolf|dire wolves]] that detected Soto's pack coming and alerted the human tribe to battle the saber-teeth, with Soto fighting directly with Runar while the rest of the tribe fought the other saber-tooth tigers and unleash their wolves to help. In the melee, the baby Roshan was taken by his mother from a saber-toothed tiger named Diego, and the hunters successfully warded off the saber-teeth. Runar tried to help his wife and son, but is stopped by Soto and Oscar. After the fight, he finds out that his son and wife had disappeared.\n\nRunar had no choice left but to begin the travel to another camp far off, tracking the dangerous saber-teeth on the way and finding clues as to his son's whereabouts. In time, Runar made it near the settlement and was finally re-united with his son, but not before meeting face-to-face with Manny and Sid, the two animals who returned the child. Runar was on his guard about Manny at first, as he appeared violent while his tribe quickly rush in to attack Manny and Sid. Upon seeing Roshan, he quickly came to see that they meant no harm, simply to return his child and stopped his tribe from attacking them.\n\nRunar thanked Manny by giving him the charm bracelet that had once been Roshan's, and after letting his son say goodbye to Manny and Sid, Runar left the scene with his tribe and his son in tow.\n\n===Nadia===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Nadia\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Neanderthal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Hair\n| data3              = Dark brown\n| spouse             = Runar\n| children           = Roshan (son)\n}}\n'''Nadia''' was the wife of the chieftain of a neanderthal tribe shown in the first film.\n\nNadia had a husband, Runar, and a baby son, Roshan. She and her family lived a peaceful life together with their tribe until the day when a pack of saber-toothed tigers invaded their camp to abduct the youngest member, Roshan in revenge for the tribe killing half of their pack. Nadia fended off an attack on Roshan long enough to run away quickly from Diego who was pursuing her. Nadia ran with Roshan in her arms until she reached a high waterfall and was cornered. She jumped, holding on tightly to her son all the while; she then ended up on the riverbank below, meeting Manny and Sid, two animals that were passing by. With the last of her strength, Nadia nudged Roshan to these animals in the hopes that they could be entrusted with her son. Seconds after this act, she slipped slowly from the riverbank, disappearing. Her fate remains unknown, although it is heavily implied that she may have drowned.\n\n===The Dodo Birds===\nThese '''[[Dodo]]s''' are portrayed as greedy for [[watermelon]]s claiming it to be their private stockpile for the ice age. All these dodos hate to be extinct. Some appear to be military marching. Trying to get a watermelon from Sid, Diego and Manny who try to ask for it for the baby's hunger, some of these dodos accidentally fall to where they tossed the melon. Four of these fall into the pit to [[death by burning|burn to death]] as one warns a few, where another melon is also incinerated. The rest are defeated by Sid who protects the last melon from them by getting through them.\n\n====Dab====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Dab\n| voice              = [[Alan Tudyk]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Dodo]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Black\n| lbl3               = Feathers\n| data3              = Powder blue\n}}\n'''Dab''' was the head [[dodo]] shown in the first film.\n\nThe dodos were collecting a stockpile for the winter, and one of them stole the melon that Manny had spotted for Roshan. When Manny, Sid and Diego went to the dodos to get the melon back, they found the dodos on parade. The dodos' stockpile so far consisted only of three melons, including the stolen melon. After Manny pointed this out, the dodos fought to stop Manny, Diego and Sid getting at the melons. In the fight, the first melon fell over a cliff and several dodos, including the flock's \"last female\", jumped over as well in a [[suicide|suicid]]al attempt to retrieve it. The second melon bounced into a boiling [[tar pit]], along with three more unfortunate dodos who were trying to stop it falling in. Sid managed to get the last melon, and the remaining dodos also fell off the cliff, a parody as to why they are extinct today. In ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'', another dodo gets fried while attempting to cross the geyser fields and in the epilogue of the sequel, there is a dodo choir singing angelically as Scrat enters heaven. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Carl and Frank===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Carl and Frank\n| voice              = Carl: [[Cedric the Entertainer]]<br>Frank: [[Stephen Root]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = Carl: ''[[Embolotherium]]''<br>Frank: ''[[Megacerops|Brontops]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Black\n| lbl3               = Skin\n| data3              = Gray\n}}\n'''Carl''' and '''Frank''' are an ''[[Embolotherium]]'' and a ''[[Megacerops|Brontops]]'' respectively. Carl had thick lips and a thick horn, while Frank had more pointed lips and a thinner horn. They referred to Sid as an overgrown weasel.\n\nThe two appeared at the beginning of the film when Sid the [[ground sloth]] was shown stepping on their salad and eating an important part of it, the [[dandelion]]. The two animals soon chased after him in the hopes of killing him, but were stopped forcefully by Manny the mammoth, by being hurled through the air. They'd held a powerful grudge against Sid for what he'd done and when they next saw him, he was in the same hot mud pool that they were in and was erroneously referring to them as ladies. Again, Carl and Frank stampeded after the hapless sloth, but were waylaid when they saw that he had already been \"killed\" by a saber-toothed cat named Diego (which was part of Sid's plan to get them to be fooled into leaving him alone and not trying to kill him off) and gave up their chase post-haste stating that \"carnivores have all the fun.\" Carl and Frank aren't seen again after this.\n\n===Jennifer and Rachel===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Jennifer and Rachel\n| voice              = Jennifer: [[Lorri Bagley]]<br>Rachel: [[Jane Krakowski]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Jennifer: [[Blue]]<br>Rachel: [[Green]]\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Jennifer: [[Violet (color)|Violet]] with [[black]] hair<br>Rachel: [[Pink]] with [[blond]] hair\n}}\n'''Jennifer''' and '''Rachel''' are two ''Megalonyx'' from the first film.\n\nThe two were shown being sweet-talked by Sid to impress them while he had the baby Roshan in tow. Jennifer admitted that she found some of Sid's qualities to be most attractive, and when Sid left, the two spoke to each other on how, despite his lack of good looks, he was a family-type.\n\nThese two female sloths (in a deleted scene from the film) were shown scorning Sid when he was shown to simply be using the baby to mate with them, though Rachel was much more straightforward as she kicked him directly in the groin while calling him \"''pig''\".\n\nJennifer was a thickset dark-blue sloth with short curly hair and a medium-sized nose. Rachel was considerably thinner and had light tan fur and a blonde ponytail directly at the top of her head and a smaller nose.\n\n===Sylvia===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sylvia\n| voice              = [[Kristen Johnston]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = [[Green]]\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = [[Red]] with red hair\n}}\n'''Sylvia''' is a female Megalonyx who was cut from the first film, but can be found in the deleted scenes of the 2-Disc DVD release as well as the film-to-book adaptation.\n\nSylvia wanted Sid to travel with her, for she was seeking commitment. Sid, not wanting any of this, put her in the path of some running glyptodonts to send her off. Sylvia eventually found him again, and was still adamant to go migrating with him. Sid tricked her into thinking that he was getting turnips for their migration, and then ran off to escape, but she followed him into the jaws of Diego, the saber-toothed cat. She did not believe that Sid was truly dead, and sullenly told Diego to \"eat him\". It is presumed that after that, she left Sid alone. Sylvia had red-colored fur, green eyes and a small nose.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentaries, Sylvia was cut because the scriptwriters felt that Sid's behavior towards her made him too unlikable, and that her scenes detracted from the film's main plot. Additionally, the first movie had a different ending planned out. Sid and Manny headed south without Diego (due to his death, which was changed) and met up with the other animals. Sid had matured after witnessing Diego's death, and upon seeing Sylvia for the third time, was nicer to her, even asking her to be his mate.\n\nSylvia was cut from the movie fairly late. Most of her scenes were completely animated and rendered, and she was seen in the first few trailers of the movie as well as the initial posters.\n\n==Appearing in ''Ice Age: The Meltdown''==\n\n===Fast Tony===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Fast Tony\n| voice              = [[Jay Leno]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Holmesina]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Shell\n| data3              = Blue-gray\n| lbl4               = Skin\n| data4              = Peach\n}}\nA [[Holmesina]] living in the days of the Ice Age, '''Fast Tony''' was a [[peddler]] trying to give off items such as reeds and bark to other denizens of the Ice Age so as to escape the world's end, which by chance, he predicted and it came true. Fast Tony would give off products in exchange for whatever the other animals would bring by with the help of his \"''assistant''\", an insipid [[glyptodon]] named Stu. He was notoriously amoral with others, even being criticized by Manny for willing to sell off ''\"his own mother for a [[grape]]\"''. Fast Tony immediately asked if that was an offer, then pretended he had not thought of it for the benefit of the watching animals.\n\nStu was more Fast Tony's guinea pig to prove their wares' worth, rather than his actual partner and proved more useful dead than alive, as Fast Tony had taken Stu's shell (as Stu had just been killed by Maelstrom and Cretaceous) and shamelessly tried to pawn it off to other animals as a personal \"''mobile home''\".\n\nFast Tony was last seen at the end of ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' using Stu's shell as a raft.\n\n====Stu====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Stu\n| voice              = [[Tom Fahn]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Glyptodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Shell\n| lbl4               = Skin\n}}\n'''Stu''' was a ''Glyptodon'' who was Fast Tony's partner. He seemed to be disliked by Tony due to his stupid personality. He assisted Fast Tony to warn the valley that the dam of ice would burst and helped to demonstrate Fast Tony's snorkel. After the revelation of the flood was proved to be true, Stu took the test snorkel and used it to swim underwater. Shortly after scaring James, a young anteater, Stu was grabbed and pulled underwater by an unknown attacker. As the other animals begin to leave, Fast Tony returns to the pool to get Stu to come along, but Stu's shell is suddenly spat out of the water by the unknown assailant. Fast Tony, after looking at the shell, sees that it makes a great mobile home and runs off after the other animals to try and unload it on someone. Meanwhile, the unknown attackers turn out to be the marine reptiles Cretaceous and Maelstrom. In the ending after the flood, Fast Tony is discovered to have been using the shell as a boat, but he leaves the shell behind as he no longer needs it. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mr. and Mrs. Start===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Mr. and Mrs. Start\n| voice              = Mr. Start: [[Joseph Bologna]]<br>Mrs. Start: [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Palaeotherium|Start]]\n}}\n'''Mr. and Mrs. Start''' are two Starts that are shown resting at the Glacier Water Park where they complain about the heat.

Buck is the only inhabitant of the dinosaurs' world who does not fear Rudy in the slightest, though he possesses a deep respect for him. Due to living underground for so long, he has an extensive knowledge of the dangers of the dinosaur world.\n\nBuck first meets Manny, Crash, Eddie, Diego, and Ellie (who he at one point refers to as \"preggers\") after they descend into the jungle in pursuit of Sid and Momma, and saves them from a dinosaur attack. He has been living in the jungle for quite some time, persistently hunting Rudy to avenge the loss of his eye, and agrees to lead them to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid, and rescues him after taking control of a ''[[Harpactognathus]]''.\n\nAfter Rudy's potential death, Buck, having lost his purpose in life, decides to join the herd and live on the surface. Upon hearing a distant familiar roar that tells him that Rudy survived the fall, he chooses to stay and causes a cave-in that seals off the path between the surface and the underground jungle, trapping him inside and everyone else on the surface.

Buck escaped, knocking out one of Rudy's teeth in the process. Rudy appears to have held a grudge ever since, especially since the impact left behind a crack in his mouth which prevented any new teeth from growing.

A new landmass emerges and launches the iceberg that the two are standing on into the air.\n\nGutt battles Manny with his two swords, stating that \"the sea isn't big enough\" for the two of them. Manny charges into Gutt, knocking him down, but Gutt is able to push the mammoth off of him. Manny charges again, but Gutt swings on a number of vines to catch up to the floe; Manny follows. Gutt pushes Manny onto the front of the floe and grabs a log to finish him off, but Manny jumps onto the back of the floe, which launches Gutt off the floe. Manny catches the log and hits Gutt, sending the evil ape flying out of fight.\n\nHe lands in a cave river and grabs a piece of ice to float on the water; he notices fins sticking out of the water, and is shortly after eaten offscreen by a siren posing as a female ''Gigantopithecus''.\n\n'''Note''': [[Jeremy Renner]] was originally set to voice the character, but was replaced by [[Peter Dinklage]] due scheduling conflicts involving ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]''. Captain Gutt was initially written as a [[bear]], but designer Peter DeS\u00e8ve had a hard time designing an ursine villain, and thus instead designed him as a more versatile primate.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====Flynn====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Flynn\n| voice              = [[Nick Frost]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Elephant seal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = Gray\n}}\n'''Flynn''' is a large English [[elephant seal]] (appearing to be just as big as or even bigger than Manny in the film) who makes his first appearance in [[Scrat's Continental Crack-up|the second part of Scrat's Continental Crack-up]].

When the pirates first encounter Manny's herd, Flynn inadvertently gives them directions to return to the continent, much to Gutt's exasperation. The seal then joined the attack on the herd, squashing Sid underneath his bulk. When Manny's herd destroys the ship, leaving the pirates to drift at sea, Flynn initially panics at the prospect of [[drowning]], but is reminded by an annoyed Gutt that he is able to swim. Flynn worries about Shira when Gutt leaves her for dead, but he later propels the pirates to land aboard a small raft made of ice.\n\nIn the final battle, Flynn and Gupta corner Sid and Granny, only for the latter to summon Precious, sending the pirates running in fear. Flynn rejoins the battle against Manny, but is defeated when Precious blasts him with water.\n\n====Raz====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Raz\n| voice              = [[Rebel Wilson]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Procoptodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Grayish white with Violet stripes\n}}\n'''Raz''' is an Australian ''[[Procoptodon]]'' who serves as the crew's resident weapons and artillery expert, hiding an arsenal of deadly bone swords in her pouch and using her powerful legs to launch projectiles at enemies by kicking them.\n\nIn the final melee against Manny's herd, she battles Manny herself, until she is blasted away by Precious.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Silas====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Silas\n| voice              = [[Alain Chabat]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Petrel]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Feather colour\n| data3              = Grey, with blue feet\n}}\n'''Silas''' is a [[petrel]] from the south of France with the feet of a [[blue-footed booby]] who usually scouts out for trouble ahead of the pirates.

He is overconfident, somewhat psychotic, and dislikes being called adorable; he is berated many times by Gutt and Shira for trying to assume authority over the crew. Squint holds a rivalry with Shira, which reaches its climax when Squint becomes Gutt's new first mate after Gutt insults Shira for failing to kill Manny and his herd.\n\nIn the final battle, Squint attempts to attack Shira as she is trying to free Ellie, but Shira mocks Squint's 'adorable nose', which agitates him and allows Ellie to stomp on him.\n\nSquint later resurfaces in ''[[Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade]]'' where Squint wanted revenge on the Herd.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Dobson====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Dobson\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Metridiochoerus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Red/Violet & Brownish Gray\n}}\n'''Dobson''' is a ''[[Metridiochoerus]]'', who speaks in growls, oinks, and other pig noises (although he appeared to be singing along with the crew in the \"Master of the Seas\" musical sequence).

Dobson later takes part in the final battle, fighting Crash and Eddie \"rodeo-style\", and is able to charge into Manny and knock him into the other ship along with Shira.

In the climax of the film, Gupta and Flynn corner Sid and Granny, but are scared off by Granny's pet whale Precious.

When Peaches sees she has hurt her friend's feelings, and that Ethan and his group are lacking in common sense, she decides to leave. Ethan rudely remarks that \"it's bad enough her family is half-possum\", angering Peaches.

When Granny, along with her grandson Sid and his friends Manny and Diego, were confronted at a cliff overhanging the ocean by a number of pirates, Granny called Precious, who rose up out of the water, opened her mouth, and allowed Granny to walk in along with Sid (who was disgusted at the smell inside the whale). Later, Granny and Sid use her like a submarine to fight with the pirates.\n\nLarge, even for a whale, Precious was the beloved pet of Granny, who was always seen throwing food into the ocean when she was near it.

Though somewhat wary of the visitors, the hyraxes quickly warm up to the Sub-Zero Heroes. Manny feels that, if the hyraxes helped them, they could defeat the pirates; unfortunately, the hyraxes are unable to comprehend English and misinterpret Manny's request as asking for food. Eventually, Sid is able to communicate to them that an alliance is necessary if the other hyraxes are to be freed and the pirates are to be defeated, much to the surprise of Manny and Diego. The lead hyrax (distinguished by his bushy eyebrows, lighter fur coloration, and lower voice tone), who hates Gutt with a passion, rallies his forces and decides to help the herd, much to the herd's delight.\n \nDuring the attack on the pirates, the lead hyrax spearheads a cavalry attack, followed by a dive bombing rescue, which is a diversion used to trick the pirates into leaving the slave hyraxes and their ship unguarded while the herd frees the captives and overtakes the ship.

His personality is shown to be aloof, grumpy, and standoffish, but is otherwise loving and courageous. In the first film, while passing through the icy cave, the herd discovers [[cave painting]]s of Manny with his wife and child, who were killed by [[human]]s; this is a very sentimental moment for Manny, since he failed to protect them. Manny finds love with Ellie in ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''. In ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', he is anxious when Ellie is pregnant. At the end of the film, he becomes the proud father of a baby daughter named Peaches. In ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', he gets into an argument with his teenage daughter before being pulled away in by the drift with Diego, Sid and Granny. He and the team later encounter a group of pirates led by Captain Gutt. When the team escaped they destroy the ship and take Shira with them. This enrages the Captain who hunts them down. Later on, he is almost manipulated by [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]].\n\nA running gag for Manny, shown in four of the five films, is that if a certain character were to refer to him as fat, he would often deny it, saying that \"his fur is what makes him look big\" and that \"it's poofy\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sid===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sidney\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002)\n| voice              = [[John Leguizamo]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Teal\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light yellow\n| alias              = Sid the Sloth\n| species            = [[Megalonyx]]\n| family             = Milton (father)<br>Eunice (mother)<br>Marshall (brother)<br>Fungus (uncle)<br>Granny (grandmother)\n}}\n'''Sidney \"Sid\"''' is a [[Ground Sloth]] in all five films who is dull-witted, talkative, friendly, carefree, [[Naivety|naive]], accident-prone, patient and funny with a caring nature, and is voiced with a [[lateral lisp]]. Little is known from Sid's life other than that Sid once lived in a tree with other sloths that always wanted to leave Sid behind when the migration occurred, using several different ways to leave him behind. What is clear is that Sid's mother always told him that \"bad news is just good news in disguise\" prior to abandoning him for good. He accidentally starts a fire in the first film and learns how to do it properly towards the end; he also shows this skill in the second film, where he is worshiped by a tribe of \"mini-sloths\" who call him \"Fire King\" and try to sacrifice him. In the third film, he adopts a trio of baby T-Rexes, and is forcibly taken to the underground dinosaur land by their mother, requiring the others to come and save him. In the fourth film, it is revealed that his full name is Sidney, though this name was also used in a deleted scene of the first film. When he, Diego and Manny are on the ice and are forced up by a [[Waterspout|water spout]], they see a [[rainbow]] in the bright blue sky as he told them that \"there is a rainbow at the end of every corner.\"\n\nA mechanical version of Sid appears in ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'' during the miming scene.\n\nSid was built along the form typical of ground sloths, short, brushy tail, clawed hands and feet, a long thin neck, ovular head with bulbous eye on both sides and a pair of buckteeth. Sid's right front tooth was slightly bigger than the left, similar to his right eye, which was also somewhat bigger than the left, both eyes of which were pale green. Sid's pelt was dirty and tan, and became brown when the fungus it carried dried out, Sid attributing the state of his pelt to his vegetarian diet, which he said led to a younger-looking pelt. In his films, Sid faints at certain times when he's getting hit - e.g. he faints when he gets hit on the nose by a block of ice and apparently get his tongue stuck to the floor of an ice cave.\n\nIn the behind the scenes, the creators combined the traits of [[three-toed sloth]]s and [[ground sloth]]s while designing Sid and the other sloth characters.\n\n===Diego===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Diego\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002)\n| voice              = [[Denis Leary]] (films)<br>[[Rick Pasqualone]] (''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (video game)]]'')\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel/green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Orange\n| species            = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n}}\n'''Diego''' is a saber-toothed cat found in all five of the films. He is Shira's love interest. He has a [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] personality, although it is not intended to be nasty. He was sent by his pack to retrieve the human baby called Roshan; When he found Roshan in Manny and Sid's care, he pretended to lead them to the humans, but instead planned to lead them into an ambush by the pack. However, when Manny saved his life, Diego had a change of heart, confessing about the pack and sacrifices himself to help them escape. He was seemingly killed by the pack's leader, Soto, but survived and joined Manny and Sid on their travels. In the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown|second film]], he was revealed to suffer from [[aquaphobia]], but he eventually conquered it in order to save Sid, Crash and Eddie. In the third film, he began to fear that he was losing his predatory abilities from being in the \"herd\" too long, and considered staying in the underground dinosaur world with Buck. He changed his mind after managing to save the labored Ellie from a dinosaur attack. In [[Ice Age: Continental Drift]], another ''[[Smilodon]]'' named Shira joins the group, and Diego feels attracted to her. During the end credits, Diego and Shira are seen nuzzling each other showing that they have now become a couple.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Ellie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Ellie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006)\n| voice              = [[Queen Latifah]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light brown\n| spouse             = Manny\n| children           = Peaches (daughter)\n}} \n'''Ellie''' is a female woolly mammoth, whom Manny, Diego, and Sid meet during their migration to escape the flood in the second movie, ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''.\n\nIt was revealed that when Ellie was young, she was separated from her herd during the [[ice age]]. She came across two [[opossums]] named Crash and Eddie, along with their mother. She later forgot her origins and thought that she was an opossum.\n\nInitially Manny was overjoyed that he had found another of his kind, but got somewhat dismayed when he realized that Ellie believed that she was an opossum. Nevertheless, Sid welcomed Ellie and her brothers to travel with them, much to Manny's annoyance. During this time, Ellie displayed the mannerisms pertaining to an opossum as well as insisting (despite obvious proof that she was not a possum) and this tested Manny's patience, namely when she claimed that the act of bravery that he had done of fighting off the sea reptile Cretaceous was dumb.\n\nSoon, Manny got his time to be alone with Ellie when he and Ellie went for a walk through a wooded area, where Ellie had a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that told her of her past. Upon remembering this, she knew that she was a mammoth. When Manny later implied that they must mate in order to save the mammoths from extinction, she was initially angered, but in time she apologized for overreacting.\n\nSoon, however, this new \"herd\" reached a horrible obstacle between them and safety from the oncoming flood: a field of geysers, which Manny explained must be crossed, but Ellie would not listen: she and her brothers felt that they must go around. But this proved to be disastrous: as they were trying to reach their destination, some rocks caved down and nearly crushed Ellie and her brothers, but trapped them instead in a sort of cave. Manny rescued Ellie, for the water was flooding into the cave where she was trapped and had nearly drowned Ellie. She and Manny escaped and regrouped with the others, but faced another problem, for the waters were still rising.\n\nAfter the waters had subsided a herd of mammoths made their way into the valley. Manny thought that because the mammoths had come, that Ellie would not want to remain with him. He was persuaded otherwise by Sid and Diego and confronted Ellie confessing his feelings, saying that he wanted to be together not because they had to be, but because he himself wanted to. Ellie accepted him as her mate. The mammoths trumpet while Manny and Ellie embrace. Manny and Ellie decide to stay with their old friends, taking along Sid, Diego, and the possum brothers.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', she and Manny are mates and Ellie is pregnant with their first child. When they find the Dinosaur World under their feet, they have to go in and search for Sid in Lava Falls. When very close to Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labour, and gives birth to Peaches (which was named after the codeword that was for if Ellie went into labor on the trip). When they reunite with Sid and return to the surface, Ellie introduces Peaches to the herd's new home.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', she is an understanding wife and a mother. Ellie supports Peaches, when she had an argument with Manny. When the Ice Age: Continental Drift happens she aids the herd to the Land Bridge. In the end, she also fights with the Pirates.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Crash and Eddie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Crash and Eddie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006)\n| voice              = Crash: [[Seann William Scott]] <br>Eddie: [[Josh Peck]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Virginia opossum]]s\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Crash: Blue <br> Eddie: Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Dark brown striped\n}}\n'''Crash''' and '''Eddie''' are two twin brother opossums. Adoptive brothers of Ellie, they cared for her and taught her to hang by her tail from a tree branch when she slept, as they did. They are shown to be adventurous and fun-loving, courtesy of the fact that they're both very stupid.\n\nThey first made their presence known to the opening characters by means of shooting pebbles through reeds at Sid and Diego, then roasting them so as to humiliate them, but Diego began chasing them, leading both Sid and Diego to Ellie. After Sid invites them to travel with them, Ellie and her brothers agreed, much to the annoyance of Manny.\n\nAs they traveled with Manny and his friends, Ellie grew closer to Manny, putting both Crash and Eddie somewhat closer to Manny and his friends, but creating a short feud when Manny tried \"hitting on\" Ellie. They even play dead when crows are nearby. In time, however, they saw behind the petty grudges and worked together with Manny, Sid, and Diego to escape the flood, but left with Ellie when she left Manny and his friends to cross the minefield, as she claimed that it was suicide to cross it. Crash and Eddie joined Ellie in trying to escape the flood, but soon ran into trouble when they were trapped in a cave.\n\nEllie insisted that they leave her to the point of pushing them outwards from a small crevice, but they promised to return with help, and true to their word, persuaded Manny to try and free Ellie. They eventually made their way into a rushing current of water and were almost swept away when an overzealous Sid came along to jump into the current, leaving them, in addition to holding onto a branch for dear life against the current of water, trying to hold onto an unconscious Sid. Diego eventually helped when he jumped in and saved them from drowning along with Sid. When Manny had saved Ellie from drowning, they helped Ellie back onto solid ground, but almost drowned when the flood was encroaching.\n\nEventually however, the waters drained, leaving Crash, Eddie, and all of the others alive. When a herd of mammoths came by (as mammoths were presumed all but extinct), they thought that Ellie would go with them and leave Manny, so they went with her. But as it turned out, Manny and Ellie stayed together because they wanted to, rather than being obligated to, and so they left onwards with Sid and Diego, as well as Crash and Eddie.\n\nIn the third film, Crash and Eddie travel with the others to the dino jungle to save Sid from Momma, and both grow to idolize Buck, the one-eyed dinosaur-hunting weasel who helped them find Sid. In the third film, they also mentioned they never liked Sid. This is not true however, due to helping Buck save Sid from his incoming death.\n\nOverall, they are very close and almost inseparable as brothers, as shown in the sequels. They are near-on identical: Crash has blue eyes and a flatter nose with ridges, and was voiced by [[Seann William Scott]] while Eddie has brown eyes and a pointier nose with a brown stripe, and was voiced by [[Josh Peck]]. Their mom is Mother Opossum, who first saved Ellie when Crash and Eddie were very small.\n \nIn ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', Crash and Eddie, along with Buck, ride a pterosaur and save Sid from a lava flow heading downwards.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', they have more minor roles than in the previous films but do partake in the final battle with Gutt's crew fighting Dobson by hopping on his back and having a rodeo, but accidentally let him charge into Manny and, later Shira, knocking them onto the other ship.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Peaches===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Peaches\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' (2009)\n| voice              = [[Ciara Bravo]] (''[[Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas]]'')<br>[[Keke Palmer]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Light green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Auburn\n| spouse             = Julian\n| family             = Manny (father)<br>Ellie (mother)\n| relatives          = Crash and Eddie (adoptive uncles)\n}}\n'''Peaches''' is the daughter of [[Manny (Ice Age)#Manny|Manny]] and [[List of Ice Age characters#Ellie|Ellie]], born in the Dinosaurs' world whilst they were under attack by a pack of Guanlong. She appeared close to end of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and was named after the code-word that was thought up to say that Ellie was going into labour. Manny also claims that [[peach]]es are sweet, round and fuzzy, just like Peaches and Ellie. She looks exactly like her mother, Ellie (which Sid thinks is very lucky). At the end of the film, she returned to the surface with her parents and the rest of the group. She is voiced by [[Ciara Bravo]] in ''[[Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas]]'' as a kid, and [[Keke Palmer]] in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as a teenager, and also as a young adult in ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]''.\n\nPeaches appears as a teenager in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''. She is self-taught to do some possum moves just like her mother. Shortly after Scrat sets off a domino effect of the continents breaking apart, she is shown sneaking up in the morning going to the falls with Louis, a molehog who is also her best friend. After Manny embarrasses her in front of Ethan, her crush, and the other mammoths by grounding her, she and her father get into a fight, and as a result, when he, Diego, and Sid get separated from them on an iceberg, she feels not only helpless to stop it but also guilty. Later during the events of the film, it is Ethan who shows an interest in her hanging out with him and his friends. As a kind of condition, he suggests for her to leave Louis behind. Convinced he'd start to like her, she readily agrees. The following day, while walking with Ethan and the other mammoths, unbeknownst to them that Louis was looking for her, they begin to question her about her friendship with him. When she claims to have none so as to gain their approval, Louis overhears, also making himself known. Shortly after Louis leaves, Peaches begins to grow tired of the other mammoths' teasing, as immediately afterwards a tremor causes a dangerous moving cloud of dust, and instead of expressing concern they try to convince her that it was fun escaping the blast. Upon calling them out on their stupid behaviour, Ethan and the others carelessly judge her by her family being part possum, causing her to get upset, confront Ethan, then leave. At the end of the movie, she and her herd are, in part, saved by Louis, who bravely challenges Captain Gutt, and distracts him from Peaches by slamming a chunk of ice on his foot. His bravery, as well as Peaches' own heroics in saving her mother, impress Ethan and his friends, who ask to hang out with them instead. Louis casually agrees.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', Peaches is now a young adult and prepares to marry a male mammoth named Julian.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Granny===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Granny\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Wanda Sykes]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = Faded purple with scraggly grey scalp hair\n| family             = Milton (son)<br>Fungus (son)<br>Eunice (daughter-in-law)<br>Sid (grandson)<br>Marshall (grandson)\n}}\n'''Granny''' is a Megalonyx and also [[Sid (Ice Age)#Sid|Sid]]'s grandmother. She joins the herd after her own family abandons her, calling her \"dead weight\" to save their own skins before the earthquake (that and to avoid Sid). Despite, how Granny sometimes picks on and berates her grandson, Sid is very happy to have her around. Granny is loud, abrasive, tough, sarcastic, somewhat crazy, as she once thought Gutt was actually being nice to her. Over time she begins to warm up to the group, as Sid asked Granny why their own family abandoned him and Granny; for a moment, Granny sympathetically answers \"because they think we're screw-ups and can't do anything right\". She even helps out in several attempts to get back home. At the end Granny admits that Sid is lucky to have a real family (his herd) that care so much about him. She quickly asks Sid to chew her food, but Sid had fixed her a new set of teeth, a pair of shark teeth that were originally Raz's weapon but Granny uses them quite well as they are very sharp.\n\nIt is shown in the film she had an allegedly imaginary pet named Precious, which showed up at the end and turned out to be real: a giant whale who defeats Gutt's crew (minus Squint) by blasting them away. Precious then helped the group to Switchback Cove and Granny bids her pet a fond good-bye.\n\n===Louis===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Louis\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Josh Gad]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = Molehog\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = White, grey brown, and brown\n}}\nPeaches' best friend '''Louis''', is a timid, well-spoken, and cute molehog (a small mammal that lives during the [[ice age]]s. The molehog's name is a portmanteau of [[Mole (animal)|mole]] and [[hedgehog]]), who is always dutifully by her side and eager to help, even if it is to help her get closer to pretty boy Ethan. When Peaches' heart is ultimately broken by Ethan, Louis secretly wishes that she could see that he is the only one who adores her just as she is. Peaches is very oblivious to his crush on her. He tries to be the voice of reason when she is up to some things, because of his soft-spoken demeanor and his somewhat cowardice, Manny alongside Crash and Eddie, have dubbed him \"Wiener\". Even after having his feelings hurt by Peaches, Louis comes to his friends side when she is held hostage by Gutt. He fends off Gutt long enough for Peaches to escape, impressed by his bravery, Manny even encourages Louis to be more open minded to adventures like Peaches. Ethan and his posse even ask to hang out with him, as they seem to move on in life as friends. The only flaw with Louis' life in Ice Age is, along with \"The Brat Pack\", he seems to lack parents and other family members that he would live with.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Shira===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Shira\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Jennifer Lopez]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur Color\n| data3              = White with black stripes\n| lbl4               = Accessories\n| data4              = 2 earrings in each ear, one blue and one green.\n}}\n'''Shira''' appears in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as part of Gutt's crew, and is Captain Gutt's pawn. She is a dazzlingly beautiful, female saber-toothed cat and Diego's lover resembling a [[snow leopard]]. She makes her first appearance in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift#Marketing|Scrat's Continental Crack-up: Part 2]]'' standing next to Captain Gutt, who is holding Scrat.\n\nShira first appears when Gutt's crew attacks the herds \"ship\". Diego is smitten upon his first sight on her as she is the most beautiful creature he has ever seen. Diego, wanting himself, Manny, Sid, and Granny to get back home, tries to chomp off all the pirates' ropes from their \"ship\", but is too late as Shira arrives and restrains him, mocking him for his declaration of \"I don't fight girls\" by pinning him down and saying, \"I can see why\". After Manny and the others escape by capsizing Gutt's iceberg, Shira is seen in the water, calling out for her crewmates' help; only Flynn is concerned over Shira's whereabouts, but Gutt ignores this and demands his crew to move on forward without her. She is rescued against her will by Manny, and is angered when Diego calls her \"Kitty\" for calling them a \"bad joke\" of a herd. She journeyed with the herd to an island. Once there, she attempts to escape, but Diego catches up to her and she is imprisoned in a tree, much to her anger.\n\nThat night, Shira is approached by Diego, who learns she left her pack as he once did. Diego tells her that she simply traded one pack for another, and that his herd always has each other's backs, pointing out that Gutt hadn't made any thoughts of planning a search party for her in the first place. The next morning, Shira escapes and finds Gutt making a new ship on the other side of the island. Gutt angrily berates her for not killing the herd, and punishes her by making Squint his new first mate while she gets demoted. Gutt then orders Shira to target Diego, declaring that he would have a tiger-skin rug when it ended, he didn't care whose (somewhat proving Diego's point to Shira that Gutt never had his back on her or anyone else). When the herd enacts their plans to take Gutt's new ship back home, Shira once again tackles Diego, who convinces her to turn against Gutt and come with him. Because of their newfound love, she follows Diego to the ship, but on seeing that Gutt is catching up to them, secretly puts ice in his way. As the herd floats away, Shira tells Diego that she has his back, while both looking at each other longingly as the boat leaves implying they have feelings for each other.\n\nDuring the return home, Diego realized he had fallen in love with Shira, despite denying it to Manny and Sid. Later, when Gutt is holding Peaches hostage, Shira is seen struggling to get up, implying that Gutt had physically punished Shira for her betrayal. During the fight, she protects Ellie from Squint, mocking the rabbit's \"cute little bunny nose\". After the defeat of Gutt's crew, Shira joins the herd, sharing a loving look with Diego. She also rests her head on Diego's shoulder during the herd's landing on switchback cove. In the end credits, Shira nuzzles against Diego's side showing that they have now become a couple.\n\n===Julian===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Julian\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' (2016)\n| voice              = [[Adam DeVine]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| species            = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n}}\n'''Julian''' is a young and courageous mammoth who is Peaches' fianc\u00e9 and part-time member of The Herd and The Brat Pack.

He has his own stories in the films which are mostly independent of those of the main characters, though the two do intersect at times.\n\nIn a special feature in the second film's DVD, his name has been stated to be a mix of the words \"[[squirrel]]\" and \"[[rat]]\", his species allegedly believed to have been a common ancestor of both. In the ''Ice Age'' [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], he is referred to as \"The Scrat\" by directors [[Chris Wedge]] and [[Carlos Saldanha]].\n\nScrat is voiced in all ''Ice Age'' movies and short films by director Chris Wedge. He directly interacts with the story's main characters on eight occasions, mostly with Sid. In the first film, he attacks Sid when the latter tries to eat his acorn, successfully regaining it. He later meets Manny, Sid, and Diego asking him where the baby's family is and Scrat attempts to tell them about nearby saber-toothed tigers, but Diego kicks Scrat away before he could do so. At the end of the second film, after Scrat created a hole in the valley and released all the melted ice, later attacks Sid for saving his life (when he had already almost died and gone to paradise and was about to get a giant acorn). In the third film, Scrat is stepped on by Manny and falls onto Sid's head while chasing his acorn. Next, he appears when Sid's \"children\" are batting a ball around, the ball actually being Scrat. Also, when Scratte rips off his fur, he screams so loud the herd can hear him, causing Crash and Eddie to deem the place a \"Jungle of Misery\". Lastly, while Diego is sleeping, he wakes up when he gets hit with Scrat's acorn. In the fourth film, when Sid pries open a clam, he finds Scrat inside. Sid's grandmother mistakes Scrat for a rat and continuously hits him with her cane until he falls into the ocean.\n\nScrat constantly hunts for his acorn either to bury it or eat it, but fate always gets in the way. He invariably ends up in humorous or painful situations: being struck by lightning, pursued by avalanches, and repeatedly knocked unconscious while fighting for his acorn. Yet he never gives up. Scrat generally loses, except when he defeats a school of piranhas and successfully \"battles\" Sid.\n\nScrat is the main character in four short films. In the first, ''[[Gone Nutty]]'', he loses his collection of [[acorn]]s in a catastrophic chain of events. He jams his acorn into a hole in the middle of the collection, which shatters the pile and with it the entire continent - which begins the [[continental drift]].\n\nIn the second film, ''[[No Time for Nuts]]'', Scrat finds a [[time travel|time machine]] left by a time-traveler and visits several historical events. He becomes trapped in a frightening future when oak trees have become extinct, but somehow manages to return to the series' time period.\n\nA third Scrat short, ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]'', was released in 2010 accompanying the feature ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'', and later with ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' as a promotion for the fourth Ice Age movie ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]].''<ref>{{cite news |title=Swift injustice |first=James |last=Verniere |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330&position=also |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date=2010-12-25 |accessdate=2 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226092036/http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330 |archive-date=26 December 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA fourth and most recent short film, ''[[Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe]]'', was released in 2015 preceding ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''.\n\nScrat has a cameo in ''[[Surviving Sid]]'', that is important to the plot.\n\nScrat is the main character in the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown#Video game|''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' video game]]. He is also playable in the other two games based on the series.\n\nScrat makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Sibling Rivalry (Family Guy)|Sibling Rivalry]]\", in a cutaway gag in which [[Peter Griffin]] says Scrat's nuts are his, leading Scrat to attack Peter.\n\nThe origin of Scrat is disputed. Cartoon designer [[Ivy Supersonic]] claims she created the character in 1999, after seeing a squirrel-rat hybrid in [[Skidmore College]]'s Case Green. She called her character \"Sqrat\" and says she presented the idea to 20th Century Fox movie executives. A CNN report by Jeanne Moos of Ivy's discovery was aired in 2000, two years before ''Ice Age'' went into development. Supersonic claims the studio's own documents actually identified the character in ''Ice Age'' as \"Sqrat\", though her creation was not sabre-toothed.<ref name=\"sqrat\">{{cite web| last = Supersonic| first = Ivy| title = A Scrat is a Sqrat / Scrat - by Ivy Supersonic| url = http://ivysmedia.com/scrat/| accessdate = 11 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIvy Supersonic was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox Studios. She turned it down and subsequently lost in court. The case is currently in appeal (Case # 04401 Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, NYC). She still has hopes of receiving damages for her claimed infringement.<ref name=sqrat/>\n\nSupersonic did win a partial summary judgement from the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] in a reverse suit, Fox Film Corporation v.

While sleeping one morning, his tribe is attacked by a pack of smilodons. The leader of the pack, Soto, wants to kill the baby as revenge for the baby's father killing half the pack and using their skin as clothes and their flesh as food. His mother is able to fend off Diego, whose mission is to retrieve him. However, she is cornered over a waterfall. In a desperate attempt to save her son, leaps over the waterfall, holding the baby tightly in her arms. They are both found by Manny and Sid at the riverside. Using what little strength she has left, she gives the baby to Manny and Sid in hopes that he will be safe with them.\n\nRoshan's primary care-provider is Sid, the only member of the group who initially has concern for him, Manny being too disillusioned to care and Diego secretly planning to kill him. Manny, scarred by his previous experience with humans, is reluctant to have anything to do with the baby, but eventually bonds with him. At the end of the movie, the baby is reunited with his tribe.\n\n===Soto's Pack===\n'''Soto's Pack''' is a group of [[saber-toothed cat]]s that are the primary antagonists of ''Ice Age''.

He wants to eat Roshan in vengeance for the murders of several of his pack-mates. He is the main antagonist of the first film.\n\nAs part of his plan to kidnap Roshan, Soto plans an attack on the human camp so that while he and three other pack members would attack the humans, Diego would sneak in, unnoticed, and abduct Roshan. Diego fails at this task, leaving Soto furious, telling Diego to bring Roshan to Half-Peak where he would meet with the others and threatens have him served as a replacement if he fails. Soto dispatched his fellow pack members Zeke and Oscar to warn Diego to hurry and bring Roshan or not return at all, though was reciprocated with the news that alongside Roshan, Soto would receive a mammoth.\n\nSoto eventually made it with his pack to Half Peak and informed Diego that while he had his doubts, he was pleased that Diego had made it. Soon it would happen that unbeknownst to Soto, Diego was in league with both Manny and Sid, and so Sid would lure Soto and his pack-mates away from both Manny and Roshan with a decoy made of snow.\n\nSoto fought viciously in the altercation in which he made an attempt to kill Manny, but was stopped by the now-reformed Diego, whom he severely maimed. Out of anger, Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice, knocking loose a row of icicles, the sharp ice formations falling, and end up killing Soto offscreen.\n\n====Zeke====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Zeke\n| voice              = [[Jack Black]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Grayish-brown\n}}\n'''Zeke''' is an overactive Smilodon and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nHe is led by Soto who is out to seek Roshan and kill him. Zeke is dark-gray and looked rough, as well as acting the part of a suck up. It is revealed in a deleted scene that he, like the other members of his pack, wanted very much to follow the \"walking buffet\" south, but Soto would not hear of it. Zeke accompanied Oscar to tell Diego to hurry up and bring back Roshan or not to come back. Diego had him inform Soto that there will be a mammoth traveling with the baby as well. He soon made it along with the rest of his pack to Half Peak, where he tried to kill Sid and Roshan, but was outwitted by Sid who stomped him into a tiny crevice with his hindquarters sticking out.

Oscar went along with Zeke to find Diego and warn him to hurry and bring Roshan.

One of the pack members Diego was expected to steal the baby Roshan from the humans but missed his chance when Roshan's mother Nadia escaped with her child through a waterfall. Bitter at Diego's failure the pack leader Soto orders Diego to retrieve Roshan and bring him to Half Peak where the others will be waiting. Soto was later informed by other pack members Zeke and Oscar that Diego will bring Roshan back along with a wooly Mammoth called Manny who has been caring for Roshan along with Sid the sloth.\n\nLenny met up with Diego along with the other members of the pack at Half Peak where Zeke reminisced the joys of mammoth flesh much to Lenny's displeasure (saying his only lines in the film, \"Hey, knock it off. I'm starving!\" and \"I told you to knock it off!\"). He then demanded Zeke to stop talking about food and then tries to strike him but is stopped by Soto who tells him to save energy as mammoths don't go down easily. Soto plans an ambush on Manny so he would be caught by surprise and so he ordered the pack not to attack until they saw Manny but Diego secretly turned on his pack after he had been shown real friendship and appreciation from Manny and Sid so he tempted Zeke to leap into action and attack. The surprise given away, the pack pursue Sid as he slides down a snowy slope on a piece of bark soon after Lenny and Oscar who had been chasing Sid where hit by a large log Manny threw at them. Once they recovered they saw that Soto had been killed when he tried to attack Manny and that Diego had thwarted Soto's attacks. Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice and a number of icicles fall down and kill him. Seeing the death of their leader, Lenny and Oscar run off. It is unknown what happened to them afterwards.\n\nUnlike the rest of his pack who are all [[saber-toothed cat]]s, Lenny is a [[Homotherium|scimitar-toothed cat]] as stated in the book ''Ice Age: The Essential Guide''.\n\n===Runar===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Runar\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Neanderthal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Hair\n| data3              = Dark brown\n| spouse             = Nadia (deceased)\n| children           = Roshan (son)\n}}\n'''Runar''' was the [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] of the Neanderthal tribe shown in the first film.\n\nRunar was a leader for a tribe of Neanderthals (referred in the film as humans). He was the father of Roshan and husband of Nadia, and cared greatly for his family, all the while leading them and the rest of the tribe as a nomadic group to travel from place to place. In one encampment that his tribe set up, half a pack of saber-toothed tigers was killed and the furs taken as coats and clothing. In vengeance, the leader saber-tooth named Soto decided to plan an attack on Runar's tribe so as to take his son Roshan and kill him in vengeance for those saber-teeth slain in battle by Runar's tribe. The attack almost worked, but Runar's tribe had trained [[Dire wolf|dire wolves]] that detected Soto's pack coming and alerted the human tribe to battle the saber-teeth, with Soto fighting directly with Runar while the rest of the tribe fought the other saber-tooth tigers and unleash their wolves to help. In the melee, the baby Roshan was taken by his mother from a saber-toothed tiger named Diego, and the hunters successfully warded off the saber-teeth. Runar tried to help his wife and son, but is stopped by Soto and Oscar. After the fight, he finds out that his son and wife had disappeared.\n\nRunar had no choice left but to begin the travel to another camp far off, tracking the dangerous saber-teeth on the way and finding clues as to his son's whereabouts. In time, Runar made it near the settlement and was finally re-united with his son, but not before meeting face-to-face with Manny and Sid, the two animals who returned the child. Runar was on his guard about Manny at first, as he appeared violent while his tribe quickly rush in to attack Manny and Sid. Upon seeing Roshan, he quickly came to see that they meant no harm, simply to return his child and stopped his tribe from attacking them.\n\nRunar thanked Manny by giving him the charm bracelet that had once been Roshan's, and after letting his son say goodbye to Manny and Sid, Runar left the scene with his tribe and his son in tow.\n\n===Nadia===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Nadia\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Neanderthal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Hair\n| data3              = Dark brown\n| spouse             = Runar\n| children           = Roshan (son)\n}}\n'''Nadia''' was the wife of the chieftain of a neanderthal tribe shown in the first film.\n\nNadia had a husband, Runar, and a baby son, Roshan. She and her family lived a peaceful life together with their tribe until the day when a pack of saber-toothed tigers invaded their camp to abduct the youngest member, Roshan in revenge for the tribe killing half of their pack. Nadia fended off an attack on Roshan long enough to run away quickly from Diego who was pursuing her. Nadia ran with Roshan in her arms until she reached a high waterfall and was cornered. She jumped, holding on tightly to her son all the while; she then ended up on the riverbank below, meeting Manny and Sid, two animals that were passing by. With the last of her strength, Nadia nudged Roshan to these animals in the hopes that they could be entrusted with her son. Seconds after this act, she slipped slowly from the riverbank, disappearing. Her fate remains unknown, although it is heavily implied that she may have drowned.\n\n===The Dodo Birds===\nThese '''[[Dodo]]s''' are portrayed as greedy for [[watermelon]]s claiming it to be their private stockpile for the ice age. All these dodos hate to be extinct. Some appear to be military marching. Trying to get a watermelon from Sid, Diego and Manny who try to ask for it for the baby's hunger, some of these dodos accidentally fall to where they tossed the melon. Four of these fall into the pit to [[death by burning|burn to death]] as one warns a few, where another melon is also incinerated. The rest are defeated by Sid who protects the last melon from them by getting through them.\n\n====Dab====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Dab\n| voice              = [[Alan Tudyk]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Dodo]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Black\n| lbl3               = Feathers\n| data3              = Powder blue\n}}\n'''Dab''' was the head [[dodo]] shown in the first film.\n\nThe dodos were collecting a stockpile for the winter, and one of them stole the melon that Manny had spotted for Roshan. When Manny, Sid and Diego went to the dodos to get the melon back, they found the dodos on parade. The dodos' stockpile so far consisted only of three melons, including the stolen melon. After Manny pointed this out, the dodos fought to stop Manny, Diego and Sid getting at the melons. In the fight, the first melon fell over a cliff and several dodos, including the flock's \"last female\", jumped over as well in a [[suicide|suicid]]al attempt to retrieve it. The second melon bounced into a boiling [[tar pit]], along with three more unfortunate dodos who were trying to stop it falling in. Sid managed to get the last melon, and the remaining dodos also fell off the cliff, a parody as to why they are extinct today. In ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'', another dodo gets fried while attempting to cross the geyser fields and in the epilogue of the sequel, there is a dodo choir singing angelically as Scrat enters heaven. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Carl and Frank===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Carl and Frank\n| voice              = Carl: [[Cedric the Entertainer]]<br>Frank: [[Stephen Root]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = Carl: ''[[Embolotherium]]''<br>Frank: ''[[Megacerops|Brontops]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Black\n| lbl3               = Skin\n| data3              = Gray\n}}\n'''Carl''' and '''Frank''' are an ''[[Embolotherium]]'' and a ''[[Megacerops|Brontops]]'' respectively. Carl had thick lips and a thick horn, while Frank had more pointed lips and a thinner horn. They referred to Sid as an overgrown weasel.\n\nThe two appeared at the beginning of the film when Sid the [[ground sloth]] was shown stepping on their salad and eating an important part of it, the [[dandelion]]. The two animals soon chased after him in the hopes of killing him, but were stopped forcefully by Manny the mammoth, by being hurled through the air. They'd held a powerful grudge against Sid for what he'd done and when they next saw him, he was in the same hot mud pool that they were in and was erroneously referring to them as ladies. Again, Carl and Frank stampeded after the hapless sloth, but were waylaid when they saw that he had already been \"killed\" by a saber-toothed cat named Diego (which was part of Sid's plan to get them to be fooled into leaving him alone and not trying to kill him off) and gave up their chase post-haste stating that \"carnivores have all the fun.\" Carl and Frank aren't seen again after this.\n\n===Jennifer and Rachel===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Jennifer and Rachel\n| voice              = Jennifer: [[Lorri Bagley]]<br>Rachel: [[Jane Krakowski]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Jennifer: [[Blue]]<br>Rachel: [[Green]]\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Jennifer: [[Violet (color)|Violet]] with [[black]] hair<br>Rachel: [[Pink]] with [[blond]] hair\n}}\n'''Jennifer''' and '''Rachel''' are two ''Megalonyx'' from the first film.\n\nThe two were shown being sweet-talked by Sid to impress them while he had the baby Roshan in tow. Jennifer admitted that she found some of Sid's qualities to be most attractive, and when Sid left, the two spoke to each other on how, despite his lack of good looks, he was a family-type.\n\nThese two female sloths (in a deleted scene from the film) were shown scorning Sid when he was shown to simply be using the baby to mate with them, though Rachel was much more straightforward as she kicked him directly in the groin while calling him \"''pig''\".\n\nJennifer was a thickset dark-blue sloth with short curly hair and a medium-sized nose. Rachel was considerably thinner and had light tan fur and a blonde ponytail directly at the top of her head and a smaller nose.\n\n===Sylvia===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sylvia\n| voice              = [[Kristen Johnston]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = [[Green]]\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = [[Red]] with red hair\n}}\n'''Sylvia''' is a female Megalonyx who was cut from the first film, but can be found in the deleted scenes of the 2-Disc DVD release as well as the film-to-book adaptation.\n\nSylvia wanted Sid to travel with her, for she was seeking commitment. Sid, not wanting any of this, put her in the path of some running glyptodonts to send her off. Sylvia eventually found him again, and was still adamant to go migrating with him. Sid tricked her into thinking that he was getting turnips for their migration, and then ran off to escape, but she followed him into the jaws of Diego, the saber-toothed cat. She did not believe that Sid was truly dead, and sullenly told Diego to \"eat him\". It is presumed that after that, she left Sid alone. Sylvia had red-colored fur, green eyes and a small nose.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentaries, Sylvia was cut because the scriptwriters felt that Sid's behavior towards her made him too unlikable, and that her scenes detracted from the film's main plot. Additionally, the first movie had a different ending planned out. Sid and Manny headed south without Diego (due to his death, which was changed) and met up with the other animals. Sid had matured after witnessing Diego's death, and upon seeing Sylvia for the third time, was nicer to her, even asking her to be his mate.\n\nSylvia was cut from the movie fairly late. Most of her scenes were completely animated and rendered, and she was seen in the first few trailers of the movie as well as the initial posters.\n\n==Appearing in ''Ice Age: The Meltdown''==\n\n===Fast Tony===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Fast Tony\n| voice              = [[Jay Leno]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Holmesina]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Shell\n| data3              = Blue-gray\n| lbl4               = Skin\n| data4              = Peach\n}}\nA [[Holmesina]] living in the days of the Ice Age, '''Fast Tony''' was a [[peddler]] trying to give off items such as reeds and bark to other denizens of the Ice Age so as to escape the world's end, which by chance, he predicted and it came true. Fast Tony would give off products in exchange for whatever the other animals would bring by with the help of his \"''assistant''\", an insipid [[glyptodon]] named Stu. He was notoriously amoral with others, even being criticized by Manny for willing to sell off ''\"his own mother for a [[grape]]\"''. Fast Tony immediately asked if that was an offer, then pretended he had not thought of it for the benefit of the watching animals.\n\nStu was more Fast Tony's guinea pig to prove their wares' worth, rather than his actual partner and proved more useful dead than alive, as Fast Tony had taken Stu's shell (as Stu had just been killed by Maelstrom and Cretaceous) and shamelessly tried to pawn it off to other animals as a personal \"''mobile home''\".\n\nFast Tony was last seen at the end of ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' using Stu's shell as a raft.\n\n====Stu====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Stu\n| voice              = [[Tom Fahn]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Glyptodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Shell\n| lbl4               = Skin\n}}\n'''Stu''' was a ''Glyptodon'' who was Fast Tony's partner. He seemed to be disliked by Tony due to his stupid personality. He assisted Fast Tony to warn the valley that the dam of ice would burst and helped to demonstrate Fast Tony's snorkel. After the revelation of the flood was proved to be true, Stu took the test snorkel and used it to swim underwater. Shortly after scaring James, a young anteater, Stu was grabbed and pulled underwater by an unknown attacker. As the other animals begin to leave, Fast Tony returns to the pool to get Stu to come along, but Stu's shell is suddenly spat out of the water by the unknown assailant. Fast Tony, after looking at the shell, sees that it makes a great mobile home and runs off after the other animals to try and unload it on someone. Meanwhile, the unknown attackers turn out to be the marine reptiles Cretaceous and Maelstrom. In the ending after the flood, Fast Tony is discovered to have been using the shell as a boat, but he leaves the shell behind as he no longer needs it. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mr. and Mrs. Start===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Mr. and Mrs. Start\n| voice              = Mr. Start: [[Joseph Bologna]]<br>Mrs. Start: [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Palaeotherium|Start]]\n}}\n'''Mr. and Mrs. Start''' are two Starts that are shown resting at the Glacier Water Park where they complain about the heat.

He acts as the voice that warns the other animals of the dangers coming soon due to the valley where they reside flooding up with water. The Lone Gunslinger only warns them of the danger and little else, rather hoping that one or two of the animals leaving will die, furnishing food for him and the other vultures which he is presumably family and friends with.\n\nAs he watches all of the creatures in the valley leave to safety, he makes cryptic statements with his Teratornis friends about it and this escalades to the point of singing a musical number on how much they plotted to eat the other animals.\n\nThe Lone Gunslinger was last shown flying over the \"boat\" full of escaping animals and making provocative remarks.\n\nIn the storybook version, he and his fellow Teratornis were shown to be feasting on Cretaceous and Maelstrom's corpses.\n\n===Cretaceous===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Cretaceous\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Cymbospondylus]]<ref name=\"TEG\">''Ice Age: The Essential Guide''</ref>{{rp|39}}\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Yellow with red pupils\n| lbl3               = Scales\n| data3              = Iris (purple-blue)\n}}\n'''Cretaceous''' is an [[Cymbospondylus]].

The ice melted, releasing both him and Maelstrom into the lake which was all but abandoned by most animals. When they made it to the ice lake, the first animal that they had encountered and eaten was Stu, leaving behind only his shell. The two sea reptiles then swam further down the series of rivers where they eventually reached Manny's herd as well as Crash, Eddie, and Ellie. Cretaceous made a great lunge at Manny, but was caught on his tusks, only to be flung far off, hitting a piece of ice and falling back into the water.\n\nLater, when the dam broke, the two reptiles went swimming on the wall of water that was slowly approaching towards the escaping masses and pulled down Manny when he was swimming to save Ellie. Manny devised a plan to rid himself of the two sea reptiles, by having them try to chase him, he tricked them into hitting a log that was wedged under a large rock.

Angry that something had attempted to take his acorn. Scrat seized another piranha and used it to hit at others, fighting and kicking the fish away, stunning them all. As one attempted to edge back to the water, Scrat stomped on its side, forcing it to release an acorn that is held.\n\nIn [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs|Ice Age 3]], a school of piranha met a baby [[Tyrannosaurus]] (one of Momma's babies that had been kidnapped by Sid) and bared their teeth at it.

Rudy appears to have held a grudge ever since, especially since the impact left behind a crack in his mouth which prevented any new teeth from growing. (Note: Rudy is constantly mistaken for a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and although he has features of both species, the filmmakers have directly stated he is a ''Baryonyx''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}) Rudy first appears when he attacks Sid and chases him onto a rock floating over Lava Falls, and later attacks Sid and company full force as they are about to exit the jungle. The group quickly proves to be no match for the ''Baryonyx'', but are saved by Momma, who knocks him off of a cliff. Rudy survives, however, and he and Buck continue their eternal war. Rudy is last seen roaring in frustration as Buck is riding on top of the massive dinosaur laughing, as Rudy runs through the jungle.\n\nBuck and Rudy made a brief cameo in the following film ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''.\n\n===Johnny===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Johnny\n| voice              = [[Christian Pikes]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Aardvark]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Reddish-brown\n}}\n'''Johnny''' is a young aardvark who is swallowed whole and alive by Egbert. Johnny's mother demands that Sid, currently posing as the young dinosaurs' father orders the dinosaur to return her son or else they will leave the playground. Johnny was not found just then; instead a young ''[[Gastornis]]'', named Madison, is brought up. But then Manny and Ellie come by. Egbert got scared, and immediately regurgitated Johnny. His mother promptly drags him off. He is referred to by Sid and his mother as \"Little Johnny\".\n\n===Johnny's Mother===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Unknown\n| voice              = [[Maile Flanagan]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Aardvark]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Reddish-brown\n}}\nThe '''unnamed mother''' of Johnny.

She was among the village of animals that reacted to Ellie's false alarm of her pregnancy. When Sid commented on the beaver mom's pregnancy, the beaver mom angrily tells Sid that she is not pregnant and snapped a stick to hit Sid with it. When the beaver mom's young child ventured into the playground that Manny had built, she called out Sid over the fact that the three ''Tyrannosaurus'' children were picking on her child.

Sid took them away from their [[List of Ice Age characters#Momma|mother]], but she came searching for them and took Sid away with them, then she later became friends with Sid at the end of the movie. They are very friendly dinosaurs, but due to being carnivores, they go too far in playing with other animals which eventually winds up with one of them eating a couple of the kids. Despite knowing that Sid isn't their real father, they still loved and care for him to a point of protecting him from their angry mother.

After returning to the Plates of Woe, the pterosaur flew away after Buck asked if it had \"ever thought of settling down and starting a family\".\n\nRoger's gender is unspecified in the film, but it is referred to as a female in the video game adaption.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Other dinosaurs===\nAmong the other dinosaurs that live in the underground valley are ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' (which is depicted with a long neck like a ''[[Miragaia longicollum]]''), ''[[Iguanodon]]'', ''[[Troodon]]'', ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', ''[[Chasmosaurus]]'', ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', ''[[Guanlong]]'' and the [[pterosaur]]s ''[[Harpactognathus]]'' and ''[[Cearadactylus]]'' (the filmmakers refer to them as \"[[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]]\" and \"pterosaur\" respectively).

Among its members are:\n\n====Captain Gutt====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Captain Gutt\n| voice              = [[Peter Dinklage]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Brown and Gray\n}}\n\n{{Overly detailed|date=July 2016|section=yes}}\n\n'''Gutt''' is a ''[[Gigantopithecus]]'' who is a self-styled master and [[Piracy|pirate]] captain of the high seas. His name is based on the long sharpened fingernails that he uses to \"[[disembowelment|gut]]\" his enemies. He is the main antagonist of the fourth film. He captures Manny, Sid, Diego, Scrat, and Granny and attempts to make them part of his crew. His friendly demeanor quickly vanishes when Manny refuses; he throws the mammoth and his friends overboard, and furiously vows revenge when they destroy his ship and bounty during their escape.\n\nGutt enslaves a population of hyraxes to build a new ship for him, and also strips Shira of her rank as first mate when she reveals she did not attack Manny, giving her position to Squint. Gutt leads his crew to battle against the unenslaved hyraxes, only for the hyraxes to be revealed as a distraction while Manny steals his new ship. Enraged, Gutt quickly forges a new ship out of a wall of ice, propelled by his legion of [[narwhal]]s. Gutt arrives at Manny's home, and takes Ellie, Peaches, and the other animals hostage.\n\nManny turns himself in to free his wife and daughter, but Gutt goes back on his word, stating that Manny took everything he had from him and the evil captain intended to do the same. However, the timely arrival of Louis, Peaches' friend, sparks a fierce battle between the pirates and Manny's herd. Gutt tries to fight Manny along with Raz, but Diego fights Gutt himself. Gutt chases Diego up a tree on the herd's ship, and knocks the sabertooth down with the rest of herd. Gutt corners the herd, but he and his pirates are defeated by Granny's pet whale Precious.\n\nGutt is swift enough to dodge Precious' blasts while Squint, Raz, Flynn, Dobson, Silas, and Gupta are knocked onto the side of their ship and into the sea; Gutt escapes and leaves his crew behind. He is about to kill Ellie when Peaches knocks him onto the back of the ice. He then leaps at Manny and refuses to let him return to his family. A new landmass emerges and launches the iceberg that the two are standing on into the air.\n\nGutt battles Manny with his two swords, stating that \"the sea isn't big enough\" for the two of them. Manny charges into Gutt, knocking him down, but Gutt is able to push the mammoth off of him. Manny charges again, but Gutt swings on a number of vines to catch up to the floe; Manny follows. Gutt pushes Manny onto the front of the floe and grabs a log to finish him off, but Manny jumps onto the back of the floe, which launches Gutt off the floe. Manny catches the log and hits Gutt, sending the evil ape flying out of fight.\n\nHe lands in a cave river and grabs a piece of ice to float on the water; he notices fins sticking out of the water, and is shortly after eaten offscreen by a siren posing as a female ''Gigantopithecus''.\n\n'''Note''': [[Jeremy Renner]] was originally set to voice the character, but was replaced by [[Peter Dinklage]] due scheduling conflicts involving ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]''. Captain Gutt was initially written as a [[bear]], but designer Peter DeS\u00e8ve had a hard time designing an ursine villain, and thus instead designed him as a more versatile primate.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====Flynn====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Flynn\n| voice              = [[Nick Frost]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Elephant seal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = Gray\n}}\n'''Flynn''' is a large English [[elephant seal]] (appearing to be just as big as or even bigger than Manny in the film) who makes his first appearance in [[Scrat's Continental Crack-up|the second part of Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]. His lack of intelligence is the source of comic relief throughout the film. Flynn likes to eat [[fruit]], and calls the song titled \"Master of the Seas\" a [[sea shanty]]. When the pirates first encounter Manny's herd, Flynn inadvertently gives them directions to return to the continent, much to Gutt's exasperation. The seal then joined the attack on the herd, squashing Sid underneath his bulk. When Manny's herd destroys the ship, leaving the pirates to drift at sea, Flynn initially panics at the prospect of [[drowning]], but is reminded by an annoyed Gutt that he is able to swim. Flynn worries about Shira when Gutt leaves her for dead, but he later propels the pirates to land aboard a small raft made of ice.\n\nIn the final battle, Flynn and Gupta corner Sid and Granny, only for the latter to summon Precious, sending the pirates running in fear. Flynn rejoins the battle against Manny, but is defeated when Precious blasts him with water.\n\n====Raz====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Raz\n| voice              = [[Rebel Wilson]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Procoptodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Grayish white with Violet stripes\n}}\n'''Raz''' is an Australian ''[[Procoptodon]]'' who serves as the crew's resident weapons and artillery expert, hiding an arsenal of deadly bone swords in her pouch and using her powerful legs to launch projectiles at enemies by kicking them.\n\nIn the final melee against Manny's herd, she battles Manny herself, until she is blasted away by Precious.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Silas====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Silas\n| voice              = [[Alain Chabat]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Petrel]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Feather colour\n| data3              = Grey, with blue feet\n}}\n'''Silas''' is a [[petrel]] from the south of France with the feet of a [[blue-footed booby]] who usually scouts out for trouble ahead of the pirates.

He is overconfident, somewhat psychotic, and dislikes being called adorable; he is berated many times by Gutt and Shira for trying to assume authority over the crew. Squint holds a rivalry with Shira, which reaches its climax when Squint becomes Gutt's new first mate after Gutt insults Shira for failing to kill Manny and his herd.\n\nIn the final battle, Squint attempts to attack Shira as she is trying to free Ellie, but Shira mocks Squint's 'adorable nose', which agitates him and allows Ellie to stomp on him.\n\nSquint later resurfaces in ''[[Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade]]'' where Squint wanted revenge on the Herd.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Dobson====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Dobson\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Metridiochoerus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Red/Violet & Brownish Gray\n}}\n'''Dobson''' is a ''[[Metridiochoerus]]'', who speaks in growls, oinks, and other pig noises (although he appeared to be singing along with the crew in the \"Master of the Seas\" musical sequence). He teams up with Raz in firing the cannons, loading them with chunks of ice for Raz to fire with her powerful kangaroo legs, and leaps down onto the heroes's ship with her to corner Manny. Dobson later takes part in the final battle, fighting Crash and Eddie \"rodeo-style\", and is able to charge into Manny and knock him into the other ship along with Shira.

In the climax of the film, Gupta and Flynn corner Sid and Granny, but are scared off by Granny's pet whale Precious.

When Peaches sees she has hurt her friend's feelings, and that Ethan and his group are lacking in common sense, she decides to leave. Ethan rudely remarks that \"it's bad enough her family is half-possum\", angering Peaches. Ethan, unlike his posse, seems to be at least partially rational, and might have felt guilt from hurting Peaches' feelings.\n\nAfter Louis helps to save Peaches, Ethan and his group are impressed by his bravery.

Later, Granny and Sid use her like a submarine to fight with the pirates.\n\nLarge, even for a whale, Precious was the beloved pet of Granny, who was always seen throwing food into the ocean when she was near it.

Her blowhole was shown as being capable of delivering a nasty attack to the pirates, and she was able to swallow Manny to prevent him from falling in the sea.\n\n===Hyraxes===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Hyraxes\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Hyrax]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Varying\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Varying\n}}\n'''Hyraxes''' have only been seen in ''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' and ''Ice Age: Collision Course''.\n\nThey are first seen being forced to work as slaves by Captain Gutt, as they are used to load Gutt's treasure onboard and are even used to swab the deck as part of a mop.\n \nManny, Sid and Diego encounter the hyraxes that were not enslaved during a short trek on a deserted island in the jungle. Though somewhat wary of the visitors, the hyraxes quickly warm up to the Sub-Zero Heroes. Manny feels that, if the hyraxes helped them, they could defeat the pirates; unfortunately, the hyraxes are unable to comprehend English and misinterpret Manny's request as asking for food. Eventually, Sid is able to communicate to them that an alliance is necessary if the other hyraxes are to be freed and the pirates are to be defeated, much to the surprise of Manny and Diego. The lead hyrax (distinguished by his bushy eyebrows, lighter fur coloration, and lower voice tone), who hates Gutt with a passion, rallies his forces and decides to help the herd, much to the herd's delight.\n \nDuring the attack on the pirates, the lead hyrax spearheads a cavalry attack, followed by a dive bombing rescue, which is a diversion used to trick the pirates into leaving the slave hyraxes and their ship unguarded while the herd frees the captives and overtakes the ship. The enslaved hyraxes take an immense liking to Diego after he frees them.\n \nAs the heroes escape on Gutt's new ship, the hyraxes fashion small ice boats, which they use to sail away to a new home in South America, taunting the pirates as they leave.\n \nThe hyraxes are last seen in South America, where they have made a new home and have even carved a hyrax-sized replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]], welcoming the other animals.\n\n===Pirate rats===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = '''Pirates'''\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Rat]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Varying\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Dark gray\n}}\nA number of ''' pirate rats''' (or '''pie-rats''') made their homes on the \"ship\" of Captain Gutt, actually a giant iceberg carved into a seaworthy vessel with Gutt at its helm and a number of other animals as its crew. The rats subsided more or less well off with Gutt on board, though one of them suffered Gutt's annoyance when it was caught mocking his apish movements and thus picked up by the ape and flung off the ship.\n \nLater, once a number of seaborne mammals accidentally broke down Gutt's vessel, the rats abandoned ship, escaping into the waters below, with at least one pushed out forcefully by Scrat, another mammal taken hostage by Gutt.\n\n===Giant crab===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Giant crab\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Crab]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Greyish-Blue\n| lbl3               = Shell colour\n| data3              = Blue, red, and faded purple\n}}\nThe '''giant [[crab]]''' is a minor character in the fourth film. The giant crab was seen aboard Manny, Diego and Sid's \"ship\" during a storm. After trying to escape, Sid was trapped on the edge of the floating land. The crab tried to attack him, but it noticed a giant wave heading towards them; Sid, noticing it too, clutched onto the crab's leg in a terrified trance. As soon as the wave was gone, Sid tried to thank the giant crab for saving his life, but was horrified to see only its leg remaining, with leg then being blown away by the wind.\n\n==Appearing in ''Ice Age: Collision Course''==\n\n===Dino-Bird Family===\nThe '''Dino-Bird Family''' is a family of ''Bird-like [[Dromaeosauridae|Dromaeosaurid]]'' ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' that first appear in ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]''.

While they were determined to stop Buck at the time he was assisting the Herd from combating the threat of an asteroid, they end up giving up on targeting Buck and help the Herd in stopping the asteroid and later attended Peaches' wedding.\n\n====Gavin====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gavin\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' (2016)\n| voice              = [[Nick Offerman]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| species            = Bird-like [[Dromaeosaur|Dromaeosauridae]]\n}}\n'''Gavin''' is a tough-as-nails and misguided dromaeosaur who is part of an extended family of \"flying birds\" and the former main [[antagonist]] of the film.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Gertie====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gertie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' (2016)\n| voice              = [[Stephanie Beatriz]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| species            = Bird-like Dromaeosaur\n}}\n'''Gertie''' is a posh and foxy dromaeosaur who is part of an extended family of \"flying birds\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Roger====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Roger\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' (2016)\n| voice              = [[Max Greenfield]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| species            = Bird-like Dromaeosaur\n}}\n'''Roger''' is a freaky and cowardly young dromaeosaur who is part of an extended family of \"flying birds.\"\n{{clear}}\n\n===Shangri Llama===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Shangri Llama\n| voice              = [[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| species            = [[Llama]]\n}}\n'''Shangri Llama''' is the spiritual leader of Geotopia.

The song became her first single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at No. 83. She had a series of singles that charted low on the Hot 100 between 1970 and 1975.

Abortion related laws were drafted by the legislature by the end of the 1900s.\u00a0 These laws would be addressed in court during the 1800s as they related to application in prosecutions of women for having abortions. During the 1940s, hospitals created committees to approve abortion requests with the goal of trying to reduce the number of abortions performed at them.\n\nThe number of abortion clinics in the state has been on the decline in recent years, going from 100 in 1982 to 88 in 1992 to 41 in 2014.\u00a0State funding through Medicaid was available for poor women needing abortions, with 10,277 state funded abortions in 2010.\u00a0 There were 24,454 legal abortions performed in 2014,\u00a0going up to 48,110 abortions in New Jersey in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-new-jersey|title=State Facts About Abortion: New Jersey|date=2016-01-26|website=Guttmacher Institute|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>.

Wade'':<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Katie|date=20 Dec 2019|title=Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|url=https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-we-should-stop-using-term-elective-abortion/2018-12|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics|doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175|accessdate=17 May 2019|pmid=30585581|volume=20|pages=E1175-1180|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAnti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Pam|last2=Hardisty|first2=Jean|year=2007|title=The Importance of the Political 'Framing' of Abortion|url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v14n1/ReproPatriarch-07.html|journal=The Public Eye Magazine|volume=14|issue=1}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/weekinreview/05greenhouse.html?scp=1&sq=infanticide \"The Roberts Court Takes on Abortion\".] ''New York Times.''

(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.

However, in recent years a redevelopment and revitalization plan has been drafted by the Borough Council.\n\n=== Key To The City ===\nHoutzdale in 2019 introduced the [[Key to the City (disambiguation)|Key to the City]] award for outstanding members of the Houtzdale Community and surrounding area. Although the Borough is not a city, the council thought that there needed to be some award for acts of good that are done in the borough. The award was given prior to 2019, however there was no official stance by the council to use this award often. The award was given twice in the first year, and the council looks forward to seeing it given more often. The award can be given to one person or a group of people, however only one key is presented to the recipient whether it be a group or single individual.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Recipients of The Key to the City\n!Name\n!Date\n|-\n!Previous Awards\n|\n|-\n|Houtzdale Doller General Store (grand opening)\n|\n|-\n!2019\n|\n|-\n|Aaron Wonderling\n|May 5, 2019 \n|-\n|Members of the Houtzdale Legion Honor Guard\n|July 25, 2019\n|}\n\n==Government==\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe borough council consists of 7 members, who are elected in the general elections. They serve four (4) year terms with seats coming available every 2 years. There are no wards within the borough so each member serves the people in an at large position.\n\nThe council is currently headed by President Jessie Lamison and Vice-President James Love. Other members include Micheal Tomko, James Twoey, Lanny Shaffer, Merle Hayward, and Zachary Bloom.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Current Council Members\n!Name\n!Elected or Appointed\n!Council Member Since\n!Number of Terms\n!Start Year of Current Term\n!Seat up for Election\n|-\n|Zachary Bloom\n|Elected\n|2016\n|2\n|2018\n|2021 to start 2022\n|-\n|James Twoey\n|Elected\n|2014\n|2\n|2018\n|2021 to start 2022\n|-\n|James Love\n|Elected\n|2007\n|4\n|2020\n|2023 to start 2024\n|-\n|Merle Heywood\n|Elected\n|2012\n|3\n|2020\n|2023 to start 2024\n|-\n|Jesse Lamison\n|Elected\n|2012\n|3\n|2020\n|2023 to start 2024\n|-\n|Lanny Shaffer\n|Elected\n|2014\n|2\n|2018\n|2021 to start 2022\n|-\n|Mike Tomko\n|Elected\n|2014\n|2\n|2018\n|2021 to start 2022\n|}\n\n=== Mayors ===\nThe town also has an elected mayor. This position is mainly ceremonial at the current time due to lacking responsibilities. The position is a four (4) year term. The position is currently held by Izen Lingenfelter who was elected in 2019 for a term starting January 2020.\n\nPrior to an unknown date, it is believed that the title of \"Chief Burgess\" was used instead of \"Mayor.\" From the minutes and ordinances of the Borough, it seems as though the position and duties of the Chief Burgess were similar if not identical to todays position and duties of the Mayor.\n\n==== Mayoral Election of 2017 ====\nIn the primary election of 2017, incumbent Camille \"Bud\" George was voted onto the November General Election ballot. On September 1st of that year, Mr. George passed away at the age of 89. The proximity of his passing to the General Election meant that the Council had little to no time to remove his name from the ballot. It was due to this that on November 7, his name appeared as an option. When all the votes were counted, Camille George had a narrow winning margin, thus a problem arose. There were however two write-in campaigns which had taken place. Robert Hanna and John Bumbarger had both placed there hat in the ring by standing at the polling place on election day. Between these two individuals, Robert Hanna had the most votes. In the event that a mayoral seat is not filled, the Pennsylvania Borough Code allows for the Borough Council to appoint someone to the position. Since Robert Hanna had come in second only to Camille George, it was decided by Council that he should take the seat. Council Member Zachary Bloom was quoted as saying, \"We saw a lot of people pay tribute to the memory of Mr. George. We also saw the people choose the new mayor, in our opinion, by voting like they did for Mr. Hanna.\" The council appointed Robert Hanna by unanimous vote in 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Chief Burgesses\n!Name\n!From\n!To\n|-\n|P.

This position is mainly ceremonial at the current time due to lacking responsibilities. The position is a four (4) year term. The position is currently held by Izen Lingenfelter who was elected in 2019 for a term starting January 2020. \n\nPrior to an unknown date, it is believed that the title of \"Chief Burgess\" was used instead of \"Mayor.\" From the minutes and ordinances of the Borough, it seems as though the position and duties of the Chief Burgess were similar if not identical to todays position and duties of the Mayor. \n\n==== Mayoral Election of 2017 ====\nIn the primary election of 2017, incumbent Camille \"Bud\" George was voted onto the November General Election ballot. On September 1st of that year, Mr. George passed away at the age of 89. The proximity of his passing to the General Election meant that the Council had little to no time to remove his name from the ballot. It was due to this that on November 7th, his name appeared as an option. When all the votes were counted, Camille George had a narrow winning margin, thus a problem arose. There were however two write-in campaigns which had taken place. Robert Hanna and John Bumbarger had both placed there hat in the ring by standing at the polling place on election day. Between these two individuals, Robert Hanna had the most votes. In the event that a mayoral seat is not filled, the Pennsylvania Borough Code allows for the Borough Council to appoint someone to the position. Since Robert Hanna had come in second only to Camille George, it was decided by Council that he should take the seat. Council Member Zachary Bloom was quoted as saying, \"We saw a lot of people pay tribute to the memory of Mr. George. We also saw the people choose the new mayor, in our opinion, by voting like they did for Mr. Hanna.\" The council appointed Robert Hanna by unanimous vote in 2018.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Chief Burgesses\n!Name\n!From\n!To\n|-\n|P.

[[Sam Houston]], leader of the Texans in their war for independence from Mexico. After the Chartiers Valley Railroad was completed through that section in 1871, David C. Houston, a son of Daniel Houston, saw the possibilities of a town at that point and laid out the present plan of Houstonville. The first house in the new town was completed in the summer of 1871 by A. T. Haft and the second by J. C. Johnson. A few years later H. E. Riggle laid out a plan adjoining which was called Riggletown.  On May 13, 1901, The Borough of Houston was incorporated from land of Chartiers & North Strabane Townships.\n\n==In Popular Culture==\n\nA notable reference of Houston's contribution to pop culture would be that it was one of the main filming locations<ref>{{Citation|title=The Prince of Pennsylvania (1988) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095903/locations|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> for the 1988 film [[The Prince of Pennsylvania]] starring [[Keanu Reeves]].

[[Sam Houston]], leader of the Texans in their war for independence from Mexico. After the Chartiers Valley Railroad was completed through that section in 1871, David C. Houston, a son of Daniel Houston, saw the possibilities of a town at that point and laid out the present plan of Houstonville. The first house in the new town was completed in the summer of 1871 by A. T. Haft and the second by J. C. Johnson. A few years later H. E. Riggle laid out a plan adjoining which was called Riggletown.  On May 13, 1901, The Borough of Houston was incorporated from land of Chartiers & North Strabane Townships.\n\n==In Popular Culture==\n\nA notable reference of Houston's contribution to pop culture would be that it was one of the main filming locations<ref>{{Citation|title=The Prince of Pennsylvania (1988) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095903/locations|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> for the 1988 film [[The Prince of Pennsylvania]] starring [[Keanu Reeves]].
