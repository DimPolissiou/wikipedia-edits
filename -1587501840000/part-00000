He was the son of William and Mary (Cosby) Callis.  His mother was third in descent from William Overton and Mary Waters.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">https://books.google.com/books?id=SJcsAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA385</ref>\n\nHis mother's first cousin was [[Dabney Carr (Virginia assemblyman)|Dabney Carr]], a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and his wife, Martha Jefferson.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Martha was the sister of President [[Thomas Jefferson]] and she was also a cousin of William's second wife, Anne Price. Martha's mother was [[Jane Randolph Jefferson|Jane Randolph]], daughter of [[Isham Randolph of Dungeness|Isham Randolph]], a ship's captain and sometime planter, first cousin to [[Peyton Randolph]], and granddaughter of wealthy [[English people|English]] gentry. Martha's father was [[Peter Jefferson]], a planter and surveyor in [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] (Shadwell, then [[Edge Hill, Virginia|Edge Hill]], [[Virginia]].) He was of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent. When Colonel [[William Randolph]], an old friend of Peter Jefferson, died in 1745, Peter assumed executorship and personal charge of William Randolph's estate in [[Tuckahoe Plantation|Tuckahoe]] as well as his infant son, [[Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr.]] That year the Jeffersons relocated to Tuckahoe where they would remain for the next seven years before returning to their home in Albemarle. Peter Jefferson was then appointed to the Colonelcy of the county, an important position at the time.<ref name=\"HSR\"/>\n\nDabney and Martha were the parents of [[Dabney Carr]] and nephew of [[Dabney S. Carr|Dabney Smith Carr]], who was a newspaper publisher and later was U.S. Minister to Turkey (1843\u201349).\n\nIn 1774, he was tutored, along with James Madison and James Monroe, by Parson John Todd who established in his home near Ochid the first classical school in [[Louisa County, Virginia|Louisa County]]. With Monroe, Callis entered the [[College of William & Mary]] at age 17; he left college in late 1775 to join the [[Continental Army]].\n\n==Marriage and family==\nHe married first, about 1783, Martha Elizabeth Winston (June 21, 1765 - April 29, 1788). They were the parents of three children.\n\nHe married, as his second wife, on May 4, 1790 in [[Louisa County, Virginia]], Anne Price.<ref>http://www.trevilians.com/others/callis1.htm</ref> She was born on November 4, 1774 at \"Cool Water\", Hanover County, Virginia and died on September 8, 1846 at [[Doswell, Virginia|Doswell]], [[Hanover County, Virginia]]. They were the parents of nine children.\n\nShe was the daughter of Captain Thomas Randolph Price, who served as an officer in the [[Virginia militia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was a participant in the [[Gunpowder Incident]] and Barbara Overton \"Betsy\" Winston. Barbara was a first cousin of Martha Elizabeth Winston, the first wife of William Overton Callis.\n\nAnne was a descendant of Cicely Wilford and the [[Most Reverend]] Dr. [[Edwin Sandys (archbishop)|Edwin Sandys]], an [[Anglican]] church leader who successively held the posts of the [[Bishop of Worcester]] (1559\u20131570), [[Bishop of London]] (1570\u20131576), and the [[Archbishop of York]] (1576\u20131588); Sir [[George Barne III]] (1532- d. 1593), the [[Lord Mayor of London]] and a prominent merchant and public official from London during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]]; [[William Randolph]] (bapt. November 7, 1650 \u2013 April 11, 1711) was a colonist and land owner who played an important role in the history and government of the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]]. He and his wife, Mary Isham, are referred to as \"the Adam and Eve of Virginia\"; [[Richard Lovelace]], an English poet in the seventeenth century and [[Francis Lovelace]] (1621\u20131675), who was the second governor of the [[Province of New York|New York]] colony appointed by the [[Duke of York]], later King [[James II of England]].\n\nAnne was the great great great granddaughter of Captain Thomas Todd who married Elizabeth Bernard making her a cousin of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. Thomas and Elizabeth were also the great great grandparents of President James Madison.<ref>In 1664 Thomas Todd came from England and settled in Ware Parish, Gloucester Co., Va., bringing with him his wife and one or two children born in England. He was a ship master and died at sea in 1676. His wife was Ann Gorsuch, dau, of Rev. John Gorsuch, Rector of Walkham, Hertfordshire and his wife Anne, dau. of [[Richard Lovelace|Sir William Lovelace]]. Their children were Thomas, Christopher, James, William, Philip, Joanna, Anne, Frances and Isabella. One of the descendants of Capt. Thomas Todd, the eldest child, was the distinguished jurist, [[Thomas Todd]] of Kentucky, who after filling the highest judicial offices in that State was appointed by President Jefferson one of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, and held that office from 1807 till his death in 1824. His abilities and character won him the personal friendship of Chief Justice Marshall, and of the foremost men in the country. His eldest son, Charles Scott Todd was graduated at William and Mary College, practiced law in Frankfort, Ky. In the war of 1812 he was appointed Secretary of State of Kentucky by Gov. Madison; he was sent on a confidential mission to Colombia by the United States Government in 1820, and was appointed minister to Russia by President Tyler in 1841.\n\nJudge Todd's second wife was Lucy Payne sister of Mrs. President Madison; but when he married her she was the widow of George Steptoe Washington, youngest son (by the fourth of his five wives,) of Samuel Washington, brother of George Washington first President of the United States. Isabella the youngest child of Capt. Thomas Todd the immigrant, married John Madision the son of a wealthy planter of the same name, who was the original immigrant of that family. They had two sons, Ambrose and John, the latter was the father of the Right Rev. James Madison, President of William and Mary College, and first Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Virginia, and of his brother George Madison, Gov. of Kentucky. Ambrose married Frances Taylor sister of Zachary Taylor, who was the grandfather of Gen. Zachary Taylor, the thirteenth President of the United States. The wife of President Madison was Dorothea (commonly called Dolly) Payne, though when he married her she was the widow of John Todd, a promising and wealthy young lawyer in Philadelphia. She and her sister Lucy (Judge Todd's second wife) were daughters of John Payne and Mary Coles, a first cousin of Patrick Henry, and grand-daughter of John Payne who came to Virginia early in the eighteenth century, and Anna Fleming, grand-daughter of Sir Thomas Fleming, one of the early settlers of Jamestown, Va. Their family belonged to the society of Friends, and their mother and Grandmother had been as celebrated as they were for beauty and charming manners. The Jefferson and Madison families were very intimate, and as President Jefferson was a widower, and his daughters were married and had duties elsewhere, he was accustomed to ask Mrs. Madison to preside at the social functions in the White House. For President Jefferson's two terms, and for her husband's two terms, therefore, in other words, for sixteen years, she was virtually mistress of the presidential mansion. During her long tenure of this elevated position she became widely known and universally admired and beloved. In some respects she was the most remarkable woman which this country has produced.</ref>\n\n==War service==\nIn November 1775, he became a Private, 1st Regiment, Capt.

He left the war to go to the [[West Indies]] in [[Havana]] and Caracas in 1779 to recuperate.  After recuperating, he re-entered the service, and in December 1780, he was a Captain of Volunteer Troop of Horses in the 4th Virginia Militia.<sup>1</sup>\n\n===At Yorktown===\nMarch 8, 1781 Yorktown\u2014Letter from Capt. James Maxwell to Gov Jefferson described\nhow a plundering party of about 300 British regulars under Col. Dundas were chased from  Yorktown to Newport News by Maj. Callis & Lt.

Thomas Jefferson and described how a plundering party of about 300 British regulars under Col. Dundas were chased from [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] to [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] by Maj. Callis & Lt. Allen with a small force of volunteers.\n\n===Meets Benedict Arnold===\nOn August 1, 1781, having been promoted to Colonel, Callis reported on the fleet in the Portsmouth area to Brig Gen. Weedon at [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]].  Louis L. Kean relates how his great-great-great-grandmother Anne (Price) Callis told her grandchildren that Callis met with Benedict Arnold on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] to arrange for the exchange of prisoners of war. As they waited for the papers to be processed, Arnold asked what would happen if he, Arnold, were taken prisoner. Callis replied, \"Sir, the leg that was wounded in the service of your country would be buried with full military honors. The rest of you, they would hang!\" A footnote in Irving's ''Life of Washington'' (p.&nbsp;286) relates this incident but does not name the officer.\n\n===Aide to General Nelson===\nIn his widow's application for a pension in 1847, she stated her husband acted as aide de camp to Gen. Nelson in 1781 during the period when the British fleet under Adm. Graves was in [[Hampton Roads]] and [[Lord Cornwallis]] was operating by land.\n\n===Lafayette's letter to Jefferson===\n[[File:Banastre-Tarleton-by-Joshua-Reynolds.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Lieutenant-Colonel Banastre Tarleton\" by Sir Joshua Reynolds]]\nIn the ''Virginia Magazine of History'' (V375) was printed a letter from [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Lafayette]] to Governor [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], dated July 1, 1781. Lyons Plantation-- \"I had yesterday the pleasure to see Maj. Callis and am happy to find you have established a chain of liaison between this camp and the seat of government.\" Lafayette mentioned the enemy's retreat from Richmond, and their arrival at Williamsburg. He suggested that he go and fight Cornwallis. His troops had managed to get clear of the smallpox; but his men were deserting to harvest their crops. He suggested arming two corps of volunteers of 120 men each with spears (for lack of better weapons), forming a corp of 150 negro pioneers and a corp of 150 negro wagoners to collect horses and weapons from the countryside. \"Col. Callis is going up for that same affair (equipping a cavalry) and to him I beg leave to refer your excellency.\"\n\nIn 1782, Col. Callis was at the siege of Yorktown with Lafayette for Cornwallis's surrender; he was an aide to Gen. Nelson.\n\n=== Col. Banastre Tarleton ===\nDuring the siege of Yorktown, Capt. Callis was amused when a farmer dashed into the street and grabbed the bridle of the intensely disliked British Col. Tarleton's mount, declaring loudly, \"This here be my horse that the damned Britishers stole\"\u2014and got his horse back. St. George Tucker, in his journal on the siege of Yorktown, corroborated that Capt. Callis was a witness of this incident. This is the hated British officer portrayed in the movie [[The Patriot (2000 film)|''The Patriot'']] (2000).  The character in the movie (Colonel William Tavington) was based on Tarleton as a cruel, sadistic commander who massacred prisoners of war and innocent civilians.\n\nCallis' [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] service was a total of 7 years and 10 months.\n\n== Later life ==\n\n=== Society of Cincinnati ===\nIn early May 1783, Callis became a charter member of the [[Society of Cincinnati]], along with [[George Washington|Gen. Washington]].  In 1787, the Society held its meeting a week before the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] when the [[Articles of Confederation]] was replaced by the Constitution. 21 of the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention were members of the Society. William Overton Callis was one of the 21.\n\n=== Cool Springs ===\nOn December 7, 1785, he bought Cool Springs plantation, comprising {{convert|660|acre|km2}}, from Thomas and Lucy Poindexter for 120 pounds.  It was near the crossroads of [[Cuckoo, Virginia|Cuckoo]].  On January 19, 1788 he bought {{convert|340|acre|km2}} from Robert & Barbara Barrett 25 for 320 pounds.  By 1788, he was the 50th largest land owner, 57th wealthiest land owner, and the 70th largest slave owner in [[Louisa County, Virginia|Louisa County]].  He owned over {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} worth then around 500 pounds.  He owned 15 slaves, 5 horses, and 15 cattle.\n\n==== Constitutional convention and politics ====\nIn 1788, he was a representative from Louisa County to the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]] where they ratified [[United States Constitution]].  Virginia was not necessarily as a whole inclined to ratify.  There were eight representatives, one of which is our subject here, whose constituency was decidedly against ratification.  Callis was persuaded to vote for the ratification against his citizen's opinion.  Had he and the other seven not changed their votes, Virginia would not have ratified the constitution, at least at that vote. (Wm. Writ Henry, Life of Patrick Henry)\n\nHe was a representative to the Virginia General Assembly from Louisa County for 17 years.\n\nCallis was an elector from Virginia in Washington's unanimous election to a second term in 1793.   Until 1800, each elector had two votes.  Callis voted with all the other electors unanimously using one vote for Washington.  His second vote went for Republican George Clinton of New York as did the other electors from Virginia.  Washington won president with 132 votes, but Clinton came in third with 50 votes behind Federalist John Adams (77 votes), who became vice president. George Clinton later became Governor of New York (1777) and ultimately become VP (1805\u20131812) under both Jefferson and Madison.\n\n==== Letters from Thomas Jefferson ====\nDuring the time between serving as the first Secretary of State and as the second vice president on May 8, 1795, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Callis at Cuckoo, requesting him to negotiate the purchase of Nance, a 34-year-old weaver, from Jefferson's brother-in-law Hastings Marks; Jefferson was resuming the business of domestic manufacture and needed a weaver but must pay for her out of next year's crops.  Callis lived less than 40 miles from Monticello.\n\nWhile serving as president, Jefferson responds to a letter from Callis asking Jefferson for a position for Callis' son in the Navy.  \"Washington, July 19,04  In receipt of your letter asking employment in the Navy for your son.  I enclosed it to the Secretary of the Navy.  He is at present at Baltimore.  His answer is that your son can take his station with the midshipmen, and that his first employment will be in one of the gunboats.  You omitted to mention his name, or the warrant would now have been sent.  As I set out for Montecello in six days, it will be shorter for you to address the information to Robert Smith, Secretary of the Navy at Baltimore.  He will forward the warrant and instructions to whatever place you shall direct.  Accept my friendly salutations and assurances of great asteem and respect.  Thos Jefferson\"\n\n==== Retirement, death, and burial ====\nIn 1790, he built his last home, \"Needmore\", in [[Cuckoo, Virginia]] across the road from his ordinary Cuckoo Tavern which he also bought in 1807.  Needmore was a large two-story southern style frame farmhouse.\n\nhttp://www.schutzfamily.us/\n\nIt was at Cuckoo Tavern during the war that Jack Jouett overheard English officers plotting the capture of Gov. Jefferson and the Virginia legislature, then convened at [[Monticello]].  Jouett made the perilous ride over back roads in the dead of night to warn them so they were long gone when the British arrived the next day.\n\nIn 1800, Callis retired from politics.  On March 14, 1814,<ref name=\"GenPage\" /> he died at his Needmore home; he is buried in Fork Episcopal Church Cemetery, Point of Fork, 12566 Old Ridge Road, Doswell, Va [[Hanover County, Virginia]], with his second wife Ann (Price) Callis.  General Nelson's wife is also buried in this cemetery.(3)  The Fork Church is {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and 1/2 mile east of Cool Water.  This church was also that of [[Patrick Henry]], and they were fellow attendees during their lives.\n\nAfter Callis' death in 1814, Needmore was sold four years later in 1818 to Henry Pendleton.  In 1912, it was torn down and replaced by the home of the present Pendleton family.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\nReferences: \n1 \"The History of the Virginia Federal Convention of 1788: With Some Account of the Eminent Virginian of that era who were members of the body.\" by HUGH BLAIR GRIGSBY, LL.D. 1891\n2 \"The Family of William Overton Callis of Louisa County, Virginia\" by Charles R Niehaus 1989\n3 http://www.theforkchurch.org/history.html\n\n[[Virginia Regiment]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Callis, William Overton}}\n[[Category:1756 births]]\n[[Category:1814 deaths]]\n[[Category:Continental Army soldiers]]\n[[Category:People from Urbanna, Virginia]]\n[[Category:People from Hanover County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Continental Army officers from Virginia]]\n[[Category:Randolph family of Virginia]]\n[[Category:American planters]]\n[[Category:College of William & Mary alumni]]\n[[Category:Delegates to the Virginia Ratifying Convention]]\n[[Category:18th-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:Virginia lawyers]]\n[[Category:Hampden\u2013Sydney College alumni]]\n[[Category:Members of the Virginia House of Delegates]]\n[[Category:People from Louisa County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:American democracy activists]]\n[[Category:American Anglicans]]\n[[Category:British North American Anglicans]]\n[[Category:Virginia Federalists]]\n[[Category:18th-century American Episcopalians]]\n[[Category:19th-century American Episcopalians]]\n[[Category:Virginia Democratic-Republicans]]\n[[Category:Virginia colonial people]]\n[[Category:Burials in Virginia]]\n[[Category:American slave owners]]\n[[Category:Christians from Virginia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox officeholder \n|name = William Overton Callis\n|image name=William Overton Callis painted by Lawrence Sully in 1790s.jpg\n|caption= William Overton Callis <br/> by [[Thomas Sully|Lawrence Sully]] (1769\u20131804).\n|birth_date=March 4, 1756\n|birth_place=[[Urbanna, Virginia]], US\n|death_date={{death date and age|1814|3|14|1756|3|4}}\n|death_place=[[Doswell, Virginia]]\n| alma_mater={{hlist|[[Hampden-Sydney College]]|[[College of William & Mary]]}}\n|spouse={{hlist|Martha Elizabeth Winston|Anne Price}}\n|children=   \n|profession={{hlist|[[Politician]]|[[Lawyer]]|[[Soldier]]}}\n|signature=\n|footnotes=\n<!-- Military service -->\n| branch =\n| serviceyears =\n| rank =\n| unit =\n| commands =\n| battles =\n| awards =\n}}\n\n'''William O.

Tarleton's mount, declaring loudly, \"This here be my horse that the damned Britishers stole\"\u2014and got his horse back. St. George Tucker, in his journal on the siege of Yorktown, corroborated that Capt. Callis was a witness of this incident. This is the hated British officer portrayed in the movie [[The Patriot (2000 film)|''The Patriot'']] (2000).  The character in the movie (Colonel William Tavington) was based on Tarleton as a cruel, sadistic commander who massacred prisoners of war and innocent civilians.\n\nCallis' [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] service was a total of 7 years and 10 months.\n\n== Later life ==\n\n=== Society of Cincinnati ===\nIn early May 1783, Callis became a charter member of the [[Society of Cincinnati]], along with [[George Washington|Gen. Washington]].  In 1787, the Society held its meeting a week before the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] when the [[Articles of Confederation]] was replaced by the Constitution. 21 of the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention were members of the Society. William Overton Callis was one of the 21.\n\n=== Cool Springs ===\nOn December 7, 1785, he bought Cool Springs plantation, comprising {{convert|660|acre|km2}}, from Thomas and Lucy Poindexter for 120 pounds.  It was near the crossroads of [[Cuckoo, Virginia|Cuckoo]].  On January 19, 1788 he bought {{convert|340|acre|km2}} from Robert & Barbara Barrett 25 for 320 pounds.  By 1788, he was the 50th largest land owner, 57th wealthiest land owner, and the 70th largest slave owner in [[Louisa County, Virginia|Louisa County]].  He owned over {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} worth then around 500 pounds.  He owned 15 slaves, 5 horses, and 15 cattle.\n\n==== Constitutional convention and politics ====\nIn 1788, he was a representative from Louisa County to the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]] where they ratified [[United States Constitution]].  Virginia was not necessarily as a whole inclined to ratify.  There were eight representatives, one of which is our subject here, whose constituency was decidedly against ratification.  Callis was persuaded to vote for the ratification against his citizen's opinion.  Had he and the other seven not changed their votes, Virginia would not have ratified the constitution, at least at that vote. (Wm. Writ Henry, Life of Patrick Henry)\n\nHe was a representative to the Virginia General Assembly from Louisa County for 17 years.\n\nCallis was an elector from Virginia in Washington's unanimous election to a second term in 1793.   Until 1800, each elector had two votes.  Callis voted with all the other electors unanimously using one vote for Washington.  His second vote went for Republican George Clinton of New York as did the other electors from Virginia.  Washington won president with 132 votes, but Clinton came in third with 50 votes behind Federalist John Adams (77 votes), who became vice president. George Clinton later became Governor of New York (1777) and ultimately become VP (1805\u20131812) under both Jefferson and Madison.\n\n==== Letters from Thomas Jefferson ====\nDuring the time between serving as the first Secretary of State and as the second vice president on May 8, 1795, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Callis at Cuckoo, requesting him to negotiate the purchase of Nance, a 34-year-old weaver, from Jefferson's brother-in-law Hastings Marks; Jefferson was resuming the business of domestic manufacture and needed a weaver but must pay for her out of next year's crops.  Callis lived less than 40 miles from Monticello.\n\nWhile serving as president, Jefferson responds to a letter from Callis asking Jefferson for a position for Callis' son in the Navy.  \"Washington, July 19,04  In receipt of your letter asking employment in the Navy for your son.  I enclosed it to the Secretary of the Navy.  He is at present at Baltimore.  His answer is that your son can take his station with the midshipmen, and that his first employment will be in one of the gunboats.  You omitted to mention his name, or the warrant would now have been sent.  As I set out for Montecello in six days, it will be shorter for you to address the information to Robert Smith, Secretary of the Navy at Baltimore.  He will forward the warrant and instructions to whatever place you shall direct.  Accept my friendly salutations and assurances of great asteem and respect.  Thos Jefferson\"\n\n==== Retirement, death, and burial ====\nIn 1790, he built his last home, \"Needmore\", in [[Cuckoo, Virginia]] across the road from his ordinary Cuckoo Tavern which he also bought in 1807.  Needmore was a large two-story southern style frame farmhouse.\n\nhttp://www.schutzfamily.us/\n\nIt was at Cuckoo Tavern during the war that Jack Jouett overheard English officers plotting the capture of Gov. Jefferson and the Virginia legislature, then convened at [[Monticello]].  Jouett made the perilous ride over back roads in the dead of night to warn them so they were long gone when the British arrived the next day.\n\nIn 1800, Callis retired from politics.  On March 14, 1814,<ref name=\"GenPage\" /> he died at his Needmore home; he is buried in Fork Episcopal Church Cemetery, Point of Fork, 12566 Old Ridge Road, Doswell, Va [[Hanover County, Virginia]], with his second wife Ann (Price) Callis.  General Nelson's wife is also buried in this cemetery.(3)  The Fork Church is {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and 1/2 mile east of Cool Water.  This church was also that of [[Patrick Henry]], and they were fellow attendees during their lives.\n\nAfter Callis' death in 1814, Needmore was sold four years later in 1818 to Henry Pendleton.  In 1912, it was torn down and replaced by the home of the present Pendleton family.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\nReferences: \n1 \"The History of the Virginia Federal Convention of 1788: With Some Account of the Eminent Virginian of that era who were members of the body.\" by HUGH BLAIR GRIGSBY, LL.D. 1891\n2 \"The Family of William Overton Callis of Louisa County, Virginia\" by Charles R Niehaus 1989\n3 http://www.theforkchurch.org/history.html\n\n[[Virginia Regiment]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Callis, William Overton}}\n[[Category:1756 births]]\n[[Category:1814 deaths]]\n[[Category:Continental Army soldiers]]\n[[Category:People from Urbanna, Virginia]]\n[[Category:People from Hanover County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Continental Army officers from Virginia]]\n[[Category:Randolph family of Virginia]]\n[[Category:American planters]]\n[[Category:College of William & Mary alumni]]\n[[Category:Delegates to the Virginia Ratifying Convention]]\n[[Category:18th-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:Virginia lawyers]]\n[[Category:Hampden\u2013Sydney College alumni]]\n[[Category:Members of the Virginia House of Delegates]]\n[[Category:People from Louisa County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:American democracy activists]]\n[[Category:American Anglicans]]\n[[Category:British North American Anglicans]]\n[[Category:Virginia Federalists]]\n[[Category:18th-century American Episcopalians]]\n[[Category:19th-century American Episcopalians]]\n[[Category:Virginia Democratic-Republicans]]\n[[Category:Virginia colonial people]]\n[[Category:Burials in Virginia]]\n[[Category:American slave owners]]\n[[Category:Christians from Virginia]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Curracas->Caracas -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Overton_Callis"}

Sung & Spatafora (2007)</small>\n}}\n\n'''''Tolypocladium inflatum''''' is an ascomycete [[fungus]] originally isolated from a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[soil]] sample that, under certain conditions, produces the [[immunosuppressant]] [[drug]] [[ciclosporin]].<ref name=dhillon2002 /> In its sexual stage ([[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]]) it is a [[parasite]] on [[scarabeidae|scarab beetles]]. It forms a small, compound [[ascocarp]] that arises from the cadaver of its host beetle. In its asexual stage ([[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]]) it is a white [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] that grows on soil. It is much more commonly found in its asexual stage and this is the stage that was originally given the name ''Tolypocladium inflatum''.<ref name=dhillon2002 />\n\n==History==\nIn 1969, a soil sample containing microfungi from [[Norway]], found by Hans Peter Frey.<ref name=svarstad2000 /> was brought to [[Switzerland]]<ref name=dhillon2002 /> from which a fungus misidentified as ''Trichoderma polysporum'' was isolated.<ref name=dreyfuss1976 /> In 1971 the Austrian mycologist, Walter Gams, re-identified the isolate as a previously unknown microfungus affiliated with the order Hypocreales.<ref name=bissett1983 /> He erected the genus ''Tolypocladium'' to accommodate the isolate which he named ''T. inflatum'' Gams.<ref name=bissett1983 /> The taxon is characterized by swollen [[phialide]]s, sparingly branched [[conidiophores]], and small, [[unicellular]] [[conidia]] borne in slimy heads.<ref name=bissett1983 /> Canadian mycologist John Bissett re-examined the strain in 1983, finding it to match the species ''Pachybasium niveum'', a fungus described prior to the work of Gams. According to the rules of publication priority for [[botanical nomenclature]], Bissett proposed the combination ''Tolypocladium niveum''.<ref name=bissett1983 /> However due to the economic importance of the fungus to the pharmaceutical industry and the fact that the incorrect name had already become well-entrenched, a proposal to formally [[nomen conservandum|conserve]] the name ''T. inflatum'' against earlier names was made and accepted, establishing the [[correct name (botany)|correct name]] of the mold that produces ciclosporin as ''Tolypocladium inflatum''.\n\n==Growth and morphology==\n''Tolypocladium inflatum'' occurs most commonly in soil or leaf litter, particularly at high latitudes in cold soils.<ref name=bissett1983 /> The [[species]] is characterized by spherically swollen [[phialide]]s that are terminated with narrow necks bearing subglobose [[conidia]].<ref name=bissett1983 /> ''T. inflatum'' is highly tolerant of [[lead]] and has been found to dominate the mycota of lead-contaminated soils.<ref name=baath2005 /> A study conducted by Baath ''et al''. found that 35% of the fungal isolates recovered from lead-laden soil were ''T. inflatum''.<ref name=baath2005 />\n\nIn 1996, Kathie Hodge of [[Cornell University]] and colleagues determined that the mold ''T. inflatum'' was the asexual state of what was then known as ''Cordyceps subsessilis''.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> ''Cordyceps subsessilis'' was later moved to the genus ''Elaphocordyceps''. However, under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]]'s 2011 \"[[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph#One fungus, one name|one fungus, one name]]\" principle, fungi can not have different names for their anamorphic and teleomorphic stages if they are found to be the same species so ''Elaphocordyceps subsessilis'' was made a synonym of ''Tolypocladium inflatum.<ref name=Quandt2014 /><ref name=\"Hawksworth 2011\" />\n\nThe genome of the ''T. inflatum'' strain/isolate NRRL 8044 (ATCC 34921) was sequenced and published in 2013 by Bushley and colleagues.<ref name=genome /> This was the same strain from which the ciclosporin was first isolated.\n\n==Metabolite production==\n''Tolypocladium inflatum'' is similar to other fungi in the order Hypocreales in generating a variety of biologically active [[secondary metabolites]].<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Two significant groups of metabolites are produced from ''T. inflatum'': ciclosporins and [[efrapeptin]]s.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> Ciclosporin exhibits [[insecticidal]] and [[antifungal]] properties<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> and is a key [[immunosuppressant]] drug used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs.<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> [[Cyclosporin A|Ciclosporin A]] also has the potential use in the treatment of [[autoimmune diseases]].<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> The [[genome]] of filamentous ''T. inflatum'' contains a 12-gene cluster associated with a repetitive element.<ref name=bushley2013 /><ref name=yang2018 /> [[Efrapeptin]]s are mitochondrial and prokaryotic [[ATPase]] inhibitors that also have insecticidal and antifungal properties.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> Little is known about the role of these metabolites in the ecology of the fungus.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> In 2011, Linn and co-workers studied crude extracts of ''T. inflatum'' and found that the fungus produced six new secondary metabolites and four other chlamydosporol derivatives.<ref name=\"lin2011\" />\n\n==Pathogenicity==\nAlthough ''Tolypocladium inflatum'' is chiefly as a soil fungus<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> its sexual state has been encountered as a pathogen of insects,<ref name=hodge1996 /> specifically [[beetle]] [[larvae]].<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Hodge and co-workers suggested that the fungus may have originated as an insect pathogen but evolved over time survive asexually as a [[facultative]] soil [[saprobe]].<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> Although ''T. inflatum'' has not been shown to affect [[nematodes]], researchers Samson and Soares hypothesized that the ''Tolypocladium'' species may have a nematode alternate host.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> ''Tolypocladium inflatum'' has also shown to produce substances that inhibit the [[in vitro]] growth of a number of fungal species.<ref name=\"summerbell1987\" /> Some suggest that ''T. inflatum'' may also have the ability to inhibit certain fungal plant pathogens from colonizing their hosts.<ref name=\"summerbell1987\" /> For example, ''T. inflatum'' had a small but significant effect on inhibiting [[mycorrhiza]] formation.<ref name=\"summerbell1987\" /> Furthermore, [[secondary metabolites]] isolated from the crude extract of ''T. inflatum'' have shown modest [[cytotoxicity]] against eight human [[tumour]] cell lines including [[A549 cell|A549]] (human lung [[adenocarcinoma]]), A375 (human malignant [[melanoma]]), and [[MCF-7]] (human [[breast cancer]]).<ref name=\"lin2011\" />\n\n==Medical uses==\n''Tolypocladium inflatum'' has long been of interest in biotechnology due to its production of a relatively non-cytotoxic, natural 11 [[amino acid]]<ref name=simons1986 /> [[cyclic peptide]]<ref name=\"disalvo2013\" /> named Ciclosporin A.<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Ciclosporin is an [[immunosuppressant drug]] used in the management of [[autoimmune diseases]] and the prevention of rejection in organ transplantation.<ref name=\"dhillon2002\" /> Ciclosporin A works by targeting and binding with human ciclophilin A.<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> This ciclosporine-ciclophilin binding inhibits [[calcineurin]] and effectively inhibits the human [[immune system]].<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Without calcineurin, the activity of nuclear factor of activated [[T-cells]] and [[transcription regulator]]s of [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] in [[T-lymphocytes]] is blocked.<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Ciclosporin A considerably alters the nuclear morphology of in vitro human peripheral blood [[mononuclear leukocytes]] from [[ovoid]] to a radially splayed [[lobulated]] structure.<ref name=simons1986 /> The expression levels of alanine racemase affects the level of cyclosporine production by ''T. inflatum''.<ref name=\"disalvo2013\" /> Ciclosporin A was first introduced in medical use in the 1970s after an organ transplant to reduce [[graft rejection]].<ref name=\"hoppert2001\" /> This use was based on cyclosporin\u2019s ability to interfere with [[lymphokine]] [[biosynthesis]].<ref name=\"hoppert2001\" /> Ciclosporin A also has [[anti-inflammatory]], [[antifungal]], and [[antiparasitic]] abilities. It has been recommended for autoimmune diseases as well as potential treatment for [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[type I diabetes]], and [[HIV-1]].<ref name=\"disalvo2013\" /> Despite its use in medicine, cyclosporine A exhibits significant [[nephrotoxicity]], [[cardiotoxicity]], and hepathotoxicity.<ref name=\"larson1993\" /> Drugs containing ''T. inflatum''-produced cyclosporin A are a major product of the pharmaceutical company, [[Novartis]].<ref name=\"dhillon2002\" />\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"bissett1983\">{{cite journal|last1=Bissett|first1=J.|title=Notes on Tolypocladium and related genera|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|date=1983|pages=1311\u20131329|doi=10.1139/b83-139|volume=61}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"bushley2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Bushley|first1=Kathryn E.|last2=Raja|first2=Rajani|last3=Jaiswal|first3=Pankaj |last4=Cumbie |first4=Jason S. |last5=Nonogaki|first5=Mariko|last6=Boyd|first6=Alexander E.|last7=Owensby|first7=C.

It forms a small, compound [[ascocarp]] that arises from the cadaver of its host beetle. In its asexual stage ([[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]]) it is a white [[mold]] that grows on soil. It is much more commonly found in its asexual stage and this is the stage that was originally given the name ''Tolypocladium inflatum''.<ref name=dhillon2002 />\n\n==History==\nIn 1969, a soil sample containing microfungi from [[Norway]], found by Hans Peter Frey.<ref name=svarstad2000 /> was brought to [[Switzerland]]<ref name=dhillon2002 /> from which a fungus misidentified as ''Trichoderma polysporum'' was isolated.<ref name=dreyfuss1976 /> In 1971 the Austrian mycologist, Walter Gams, re-identified the isolate as a previously unknown microfungus affiliated with the order Hypocreales.<ref name=bissett1983 /> He erected the genus ''Tolypocladium'' to accommodate the isolate which he named ''T. inflatum'' Gams.<ref name=bissett1983 /> The taxon is characterized by swollen [[phialide]]s, sparingly branched [[conidiophores]], and small, [[unicellular]] [[conidia]] borne in slimy heads.<ref name=bissett1983 /> Canadian mycologist John Bissett re-examined the strain in 1983, finding it to match the species ''Pachybasium niveum'', a fungus described prior to the work of Gams. According to the rules of publication priority for [[botanical nomenclature]], Bissett proposed the combination ''Tolypocladium niveum''.<ref name=bissett1983 /> However due to the economic importance of the fungus to the pharmaceutical industry and the fact that the incorrect name had already become well-entrenched, a proposal to formally [[nomen conservandum|conserve]] the name ''T. inflatum'' against earlier names was made and accepted, establishing the [[correct name (botany)|correct name]] of the mold that produces ciclosporin as ''Tolypocladium inflatum''.\n\n==Growth and morphology==\n''Tolypocladium inflatum'' occurs most commonly in soil or leaf litter, particularly at high latitudes in cold soils.<ref name=bissett1983 /> The [[species]] is characterized by spherically swollen [[phialide]]s that are terminated with narrow necks bearing subglobose [[conidia]].<ref name=bissett1983 /> ''T. inflatum'' is highly tolerant of [[lead]] and has been found to dominate the mycota of lead-contaminated soils.<ref name=baath2005 /> A study conducted by Baath ''et al''. found that 35% of the fungal isolates recovered from lead-laden soil were ''T. inflatum''.<ref name=baath2005 />\n\nIn 1996, Kathie Hodge of [[Cornell University]] and colleagues determined that the mold ''T. inflatum'' was the asexual state of what was then known as ''Cordyceps subsessilis''.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> ''Cordyceps subsessilis'' was later moved to the genus ''Elaphocordyceps''. However, under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]]'s 2011 \"[[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph#One fungus, one name|one fungus, one name]]\" principle, fungi can not have different names for their anamorphic and teleomorphic stages if they are found to be the same species so ''Elaphocordyceps subsessilis'' was made a synonym of ''Tolypocladium inflatum.<ref name=Quandt2014 /><ref name=\"Hawksworth 2011\" />\n\nThe genome of the ''T. inflatum'' strain/isolate NRRL 8044 (ATCC 34921) was sequenced and published in 2013 by Bushley and colleagues.<ref name=genome /> This was the same strain from which the ciclosporin was first isolated.\n\n==Metabolite production==\n''Tolypocladium inflatum'' is similar to other fungi in the order Hypocreales in generating a variety of biologically active [[secondary metabolites]].<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Two significant groups of metabolites are produced from ''T. inflatum'': ciclosporins and [[efrapeptin]]s.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> Ciclosporin exhibits [[insecticidal]] and [[antifungal]] properties<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> and is a key [[immunosuppressant]] drug used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs.<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> [[Cyclosporin A|Ciclosporin A]] also has the potential use in the treatment of [[autoimmune diseases]].<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> The [[genome]] of filamentous ''T. inflatum'' contains a 12-gene cluster associated with a repetitive element.<ref name=bushley2013 /><ref name=yang2018 /> [[Efrapeptin]]s are mitochondrial and prokaryotic [[ATPase]] inhibitors that also have insecticidal and antifungal properties.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> Little is known about the role of these metabolites in the ecology of the fungus.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> In 2011, Linn and co-workers studied crude extracts of ''T. inflatum'' and found that the fungus produced six new secondary metabolites and four other chlamydosporol derivatives.<ref name=\"lin2011\" />\n\n==Pathogenicity==\nAlthough ''Tolypocladium inflatum'' is chiefly as a soil fungus<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> its sexual state has been encountered as a pathogen of insects,<ref name=hodge1996 /> specifically [[beetle]] [[larvae]].<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Hodge and co-workers suggested that the fungus may have originated as an insect pathogen but evolved over time survive asexually as a [[facultative]] soil [[saprobe]].<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> Although ''T. inflatum'' has not been shown to affect [[nematodes]], researchers Samson and Soares hypothesized that the ''Tolypocladium'' species may have a nematode alternate host.<ref name=\"hodge1996\" /> ''Tolypocladium inflatum'' has also shown to produce substances that inhibit the [[in vitro]] growth of a number of fungal species.<ref name=\"summerbell1987\" /> Some suggest that ''T. inflatum'' may also have the ability to inhibit certain fungal plant pathogens from colonizing their hosts.<ref name=\"summerbell1987\" /> For example, ''T. inflatum'' had a small but significant effect on inhibiting [[mycorrhiza]] formation.<ref name=\"summerbell1987\" /> Furthermore, [[secondary metabolites]] isolated from the crude extract of ''T. inflatum'' have shown modest [[cytotoxicity]] against eight human [[tumour]] cell lines including [[A549 cell|A549]] (human lung [[adenocarcinoma]]), A375 (human malignant [[melanoma]]), and [[MCF-7]] (human [[breast cancer]]).<ref name=\"lin2011\" />\n\n==Medical uses==\n''Tolypocladium inflatum'' has long been of interest in biotechnology due to its production of a relatively non-cytotoxic, natural 11 [[amino acid]]<ref name=simons1986 /> [[cyclic peptide]]<ref name=\"disalvo2013\" /> named Ciclosporin A.<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Ciclosporin is an [[immunosuppressant drug]] used in the management of [[autoimmune diseases]] and the prevention of rejection in organ transplantation.<ref name=\"dhillon2002\" /> Ciclosporin A works by targeting and binding with human ciclophilin A.<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> This ciclosporine-ciclophilin binding inhibits [[calcineurin]] and effectively inhibits the human [[immune system]].<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Without calcineurin, the activity of nuclear factor of activated [[T-cells]] and [[transcription regulator]]s of [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] in [[T-lymphocytes]] is blocked.<ref name=\"bushley2013\" /> Ciclosporin A considerably alters the nuclear morphology of in vitro human peripheral blood [[mononuclear leukocytes]] from [[ovoid]] to a radially splayed [[lobulated]] structure.<ref name=simons1986 /> The expression levels of alanine racemase affects the level of cyclosporine production by ''T. inflatum''.<ref name=\"disalvo2013\" /> Ciclosporin A was first introduced in medical use in the 1970s after an organ transplant to reduce [[graft rejection]].<ref name=\"hoppert2001\" /> This use was based on cyclosporin\u2019s ability to interfere with [[lymphokine]] [[biosynthesis]].<ref name=\"hoppert2001\" /> Ciclosporin A also has [[anti-inflammatory]], [[antifungal]], and [[antiparasitic]] abilities. It has been recommended for autoimmune diseases as well as potential treatment for [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[type I diabetes]], and [[HIV-1]].<ref name=\"disalvo2013\" /> Despite its use in medicine, cyclosporine A exhibits significant [[nephrotoxicity]], [[cardiotoxicity]], and hepathotoxicity.<ref name=\"larson1993\" /> Drugs containing ''T. inflatum''-produced cyclosporin A are a major product of the pharmaceutical company, [[Novartis]].<ref name=\"dhillon2002\" />\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"bissett1983\">{{cite journal|last1=Bissett|first1=J.|title=Notes on Tolypocladium and related genera|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|date=1983|pages=1311\u20131329|doi=10.1139/b83-139|volume=61}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"bushley2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Bushley|first1=Kathryn E.|last2=Raja|first2=Rajani|last3=Jaiswal|first3=Pankaj |last4=Cumbie |first4=Jason S. |last5=Nonogaki|first5=Mariko|last6=Boyd|first6=Alexander E.|last7=Owensby|first7=C.

In order to get to their practice space, the band \"had to walk through a pile of shit.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Puddle Of Mudd Wes Scantlin Interview |url=http://spinitloud.com/?p=162 |publisher=spinitloud.com |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927095844/http://spinitloud.com/?p=162 |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> The group's first release, ''[[Stuck (EP)|Stuck]]'', was an EP released in 1994 on V&R Records. It was produced by the band and E.J. Rose, and was recorded at Red House Studio in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Kansas. It spawned two radio singles (the first was \"You Don't Know\", the second \"Drift and Die\").\n\nMinus [[Jimmy Allen (musician)|Jimmy Allen]], the group released their debut album, ''[[Abrasive (album)|Abrasive]]'', in 1997 on Hardknocks Records. It had eleven tracks, all written by the band, three of which would eventually make it on to Puddle of Mudd's first major-label release. Differences of opinion and other factors led to the break-up of the original Puddle of Mudd by early 1999, leaving Scantlin as the only original member\n\n=== ''Come Clean'' (2001\u201302) ===\nScantlin's big break in the music business came after a copy of his demo tape was delivered to [[Fred Durst]]. Durst contacted Scantlin, and after hearing that his band had broken up, decided to bring him to California to attempt to put a new band together.\n\nOne of the first people Scantlin met upon arriving in California was [[Doug Ardito]], an intern at [[Interscope Records]]. When Scantlin found out about Ardito's bass playing, they decided to work together. They were still in need of a guitarist and drummer. Fred Durst decided to contact a guitarist he knew from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, [[Paul Phillips (guitarist)|Paul Phillips]], who had formerly played in a local band there called Happy Hour. After getting the call from Durst, Paul decided to try out for Puddle of Mudd and was accepted, choosing to leave college in order to join. The band held auditions for a new drummer and selected [[Greg Upchurch]], who was an ex-member of [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]] and had also toured with [[Chris Cornell]].\n\nPuddle of Mudd released its major-label debut album ''[[Come Clean (Puddle of Mudd album)|Come Clean]]'' on August 28, 2001. The lead single from the album, \"[[Control (Puddle of Mudd song)|Control]]\" was successful. It was also the theme song for WWE's ''[[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series 2001]],'' which was critically acclaimed. The second single off the album, \"[[Blurry]]\", co-written with Jimmy Allen and Doug Ardito, turned out to be Puddle of Mudd's most successful single, reaching No. 5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 8 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and also winning an [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] song of the year award for Ardito, Allen and Scantlin. The song was also used in the game ''[[Ace Combat 5]]'', published by Namco. \"[[Drift & Die (Puddle of Mudd song)|Drift & Die]]\" co-written by Jimmy Allen was also released as a single spending six weeks at the No.&nbsp;1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The fourth single, \"[[She Hates Me]]\" co-written by Jimmy Allen was released in late 2002, and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks chart]], as well as No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Allen and Scantlin won the ASCAP award for most played rock song of the year.<ref name=\"Billboard.com\"/>\n\nThe group then embarked on a European and American tour as the opening act for [[Godsmack]] and [[Deftones]], and were also a part of the [[Family Values Tour|Family Values 2001 tour]], alongside [[Linkin Park]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], and [[Staind]].\n\nThe album was certified triple [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the U.S. by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on January 31, 2003, and as of late 2006, total sales worldwide were in excess of five million copies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n=== ''Life on Display'' (2003\u201305) ===\nPuddle of Mudd's follow up, ''[[Life on Display (album)|Life on Display]],'' spawned three singles \"Away From Me\", \"Heel Over Head\", and \"Spin You Around\". The album sold below expectations. Although shortly after its release, the record was certified gold and to date, has sold over 706,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Some suggested this was the primary cause of drummer [[Greg Upchurch]]'s leaving the band to join [[3 Doors Down]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1085937|pure_url=yes}} |title=Famous \u2013 Puddle of Mudd |website=AllMusic |date=October 9, 2007 |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref> [[Marisa Miller]] appeared in the music video for \"Spin You Around\". \"Away From Me\" was featured in ''[[The O.C.]]'' in 2004.

A 2005 legal document regarding use and rights to the name \"Puddle of Mudd\" has the spelling of his last name with an I not an E. \u2013 ''Burkitt vs. Flawless Records''.</ref> According to Scantlin, the band name was inspired by practicing next to the Missouri river levee, which always inundated the band's practice space, but never ruined their equipment since they were on the second floor. In order to get to their practice space, the band \"had to walk through a pile of shit.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Puddle Of Mudd Wes Scantlin Interview |url=http://spinitloud.com/?p=162 |publisher=spinitloud.com |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927095844/http://spinitloud.com/?p=162 |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> The group's first release, ''[[Stuck (EP)|Stuck]]'', was an EP released in 1994 on V&R Records. It was produced by the band and E.J. Rose, and was recorded at Red House Studio in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Kansas. It spawned two radio singles (the first was \"You Don't Know\", the second \"Drift and Die\").\n\nMinus [[Jimmy Allen (musician)|Jimmy Allen]], the group released their debut album, ''[[Abrasive (album)|Abrasive]]'', in 1997 on Hardknocks Records. It had eleven tracks, all written by the band, three of which would eventually make it on to Puddle of Mudd's first major-label release. Differences of opinion and other factors led to the break-up of the original Puddle of Mudd by early 1999, leaving Scantlin as the only original member\n\n=== ''Come Clean'' (2001\u201302) ===\nScantlin's big break in the music business came after a copy of his demo tape was delivered to [[Fred Durst]]. Durst contacted Scantlin, and after hearing that his band had broken up, decided to bring him to California to attempt to put a new band together.\n\nOne of the first people Scantlin met upon arriving in California was [[Doug Ardito]], an intern at [[Interscope Records]]. When Scantlin found out about Ardito's bass playing, they decided to work together. They were still in need of a guitarist and drummer. Fred Durst decided to contact a guitarist he knew from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, [[Paul Phillips (guitarist)|Paul Phillips]], who had formerly played in a local band there called Happy Hour. After getting the call from Durst, Paul decided to try out for Puddle of Mudd and was accepted, choosing to leave college in order to join. The band held auditions for a new drummer and selected [[Greg Upchurch]], who was an ex-member of [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]] and had also toured with [[Chris Cornell]].\n\nPuddle of Mudd released its major-label debut album ''[[Come Clean (Puddle of Mudd album)|Come Clean]]'' on August 28, 2001. The lead single from the album, \"[[Control (Puddle of Mudd song)|Control]]\" was successful. It was also the theme song for WWE's ''[[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series 2001]],'' which was critically acclaimed. The second single off the album, \"[[Blurry]]\", co-written with Jimmy Allen and Doug Ardito, turned out to be Puddle of Mudd's most successful single, reaching No. 5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 8 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and also winning an [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] song of the year award for Ardito, Allen and Scantlin. The song was also used in the game ''[[Ace Combat 5]]'', published by Namco. \"[[Drift & Die (Puddle of Mudd song)|Drift & Die]]\" co-written by Jimmy Allen was also released as a single spending six weeks at the No.&nbsp;1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The fourth single, \"[[She Hates Me]]\" co-written by Jimmy Allen was released in late 2002, and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks chart]], as well as No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Allen and Scantlin won the ASCAP award for most played rock song of the year.<ref name=\"Billboard.com\"/>\n\nThe group then embarked on a European and American tour as the opening act for [[Godsmack]] and [[Deftones]], and were also a part of the [[Family Values Tour|Family Values 2001 tour]], alongside [[Linkin Park]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], and [[Staind]].\n\nThe album was certified triple [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the U.S. by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on January 31, 2003, and as of late 2006, total sales worldwide were in excess of five million copies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n=== ''Life on Display'' (2003\u201305) ===\nPuddle of Mudd's follow up, ''[[Life on Display (album)|Life on Display]],'' spawned three singles \"Away From Me\", \"Heel Over Head\", and \"Spin You Around\". The album sold below expectations. Although shortly after its release, the record was certified gold and to date, has sold over 706,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Some suggested this was the primary cause of drummer [[Greg Upchurch]]'s leaving the band to join [[3 Doors Down]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1085937|pure_url=yes}} |title=Famous \u2013 Puddle of Mudd |website=AllMusic |date=October 9, 2007 |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref> [[Marisa Miller]] appeared in the music video for \"Spin You Around\". \"Away From Me\" was featured in ''[[The O.C.]]'' in 2004.

Considered an essential element of the family altar on the occasion of ''[[t\u1ebft]]'', the making and eating of ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' during this time is a well-preserved tradition of Vietnamese people. Beside the ''t\u1ebft'' holiday, ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' is also eaten all year round as Vietnamese cuisine.\n==Origin and symbol==\n\nAccording to the book ''[[L\u0129nh Nam ch\u00edch qu\u00e1i]]'' (''Extraordinary stories of [[Vietnam|L\u0129nh Nam]]'') published in 1695, the creation of ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' was credited to Lang Li\u00eau, a prince of the last [[Ly line|Sixth H\u00f9ng Dynasty]] of the [[Ly line|H\u00f9ng dynasty]] (c. 1712 - 1632 BC). It was said that in choosing a successor among his sons, the monarch decided to carry out a competition in which each prince brought a delicacy representing the sincerity for the ancestors on the occasion of the ''t\u1ebft'', whoever could introduce the most delicious dish for the altar would become the next ruler of the country. While other princes tried to find the rare and delicious foods from forest and sea, the eighteenth prince, Lang Li\u00eau, who was the poorest son of the H\u00f9ng king, could not afford such luxurious dishes and had to be content with everyday ingredients, such as rice and pork. Finally, he created one cake in the square form of earth called ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' and one in the round form of sky called ''[[b\u00e1nh gi\u1ea7y]]'' from these simple ingredients. In tasting the dishes offered by his son, the H\u00f9ng king found ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' and ''b\u00e1nh gi\u1ea7y'' not only delicious but also a fine representation of the respect for ancestors. Therefore, he decided to cede the throne to Lang Li\u00eau and ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'', ''b\u00e1nh gi\u1ea7y'' became traditional foods during the ''t\u1ebft''.<ref name=Janowski/><ref>{{cite book |title=Under the Starfruit Tree: Folktales from Vietnam |author1=Alice M.

The fat and lean pork is preferred for b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng because its fatty flavour well associates with the glutinous rice and mung bean.

Firstly the giang strings and two l\u00e1 dong leaves are placed as the square base for the b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng. After that, glutinous rice is stuffed in l\u00e1 dong, followed by mung bean, pork and finally another layer of rice so that bean and pork can be respectively in the center of the cake. All placed ingredients are carefully wrapped in l\u00e1 dong and bound by giang strings in the square form. In order to get a near perfect square-shaped cake, the maker can use a mold of square form as the base for the wrapping. To keep the cake from [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] or being spoiled, b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng should be carefully wrapped as tight as possible.\n\nThe prepared cakes are tightly arranged in large pot, the pot is filled with fresh water and boiled for hours until they are done from the inside stuffing to outside.

Considered an essential element of the family altar on the occasion of ''[[t\u1ebft]]'', the making and eating of ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' during this time is a well-preserved tradition of Vietnamese people. Beside the ''t\u1ebft'' holiday, ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' is also eaten all year round as Vietnamese cuisine.\n==Origin and symbol==\n\nAccording to the book ''[[L\u0129nh Nam ch\u00edch qu\u00e1i]]'' (''Extraordinary stories of [[Vietnam|L\u0129nh Nam]]'') published in 1695, the creation of ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' was credited to Lang Li\u00eau, a prince of the last [[Ly line|Sixth H\u00f9ng Dynasty]] of the [[Ly line|H\u00f9ng dynasty]] (c. 1712 - 1632 BC). It was said that in choosing a successor among his sons, the monarch decided to carry out a competition in which each prince brought a delicacy representing the sincerity for the ancestors on the occasion of the ''t\u1ebft'', whoever could introduce the most delicious dish for the altar would become the next ruler of the country. While other princes tried to find the rare and delicious foods from forest and sea, the eighteenth prince, Lang Li\u00eau, who was the poorest son of the H\u00f9ng king, could not afford such luxurious dishes and had to be content with everyday ingredients, such as rice and pork. Finally, he created one cake in the square form of earth called ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' and one in the round form of sky called ''[[b\u00e1nh gi\u1ea7y]]'' from these simple ingredients. In tasting the dishes offered by his son, the H\u00f9ng king found ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'' and ''b\u00e1nh gi\u1ea7y'' not only delicious but also a fine representation of the respect for ancestors. Therefore, he decided to cede the throne to Lang Li\u00eau and ''b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng'', ''b\u00e1nh gi\u1ea7y'' became traditional foods during the ''t\u1ebft''.<ref name=Janowski/><ref>{{cite book |title=Under the Starfruit Tree: Folktales from Vietnam |author1=Alice M.

People ferry supplies on horses, donkeys, and mules in the warmer months, and in the frozen winters, they are transported through the frozen [[Zanskar River]]. No fees are charged from the students, and the monastery bears the cost for the room, board and study materials of the students, with help from sponsors. A lot of the students are children from the local farming families in the Lungnak Valley, which are extremely poor and least educated. The older generations are nearly totally uneducated. While they understand the importance of education, they can't afford to send their kids away, outside the Zanskar Valley. Hence, a school like Phuktal Monastic School offers the best of both worlds, by imparting quality education, for free, and without the students having to leave the valley.\n\n==History==\nThe school was set up in 1993, at the behest of Geshe Lharampa Nagri Choszed (1920\u20131998), a native of [[Tibet]], who came to Phuktal in 1959 after the [[Battle of Chamdo|Chinese invasion of Tibet]]. Nagri Choszed brought with him a high level of Buddhist philosophical education and training, to which the isolated Phuktal monks had had virtually no access for several centuries. He restored the ancient tradition of learning and scholarship at Phuktal and instructed the monks in philosophy, traditional ritual systems, and moral discipline. He also sent out many monks to for the purpose of advance learning at other institutions, who returned to Phuktal and began to teach.\n\nIn 2014, the Phuktal Monastic School facility was completed. The new facility had student accommodation and housing, multiple classrooms, staff quarters, offices, a library, the [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Sowa-Rigpa medicine]] centre, a kitchen, a dining hall, and a prayer-assembly hall. This helped the school increase its enrolment significantly.\n\n==Curriculum and Student life==\nComplete education is provided, which involves a mix of traditional learning, which ensures preservation of the unique Zanskari cultural and spiritual heritage and the spread of ''dharma'', and modern curriculum, which readies them for the world. The school currently provides primary (grades 1 to 4) and middle school (grades 5 to 8) education, after which students take a transfer to other higher or secondary schools. By that age, the students are older and more mature to leave the valley by themselves. The school has an integrated curriculum and includes natural sciences, social sciences, [[Modern Standard Hindi|Hindi]], [[English language|English]], and written [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''(Bhodi)''. It also includes traditional Tibetan subjects such as Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and Sowa-Rigpa medicine, the Tibetan science of natural medicine. The Phuktal Gompa maintains a [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Traditional Tibetan medical]] clinic and makes many of the natural medicines itself.\n\nAs future members of the Gompa, the students are trained in all aspects of monastic life and life as a monk, including prayers, rituals, festivals, hymns, among other things. The day of the student begins early, with prayers at sunrise followed by exercise, and then learning. Classrooms are often open to the air.\n\nThe teaching faculty of the Phuktal Monastic School consists of [[Geshe]]s, the Tibetan Buddhist equivalent of a master's degree, and is an academic degree for monks and nuns. Geshes are responsible for not only imparting education to their students on subjects in the curriculum, but also all aspects of dormitory life, since students often live at the Monastery during their school life.

People ferry supplies on horses, donkeys, and mules in the warmer months, and in the frozen winters, they are transported through the frozen [[Zanskar River]]. No fees are charged from the students, and the monastery bears the cost for the room, board and study materials of the students, with help from sponsors. A lot of the students are children from the local farming families in the Lungnak Valley, which are extremely poor and least educated. The older generations are nearly totally uneducated. While they understand the importance of education, they can't afford to send their kids away, outside the Zanskar Valley. Hence, a school like Phuktal Monastic School offers the best of both worlds, by imparting quality education, for free, and without the students having to leave the valley.\n\n==History==\nThe school was set up in 1993, at the behest of Geshe Lharampa Nagri Choszed (1920\u20131998), a native of [[Tibet]], who came to Phuktal in 1959 after the [[Battle of Chamdo|Chinese invasion of Tibet]]. Nagri Choszed brought with him a high level of Buddhist philosophical education and training, to which the isolated Phuktal monks had had virtually no access for several centuries. He restored the ancient tradition of learning and scholarship at Phuktal and instructed the monks in philosophy, traditional ritual systems, and moral discipline. He also sent out many monks to for the purpose of advance learning at other institutions, who returned to Phuktal and began to teach.\n\nIn 2014, the Phuktal Monastic School facility was completed. The new facility had student accommodation and housing, multiple classrooms, staff quarters, offices, a library, the [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Sowa-Rigpa medicine]] centre, a kitchen, a dining hall, and a prayer-assembly hall. This helped the school increase its enrolment significantly.\n\n==Curriclum and Student life==\nComplete education is provided, which involves a mix of traditional learning, which ensures preservation of the unique Zanskari cultural and spiritual heritage and the spread of ''dharma'', and modern curriculum, which readies them for the world. The school currently provides primary (grades 1 to 4) and middle school (grades 5 to 8) education, after which students take a transfer to other higher or secondary schools. By that age, the students are older and more mature to leave the valley by themselves. The school has an integrated curriculum and includes natural sciences, social sciences, [[Modern Standard Hindi|Hindi]], [[English language|English]], and written [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''(Bhodi)''. It also includes traditional Tibetan subjects such as Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and Sowa-Rigpa medicine, the Tibetan science of natural medicine. The Phuktal Gompa maintains a [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Traditional Tibetan medical]] clinic and makes many of the natural medicines itself.\n\nAs future members of the Gompa, the students are trained in all aspects of monastic life and life as a monk, including prayers, rituals, festivals, hymns, among other things. The day of the student begins early, with prayers at sunrise followed by exercise, and then learning. Classrooms are often open to the air.\n\nThe teaching faculty of the Phuktal Monastic School consists of [[Geshe]]s, the Tibetan Buddhist equivalent of a master's degree, and is an academic degree for monks and nuns. Geshes are responsible for not only imparting education to their students on subjects in the curriculum, but also all aspects of dormitory life, since students often live at the Monastery during their school life. At present, there are three Geshes at the school.\n\n==Phuktal River Blockade and Floods==\nOn 31 December 2014, a landlisde occurred between the Shun and Phuktal villages.

{"title_page": "Agricultural soil science", "text_new": "{{Agriculture}}\n\n'''Agricultural soil science''' is a branch of [[soil science]] that deals with the study of [[edaphology|edaphic]] conditions as they relate to the [[food production|production of food]] and [[fiber]].  In this context, it is also a constituent of the field of [[agronomy]] and is thus also described as '''soil agronomy'''.\n\n==History==\n\nPrior to the development of [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]] in the 19th century, agricultural soil science (or [[edaphology]]) was the only branch of soil science. The bias of early soil science toward viewing soils only in terms of their agricultural potential continues to define the soil science profession in both academic and popular settings {{As of|2006|lc=on}}. (Baveye, 2006)\n\n==Current status==\n\nAgricultural soil science follows the holistic method. Soil is investigated in relation to and as integral part of terrestrial ecosystems but is also recognized as a [[soil management|manageable]] [[natural resource]].\n\nAgricultural soil science studies the chemical, physical, biological, and mineralogical composition of soils as they relate to agriculture. Agricultural soil scientists develop methods that will improve the use of soil and increase the production of food and fiber crops. Emphasis continues to grow on the importance of soil sustainability.  Soil degradation such as erosion, compaction, lowered fertility, and contamination continue to be serious concerns.<ref>[http://www.ImAnAgronomist.net I'm An Agronomist!<!-- Bot generated title -->]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001231943/http://www.imanagronomist.net/ |date=October 1, 2016 }}</ref>  They conduct research in [[irrigation]] and [[drainage]], [[tillage]], [[soil classification]], [[nutrition|plant nutrition]], [[fertility (soil)|soil fertility]], and other areas.\n\nAlthough maximizing plant (and thus animal) production is a valid goal, sometimes it may come at high cost which can be readily evident (e.g. massive [[crop disease]] stemming from [[monoculture]]) or long-term (e.g. impact of chemical fertilizers and pesticides on human health). An agricultural soil scientist may come up with a plan that can maximize production using sustainable methods and solutions, and in order to do that he must look into a number of science fields including [[agricultural science]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[meteorology]] and [[geology]].\n\n==Kinds of soil and their variables==\n\nSome soil variables of special interest to agricultural soil science are:\n\n*[[Soil texture]] or soil composition: Soils are composed of solid particles of various sizes. In decreasing order, these particles are [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]]. Every soil can be classified according to the relative percentage of sand, silt and clay it contains.\n*[[Aeration#Aeration of soil|Aeration]] and [[Porosity#Porosity of soil|porosity]]: [[Atmosphere of Earth|Atmospheric air]] contains elements such as [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[carbon]] and others. These elements are prerequisites for life on Earth. Particularly, all [[Cell (biology)|cells]] (including root cells) require oxygen to function and if conditions become [[anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] they fail to [[cellular respiration|respire]] and [[metabolism|metabolize]]. Aeration in this context refers to the mechanisms by which air is delivered to the soil. In natural ecosystems soil aeration is chiefly accomplished through the vibrant activity of the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]]. Humans commonly aerate the soil by tilling and plowing, yet such practice may cause [[Soil#Degradation|degradation]]. Porosity refers to the air-holding capacity of the soil. See also [[characterisation of pore space in soil]].\n*Drainage: In soils of bad drainage the water delivered through rain or irrigation may pool and stagnate. As a result, prevail [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] conditions and plant roots suffocate. Stagnant water also favors plant-attacking water [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s. In soils of excess drainage, on the other hand, plants don't get to absorb adequate water and [[Leaching (agriculture)|nutrients are washed]] from the porous medium to end up in [[groundwater]] reserves.\n*[[Water content]]: Without soil moisture there is no [[transpiration]], no growth and plants [[Wilting|wilt]]. Technically, plant cells lose their pressure (see [[osmotic pressure]] and [[turgor pressure]]). Plants contribute directly to soil moisture. For instance, they create a leafy cover that minimizes the evaporative effects of solar radiation. But even when plants or parts of plants die, the decaying plant matter produces a thick organic cover that protects the soil from evaporation, [[erosion]] and [[soil compaction|compaction]]. For more on this subject see [[mulch]].\n*[[Water potential]]: Water potential describes the tendency of the water to flow from one area of the soil to another. While water delivered to the soil surface normally flows downward due to gravity, at some point it meets increased pressure which causes a reverse upward flow. This effect is known as water suction.\n*[[Soil horizon|Horizonation]]: Typically found in advanced and mature soils, horizonation refers to the creation of soil layers with differing characteristics. It affects almost all soil variables.\n*[[Fertility (soil)|Fertility]]: A fertile soil is one rich in [[nutrient]]s and [[organic matter]]. Modern agricultural methods have rendered much of the arable land infertile. In such cases, soil can no longer support on its own plants with high nutritional demand and thus needs an external source of nutrients. However, there are cases where human activity is thought to be responsible for transforming rather normal soils into super-fertile ones (see [[terra preta]]).\n*[[Biota (ecology)|Biota]] and [[soil biota]]: Organisms interact with the soil and contribute to its quality in innumerable ways. Sometimes the nature of interaction may be unclear, yet a rule is becoming evident: The amount and diversity of the biota is \"proportional\" to the quality of the soil. [[Clade]]s of interest include [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[nematode]]s, [[annelid]]s and [[arthropod]]s.\n*Soil acidity or [[soil pH]] and [[cation-exchange capacity]]: Root cells act as [[Proton pump|hydrogen pumps]] and the surrounding concentration of hydrogen ions affects their ability to absorb nutrients. pH is a measure of this concentration. Each plant species achieves maximum growth in a particular pH range, yet the vast majority of edible plants can grow in soil pH between 5.0 and 7.5.\n\nSoil scientists use a soil classification system to describe soil qualities. The [[International Union of Soil Sciences]] endorses the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources|World Reference Base]] as the international standard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-survey/soil-classification/world-reference-base/en/|title=World Reference Base {{!}} FAO SOILS PORTAL {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Soil fertility==\n\nAgricultural soil scientists study ways to make [[soil]]s more [[soil fertility|productive]]. They classify soils and test them to determine whether they contain nutrients vital to plant growth. Such nutritional substances include compounds of [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]]. If a certain soil is deficient in these substances, [[fertilizer]]s may provide them. Agricultural soil scientists investigate the movement of [[Plant nutrition|nutrients]] through the soil, and the amount of nutrients absorbed by a plant's [[root]]s. Agricultural soil scientists also examine the development of roots and their relation to the soil. Some agricultural soil scientists try to understand the structure and function of soils in relation to soil fertility. They grasp the structure of soil as porous solid. The solid frames of soil consist of mineral derived from the rocks and organic matter originated from the dead bodies of various organisms. The pore space of the soil is essential for the soil to become productive. Small pores serve as water reservoir supplying water to plants and other organisms in the soil during the rain-less period. The water in the small pores of soils is not pure water; they call it soil solution. In soil solution, various plant nutrients derived from minerals and organic matters in the soil are there. This is measured through the [[cation exchange capacity]]. Large pores serve as water drainage pipe to allow the excessive water pass through the soil, during the heavy rains. They also serve as air tank to supply oxygen to plant roots  and other living beings in the soil.\n\n==Soil preservation==\n\nIn addition, agricultural soil scientists develop methods to preserve the agricultural productivity of soil and to decrease the effects on productivity of [[erosion]] by wind and water. For example, a technique called [[contour plowing]] may be used to prevent soil erosion and conserve rainfall. Researchers in agricultural soil science also seek ways to use the soil more effectively in addressing associated challenges.  Such challenges include the beneficial reuse of human and animal wastes using agricultural crops; agricultural [[soil management]] aspects of preventing [[water pollution]] and the build-up in agricultural soil of chemical [[pesticide]]s. [[Regenerative agriculture]] practices can be used to address these challenges and rebuild soil health.\n\n==Employment of agricultural soil scientists==\n\nMost agricultural soil scientists are consultants, researchers, or teachers. Many work in the [[developed world]] as farm advisors,  [[agricultural experiment station]]s, federal, state or local government agencies, industrial firms, or universities. Within the USA they may be trained through the [[USDA]]'s [[Cooperative Extension Service]] offices, although other countries may use universities, [[:Category:Research institutes by country|research institutes]] or research agencies. Elsewhere, agricultural soil scientists may serve in international organizations such as the [[Agency for International Development]] and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations.\n\n==Quotations==\n\n{{quote|[The key objective of the soil science discipline is that of] finding ways to meet growing [[human need]]s for food and fiber while maintaining [[environmental change|environmental stability]] and [[Conservation biology|conserving resources]] for future generations|[[John W.
