{"title_page": "Campus carbon neutrality", "text_new": "Universities all around the world have always had a leadership role in their respective communities by demonstrating the type of changes that need to occur with respect to timely issues that arise. In recent times, educational institutions are reporting greenhouse emissions as a means to measure sustainability. To become carbon neutral, universities are working to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, cut their use of energy, use more renewable energy, and emphasize the importance of sustainable energy sources.<ref name=Perazzoli/> Universities that have committed to becoming carbon neutral have recognized the threat of global warming and are therefore committing to reverse the trend.<ref name=Perazzoli/>\n\n==Definitions==\n{{main|Glossary of climate change}}\n* [[Carbon neutral|Carbon Neutral]]: a term that results or has no additional net of carbon dioxide emission or is inherently counterbalancing the carbon emissions with carbon offsets. This can be achieved by increasing energy efficiency and improving energy conservation, as well as by using renewable energy. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carbon-neutral|title=Definition of CARBON-NEUTRAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n* [[Carbon offset|Carbon Offset]]: an emission reduction credit from an action or activity that results in less carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon offsets are usually measured in tons of CO<sub>2</sub> and can be created by renewable energy projects, energy efficiency, and land use and agriculture based projects. In addition carbon offsets can be traded sold or bought as part of a bigger system to reduce pollutants. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carbon+offset|title=Definition of CARBON OFFSET|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n* [[Sustainable]]: a method of harvesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or permanently damaged; of or relating to a lifestyle involving the use of sustainable methods .<ref name=\"Sustainable-MW\"/>\n* [[Carbon Footprint]]: a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide that is put into the atmosphere as a result of an individual's actions; driving, flying, home heating and cooling, as well as electricity use are some of the common activities that add to your carbon footprint.<ref name=\"What is a carbon footprint?\"/>\n* Carbon Calculator: measures an individual's or institution's impact on the climate by estimating how many tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases an individual's choices create each year.

The mission of the organization is to \"provides a framework and support for America\u2019s colleges and universities to implement comprehensive plans in pursuit of climate neutrality.\"<ref name=\"Mission and History pcc\" /> The ACUPCC grew from concept to text during late 2006, and by March 2007 consisted of 157 signatories.<ref name=\"Mission and History pcc\" /> The organization was officially unveiled in June 2007,<ref name=\"Mission and History pcc\" /> and currently numbers 677 signatories.<ref name=\"Signatory List pcc\" />\n\n====Summary of ACUPCC text====\nThe ACUPCC text can be summarized in two sections: the statement, and the plan. The statement is a four-paragraph declaration that outlines the scientific knowledge regarding global climate change that the signatories accept as fact. It goes on to describe the perceived or predicted institutional and social benefits of taking steps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. The text proposes that by acting to limit their carbon footprint, universities and colleges can act as leader institutions in their communities, and similarly better serve their students and their educational needs. It concludes that, in accordance with the many resultant institutional benefits expected, leaders of educational institutions ought to commit to the steps outlined in the plan. The plan is a three-part outline of certain steps signatory institutions should take \"in pursuit of climate neutrality.\" <ref name=\"Text pcc\" /> The three parts of the plan involve developing a comprehensive plan, choosing from a menu of 'tangible actions' to initiate while developing a comprehensive plan, and issuing regular reports to AASHE regarding institutional progress. Comprehensive plan development under the ACUPCC follows three milestones. By the two-month milestone, signatories commit to having created formal institutional structures (and where appropriate, departments) for the express purpose of guiding the development of the plan as well as implementation of the other elements of the commitment. By the one-year milestone, signatories commit to having completed a greenhouse gas inventory, in accordance with the GHG protocol, with accordances in place to update the figures on a bi-yearly basis. The two-year milestone builds upon the greenhouse gas inventory, requiring that signatories create a comprehensive action plan for achieving climate neutrality. This action plan must include certain minimum elements: a target date for complete climate neutrality, intermediate institutional goals and target dates, steps to integrate climate neutrality and related concerns with educational curriculum and research, and institutional mechanisms for tracking intermediate goals above and beyond the specific structures outlined by the ACUPCC. The menu of possible actions includes conforming to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver standards or greater, purchasing [[Energy Star]] products, and encouraging and fostering use of public transportation. Finally, the reporting section of the three-part plan requires signatory institutions to make the details of their plans, inventories, and progress publicly available through AASHE. The final one-sentence paragraph of the text mentions the need to spread the knowledge contained in the commitment and recruit more signatories through institutional diplomacy.<ref name=\"Text pcc\" />\n\n===The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education===\nA partner with Second Nature, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), was established in 2006 as the first professional higher education association for the campus sustainability community.<ref name=\"AASHE\" /> AASHE works with all sectors of a campus in integrating sustainability in with campus governance, education, and research.<ref name=\"AASHE\" /> Professional development is also emphasized through conferences, workshops, and networking.<ref name=\":0\" /> Press releases, blogs, and awards are coordinated to promote carbon reduction and sustainable awareness.

There are national and internationally binding laws to try to reduce such greenhouse gases. If it were not for this legislation, universities would probably not be pushing for carbon neutrality themselves. Therefore, it is important to understand some of the key legislation when looking at how schools are trying to contribute to the solution.\n\n===The Kyoto Protocol===\nThe [[Kyoto Protocol]] is an international agreement that requires countries to commit to reducing the greenhouse gases they emit into the atmosphere. The protocol was created in Kyoto, Japan on December 11, 1997 and put into practice on February 16, 2005.<ref name=\"Kyoto Protocol UNFCCC\"/> The protocol targets industrialized countries because they are the ones producing most of the greenhouse gases.<ref name=\"Kyoto Protocol UNFCCC\"/> Specific chemicals that it wants to reduce are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, Sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons.<ref name=\"Kyoto Protocol\"/> Thirty-seven industrialized countries and parts of Europe have signed and are bound by the agreement. The United States is not one of them.<ref name=\"Kyoto Protocol UNFCCC\"/>\nThe Kyoto Protocol allots a specific amount of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions that each country can produce, however, countries can also trade emissions with other countries, resulting in the cap and trade system.<ref name=\"Emissions Trading\"/> If one country has not used up all of its allotted emissions, it can sell them to other countries that have gone over their limit.<ref name=\"Emissions Trading\"/>\n\n===The Montreal Protocol===\nThe [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international agreement that seeks to phase out chemicals that damage the ozone layer.<ref name=\"Montreal Protocol\"/> The Montreal protocol was signed in 1987, went into practice in 1989, and was further amended in London in 1990 and in Copenhagen in 1992.<ref name=\"Montreal Protocol\"/> The protocol set a quicker timetable for industrialized nations to phase out chemicals than it did for developing nations. For example, developed countries were to [[phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons|phase-out chlorofluorocarbons]] by 1995, but developing countries have until 2010 to phase out this chemical.<ref name=Welch/> Other chemicals that it wanted to phase out were halons, [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[methyl chloroform]], hydrochloroforlourocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, and [[methyl bromide]].<ref name=Welch/>\n\n===The Greenhouse Gas Protocol===\nThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol was created by the Climate Registry to establish a common method of reporting and measuring greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=\"GHG Protocol Initiative\"/> Thirty-four U.S. states, two Canadian provinces, and one American Indian tribe have joined.<ref name=\"GHG Protocol Initiative\"/> Mexico, for example, is using the protocol a guideline for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its three-step plan, Mexico will have voluntary emissions reporting, then it will have a greenhouse gas cap, and finally it will follow a cap- and-trade system.<ref name=\"GHG Protocol Initiative\"/> In addition, \u201cforty-two of the largest corporations follow GHG Protocol standards.\u201d<ref name=\"GHG Protocol Initiative\"/>\n\n===Talloires Declaration===\nThe [[Talloires Declaration]] is the first official statement of a commitment to environmental sustainability in higher education. The declaration was made in 1990 at an international conference in France. The Talloires Declaration is an action plan consisting of ten points that aim to incorporate sustainability and environmental literacy in teaching, research, operations and outreach at universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ulsf.org/brief-history-of-the-talloires-declaration/|title=Brief History of the Talloires Declaration \u2013 ULSF|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> It was written with the premise that universities play a major role in the process of addressing and reversing the current trends of environmental changes because they prepare most of society's leaders and are therefore uniquely positioned to influence the direction that society takes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ulsf.org/brief-history-of-the-talloires-declaration/|title=Brief History of the Talloires Declaration \u2013 ULSF|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\nBy signing the Talloires Declaration, a university agrees to:\n{{quote|\n# Increase Awareness of Environmentally Sustainable Development\n# Create an Institutional Culture of Sustainability\n# Educate for Environmentally Responsible Citizenship\n# Foster Environmental Literacy for All\n# Practice Institutional Ecology\n# Involve all Stakeholders\n# Collaborate for Interdisciplinary Approaches\n# Enhance Capacity of Primary and Secondary Schools\n# Broaden Service and Outreach Nationally and Internationally\n# Maintain the Movement}}\n\n===Climate Neutral Network===\nThe Climate Neutral Network is \u201can initiative led by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] to promote global action to de-carbonize our economies and societies.\"<ref name=\"Climate Neutrality with Honours\"/> The initiative involves universities, colleges, and other academic institutions worldwide and its aim is to work together in order to transform so that they can have a zero emission future. Like the Presidential Climate Commitment, the Climate Neutral Network is designed with the premise that colleges and universities are vital components in addressing climate change \"because they can model climate neutrality on their campuses, and they can teach their students skills and knowledge they need to address the climate crisis.\"<ref name=\"Climate Neutrality with Honours\"/>\n\n====University of Malaga (Spain)====\n[[University of M\u00e1laga]] (UMA) announced its participation in UNEP's Climate Neutral Network in July 2009.<ref name=Matthes/> As an urban campus, Malaga University has focused on building infrastructure and facilities for renewable energy production and fostering low-impact transportation to further its goals of being carbon neutral. In the realm of transit, the University plans on completing a subway line between the local city center and the University center by 2012,<ref name=\"UNEP AO\"/> as well as facilitating the growth of bicycle and pedestrian portions of traffic.<ref name=\"UNEP AO\"/> UMA has also planned or constructed installations of solar thermal and photovoltaic generation on its campus, and is currently constructing a photovoltaic installation aimed to produce one megawatt of energy for the school.<ref name=Matthes/><ref name=\"UNEP AO\"/> The school is also investing in co- and tri-generation technologies that incorporate fuel-burning generation and secondary heat capture aided by geothermal heat.<ref name=Matthes/> The campus' immediate goal is to rely entirely on sustainable sources of power.<ref name=Mascarelli/>\n\n====Tongji University (China)====\n[[Tongji University]] in [[Shanghai]], China was one of the first six schools to join the Climate Neutral Network.<ref name=\"Climate Neutrality with Honours\"/> Tongji is using technology, management, and education and participation to meet its goal of using fewer resources.<ref name=\"Construction\"/> Tongji is saving energy by using [[solar water heating]] and re-using waste water in its bath house.<ref name=\"Construction\"/> Additional steps are being taken to save energy in many of the university\u2019s buildings, such as \u201c[[low-E windows]], [[architectural sun shading]], [[roof greening]], and [[energy-saving lighting]].\u201d<ref name=\"Construction\"/>  The Wenyuan building, for example, uses \u201c[[geo-heat pumps]], thermal insulation systems, [[rainwater collection]] and recycling systems.\u201d<ref name=\"Climate Neutrality with Honours\"/>\nThe Tongji Fuel Cell Vehicle Engineering Center is helping to create [[fuel cell vehicles]]. These fuel cell powered sedans can travel 150 miles  per hour and can \u201ccover up to 300 miles after one hydrogen charging.\u201d<ref name=\"Climate Neutrality with Honours\"/>\n\n====University of the West of England (UK)====\n[[University of the West of England]] is part of the Climate Neutral Network and with this, it is committed to reducing climate change. This entails reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so to accomplish this, the university developed a carbon management plan in partnership with [[Carbon Trust]]. The aim of the university\u2019s carbon management plan is \u201cto use energy more efficiently to progressively reduce dependency on fossil fuels and contribute to achieving the UK target of an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.\"<ref name=\"University of the West of England\"/> The critical objectives of the plan are to: \"reduce energy use in buildings, including residential buildings; implement an energy awareness campaign; implement 80 percent of the technical carbon saving measures detailed in the Carbon Management Plan; aim to achieve [[BREEAM]] rating of at least \u201cVery Good\u201d for energy aspects of new buildings; and to consider the procurement of a proportion of electricity from renewable sources where economic to do so.\"<ref name=\"University of the West of England\"/> Additionally, the University of the West of England is a member of the West of England Carbon Challenge. As a member, the university has pledged to reduce its emissions over the course of four years in order to have an overall 10 percent decrease in emissions by 2012.<ref name=\"What is the West of England\"/>\n\n==References==\n<references>\n<!-- begin Nick's refs -->\n<ref name=\"UNEP AO\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/climateneutral/Participants/AssociationsOrganizations/MalagaUniversity/tabid/820/Default.aspx|title=\"UNEP Climate Neutral Network - Associations & Organizations - Malaga University\" UNEP Climate Neutral Network - Association and Organizations. 2009.

The mission of the organization is to \"provides a framework and support for America\u2019s colleges and universities to implement comprehensive plans in pursuit of climate neutrality.\"<ref name=\"Mission and History pcc\" /> The ACUPCC grew from concept to text during late 2006, and by March 2007 consisted of 157 signatories.<ref name=\"Mission and History pcc\" /> The organization was officially unveiled in June 2007,<ref name=\"Mission and History pcc\" /> and currently numbers 677 signatories.<ref name=\"Signatory List pcc\" />\n\n====Summary of ACUPCC text====\nThe ACUPCC text can be summarized in two sections: the statement, and the plan. The statement is a four-paragraph declaration that outlines the scientific knowledge regarding global climate change that the signatories accept as fact. It goes on to describe the perceived or predicted institutional and social benefits of taking steps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. The text proposes that by acting to limit their carbon footprint, universities and colleges can act as leader institutions in their communities, and similarly better serve their students and their educational needs. It concludes that, in accordance with the many resultant institutional benefits expected, leaders of educational institutions ought to commit to the steps outlined in the plan. The plan is a three-part outline of certain steps signatory institutions should take \"in pursuit of climate neutrality.\" <ref name=\"Text pcc\" /> The three parts of the plan involve developing a comprehensive plan, choosing from a menu of 'tangible actions' to initiate while developing a comprehensive plan, and issuing regular reports to AASHE regarding institutional progress. Comprehensive plan development under the ACUPCC follows three milestones. By the two-month milestone, signatories commit to having created formal institutional structures (and where appropriate, departments) for the express purpose of guiding the development of the plan as well as implementation of the other elements of the commitment. By the one-year milestone, signatories commit to having completed a greenhouse gas inventory, in accordance with the GHG protocol, with accordances in place to update the figures on a bi-yearly basis. The two-year milestone builds upon the greenhouse gas inventory, requiring that signatories create a comprehensive action plan for achieving climate neutrality. This action plan must include certain minimum elements: a target date for complete climate neutrality, intermediate institutional goals and target dates, steps to integrate climate neutrality and related concerns with educational curriculum and research, and institutional mechanisms for tracking intermediate goals above and beyond the specific structures outlined by the ACUPCC. The menu of possible actions includes conforming to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver standards or greater, purchasing [[Energy Star]] products, and encouraging and fostering use of public transportation.

There are national and internationally binding laws to try to reduce such greenhouse gases. If it were not for this legislation, universities would probably not be pushing for carbon neutrality themselves. Therefore, it is important to understand some of the key legislation when looking at how schools are trying to contribute to the solution.\n\n===The Kyoto Protocol===\nThe [[Kyoto Protocol]] is an international agreement that requires countries to commit to reducing the greenhouse gases they emit into the atmosphere.

The United States is not one of them.<ref name=\"Kyoto Protocol UNFCCC\"/>\nThe Kyoto Protocol allots a specific amount of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions that each country can produce, however, countries can also trade emissions with other countries, resulting in the cap and trade system.<ref name=\"Emissions Trading\"/> If one country has not used up all of its allotted emissions, it can sell them to other countries that have gone over their limit.<ref name=\"Emissions Trading\"/>\n\n===The Montreal Protocol===\nThe [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international agreement that seeks to phase out chemicals that damage the ozone layer.<ref name=\"Montreal Protocol\"/> The Montreal protocol was signed in 1987, went into practice in 1989, and was further amended in London in 1990 and in Copenhagen in 1992.<ref name=\"Montreal Protocol\"/> The protocol set a quicker timetable for industrialized nations to phase out chemicals than it did for developing nations. For example, developed countries were to [[phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons|phase-out chlorofluorocarbons]] by 1995, but developing countries have until 2010 to phase out this chemical.<ref name=Welch/> Other chemicals that it wanted to phase out were halons, [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[methyl chloroform]], hydrochloroforlourocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, and [[methyl bromide]].<ref name=Welch/>\n\n===The Greenhouse Gas Protocol===\nThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol was created by the Climate Registry to establish a common method of reporting and measuring greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=\"GHG Protocol Initiative\"/> Thirty-four U.S. states, two Canadian provinces, and one American Indian tribe have joined.<ref name=\"GHG Protocol Initiative\"/> Mexico, for example, is using the protocol a guideline for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its three-step plan, Mexico will have voluntary emissions reporting, then it will have a greenhouse gas cap, and finally it will follow a cap- and-trade system.<ref name=\"GHG Protocol Initiative\"/> In addition, \u201cforty-two of the largest corporations follow GHG Protocol standards.\u201d<ref name=\"GHG Protocol Initiative\"/>\n\n===Talloires Declaration===\nThe [[Talloires Declaration]] is the first official statement of a commitment to environmental sustainability in higher education.

In the realm of transit, the University plans on completing a subway line between the local city center and the University center by 2012,<ref name=\"UNEP AO\"/> as well as facilitating the growth of bicycle and pedestrian portions of traffic.<ref name=\"UNEP AO\"/> UMA has also planned or constructed installations of solar thermal and photovoltaic generation on its campus, and is currently constructing a photovoltaic installation aimed to produce one megawatt of energy for the school.<ref name=Matthes/><ref name=\"UNEP AO\"/> The school is also investing in co- and tri-generation technologies that incorporate fuel-burning generation and secondary heat capture aided by geothermal heat.<ref name=Matthes/> The campus' immediate goal is to rely entirely on sustainable sources of power.<ref name=Mascarelli/>\n\n====Tongji University (China)====\n[[Tongji University]] in [[Shanghai]], China was one of the first six schools to join the Climate Neutral Network.<ref name=\"Climate Neutrality with Honours\"/> Tongji is using technology, management, and education and participation to meet its goal of using fewer resources.<ref name=\"Construction\"/> Tongji is saving energy by using [[solar water heating]] and re-using waste water in its bath house.<ref name=\"Construction\"/> Additional steps are being taken to save energy in many of the university\u2019s buildings, such as \u201c[[low-E windows]], [[architectural sun shading]], [[roof greening]], and [[energy-saving lighting]].\u201d<ref name=\"Construction\"/>  The Wenyuan building, for example, uses \u201c[[geo-heat pumps]], thermal insulation systems, [[rainwater collection]] and recycling systems.\u201d<ref name=\"Climate Neutrality with Honours\"/>\nThe Tongji Fuel Cell Vehicle Engineering Center is helping to create [[fuel cell vehicles]]. These fuel cell powered sedans can travel 150 miles  per hour and can \u201ccover up to 300 miles after one hydrogen charging.\u201d<ref name=\"Climate Neutrality with Honours\"/>\n\n====University of the West of England (UK)====\n[[University of the West of England]] is part of the Climate Neutral Network and with this, it is committed to reducing climate change. This entails reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so to accomplish this, the university developed a carbon management plan in partnership with [[Carbon Trust]]. The aim of the university\u2019s carbon management plan is \u201cto use energy more efficiently to progressively reduce dependency on fossil fuels and contribute to achieving the UK target of an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.\"<ref name=\"University of the West of England\"/> The critical objectives of the plan are to: \"reduce energy use in buildings, including residential buildings; implement an energy awareness campaign; implement 80 percent of the technical carbon saving measures detailed in the Carbon Management Plan; aim to achieve [[BREEAM]] rating of at least \u201cVery Good\u201d for energy aspects of new buildings; and to consider the procurement of a proportion of electricity from renewable sources where economic to do so.\"<ref name=\"University of the West of England\"/> Additionally, the University of the West of England is a member of the West of England Carbon Challenge. As a member, the university has pledged to reduce its emissions over the course of four years in order to have an overall 10 percent decrease in emissions by 2012.<ref name=\"What is the West of England\"/>\n\n==References==\n<references>\n<!-- begin Nick's refs -->\n<ref name=\"UNEP AO\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/climateneutral/Participants/AssociationsOrganizations/MalagaUniversity/tabid/820/Default.aspx|title=\"UNEP Climate Neutral Network - Associations & Organizations - Malaga University\" UNEP Climate Neutral Network - Association and Organizations. 2009.

The Wildcat continued to be built throughout the remainder of the war to serve on [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]], where larger and heavier fighters could not be used.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Grumman XF4F-3 prototype in flight in 1939.jpg|thumb|The XF4F-3 in 1939; it was written off in a fatal accident on 16 December 1940]]\n\nGrumman fighter development began with the two-seat [[Grumman FF]] [[biplane]]. The FF was the first U.S. naval fighter with a retractable [[landing gear]]. The wheels retracted into the [[fuselage]], leaving the tires visibly exposed, flush with the sides of the fuselage. Two single-seat biplane designs followed, the [[Grumman F2F|F2F]] and [[Grumman F3F|F3F]], which established the general fuselage outlines of what would become the F4F Wildcat. In 1935, while the F3F was still undergoing flight testing, Grumman started work on its next biplane fighter, the G-16. At the time, the U.S. Navy favored a [[monoplane]] design, the [[Brewster F2A Buffalo|Brewster F2A-1]], ordering production early in 1936. However, an order was also placed for Grumman's G-16 (given the navy designation XF4F-1) as a backup in case the Brewster monoplane proved to be unsatisfactory.<ref name=\"Swan US Navy p205\">Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 205.</ref><ref name=\"Green v4 p90\">Green 1969, p. 60.</ref>\n\nIt was clear to Grumman that the XF4F-1 would be inferior to the Brewster monoplane, so Grumman abandoned the XF4F-1, designing instead a new monoplane fighter, the XF4F-2.<ref name=\"Swan US Navy p205\"/><ref name=\"donald wildcat\">Donald 1995, pp. 128\u2013134.</ref> The XF4F-2 would retain the same, fuselage-mounted, hand-cranked main landing gear as the F3F, with its relatively narrow track. The unusual manually-retractable main landing gear design for all of Grumman's U.S. Navy fighters up to and through the F4F, as well as for the amphibious [[Grumman J2F]] utility biplane, was originally created in the 1920s by Leroy Grumman for [[Grover Loening]].<ref>[http://www.willyvictor.com/Biographies/waters.html \"Wayne Waters CDR USN(ret).\"] ''willyvictor.com.''</ref>{{refn|Quote: ...landing gear was almost identical to that in the J2F's.|group=N}} Landing accidents caused by failure of the main gear to fully lock into place were distressingly common.<ref>Tillman 1983, p. 12.</ref>\n\n[[File:F4F-3 in flight in summer of 1940.jpg|thumb|An early F4F-3 with [[Spinner (aeronautics)|prop spinner]] and cowl guns]]\n\nThe overall performance of Grumman's new monoplane was felt to be inferior to that of the Brewster Buffalo. The XF4F-2 was marginally faster, but the Buffalo was more maneuverable. It was judged superior and was chosen for production.<ref name=\"donald wildcat\"/> After losing out to Brewster, Grumman completely rebuilt the prototype as the XF4F-3 with new wings and tail and a supercharged version of the [[Pratt & Whitney]] R-1830 \"Twin Wasp\" radial engine.<ref name=\"donald wildcat\"/><ref name=\"green 4 F4f\">Green 1961, pp. 90\u201396.</ref> Testing of the new XF4F-3 led to an order for F4F-3 production models, the first of which was completed in February 1940. France also ordered the type, powered by a [[Wright R-1820]] \"Cyclone 9\" radial engine, but France fell to the Axis powers before they could be delivered and the aircraft went instead to the British Royal Navy, who christened the new fighter the [[Martlet]]. The U.S. Navy officially adopted the aircraft type on 1 October 1941 as the Wildcat. The Royal Navy's and U.S. Navy's F4F-3s, armed with four .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) Browning machine guns, joined active units in 1940.<ref name=\"green 4 F4f\"/>\n\nOn 16 December 1940, the XF4F-3 prototype, BuNo ''0383'', c/n 356, modified from XF4F-2, was lost under circumstances that suggested that the pilot may have been confused by the poor layout of fuel valves and flap controls and inadvertently turned the fuel valve to \"off\" immediately after takeoff rather than selecting flaps \"up\".

Production later switched to the improved '''FM-2''' (based on Grumman's XF4F-8 prototype) optimized for small-carrier operations, with a more powerful engine (the {{convert|1350|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Wright R-1820]]-56), and a taller tail to cope with the torque.<ref name=\"Fighting the U-boats\"/>\n\n====F4F-7====\nThe '''F4F-7''' was a photoreconnaissance variant, with armor and armament removed. It had non-folding \"wet\" wings that carried an additional 555&nbsp;gal (2,101&nbsp;L) of fuel for a total of about 700&nbsp;gal (2,650&nbsp;L), increasing its range to 3,700&nbsp;mi (5,955&nbsp;km). A total of 21 were built.<ref name=\"donald wildcat\"/>\n\n====F2M Wildcat====\nThe '''F2M-1''' was a planned development of the FM-1 by General Motors / Eastern Aircraft to be powered by the improved XR-1820-70 engine, but the project was cancelled before any aircraft were built.<ref name=\"EGustin\"/>\n\n===Royal Navy Martlets===\n====Martlet Mk I====\nAt the end of 1939, Grumman received a French order for 81 aircraft of model G-36A, to equip their new {{sclass-|Joffre|aircraft carrier}}s: {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|Joffre||2}} and {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|Painlev\u00e9||2}}. The main difference with the basic model G-36 was due to the unavailability for export of the two-stage supercharged engine of F4F-3. The G-36A was powered by the nine-cylinder, single-row [[Wright Cyclone|Wright R-1820-G205A]] radial engine, of {{convert|1200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and with a single-stage two-speed supercharger.<ref name=\"willing p52,60-1\">Green, Swanborough and Brown 1977, pp. 52, 60\u201361.</ref>\n\n[[File:Martlet at Grumman 1940.jpg|thumb|A G-36A at Grumman, 1940]]\n\nThe G-36A also had French [[Flight instruments|instruments]] (with metric calibration), radio and [[Sight (device)|gunsight]]. The throttle was modified to conform to French pre-war practice: the throttle lever was moved towards the pilot (i.e. backward) to increase engine power. The armament which was to be fitted in France was six 7.5&nbsp;mm (.296&nbsp;in) [[Darne machine gun]]s (two in the fuselage and four in the wings). The first G-36A was flown on 11 May 1940.<ref name=\"Wixley two p51\">Wixley ''Air Enthusiast'' July\u2013August 1997, p. 51.</ref> After France's defeat in the [[Battle of France]], all contracts were taken over by Britain. The throttle was modified again, four 0.50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns were installed in the wings and most traces of the original ownership removed.<ref name=\"Willing p61\">Green, Swanborough and Brown 1977, p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe Martlets were modified for British use by [[Blackburn Aircraft|Blackburn]], which continued to do this for all later marks. British gunsights, [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] spools and other items were installed.<ref name=\"Blackburn p40-2\">Jackson 1968, pp. 40\u201342.</ref> After attempts to fit British radio sets, it was decided to use the superior American equipment.<ref name=\"Willing p68\">Green, Swanborough and Brown 1977, p. 68.</ref> The first Martlets entered British service in August 1940, with [[804 Naval Air Squadron]], stationed at [[RNAS Hatston|Hatston]] in the [[Orkney]] Islands. The Martlet Mk I did not have a wing folding mechanism and was therefore used primarily from land bases, with the exception of 882 Sqn aboard ''Illustrious.''{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1940, Belgium also placed an order for at least 10 Martlet Mk 1s. These were to be modified with the removal of the tailhook. Belgium surrendered before any aircraft were delivered and by 10 May 1940, the aircraft order was transferred to the Royal Navy.\n\n====Martlet Mk II====\nBefore the Fleet Air Arm took on charge the Martlet Mk Is it had already ordered 100 G-36B fighters. The British chose the [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp|Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S3C4-G]] engine to power this aircraft; this too had a single-stage, two-speed supercharger. The FAA decided to accept a delay in delivery to get Martlets fitted out with the Grumman-designed and patented ''Sto-Wing'' folding wing system first fitted onto U.S. Navy F4F-4 Wildcats,<ref name=sto /> which were vitally important if the Martlet was to be used from the first 3 [[Illustrious-class aircraft carrier|Illustrious class]] carriers which had elevators that were too narrow to accommodate non-folding wing aircraft. Nevertheless, the first 10 received had fixed wings. The first Martlet with folding wings was not delivered until August 1941.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn contrast to the USN F4F-3, the British aircraft were fitted with armor and self-sealing fuel tanks. The Mk II also had a larger tailwheel. For carrier operations, the \"sting\" tail hook and attachment point for the American single-point catapult launch system were considered important advantages. Nevertheless, the Martlets were modified to have British-style catapult spools. Deliveries of the folding-wing G-36Bs began in August 1941, with 36 shipped to the UK and 54 shipped to the Far East; they were designated \"Martlet Mark II\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A&AEE) testing of the Martlet II at a mean weight of approximately 7,350&nbsp;lb showed a maximum speed of 293&nbsp;mph at 5,400&nbsp;ft and 13,800&nbsp;ft, a maximum climb rate of 1940 fpm at 7,600&nbsp;ft at 7,790&nbsp;lb weight, and a time to climb to 20,000&nbsp;ft of 12.5 minutes. The service ceiling at 7,790&nbsp;lb was 31,000&nbsp;ft.<ref name=\"Mason, p.306\">Mason, p.306.</ref>\n\n[[File:MarletMk2 888Sqn HMSFormidable Oran Dec1942.jpg|thumb|A Martlet II from {{HMS|Formidable|67|6}}, 1942]]\n\nThe Martlet was the second single-seat, monoplane fighter to operate from Royal Navy aircraft carriers following the introduction of the [[Sea Hurricane]] IB on {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} in July 1941.<ref>Brown 1980, pp. 45, 110.</ref>\n\nThe majority of the Martlet Mk IIs were sent to the Far East. The first shipboard operations of the type in British service were in September 1941, aboard {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}}, a very small escort carrier with a carrier deck of {{convert|420|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|59|ft|m|abbr=on}}, no elevators and no hangar deck. The six Wildcats were parked on the deck at all times. On its first voyage, it served as escort carrier for a convoy to Gibraltar. On 20 September, a German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Fw 200]] was shot down. On the next voyage, four Fw 200 ''Condors'' fell to the guns of the Martlets, and of the combined total, two of these five Condors were shot down by [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric \"Winkle\" Brown]] during his time aboard. Operations from ''Audacity'' also demonstrated that the fighter cover was useful against U-boats. ''Audacity'' was sunk by a U-boat on 21 December 1941, with only Brown and one other pilot surviving,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30039300|title=Eric 'Winkle' Brown: The man who seemed not to notice danger|work=[[BBC News]]|last=Jones|first=Luke|date=November 14, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref> but it had already proved the usefulness of escort carriers.<ref name=\"Fighting the U-boats\"/>\n\nIn May 1942, 881 and 882 squadrons on {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} participated in operations against [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]]. In August 1942, 806 NAS on {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} provided fighter cover for a [[Malta Convoys|convoy to Malta]]. Later in that year they participated in the landings in French North Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n====Martlet Mk III====\nThe first 30 F4F-3As were released for sale to Greece, after the [[Greco-Italian War|Italian invasion in November 1940]]. However, at the defeat of Greece in April 1941 the aircraft had only reached Gibraltar. They were taken over by the FAA as Martlet Mk III(B). As these aircraft did not have folding wings, they were only used from land bases. They served in a shore-based role in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Wildcat Aces of World War 2|publisher=Osprey|isbn=1 85532 486 5|pages=71|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTen fixed-wing G-36Bs were used by the FAA as Martlet III(A).\n\n====Martlet Mk IV====\nThe Royal Navy purchased  220 F4F-4s adapted to British requirements. The main difference was the use of a Wright R-1820-40B Cyclone in a distinctly more rounded and compact cowling, with a single double-wide flap on each side of the rear and no lip intake. These machines were named Martlet Mk IV. [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment|Boscombe Down]] testing of the Martlet IV at 7,350&nbsp;lb weight showed a maximum speed of 278&nbsp;mph at 3,400&nbsp;ft and 298&nbsp;mph at 14,600&nbsp;ft, a maximum climb rate of 1580 fpm at 6,200&nbsp;ft at 7,740&nbsp;lb weight, and a time to climb to 20,000&nbsp;ft of 14.6 minutes. The service ceiling at 7,740&nbsp;lb was 30,100&nbsp;ft.<ref name=\"Mason, p.306\"/>\n\n====Martlet Mk V====\nThe Fleet Air Arm purchased 312 FM-1s, originally with the designation of Martlet V. In January 1944, a decision was made to retain the American names for US-supplied aircraft, redesignating the batch as the Wildcat V.\n\n====Wildcat Mk VI====\nThe Wildcat VI was the Air Ministry name for the FM-2 Wildcat in FAA service.\n\n==Operators==\n;{{flag|Belgium|1921}}\n* [[Belgian Air Force]]: at least 10 Martlet Mk I's ordered, never delivered, transferred to Royal Navy after [[Battle of Belgium|surrender]].\n;{{flag|France|1921}}\n* [[Aeronavale]]: 81 aircraft ordered, never delivered, transferred to Royal Navy after French [[Battle of France|defeat]].\n;{{flag|Greece|1940}}\n* [[Hellenic Air Force]]: 30 Martlet Mk III's ordered, delivered to Gibraltar, transferred to Royal Navy after [[Battle of Greece|defeat]].\n\n;{{flag|Canada|1921}}\n* [[Royal Canadian Navy]]: RCN personnel assigned to the Royal Navy {{HMS|Puncher|D79|6}}, were to provide the RCN with experience in aircraft carrier operations.

Later the \"Wildcat\" name would be adopted by the RN in order to simplify supply, and prevent possible confusion over delivery orders.</ref> First used in combat by the British in the North Atlantic, the Wildcat was the only effective fighter available to the United States Navy and Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater during the early part of [[World War II]] in 1941 and 1942; the disappointing [[Brewster Buffalo]] was withdrawn in favor of the Wildcat and replaced as units became available. With a top speed of {{convert|318|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the Wildcat was outperformed by the faster {{convert|331|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, more maneuverable, and longer-ranged [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]. However, the F4F's ruggedness, coupled with tactics such as the [[Thach Weave]], resulted in a claimed air combat kill-to-loss ratio of 5.9:1 in 1942 and 6.9:1 for the entire war.<ref name=\"polmar\">Polmar 2004</ref>\n\nLessons learned from the Wildcat were later applied to the faster [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F Hellcat]]. While the Wildcat had better range and maneuverability at low speed,<ref>Tillman 1983, pp. 5, 96.</ref> the Hellcat could rely on superior power and high speed performance<ref>[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/japan/ptr-1111.pdf TAIC REPORT NO.17, November 1944]</ref> to outperform the Zero. The Wildcat continued to be built throughout the remainder of the war to serve on [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]], where larger and heavier fighters could not be used.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Grumman XF4F-3 prototype in flight in 1939.jpg|thumb|The XF4F-3 in 1939; it was written off in a fatal accident on 16 December 1940]]\n\nGrumman fighter development began with the two-seat [[Grumman FF]] [[biplane]]. The FF was the first U.S. naval fighter with a retractable [[landing gear]]. The wheels retracted into the [[fuselage]], leaving the tires visibly exposed, flush with the sides of the fuselage. Two single-seat biplane designs followed, the [[Grumman F2F|F2F]] and [[Grumman F3F|F3F]], which established the general fuselage outlines of what would become the F4F Wildcat. In 1935, while the F3F was still undergoing flight testing, Grumman started work on its next biplane fighter, the G-16. At the time, the U.S. Navy favored a [[monoplane]] design, the [[Brewster F2A Buffalo|Brewster F2A-1]], ordering production early in 1936. However, an order was also placed for Grumman's G-16 (given the navy designation XF4F-1) as a backup in case the Brewster monoplane proved to be unsatisfactory.<ref name=\"Swan US Navy p205\">Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 205.</ref><ref name=\"Green v4 p90\">Green 1969, p. 60.</ref>\n\nIt was clear to Grumman that the XF4F-1 would be inferior to the Brewster monoplane, so Grumman abandoned the XF4F-1, designing instead a new monoplane fighter, the XF4F-2.<ref name=\"Swan US Navy p205\"/><ref name=\"donald wildcat\">Donald 1995, pp. 128\u2013134.</ref> The XF4F-2 would retain the same, fuselage-mounted, hand-cranked main landing gear as the F3F, with its relatively narrow track. The unusual manually-retractable main landing gear design for all of Grumman's U.S. Navy fighters up to and through the F4F, as well as for the amphibious [[Grumman J2F]] utility biplane, was originally created in the 1920s by Leroy Grumman for [[Grover Loening]].<ref>[http://www.willyvictor.com/Biographies/waters.html \"Wayne Waters CDR USN(ret).\"] ''willyvictor.com.''</ref>{{refn|Quote: ...landing gear was almost identical to that in the J2F's.|group=N}} Landing accidents caused by failure of the main gear to fully lock into place were distressingly common.<ref>Tillman 1983, p. 12.</ref>\n\n[[File:F4F-3 in flight in summer of 1940.jpg|thumb|An early F4F-3 with [[Spinner (aeronautics)|prop spinner]] and cowl guns]]\n\nThe overall performance of Grumman's new monoplane was felt to be inferior to that of the Brewster Buffalo. The XF4F-2 was marginally faster, but the Buffalo was more maneuverable. It was judged superior and was chosen for production.<ref name=\"donald wildcat\"/> After losing out to Brewster, Grumman completely rebuilt the prototype as the XF4F-3 with new wings and tail and a supercharged version of the [[Pratt & Whitney]] R-1830 \"Twin Wasp\" radial engine.<ref name=\"donald wildcat\"/><ref name=\"green 4 F4f\">Green 1961, pp. 90\u201396.</ref> Testing of the new XF4F-3 led to an order for F4F-3 production models, the first of which was completed in February 1940. France also ordered the type, powered by a [[Wright R-1820]] \"Cyclone 9\" radial engine, but France fell to the Axis powers before they could be delivered and the aircraft went instead to the British Royal Navy, who christened the new fighter the [[Martlet]]. The U.S. Navy officially adopted the aircraft type on 1 October 1941 as the Wildcat. The Royal Navy's and U.S. Navy's F4F-3s, armed with four .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) Browning machine guns, joined active units in 1940.<ref name=\"green 4 F4f\"/>\n\nOn 16 December 1940, the XF4F-3 prototype, BuNo ''0383'', c/n 356, modified from XF4F-2, was lost under circumstances that suggested that the pilot may have been confused by the poor layout of fuel valves and flap controls and inadvertently turned the fuel valve to \"off\" immediately after takeoff rather than selecting flaps \"up\". This was the first fatality in the type.<ref>\"Grumman's Willing Wildcat\".

The Fulmar was a two-seat fighter with good range but operated at a performance disadvantage against single-seater fighters. Navalised [[Supermarine Seafire|Supermarine Spitfires]] were not available because of the greater need of the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref>Buttler 2004</ref> In the European theater, the Wildcat scored its first combat victory on [[Christmas Day]] 1940, when a land-based Martlet destroyed a [[Junkers Ju 88]] bomber over the [[Scapa Flow]] naval base.<ref name=\"thetp201\"/> This was the first combat victory by a US-built fighter in British service in World War II.<ref name=\"thetp201\">Thetford 1978, p. 201.</ref> The type also pioneered combat operations from the smaller [[escort carriers]].<ref name=\"EGustin\">Gustin Emmanuel.

At first, GM produced the '''FM-1''' (identical to the F4F-4, but with four guns). Production later switched to the improved '''FM-2''' (based on Grumman's XF4F-8 prototype, informally known as the \"Wilder Wildcat\") optimized for small-carrier operations, with a more powerful engine, and a taller tail to cope with the increased torque.<ref name=\"Fighting the U-boats\">Garner, Forest.

Larger fighters such as the Hellcat and the Corsair and dedicated dive bombers were needed aboard fleet carriers, and the Wildcat's slower landing speed made it more suitable for shorter flight decks.<ref name=\"Kinzey 2000, p. 68\">Kinzey 2000, p. 68.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Battle off Samar]] on 25 October 1944, escort carriers of Task Unit 77.4.3 (\"Taffy 3\") and their escort of destroyers and destroyer escorts found themselves as the sole force standing between vulnerable troop transport and supply ships engaged in landings on the Philippine island of Leyte and a powerful Japanese surface fleet of battleships and cruisers. In desperation, lightly armed [[Grumman Avenger|Avengers]] and FM-2 Wildcats from Taffys 1, 2 and 3 resorted to tactics such as strafing ships, including the bridge of the Japanese battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}, while the destroyers and destroyer escorts charged the enemy. Confused by the fierce resistance, and having suffered significant damage, the Japanese fleet eventually withdrew from the battle.\n\n====Atlantic====\nU.S. Navy Wildcats participated in [[Operation Torch]].

This design was still not competitive with the Brewster F2A Buffalo which won initial U.S. Navy orders, but when the '''F4F-3''' development was fitted with a more powerful version of the engine, a Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp R-1830-76, featuring a two-stage supercharger, it showed its true potential.<ref>Tillman 1983, p. 7.</ref>\n\n====F4F-3====\nU.S. Navy orders followed as did some (with [[Wright Cyclone]] engines) from France; these ended up with the [[Royal Navy]]'s Fleet Air Arm after the fall of France and entered service on 8 September 1940. These aircraft, designated by Grumman as '''G-36A''', had a different cowling from other earlier F4Fs and fixed wings, and were intended to be fitted with French armament and [[avionics]] following delivery. In British service initially, the aircraft were known as the '''Martlet I''', but not all Martlets would be to exactly the same specifications as U.S. Navy aircraft. All Martlet Is featured the four .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s of the F4F-3 with 450 rpg. The British directly ordered and received a version with the original Twin Wasp, but again with a modified [[cowling]], under the manufacturer designation '''G-36B'''. These aircraft were given the designation '''Martlet II''' by the British. The first 10 G-36Bs were fitted with non-[[folding wing]]s and were given the designation '''Martlet III'''.

The F4F-4 was the definitive version that saw the most combat service in the early war years, including the Battle of Midway. The F4F-3 was replaced by the F4F-4 in June 1942, during the Battle of Midway; only [[VMF-221]] still used them at that time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThis version was less popular with American pilots because the same amount of ammunition was spread over two additional guns, decreasing firing time.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ships/logs/CV/cv5-Midway.html \"F4F-4 Airplanes.\"] ''Battle of Midway Action Report, USS Yorktown (CV-5).'' Retrieved: 22 October 2010.</ref> With the F4F-3's four .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns and 450 rpg, pilots had 34 seconds of firing time; six guns decreased ammunition to 240 rpg, which could be expended in less than 20 seconds. The increase to six guns was attributed to the Royal Navy, who wanted greater firepower to deal with German and Italian foes. Jimmy Thach is quoted as saying, \"A pilot who cannot hit with four guns will miss with eight.\"<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_thatch_interview.asp \"Excerpts from a 1942 Interview with Lt. Cdr. John S. Thach.\"] ''microsoft.com.'' Retrieved: 22 October 2010.</ref> Extra guns and folding wings meant extra weight, and reduced performance: the F4F-4 was capable of only about {{convert|318|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|19400|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Rate of climb was noticeably worse in the F4F-4; while Grumman optimistically claimed the F4F-4 could climb at a modest {{convert|1950|ft|m|abbr=on}} per minute, in combat conditions, pilots found their F4F-4s capable of ascending at only {{convert|500|to|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} per minute.<ref name=\"Fighting the U-boats\"/> Moreover, the F4F-4's folding wing was intended to allow five F4F-4s to be stowed in the space required by two F4F-3s. In practice, the folding wings allowed an increase of about 50% in the number of Wildcats carried aboard U.S. fleet aircraft carriers. A variant of the F4F-4, designated '''F4F-4B''' for contractual purposes, was supplied to the British with a modified cowling and Wright Cyclone engine. These aircraft received the designation of '''Martlet IV'''.\n\n====F4F-5 Wildcat====\nTwo F4F-3s (the 3rd and 4th production aircraft, BuNo 1846/1847) were fitted with a [[Wright R-1820|Wright R-1820-40]] engine and designated XF4F-5.\n\n====FM-1/-2 Wildcat====\n[[File:Grumman F4F Wildcat in formation.jpg|thumb|FM-2s from {{USS|White Plains|CVE-66|2}}, in June 1944, with 58 gallon drop tanks]]\nGeneral Motors / Eastern Aircraft produced 5,280 FM variants of the Wildcat.<ref name=\"polmar\"/> Grumman's Wildcat production ceased in early 1943 to make way for the newer F6F Hellcat, but General Motors continued producing Wildcats for both U.S. Navy and Fleet Air Arm use. Late in the war, the Wildcat was obsolescent as a front line fighter compared to the faster (380&nbsp;mph/610&nbsp;km/h) F6F Hellcat or much faster (446&nbsp;mph/718&nbsp;km/h) F4U Corsair. However, they were adequate for small escort carriers against submarine and shore threats. These relatively modest ships only carried two types of aircraft, the Wildcats and GM-built TBM Avengers. The Wildcat's lower landing speed and ability to take off without a catapult made it more suitable for shorter flight decks.<ref name=\"Kinzey 2000, p. 68\"/> At first, GM produced the '''FM-1''', identical to the F4F-4, but reduced the number of guns to four, and added wing racks for two 250&nbsp;lb (110&nbsp;kg) bombs or six rockets. Production later switched to the improved '''FM-2''' (based on Grumman's XF4F-8 prototype) optimized for small-carrier operations, with a more powerful engine (the {{convert|1350|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Wright R-1820]]-56), and a taller tail to cope with the torque.<ref name=\"Fighting the U-boats\"/>\n\n====F4F-7====\nThe '''F4F-7''' was a photoreconnaissance variant, with armor and armament removed. It had non-folding \"wet\" wings that carried an additional 555&nbsp;gal (2,101&nbsp;L) of fuel for a total of about 700&nbsp;gal (2,650&nbsp;L), increasing its range to 3,700&nbsp;mi (5,955&nbsp;km). A total of 21 were built.<ref name=\"donald wildcat\"/>\n\n====F2M Wildcat====\nThe '''F2M-1''' was a planned development of the FM-1 by General Motors / Eastern Aircraft to be powered by the improved XR-1820-70 engine, but the project was cancelled before any aircraft were built.<ref name=\"EGustin\"/>\n\n===Royal Navy Martlets===\n====Martlet Mk I====\nAt the end of 1939, Grumman received a French order for 81 aircraft of model G-36A, to equip their new {{sclass-|Joffre|aircraft carrier}}s: {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|Joffre||2}} and {{Ship|French aircraft carrier|Painlev\u00e9||2}}. The main difference with the basic model G-36 was due to the unavailability for export of the two-stage supercharged engine of F4F-3. The G-36A was powered by the nine-cylinder, single-row [[Wright Cyclone|Wright R-1820-G205A]] radial engine, of {{convert|1200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and with a single-stage two-speed supercharger.<ref name=\"willing p52,60-1\">Green, Swanborough and Brown 1977, pp. 52, 60\u201361.</ref>\n\n[[File:Martlet at Grumman 1940.jpg|thumb|A G-36A at Grumman, 1940]]\n\nThe G-36A also had French [[Flight instruments|instruments]] (with metric calibration), radio and [[Sight (device)|gunsight]]. The throttle was modified to conform to French pre-war practice: the throttle lever was moved towards the pilot (i.e. backward) to increase engine power. The armament which was to be fitted in France was six 7.5&nbsp;mm (.296&nbsp;in) [[Darne machine gun]]s (two in the fuselage and four in the wings). The first G-36A was flown on 11 May 1940.<ref name=\"Wixley two p51\">Wixley ''Air Enthusiast'' July\u2013August 1997, p. 51.</ref> After France's defeat in the [[Battle of France]], all contracts were taken over by Britain. The throttle was modified again, four 0.50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns were installed in the wings and most traces of the original ownership removed.<ref name=\"Willing p61\">Green, Swanborough and Brown 1977, p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe Martlets were modified for British use by [[Blackburn Aircraft|Blackburn]], which continued to do this for all later marks.

The Martlet Mk I did not have a wing folding mechanism and was therefore used primarily from land bases, with the exception of 882 Sqn aboard ''Illustrious.''{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1940, Belgium also placed an order for at least 10 Martlet Mk 1s. These were to be modified with the removal of the tailhook. Belgium surrendered before any aircraft were delivered and by 10 May 1940, the aircraft order was transferred to the Royal Navy.\n\n====Martlet Mk II====\nBefore the Fleet Air Arm took on charge the Martlet Mk Is it had already ordered 100 G-36B fighters. The British chose the [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp|Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S3C4-G]] engine to power this aircraft; this too had a single-stage, two-speed supercharger. The FAA decided to accept a delay in delivery to get Martlets fitted out with the Grumman-designed and patented ''Sto-Wing'' folding wing system first fitted onto U.S. Navy F4F-4 Wildcats,<ref name=sto /> which were vitally important if the Martlet was to be used from the first 3 [[Illustrious-class aircraft carrier|Illustrious class]] carriers which had elevators that were too narrow to accommodate non-folding wing aircraft. Nevertheless, the first 10 received had fixed wings. The first Martlet with folding wings was not delivered until August 1941.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn contrast to the USN F4F-3, the British aircraft were fitted with armor and self-sealing fuel tanks. The Mk II also had a larger tailwheel. For carrier operations, the \"sting\" tail hook and attachment point for the American single-point catapult launch system were considered important advantages. Nevertheless, the Martlets were modified to have British-style catapult spools. Deliveries of the folding-wing G-36Bs began in August 1941, with 36 shipped to the UK and 54 shipped to the Far East; they were designated \"Martlet Mark II\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A&AEE) testing of the Martlet II at a mean weight of approximately 7,350&nbsp;lb showed a maximum speed of 293&nbsp;mph at 5,400&nbsp;ft and 13,800&nbsp;ft, a maximum climb rate of 1940 fpm at 7,600&nbsp;ft at 7,790&nbsp;lb weight, and a time to climb to 20,000&nbsp;ft of 12.5 minutes.

The first shipboard operations of the type in British service were in September 1941, aboard {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}}, a very small escort carrier with a carrier deck of {{convert|420|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|59|ft|m|abbr=on}}, no elevators and no hangar deck. The six Wildcats were parked on the deck at all times. On its first voyage, it served as escort carrier for a convoy to Gibraltar. On 20 September, a German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Fw 200]] was shot down. On the next voyage, four Fw 200 ''Condors'' fell to the guns of the Martlets, and of the combined total, two of these five Condors were shot down by [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric \"Winkle\" Brown]] during his time aboard. Operations from ''Audacity'' also demonstrated that the fighter cover was useful against U-boats. ''Audacity'' was sunk by a U-boat on 21 December 1941, with only Brown and one other pilot surviving,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30039300|title=Eric 'Winkle' Brown: The man who seemed not to notice danger|work=[[BBC News]]|last=Jones|first=Luke|date=November 14, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref> but it had already proved the usefulness of escort carriers.<ref name=\"Fighting the U-boats\"/>\n\nIn May 1942, 881 and 882 squadrons on {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} participated in operations against [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]].

However, at the defeat of Greece in April 1941 the aircraft had only reached Gibraltar. They were taken over by the FAA as Martlet Mk III(B). As these aircraft did not have folding wings, they were only used from land bases. They served in a shore-based role in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Wildcat Aces of World War 2|publisher=Osprey|isbn=1 85532 486 5|pages=71|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTen fixed-wing G-36Bs were used by the FAA as Martlet III(A).\n\n====Martlet Mk IV====\nThe Royal Navy purchased  220 F4F-4s adapted to British requirements. The main difference was the use of a Wright R-1820-40B Cyclone in a distinctly more rounded and compact cowling, with a single double-wide flap on each side of the rear and no lip intake. These machines were named Martlet Mk IV. [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment|Boscombe Down]] testing of the Martlet IV at 7,350&nbsp;lb weight showed a maximum speed of 278&nbsp;mph at 3,400&nbsp;ft and 298&nbsp;mph at 14,600&nbsp;ft, a maximum climb rate of 1580 fpm at 6,200&nbsp;ft at 7,740&nbsp;lb weight, and a time to climb to 20,000&nbsp;ft of 14.6 minutes.

In the late 19th century, it became the centre of the [[Albanian National Awakening]]. Following their defeat in the [[Balkan Wars]], the Ottomans [[Treaty of London (1913)|ceded]] Kosovo to Serbia and Montenegro.

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganized as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved.

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganized as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved.

Tambling remains Chelsea's all-time top scorer in league competition with 164 goals. After enjoying a successful career in the [[Football League]] during the 1960s and early 1970s, Tambling moved to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. He subsequently played for several clubs in the [[League of Ireland]] and also represented the [[League of Ireland XI]]. After retiring as a player he continued to live in Ireland, residing in [[Crosshaven]], [[County Cork]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Chelsea===\nA talented schoolboy footballer who played for England schoolboys, his signature as a professional player was sought out by several teams including [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and the club he supported as a boy, [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. Having met scout Jimmy Thompson and manager [[Ted Drake]] Tambling joined Chelsea as a fifteen-year-old in 1957.<ref name=Eire1>{{cite news|title=Royalty on the King's Road|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/columnists/kieran-shannon/royalty-on-the-kings-road-231004.html|accessdate=18 May 2013|newspaper=Www.irishexaminer.com|date=11 May 2013}}</ref>  He made his debut, aged seventeen in 1959 scoring in a 3-2 win against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=Cfcdebut>{{cite web|title=Chelsea v West Ham United 7 February 1959|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/chelsea-v-west-ham-united-07-february-1959-75456/|publisher=Www.11v11.com|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref>  Two years later, following the transfer of [[Jimmy Greaves]] to [[AC Milan]], he became Chelsea's main striker and was their leading goal scorer for five seasons in the 1960s.
