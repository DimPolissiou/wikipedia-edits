Wellman]] and stars [[James Cagney]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Edward Woods]], [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]], and [[Joan Blondell]]. The film relates the story of a young man's rise in the [[organized crime|criminal underworld]] in [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]-era urban America. The supporting players include [[Beryl Mercer]], [[Murray Kinnell]], and [[Mae Clarke]]. The screenplay is based on an unpublished novel\u2014''Beer and Blood'' by two former newspapermen, [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]\u2014who had witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]]. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Whiteley |first1=Chris |title=The Public Enemy (1931) |url=http://www.hollywoodsgoldenage.com/movies/the_public_enemy.html |website=Hollywood's Golden Age 2010-18 |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/3860?sid|title=AFI&#124;Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Public Enemy'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Public-Enemy-Cagney-Woods.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Cagney]] and [[Edward Woods]] in ''The Public Enemy'']]\nAs youngsters in 1900s Chicago, Irish-Americans Tom Powers ([[James Cagney]]) and his lifelong friend Matt Doyle ([[Edward Woods]]) engage in petty theft, selling their loot to \"Putty Nose\" ([[Murray Kinnell]]). Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang on a fur warehouse robbery, assuring them he will take care of them if anything goes wrong. When Tom is startled by a stuffed bear, he shoots it, alerting the police, who kill gang member Larry Dalton. Chased by a cop, Tom and Matt have to gun him down. However, when they go to Putty Nose for help, they find he has left town.\n\nTom's straightlaced older brother Mike Powers ([[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]]) tries, but fails, to talk Tom into giving up crime. Tom keeps his activities secret from his doting mother ([[Beryl Mercer]]). When America enters [[World War I]] in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines.\n\nIn 1920, with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan ([[Robert Emmett O'Connor]]) recruits Tom and Matt as beer \"salesmen\" (enforcers) in his [[Rum-runner|bootlegging]] business. He allies himself with noted gangster Samuel \"Nails\" Nathan ([[Leslie Fenton]]). As the bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth.\n\n[[File:L'Ennemi Public.png|thumb|James Cagney in ''The Public Enemy'']]\n\nMike finds out that his brother's money comes not from politics, as Tom claims, but from bootlegging, and declares that Tom's success is based on nothing more than \"beer and blood\" (the title of the book upon which the film is based). Tom retorts in disgust: \"Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.\"\n\nTom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty (an uncredited [[Mae Clarke]]) and Mamie ([[Joan Blondell]]) respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; in a famous scene, when she complains once too often, he angrily pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen ([[Jean Harlow]]), a woman with a self-confessed weakness for bad men. At a restaurant on the night of Matt's wedding reception to Mamie, Tom and Matt recognize Putty Nose and follow him home. Begging for his life, Putty plays a song on the piano that he had entertained Tom and Matt with when they were kids. Tom shoots him in the back.\n\nTom gives his mother a large wad of money, but Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother's face. \"Nails\" Nathan dies in a horse riding accident, prompting Tom to find the horse and shoot it. A rival gang headed by \"Schemer\" Burns takes advantage of the disarray resulting from Nathan's death, precipitating a gang war.\n\nLater, Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. Tom is seriously wounded in the shootout, and ends up in the hospital. When his mother, brother, and Matt's sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, Paddy warns Mike that Tom has been kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital. Later, his dead body is returned to the Powers home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Cagney]] as Tom Powers\n* [[Jean Harlow]] as Gwen Allen\n* [[Edward Woods]] as Matt Doyle\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Mamie\n* [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] as Mike Powers\n* [[Leslie Fenton]] as Nails Nathan\n* [[Beryl Mercer]] as Ma Powers\n* [[Robert Emmett O'Connor]] as Paddy Ryan\n* [[Murray Kinnell]] as Putty Nose\n* [[Mae Clarke]] as Kitty (uncredited) \n* [[Frank Coghlan Jr.]] as Tom as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Frankie Darro]] as Matt as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Robert Homans]] as Officer Pat Burke (uncredited) \n* [[Sam McDaniel]] as Headwaiter (uncredited)\n* [[Mia Marvin]] as Paddy Ryan's girlfriend (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThe screenplay which was written by Harvey F. Thew was based on a novel which was never published called ''Beer and Blood'', by [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]. Bright and Glasmon based their novel on actual people, having witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]]. [[Warner Bros.]] studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] bought the rights to the novel and assigned director [[William A. Wellman]] to direct the film. Wellman, who had served in World War I like the brother of the main character, told Zanuck: \"I'll bring you the toughest, most violent picture you ever did see\".\n\n===Casting===\n[[Edward Woods]] was originally cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and [[James Cagney]] was cast as Tom's best friend Matt Doyle, until director Wellman decided Cagney would be more effective in the part and switched the two actors<ref name=greatest_films/> but never reshot the sequences with the characters as children, which is why the child playing Cagney's role looks like Woods while the one playing Woods' role looks like Cagney. Another reason for the switch is that the sound technology used in ''The Public Enemy'' was superior to that used in earlier films, making it no longer imperative to have an actor in the lead role who had impeccable enunciation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Louise Brooks]] was the original choice for Gwen Allen, a woman with self-confessed weakness for bad men. She refused the role, which went to a younger actress, [[Jean Harlow]]. Brooks' name was in studio records/casting call lists playing \"Bess\" in this movie, but she and her character did not appear. Brooks later explained herself to Wellman (who had directed her in ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928)) by saying that she hated making pictures because she simply \"hated [[Hollywood]]\".<ref name=\"paris359\">Paris (1989), p. 359</ref> In the opinion of Brooks's biographer [[Barry Paris]], \"turning down ''Public Enemy'' marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career\".<ref name=\"paris359\"/>\n\nTom's first girlfriend Kitty was played by [[Mae Clarke]], who was uncredited. Kitty is eventually dropped off by Tom for Gwen after he pushes half a grapefruit into her face, the most famous scene in the movie. [[Joan Blondell]] played Mamie, Matt's girlfriend. She had already worked with Cagney in ''[[Sinners' Holiday]]'' (1930) and would work with him on two films which also came out this year: ''[[God's Gift in Women]]'' and ''[[Blonde Crazy]]''. Other films that they worked together on were ''[[The Crowd Roars (1932 film)|The Crowd Roars]]'' (1932), ''[[Footlight Parade]]'' (1933) and ''[[He Was Her Man]]'' (1934). Cagney once said that Blondell was the only woman he loved besides his wife. [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] played Tom's brother, Mike.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in January and February 1931, with a small budget of $151,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022286/business|title=Business Data for The Public Enemy (1931)|accessdate=2006-12-09|format=|work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> During filming, Cagney also made ''[[Smart Money (1931 film)|Smart Money]]'', co-starring [[Edward G. Robinson]], who had finished his breakthrough film ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]''.\n\nIn the scene where Mike Powers punches his brother Tom,  Wellman privately took Donald Cook aside and, explaining his desire for authenticity in Tom's reaction, asked the actor to really hit Cagney. Cook played his part a bit too well, and he struck Cagney in the mouth with such force, he actually broke one of Cagney's teeth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Yet in spite of his genuine shock and pain, Cagney stayed in character and played out the rest of the scene. In another incident, live ammunition was used in a scene where Tom Powers ducks around the corner of a building to take cover from machine gun fire; the use of live ammunition was common practice at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The bullets struck the wall of the building at the position where Cagney's head had been just a moment before.<ref>Watson, Teresa.

Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion; he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|title=1978 interview with Wellman|accessdate=2008-06-05|work=Film Comment|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609102549/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|archivedate=2008-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=653428|title=The Men Who Made the Movies: William Wellman|accessdate=2008-06-05|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref>\n\nSome, such as film critic [[Ben Mankiewicz]], have asserted that Mae Clarke's surprised and seemingly somewhat angry reaction to the grapefruit was genuine, as she hadn't been told to expect the unscripted action.<ref>[[Turner Classic Movies]] (October 17, 2010). ''The Public Enemy''</ref> However, in her autobiography, Clarke stated that Cagney had told her prior to that take what he planned to do. She said that her only genuine surprise came later, when she saw the grapefruit take of the scene appear in the final film, as it had been her understanding that they were shooting it only as a joke to amuse the crew.<ref>Clarke, Mae.

In 2001, the ''[[The Sopranos|Sopranos]]'' episode \"[[Proshai, Livushka]]\" references scenes from the film which cause title character [[Tony Soprano]] to become overwhelmed by feelings of grief following his mother's death. In 2003 the character of Tom Powers was among the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]], placing 42nd in the villain list.

When America enters [[World War I]] in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines.\n\nIn 1920, with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan ([[Robert Emmett O'Connor]]) recruits Tom and Matt as beer \"salesmen\" (enforcers) in his [[Rum-runner|bootlegging]] business. He allies himself with noted gangster Samuel \"Nails\" Nathan ([[Leslie Fenton]]). As the bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth.\n\n[[File:L'Ennemi Public.png|thumb|James Cagney in ''The Public Enemy'']]\n\nMike finds out that his brother's money comes not from politics, as Tom claims, but from bootlegging, and declares that Tom's success is based on nothing more than \"beer and blood\" (the title of the book upon which the film is based). Tom retorts in disgust: \"Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.\"\n\nTom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty (an uncredited [[Mae Clarke]]) and Mamie ([[Joan Blondell]]) respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; in a famous scene, when she complains once too often, he angrily pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen ([[Jean Harlow]]), a woman with a self-confessed weakness for bad men. At a restaurant on the night of Matt's wedding reception to Mamie, Tom and Matt recognize Putty Nose and follow him home. Begging for his life, Putty plays a song on the piano that he had entertained Tom and Matt with when they were kids. Tom shoots him in the back.\n\nTom gives his mother a large wad of money, but Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother's face. \"Nails\" Nathan dies in a horse riding accident, prompting Tom to find the horse and shoot it. A rival gang headed by \"Schemer\" Burns takes advantage of the disarray resulting from Nathan's death, precipitating a gang war.\n\nLater, Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. Tom is seriously wounded in the shootout, and ends up in the hospital. When his mother, brother, and Matt's sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, Paddy warns Mike that Tom has been kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital. Later, his dead body is returned to the Powers home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Cagney]] as Tom Powers\n* [[Jean Harlow]] as Gwen Allen\n* [[Edward Woods]] as Matt Doyle\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Mamie\n* [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] as Mike Powers\n* [[Leslie Fenton]] as Nails Nathan\n* [[Beryl Mercer]] as Ma Powers\n* [[Robert Emmett O'Connor]] as Paddy Ryan\n* [[Murray Kinnell]] as Putty Nose\n* [[Mae Clarke]] as Kitty (uncredited) \n* [[Frank Coghlan Jr.]] as Tom as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Frankie Darro]] as Matt as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Robert Homans]] as Officer Pat Burke (uncredited) \n* [[Sam McDaniel]] as Headwaiter (uncredited)\n* [[Mia Marvin]] as Paddy Ryan's girlfriend (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThe screenplay which was written by Harvey F. Thew was based on a novel which was never published called ''Beer and Blood'', by [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]. Bright and Glasmon based their novel on actual people, having witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]]. [[Warner Bros.]] studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] bought the rights to the novel and assigned director [[William A. Wellman]] to direct the film. Wellman, who had served in World War I like the brother of the main character, told Zanuck: \"I'll bring you the toughest, most violent picture you ever did see\".\n\n===Casting===\n[[Edward Woods]] was originally cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and [[James Cagney]] was cast as Tom's best friend Matt Doyle, until director Wellman decided Cagney would be more effective in the part and switched the two actors<ref name=greatest_films/> but never reshot the sequences with the characters as children, which is why the child playing Cagney's role looks like Woods while the one playing Woods' role looks like Cagney. Another reason for the switch is that the sound technology used in ''The Public Enemy'' was superior to that used in earlier films, making it no longer imperative to have an actor in the lead role who had impeccable enunciation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Louise Brooks]] was the original choice for Gwen Allen, a woman with self-confessed weakness for bad men. She refused the role, which went to a younger actress, [[Jean Harlow]]. Brooks' name was in studio records/casting call lists playing \"Bess\" in this movie, but she and her character did not appear. Brooks later explained herself to Wellman (who had directed her in ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928)) by saying that she hated making pictures because she simply \"hated [[Hollywood]]\".<ref name=\"paris359\">Paris (1989), p. 359</ref> In the opinion of Brooks's biographer [[Barry Paris]], \"turning down ''Public Enemy'' marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career\".<ref name=\"paris359\"/>\n\nTom's first girlfriend Kitty was played by [[Mae Clarke]], who was uncredited. Kitty is eventually dropped off by Tom for Gwen after he pushes half a grapefruit into her face, the most famous scene in the movie. [[Joan Blondell]] played Mamie, Matt's girlfriend. She had already worked with Cagney in ''[[Sinners' Holiday]]'' (1930) and would work with him on two films which also came out this year: ''[[God's Gift in Women]]'' and ''[[Blonde Crazy]]''. Other films that they worked together on were ''[[The Crowd Roars (1932 film)|The Crowd Roars]]'' (1932), ''[[Footlight Parade]]'' (1933) and ''[[He Was Her Man]]'' (1934). Cagney once said that Blondell was the only woman he loved besides his wife. [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] played Tom's brother, Mike.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in January and February 1931, with a small budget of $151,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022286/business|title=Business Data for The Public Enemy (1931)|accessdate=2006-12-09|format=|work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> During filming, Cagney also made ''[[Smart Money (1931 film)|Smart Money]]'', co-starring [[Edward G. Robinson]], who had finished his breakthrough film ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]''.\n\nIn the scene where Mike Powers punches his brother Tom,  Wellman privately took Donald Cook aside and, explaining his desire for authenticity in Tom's reaction, asked the actor to really hit Cagney. Cook played his part a bit too well, and he struck Cagney in the mouth with such force, he actually broke one of Cagney's teeth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Yet in spite of his genuine shock and pain, Cagney stayed in character and played out the rest of the scene. In another incident, live ammunition was used in a scene where Tom Powers ducks around the corner of a building to take cover from machine gun fire; the use of live ammunition was common practice at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The bullets struck the wall of the building at the position where Cagney's head had been just a moment prior.<ref>Watson, Teresa.

Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion; he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|title=1978 interview with Wellman|accessdate=2008-06-05|work=Film Comment|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609102549/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|archivedate=2008-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=653428|title=The Men Who Made the Movies: William Wellman|accessdate=2008-06-05|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref>\n\nSome, such as film critic [[Ben Mankiewicz]], have asserted that Mae Clarke's surprised and seemingly somewhat angry reaction to the grapefruit was genuine, as she hadn't been told to expect the unscripted action.<ref>[[Turner Classic Movies]] (October 17, 2010). ''The Public Enemy''</ref> However, in her autobiography, Clarke stated that Cagney had told her prior to that take what he planned to do.

She then moved to India and started living with her mother-in-law, the then-[[Prime Minister of India]], [[Indira Gandhi]], at the latter's [[New Delhi]] residence. Sonia Gandhi, however, kept away from the [[public sphere]], even during the years of her husband's premiership.\n\nFollowing her husband's assassination, Gandhi was invited by Congress leaders to lead the party, but she declined.

Illustration from the 1876 edition by artist [[True Williams]].]]\n\nTom Sawyer, an orphan, lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri sometime in the 1840s. A fun-loving boy, Tom skips school to go swimming and is made to whitewash his aunt's fence for the entirety of the next day, Saturday, as punishment.\n\nIn one of the most famous scenes in American literature, Tom cleverly persuades the various neighbourhood children to trade him small trinkets and treasures for the \"privilege\" of doing his tedious work, using reverse psychology to convince them it is an enjoyable activity. Tom later trades the trinkets with other students for various denominations of tickets, obtained at the local Sunday school for memorizing verses of Scripture; he cashes these into the minister to win a much-coveted Bible offered to studious children as a prize, despite being one of the worst students in the Sunday school and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.\n\nTom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town and the daughter of a prominent judge. Tom wins the admiration of the judge in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize but reveals his ignorance when he is unable to answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get \"engaged\" by kissing him. However, their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was previously \"engaged\" to another schoolgirl, Amy Lawrence and that Becky was not his first girlfriend.\n\nShortly after Becky shuns him, Tom accompanies Huckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform a superstitious ritual designed to heal warts. At the graveyard, they witness a trio of body snatchers, Dr Robinson, Muff Potter, and Injun Joe, robbing a grave. Muff Potter is drunk and eventually blacks out, while Injun Joe gets into a fight with Dr Robinson and murders him. Injun Joe then appears to frame Muff Potter for the murder. Tom and Huckleberry Finn swear a blood oath not to tell anyone about the murder, fearing Injun Joe would somehow discover it was them and murder them in turn. Muff Potter is eventually jailed, assuming he committed the killing in an act of drunkenness and accepting of his guilt and fate.\n\nTom grows bored by school, and along with his best friend Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn, they run away to Jackson's Island in the Mississippi River to begin life as \"pirates\". While enjoying their new-found freedom, they become aware that the community is sounding the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing and presumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion, and after a brief moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, he is struck by the grand idea of appearing at his funeral. The trio later carries out this scheme, making a sensational and sudden appearance at church in the middle of their joint funeral service, winning the immense respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Tom regains Becky's favour after he nobly accepts the blame and caning punishment for a book she has ripped.\n\nIn court, Injun Joe pins the murder on Muff Potter, although Tom and Huckleberry Finn know he is innocent. At Potter's trial, Tom decides to defy his blood oath with Huck and speaks out against Injun Joe, who quickly escapes through a window before he can be apprehended. Henceforth, the boys live in constant fear of Joe's revenge on them for incriminating him.\n\nSummer arrives, and Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in a haunted house. After venturing upstairs, they hear a noise below, and peering through holes in the floor, they see the deaf-mute Spaniard who had shown up in the village some weeks before revealing himself to be Injun Joe. Speaking freely, Injun Joe and a companion plan to bury some stolen treasure of their own in the house. From their hiding spot, Tom and Huck wriggle with delight at the prospect of digging it up. However, by chance, the villains discover an even greater gold hoard buried in the hearth and carry it off to a better secret hiding place. The boys are determined to find where it has gone, and one night, Huck spots them and follows them. He overhears Injun Joe's plans to break into the house of the wealthy Widow Douglas and mutilate her face, an act of revenge for her late husband, a justice of the peace, having once ordered him to be publicly whipped for vagrancy. Running to fetch help, Huck prevents the crime and requests his name not be made public, for fear of Injun Joe's retaliation, thus becoming an anonymous hero.\n\nIn the meantime, Tom goes on a picnic to McDougal's Cave with Becky and their classmates. However, Tom and Becky get lost and end up wandering in the extensive cave complex for several days, facing starvation and dehydration. Becky becomes extremely dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way outgrows more desperate. He accidentally encounters Injun Joe in the caves one day but is not seen by his nemesis. Eventually, Tom finds a way out, and they are joyfully welcomed back by their community. As a preventive measure, Judge Thatcher, Becky's father, has McDougal's Cave sealed off with an iron door. When Tom hears of the sealing two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe's corpse just inside the sealed entrance, starved to death after having desperately consumed raw bats and candle stubs as a last resort. The place of his death, and specifically the in situ cups he used to collect water from a dripping stalactite, becomes a local tourist attraction. Tom and others in the town feel pity at the cruel death, despite Injun Joe's wickedness, and a petition is started to the governor to posthumously pardon him.\n\nA week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence at McDougal's Cave that the villain must have hidden the stolen gold inside, Tom takes Huck to the cave and they find the box of gold, the proceeds of which are invested for them. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, but he finds the restrictions of a civilized home life painful, attempting to escape back to his vagrant life. Tom tricks him into thinking that he can later join Tom's new scheme of starting a robber band if he returns to the widow. Reluctantly, Huck agrees and goes back to the widow.\n\n== Significance ==\nThe novel has elements of humour, satire and social criticism; features that later made [[Mark Twain]] one of the most important authors of [[American literature]]. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel is set around Twain's actual boyhood home of [[Hannibal, Missouri|Hannibal]], near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rsS9HZKKW5cC&lpg=PA60&dq=hannibal%20twain%20tourism&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Politics of Public Memory: Tourism, History, and Ethnicity in Monterey, California|last=Norkunas|first=Martha K.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0791414842|location=|pages=60}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of what boyhood is<!--not a mistake--> is developed through Tom's actions as well as his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was, [http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47db-ca4d-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99 The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs], shows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys. \n<ref>{{cite web |title=Leedle Yawcob Strauss |url=http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47db-ca4d-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99 |website=THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY DIGITAL COLLECTIONS |publisher=L. Prang & Co. |accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Inception ==\n''Tom Sawyer'' is Twain's first attempt to write a novel on his own. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (''[[The Innocents Abroad|The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress]]'', ''Roughing It'') and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These are ''The Story of the Good Boy'' and ''The Story of the Wicked Little Boy'' which are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.\n\nBy the time he wrote ''Tom Sawyer'', Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity of ''The Innocents Abroad.'' He owned a large house in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel with [[Charles Dudley Warner]], ''[[The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today|The Gilded Age]]'' published in 1874.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MKxbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1386&dq=Charles+Dudley+Warner+,+The+Golden+Age+twain&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Charles%20Dudley%20Warner%20%2C%20The%20Golden%20Age%20twain&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of American Literature|last=Gailey|first=Amanda|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=The Gilded Age : A Tale of Today}}</ref>\n\nHe had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.\n\nTwain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-Adventures-of-the-Real-Tom-Sawyer-169773916.html?c=y&story=fullstory|title=The Adventures of the Real Tom Sawyer|last=Graysmith|first=Robert|date=October 2012|newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\n[[File:The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and title page of the first American edition]]\n\nIn November 1875 Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of the [[American Publishing Company]], who sent it to [[True Williams]] for the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published at [[Chatto & Windus|Chatto and Windus]] of London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/marktwainsletter0000twai_z2u8 |url-access=registration |quote=tom sawyer chatto and windus 1876. |title=Mark Twain's Letters to his Publishers 1867-1894 |last=Twain |first=Mark |editor-first=Hamlin Lewis |editor-last=Hill |year=1967 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=| location= Berkeley, California}}</ref>\n\nThese two editions differ slightly. After completing his manuscript, Twain had a copy made of it. It is this copy which was read and annotated by his friend [[William Dean Howells]]. Howells and Twain corresponded through fairly informal, handwritten letters discussing many aspects of his works and manuscripts; language choices, character development, as well as racial development and depiction. Twain then made his own corrections based on Howells' comments which he later incorporated in the original manuscript, but some corrections escaped him. The English edition was based on this corrected copy, while the illustrated American edition was based on the original manuscript. To further complicate matters, Twain was personally concerned with the revision of the proofs of the American edition, which he did not do for the English edition. The American edition is therefore considered the authoritative edition.\n\n== Critical analysis ==\nA [[Narration|third person]] narrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel, ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', Mark Twain changes to a [[First-person narrative|first person narrative]] which takes moral conflicts more personally and thus makes greater social criticism possible.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jR9Y9Vd_8qMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Critical+analysis++tom+sawyer#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Social Criticism in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn|last=Gro\u00df-Langenhoff|first=Barbara|publisher=GRIN Verlag|year=2006|isbn=978-3638456821|location=|pages=}}</ref> The two others subsequent books, ''[[Tom Sawyer Abroad]]'' and ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'', are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.\n\nThe book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet \"[[nigger]]\"; a [[expurgation|bowdlerized]] version aroused indignation among some literary critics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/opinion/06thu4.html|title=Opinion {{!}} That\u2019s Not Twain|date=2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe book has also gotten criticism for the caricature-like portrayal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] through the character [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Injun Joe|Injun Joe]]. He  is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction. Revard suggests that the adults in the novel blame the character's Indian blood as the cause of his evil.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Revard|first=Carter|date=1999|title=Why Mark Twain Murdered Injun Joe: And Will Never Be Indicted.|journal=The Massachusetts Review|volume=40 no. 4|issue=4|pages=643\u2013670|jstor=25091596}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels and other works featuring Tom Sawyer==\n* ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884)\n* ''[[Tom Sawyer Abroad]]'' (1894)\n* ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'' (1896)\n\n[[Tom Sawyer]], the story's title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels: ''Huck and Tom Among the Indians'' and ''Tom Sawyer's Conspiracy''.

Illustration from the 1876 edition by artist [[True Williams]].]]\n\nTom Sawyer, an orphan, lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri sometime in the 1840s. A fun-loving boy, Tom skips school to go swimming and is made to whitewash his aunt's fence for the entirety of the next day, Saturday, as punishment.\n\nIn one of the most famous scenes in American literature, Tom cleverly persuades the various neighbourhood children to trade him small trinkets and treasures for the \"privilege\" of doing his tedious work, using reverse psychology to convince them it is an enjoyable activity. Tom later trades the trinkets with other students for various denominations of tickets, obtained at the local Sunday school for memorizing verses of Scripture; he cashes these into the minister to win a much-coveted Bible offered to studious children as a prize, despite being one of the worst students in the Sunday school and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.\n\nTom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town and the daughter of a prominent judge. Tom wins the admiration of the judge in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize but reveals his ignorance when he is unable to answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get \"engaged\" by kissing him. However, their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was previously \"engaged\" to another schoolgirl, Amy Lawrence and that Becky was not his first girlfriend.\n\nShortly after Becky shuns him, Tom accompanies Huckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform a superstitious ritual designed to heal warts. At the graveyard, they witness a trio of body snatchers, Dr Robinson, Muff Potter, and Injun Joe, robbing a grave. Muff Potter is drunk and eventually blacks out, while Injun Joe gets into a fight with Dr Robinson and murders him. Injun Joe then appears to frame Muff Potter for the murder. Tom and Huckleberry Finn swear a blood oath not to tell anyone about the murder, fearing Injun Joe would somehow discover it was them and murder them in turn. Muff Potter is eventually jailed, assuming he committed the killing in an act of drunkenness and accepting of his guilt and fate.\n\nTom grows bored by school, and along with his best friend Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn, they run away to Jackson's Island in the Mississippi River to begin life as \"pirates\". While enjoying their new-found freedom, they become aware that the community is sounding the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing and presumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion, and after a brief moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, he is struck by the grand idea of appearing at his funeral. The trio later carries out this scheme, making a sensational and sudden appearance at church in the middle of their joint funeral service, winning the immense respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Tom regains Becky's favour after he nobly accepts the blame and caning punishment for a book she has ripped.\n\nIn court, Injun Joe pins the murder on Muff Potter, although Tom and Huckleberry Finn know he is innocent. At Potter's trial, Tom decides to defy his blood oath with Huck and speaks out against Injun Joe, who quickly escapes through a window before he can be apprehended. Henceforth, the boys live in constant fear of Joe's revenge on them for incriminating him.\n\nSummer arrives, and Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in a haunted house. After venturing upstairs, they hear a noise below, and peering through holes in the floor, they see the deaf-mute Spaniard who had shown up in the village some weeks before revealing himself to be Injun Joe. Speaking freely, Injun Joe and a companion plan to bury some stolen treasure of their own in the house. From their hiding spot, Tom and Huck wriggle with delight at the prospect of digging it up. However, by chance, the villains discover an even greater gold hoard buried in the hearth and carry it off to a better secret hiding place. The boys are determined to find where it has gone, and one night, Huck spots them and follows them. He overhears Injun Joe's plans to break into the house of the wealthy Widow Douglas and mutilate her face, an act of revenge for her late husband, a justice of the peace, having once ordered him to be publicly whipped for vagrancy. Running to fetch help, Huck prevents the crime and requests his name not be made public, for fear of Injun Joe's retaliation, thus becoming an anonymous hero.\n\nIn the meantime, Tom goes on a picnic to McDougal's Cave with Becky and their classmates. However, Tom and Becky get lost and end up wandering in the extensive cave complex for several days, facing starvation and dehydration. Becky becomes extremely dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way outgrows more desperate. He accidentally encounters Injun Joe in the caves one day but is not seen by his nemesis. Eventually, Tom finds a way out, and they are joyfully welcomed back by their community. As a preventive measure, Judge Thatcher, Becky's father, has McDougal's Cave sealed off with an iron door. When Tom hears of the sealing two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe's corpse just inside the sealed entrance, starved to death after having desperately consumed raw bats and candle stubs as a last resort. The place of his death, and specifically the in situ cups he used to collect water from a dripping stalactite, becomes a local tourist attraction. Tom and others in the town feel pity at the cruel death, despite Injun Joe's wickedness, and a petition is started to the governor to posthumously pardon him.\n\nA week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence at McDougal's Cave that the villain must have hidden the stolen gold inside, Tom takes Huck to the cave and they find the box of gold, the proceeds of which are invested for them. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, but he finds the restrictions of a civilized home life painful, attempting to escape back to his vagrant life. Tom tricks him into thinking that he can later join Tom's new scheme of starting a robber band if he returns to the widow. Reluctantly, Huck agrees and goes back to the widow.\n\n== Significance ==\nThe novel has elements of humour, satire and social criticism; features that later made [[Mark Twain]] one of the most important authors of [[American literature]]. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel is set around Twain's actual boyhood home of [[Hannibal, Missouri|Hannibal]], near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rsS9HZKKW5cC&lpg=PA60&dq=hannibal%20twain%20tourism&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Politics of Public Memory: Tourism, History, and Ethnicity in Monterey, California|last=Norkunas|first=Martha K.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0791414842|location=|pages=60}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of what boyhood is<!--not a mistake--> is developed through Tom's actions as well as his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry.

Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs], shows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys. \n<ref>{{cite web |title=Leedle Yawcob Strauss |url=http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47db-ca4d-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99 |website=THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY DIGITAL COLLECTIONS |publisher=L. Prang & Co. |accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Inception ==\n''Tom Sawyer'' is Twain's first attempt to write a novel on his own. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (''[[The Innocents Abroad|The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress]]'', ''Roughing It'') and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These are ''The Story of the Good Boy'' and ''The Story of the Wicked Little Boy'' which are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.\n\nBy the time he wrote ''Tom Sawyer'', Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity of ''The Innocents Abroad.'' He owned a large house in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel with [[Charles Dudley Warner]], ''[[The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today|The Gilded Age]]'' published in 1874.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MKxbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1386&dq=Charles+Dudley+Warner+,+The+Golden+Age+twain&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Charles%20Dudley%20Warner%20%2C%20The%20Golden%20Age%20twain&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of American Literature|last=Gailey|first=Amanda|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=The Gilded Age : A Tale of Today}}</ref>\n\nHe had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.\n\nTwain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-Adventures-of-the-Real-Tom-Sawyer-169773916.html?c=y&story=fullstory|title=The Adventures of the Real Tom Sawyer|last=Graysmith|first=Robert|date=October 2012|newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\n[[File:The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and title page of the first American edition]]\n\nIn November 1875 Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of the [[American Publishing Company]], who sent it to [[True Williams]] for the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published at [[Chatto & Windus|Chatto and Windus]] of London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/marktwainsletter0000twai_z2u8 |url-access=registration |quote=tom sawyer chatto and windus 1876. |title=Mark Twain's Letters to his Publishers 1867-1894 |last=Twain |first=Mark |editor-first=Hamlin Lewis |editor-last=Hill |year=1967 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=| location= Berkeley, California}}</ref>\n\nThese two editions differ slightly. After completing his manuscript, Twain had a copy made of it. It is this copy which was read and annotated by his friend [[William Dean Howells]]. Howells and Twain corresponded through fairly informal, handwritten letters discussing many aspects of his works and manuscripts; language choices, character development, as well as racial development and depiction. Twain then made his own corrections based on Howells' comments which he later incorporated in the original manuscript, but some corrections escaped him. The English edition was based on this corrected copy, while the illustrated American edition was based on the original manuscript. To further complicate matters, Twain was personally concerned with the revision of the proofs of the American edition, which he did not do for the English edition. The American edition is therefore considered the authoritative edition.\n\n== Critical analysis ==\nA [[Narration|third person]] narrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel, ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', Mark Twain changes to a [[First-person narrative|first person narrative]] which takes moral conflicts more personally and thus makes greater social criticism possible.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jR9Y9Vd_8qMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Critical+analysis++tom+sawyer#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Social Criticism in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn|last=Gro\u00df-Langenhoff|first=Barbara|publisher=GRIN Verlag|year=2006|isbn=978-3638456821|location=|pages=}}</ref> The two others subsequent books, ''[[Tom Sawyer Abroad]]'' and ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'', are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.\n\nThe book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet \"[[nigger]]\"; a [[expurgation|bowdlerized]] version aroused indignation among some literary critics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/opinion/06thu4.html|title=Opinion {{!}} That\u2019s Not Twain|date=2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe book has also gotten criticism for the caricature-like portrayal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] through the character [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Injun Joe|Injun Joe]]. He  is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction.
