Both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the Cold War,<ref name=\":2\" /> writing books on the subject in the 1990s\u2014''[[Diplomacy (book)|Diplomacy]]'' and ''[[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives]]''.<ref name=\":5\" /> The Anglo-American classical geopolitical theories were revived.\n\nKissinger argued against the belief that with the dissolution of the USSR, hostile intentions had come to an end and traditional foreign policy considerations no longer applied. \"They would argue \u2026 that Russia, regardless of who govern it, sits astride the territory Halford Mackinder called the geopolitical heartland, and is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions.\" Therefore the United States must \"maintain the global balance of power vis-\u00e0-vis the country with a long history of expansionism.\"<ref>Kissinger, Henry, (1994).

During the Cold War, Kissinger argues, both sides of the Atlantic recognized that, \"unless America is organically involved in Europe, it would be obliged to involve itself later under circumstances far less favorable to both sides of the Atlantic. That is even more true today. Germany has become so strong that existing European institutions cannot by themselves strike a balance between Germany and its European partners.

Mackinder's doctrine of geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed to the notion of Alfred Thayer Mahan about the significance of navies (he coined the term ''sea power'') in world conflict. He saw navy as a basis of Colombian era empire (roughly from 1492 to the 19th century), and predicted the 20th century to be domain of land power. The Heartland theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the Heartland\u2014which wouldn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent. The basic notions of Mackinder's doctrine involve considering the geography of the Earth as being divided into two sections: the [[Afro-Eurasia|World Island]] or Core, comprising [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]]; and the Peripheral \"islands\", including the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], the [[British Isles]], and [[Oceania]]. Not only was the Periphery noticeably smaller than the World Island, it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the technological level of the World Island\u2014which contained sufficient natural resources for a developed economy.\n\nMackinder posited that the industrial centers of the Periphery were necessarily located in widely separated locations. The World Island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn, and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the Periphery (so they would have a longer struggle reaching them, and would face a well-stocked industrial bastion). Mackinder called this region the ''Heartland''. It essentially comprised [[Central and Eastern Europe]]: [[Ukraine]], Western [[Russia]], and [[Mitteleuropa]].<ref>See map in Polelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hp1-oyQjqTgC&lpg=PA57&hl=cs&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false Raising Cartographic Consciousness], p. 57.</ref> The Heartland contained the grain reserves of Ukraine, and many other natural resources. Mackinder's notion of geopolitics was summed up when he said:\n\n{{blockquote|Who rules Central and Eastern Europe commands the Heartland. Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island. Who rules the World-Island commands the World.}}\n\n[[Nicholas J. Spykman]] was both a follower and critic of geostrategists Alfred Mahan, and Halford Mackinder. His work was based on assumptions similar to Mackinder's,<ref name=\":2\" /> including the unity of world politics and the world sea. He extends this to include the unity of the air. Spykman adopts Mackinder's divisions of the world, renaming some:\n#The [[Theory of the Heartland|Heartland]];\n#The [[Rimland]] (analogous to Mackinder's \"inner or marginal crescent\" also an intermediate region, lying between the Heartland and the marginal sea powers); and\n#The Offshore Islands & Continents (Mackinder's \"outer or insular crescent\").<ref>See map in Polelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hp1-oyQjqTgC&lpg=PA118&hl=cs&pg=PA118#v=onepage&q&f=false Raising Cartographic Consciousness], p. 118.</ref>\n\nUnder Spykman's theory, a Rimland separates the Heartland from ports that are usable throughout the year (that is, not frozen up during winter). Spykman suggested this required that attempts by Heartland nations (particularly [[Russia]]) to conquer ports in the Rimland must be prevented. Spykman modified Mackinder's formula on the relationship between the Heartland and the Rimland (or the inner crescent), claiming that \"Who controls the rimland rules Eurasia.  Who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world.\" This theory can be traced in the origins of [[containment]], a U.S. policy on preventing the spread of Soviet influence after World War II (see also [[Truman Doctrine]]).\n\nAnother famous follower of Mackinder was [[Karl Haushofer]] who called Mackinder's [[Geographical Pivot of History]] a \"genius' scientific tractate.\"<ref name=\":3\">[[Karl Haushofer]], ''Pan-Ideas in Geopolitics'', 1931, (tr.

Positing that states are organic and growing, with borders representing only a temporary stop in their movement, he held that the expanse of a state's borders is a reflection of the health of the nation\u2014meaning that static countries are in decline. Ratzel published several papers, among which was the essay \"Lebensraum\" (1901) concerning [[biogeography]]. Ratzel created a foundation for the German variant of geopolitics, ''geopolitik''. Influenced by the American [[geostrategy|geostrategist]] Alfred Thayer Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power.\n\nThe geopolitical theory of Ratzel has been criticized as being too sweeping, and his interpretation of human history and geography being too simple and mechanistic. Critically, he also underestimated the importance of social organization in the development of power.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=\u00d3 Tuathail|first=Gear\u00f3id|title=The geopolitics reader|last2=Dalby|first2=Simon|last3=Routledge|first3=Paul|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34148-6|location=London; New York|language=English|oclc=750496870}}</ref>\n\n=== The association of German Geopolitik with Nazism ===\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the thoughts of [[Rudolf Kjell\u00e9n]] and Ratzel were picked up and extended by a number of German authors such as [[Karl Haushofer]] (1869\u20131946), [[Erich Obst]], [[Hermann Lautensach]] and [[Otto Maull]]. In 1923, [[Karl Haushofer]] founded the ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geopolitik'' (Journal for Geopolitics), which was later used in the [[propaganda]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. The key concepts of Haushofer's Geopolitik were Lebensraum, [[autarky]], [[pan-region]]s, and organic borders. States have, Haushofer argued, an undeniable right to seek [[natural border]]s which would guarantee [[wikt:autarky|autarky]].\n\nHaushofer's influence within the [[Nazi Party]] has been challenged, given that Haushofer failed to incorporate the Nazis' racial ideology into his work.<ref name=\":6\" /> Popular views of the role of geopolitics in the Nazi Third Reich suggest a fundamental significance on the part of the geo-politicians in the ideological orientation of the Nazi state. Bassin (1987) reveals that these popular views are in important ways misleading and incorrect.\n\nDespite the numerous similarities and affinities between the two doctrines, geopolitics was always held suspect by the National Socialist ideologists. This was understandable, for the underlying philosophical orientation of geopolitics did not comply with that of National Socialism. Geopolitics shared Ratzel's [[scientific materialism]] and geographic determinism, and held that human society was determined by external influences\u2014in the face of which qualities held innately by individuals or groups were of reduced or no significance. National Socialism rejected in principle both materialism and determinism and also elevated innate human qualities, in the form of a hypothesized 'racial character,' to the factor of greatest significance in the constitution of human society. These differences led after 1933 to friction and ultimately to open denunciation of geopolitics by Nazi ideologues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bassin|first=Mark|date=April 1987|title=Race contra space: the conflict between German geopolitik and national socialism|journal=Political Geography Quarterly|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=115\u2013134|doi=10.1016/0260-9827(87)90002-4}}</ref> Nevertheless, German Geopolitik was discredited by its (mis)use in Nazi expansionist policy of [[World War II]] and has never achieved standing comparable to the pre-war period.\n\nThe resultant negative association, particularly in U.S. academic circles, between classical geopolitics and Nazi or [[imperialist]] ideology, is based on loose justifications. This has been observed in particular by critics of contemporary academic geography, and proponents of a \"neo\"-classical geopolitics in particular. These include Haverluk et al., who argue that the stigmatization of geopolitics in academia is unhelpful as geopolitics as a field of positivist inquiry maintains potential in researching and resolving topical, often politicized issues such as [[conflict resolution]] and prevention, and mitigating [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14650045.2013.803192 | volume=19 | title=The Three Critical Flaws of Critical Geopolitics: Towards a Neo-Classical Geopolitics | journal=Geopolitics | pages=19\u201339| year=2014 | last1=Haverluk | first1=Terrence W. | last2=Beauchemin | first2=Kevin M. | last3=Mueller | first3=Brandon A. | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1234503 }}</ref>\n\n===Disciplinary differences in perspectives===\nNegative associations with the term \"geopolitics\" and its practical application stemming from its association with World War II and pre-World War II German scholars and students of Geopolitics are largely specific to the field of academic Geography, and especially sub-disciplines of [[human geography]] such as political geography.

This difference in disciplinary perspectives is addressed by Bert Chapman in ''Geopolitics: A Guide To the Issues'', in which Chapman makes note that academic and professional International Relations journals are more amenable to the study and analysis of Geopolitics, and in particular Classical Geopolitics, than contemporary academic journals in the field of political geography.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chapman|first=Bert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swINFRDahjYC|title=Geopolitics: A Guide to the Issues|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-38579-7|location=|pages=|language=en|oclc=913615116}}</ref>\n\nIn disciplines outside Geography, Geopolitics is not negatively viewed (as it often is among academic geographers such as [[Carolyn Gallaher]] or [[Klaus Dodds]]) as a tool of imperialism or associated with Nazism, but rather viewed as a valid and consistent manner of assessing major international geopolitical circumstances and events, not necessarily related to armed conflict or military operations.\n\n== France ==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}\nFrench geopolitical doctrines broadly opposed to German [[Geopolitik]] and reject the idea of a fixed geography. French geography is focused on the evolution of polymorphic territories being the result of mankind's actions. It also relies on the consideration of long time periods through a refusal to take specific events into account. This method has been theorized by Professor Lacoste according to three principles: [[Social representation|Representation]]; [[Diachronie]]; and [[Diatopie]].\n\nIn ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', [[Montesquieu]] outlined the view that man and societies are influenced by climate. He believed that hotter climates create hot-tempered people and colder climates aloof people, whereas the mild climate of France is ideal for political systems. Considered as one of the founders of French geopolitics, [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]], is the author of a book considered as a reference in modern geography (Nouvelle G\u00e9ographie universelle). Alike Ratzel, he considers geography through a global vision. However, in complete opposition to Ratzel's vision, Reclus considers geography not to be unchanging; it is supposed to evolve commensurately to the development of human society. His marginal political views resulted in his rejection by academia.\n\n[[France|French]] [[geographer]] and geopolitician [[Jacques Ancel]] is considered to be the first theoretician of geopolitics in France, and gave a notable series of lectures at the European Center of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in Paris<!-- this is where Ancel worked \u2013 see https://books.google.com.co/books?id=kRl8CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=jacques+ancel+carnegie&source=bl&ots=3LGDeBAJYD&sig=8OhUn9kBpGDksGAHI0TCz7u48Ak&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1v7fzx_PXAhVncd8KHSPqBL0Q6AEINTAB#v=onepage&q=jacques%20ancel%20carnegie&f=false --> and published ''G\u00e9opolitique'' in 1936. Like Reclus, Ancel rejects German determinist views on geopolitics (including Haushofer's doctrines).\n\n[[Braudel]]'s broad view used insights from other social sciences, employed the concept of the ''longue dur\u00e9e'', and downplayed the importance of specific events. This method was inspired by the French [[geography|geographer]] [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (who in turn was influenced by German thought, particularly that of [[Friedrich Ratzel]] whom he had met in Germany). Braudel's method was to analyse the interdependence between individuals and their environment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Braudel|first=Fernand|title=The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II. Vol. 1 Vol. 1|date=2012|publisher=Univ. of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20308-2|location=Berkeley, Calif|language=English|oclc=935298954}}</ref> Vidalian geopolitics is based on varied forms of cartography and on ''[[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]]'' (founded on a societal approach of geography\u2014i.e. on the principle of spaces polymorphic faces depending from many factors among them mankind, culture, and ideas) as opposed to determinism.\n\nDue to the influence of German ''Geopolitik'' on French geopolitics, the latter were for a long time banished from academic works. In the mid-1970s, [[Yves Lacoste]]\u2014a French [[geographer]] who was directly inspired by Ancel, Braudel and Vidal de la Blache\u2014wrote ''La g\u00e9ographie, \u00e7a sert d'abord \u00e0 faire la guerre'' (Geography first use is war) in 1976. This book\u2014which is very famous in France\u2014symbolizes the birth of this new school of geopolitics (if not so far the first French school of geopolitics as Ancel was very isolated in the 1930s\u201340s). Initially linked with communist party evolved to a less liberal approach. At the end of the 1980s he founded the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de G\u00e9opolitique (French Institute for Geopolitics) that publishes the [[H\u00e9rodote]] revue. While rejecting the generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the German and Anglo-American traditions (and the ''new geographers''), this school does focus on spatial dimension of geopolitics affairs on different levels of analysis. This approach emphasizes the importance of multi-level (or multi-scales) analysis and maps at the opposite of critical geopolitics which avoid such tools. Lacoste proposed that every conflict (both local or global) can be considered from a perspective grounded in three assumptions:\n# '''[[Social representation|Representation]]''': Each group or individuals is the product of an education and is characterized by specific representations of the world or others groups or individuals. Thus, basic societal beliefs are grounded in their ethnicity or specific location. The study of representation is a common point with the more contemporary critical geopolitics. Both are connected with the work of Henri Lefebvre (La production de l'espace, first published in 1974)\n# '''Diachronie.''' Conducting an historical analysis confronting \"long periods\" and short periods as the prominent French historian Fernand Braudel suggested.\n# '''Diatopie''': Conducting a cartographic survey through a multi-scale mapping.\n\nConnected with this stream, and former member of H\u00e9rodote editorial board, the French geographer [[Michel Foucher]] developed a long term analysis of international borders. He coined various neologism among them: ''Horogenesis'': Neologism that describes the concept of studying the ''birth of borders'', ''Dyade'': border shared by two neighbouring states (for instance US territory has two terrestrial dyades : one with Canada and one with Mexico). The main book of this searcher \"Fronts et fronti\u00e8res\" (Fronts and borders) first published in 1991, without equivalent remains untranslated in English. Michel Foucher is an expert of the [[African Union]] for borders affairs.\n\nMore or less connected with this school, St\u00e9phane Rosi\u00e8re can be quoted as the editor in Chief of the online journal ''L'Espace politique'', this journal created in 2007 became the most prominent French journal of political geography and Geopolitics with H\u00e9rodote.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=L'Espace Politique|url=https://journals.openedition.org/espacepolitique/|journal=L'Espace Politique|volume=|pages=|oclc=958694001|via=}}</ref>\n\nA much more conservative stream is personified by Fran\u00e7ois Thual. Thual was a French expert in geopolitics, and a former official of the Ministry of Civil Defence. Thual taught geopolitics of the religions at the French War College, and has written thirty books devoted mainly to geopolitical method and its application to various parts of the world. He is particularly interested in the Orthodox, Shiite, and Buddhist religions, and in troubled regions like the [[Caucasus]]. Connected with F. Thual, Aymeric Chauprade, former professor of geopolitics at the French War College and now member of the extreme-right party \"Front national\", subscribes to a supposed \"new\" French school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to ''realpolitik'' and \"clash of civilization\" (Huntington). The thought of this school is expressed through the French Review of Geopolitics (headed by Chauprade) and the International Academy of Geopolitics. Chauprade is a supporter of a Europe of nations, he advocates a European Union excluding Turkey, and a policy of compromise with Russia (in the frame of a Eurasian alliance which is ''en vogue'' among European extreme-right populists) and supports the idea of a multi-polar world\u2014including a balanced relationship between China and the U.S.\n\nFrench philosopher Michel Foucault's [[dispositif]] introduced for the purpose of [[biopolitics|biopolitical]] research was also adopted in the field of geopolitical thought where it now plays a role.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ingram |first1=Alan |date=2017 |title=Art, Geopolitics and Metapolitics at Tate Galleries London |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1532789/1/AM.pdf |journal=Geopolitics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages= 719\u2013739|doi=10.1080/14650045.2016.1263186}}</ref>\n\n== Russia ==\n\nIn the 1990s a senior researcher at the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{Interlanguage link multi|  Vadim Tsymbursky | ru |3= \u0426\u044b\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1957-2009), coined the term \"island-Russia\" and developed the \"Great Limitrophe\" concept.\n\nColonel-General [[Leonid Ivashov]] (retired), a Russian geopolitics specialist of the early 21st century, headed the [[Academy of Geopolitical Problems]] ({{lang-ru | \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c}}), which analyzes the international and domestic situations and develops geopolitical doctrine.

Both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the Cold War,<ref name=\":2\" /> writing books on the subject in the 1990s\u2014''[[Diplomacy (book)|Diplomacy]]'' and ''[[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives]]''.<ref name=\":5\" /> The Anglo-American classical geopolitical theories were revived.\n\nKissinger argued against the belief that with the dissolution of the USSR, hostile intentions had come to an end and traditional foreign policy considerations no longer applied. \"They would argue \u2026 that Russia, regardless of who govern it, sits astride the territory Halford Mackinder called the geopolitical heartland, and is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions.\" Therefore the United States must \"maintain the global balance of power vis-\u00e0-vis the country with a long history of expansionism.\"<ref>Kissinger, Henry, (1994).

During the Cold War, Kissinger argues, both sides of the Atlantic recognized that, \"unless America is organically involved in Europe, it would be obliged to involve itself later under circumstances far less favorable to both sides of the Atlantic. That is even more true today. Germany has become so strong that existing European institutions cannot by themselves strike a balance between Germany and its European partners. Nor can Europe, even with Germany, manage by itself [\u2026] Russia.\" Thus Kissinger belied it is in no country's interest that Germany and Russia should fixate on each other as a principal partner.

Now, however, he stressed on the beginning of the Cold War: \"The objective of moral opposition to Communism had merged with the geopolitical task of containing the Soviet expansion.\"<ref>Kissinger, Henry, (1994).

Mackinder's doctrine of geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed to the notion of Alfred Thayer Mahan about the significance of navies (he coined the term ''sea power'') in world conflict. He saw navy as a basis of Colombian era empire (roughly from 1492 to the 19th century), and predicted the 20th century to be domain of land power. The Heartland theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the Heartland\u2014which wouldn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent. The basic notions of Mackinder's doctrine involve considering the geography of the Earth as being divided into two sections: the [[Afro-Eurasia|World Island]] or Core, comprising [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]]; and the Peripheral \"islands\", including the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], the [[British Isles]], and [[Oceania]]. Not only was the Periphery noticeably smaller than the World Island, it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the technological level of the World Island\u2014which contained sufficient natural resources for a developed economy.\n\nMackinder posited that the industrial centers of the Periphery were necessarily located in widely separated locations. The World Island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn, and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the Periphery (so they would have a longer struggle reaching them, and would face a well-stocked industrial bastion). Mackinder called this region the ''Heartland''. It essentially comprised [[Central and Eastern Europe]]: [[Ukraine]], Western [[Russia]], and [[Mitteleuropa]].<ref>See map in Polelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hp1-oyQjqTgC&lpg=PA57&hl=cs&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false Raising Cartographic Consciousness], p. 57.</ref> The Heartland contained the grain reserves of Ukraine, and many other natural resources. Mackinder's notion of geopolitics was summed up when he said:\n\n{{blockquote|Who rules Central and Eastern Europe commands the Heartland. Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island. Who rules the World-Island commands the World.}}\n\n[[Nicholas J. Spykman]] was both a follower and critic of geostrategists Alfred Mahan, and Halford Mackinder. His work was based on assumptions similar to Mackinder's,<ref name=\":2\" /> including the unity of world politics and the world sea. He extends this to include the unity of the air. Spykman adopts Mackinder's divisions of the world, renaming some:\n#The [[Theory of the Heartland|Heartland]];\n#The [[Rimland]] (analogous to Mackinder's \"inner or marginal crescent\" also an intermediate region, lying between the Heartland and the marginal sea powers); and\n#The Offshore Islands & Continents (Mackinder's \"outer or insular crescent\").<ref>See map in Polelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hp1-oyQjqTgC&lpg=PA118&hl=cs&pg=PA118#v=onepage&q&f=false Raising Cartographic Consciousness], p. 118.</ref>\n\nUnder Spykman's theory, a Rimland separates the Heartland from ports that are usable throughout the year (that is, not frozen up during winter). Spykman suggested this required that attempts by Heartland nations (particularly [[Russia]]) to conquer ports in the Rimland must be prevented. Spykman modified Mackinder's formula on the relationship between the Heartland and the Rimland (or the inner crescent), claiming that \"Who controls the rimland rules Eurasia.  Who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world.\" This theory can be traced in the origins of [[containment]], a U.S. policy on preventing the spread of Soviet influence after World War II (see also [[Truman Doctrine]]).\n\nAnother famous follower of Mackinder was [[Karl Haushofer]] who called Mackinder's [[Geographical Pivot of History]] a \"genius' scientific tractate.\"<ref name=\":3\">[[Karl Haushofer]], ''Pan-Ideas in Geopolitics'', 1931, (tr.

Positing that states are organic and growing, with borders representing only a temporary stop in their movement, he held that the expanse of a state's borders is a reflection of the health of the nation\u2014meaning that static countries are in decline. Ratzel published several papers, among which was the essay \"Lebensraum\" (1901) concerning [[biogeography]]. Ratzel created a foundation for the German variant of geopolitics, ''geopolitik''. Influenced by the American [[geostrategy|geostrategist]] Alfred Thayer Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power.\n\nThe geopolitical theory of Ratzel has been criticized as being too sweeping, and his interpretation of human history and geography being too simple and mechanistic. Critically, he also underestimated the importance of social organization in the development of power.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=\u00d3 Tuathail|first=Gear\u00f3id|title=The geopolitics reader|last2=Dalby|first2=Simon|last3=Routledge|first3=Paul|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34148-6|location=London; New York|language=English|oclc=750496870}}</ref>\n\n=== The association of German Geopolitik with Nazism ===\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the thoughts of [[Rudolf Kjell\u00e9n]] and Ratzel were picked up and extended by a number of German authors such as [[Karl Haushofer]] (1869\u20131946), [[Erich Obst]], [[Hermann Lautensach]] and [[Otto Maull]]. In 1923, [[Karl Haushofer]] founded the ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geopolitik'' (Journal for Geopolitics), which was later used in the [[propaganda]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. The key concepts of Haushofer's Geopolitik were Lebensraum, [[autarky]], [[pan-region]]s, and organic borders. States have, Haushofer argued, an undeniable right to seek [[natural border]]s which would guarantee [[wikt:autarky|autarky]].\n\nHaushofer's influence within the [[Nazi Party]] has been challenged, given that Haushofer failed to incorporate the Nazis' racial ideology into his work.<ref name=\":6\" /> Popular views of the role of geopolitics in the Nazi Third Reich suggest a fundamental significance on the part of the geo-politicians in the ideological orientation of the Nazi state. Bassin (1987) reveals that these popular views are in important ways misleading and incorrect.\n\nDespite the numerous similarities and affinities between the two doctrines, geopolitics was always held suspect by the National Socialist ideologists. This was understandable, for the underlying philosophical orientation of geopolitics did not comply with that of National Socialism. Geopolitics shared Ratzel's [[scientific materialism]] and geographic determinism, and held that human society was determined by external influences\u2014in the face of which qualities held innately by individuals or groups were of reduced or no significance. National Socialism rejected in principle both materialism and determinism and also elevated innate human qualities, in the form of a hypothesized 'racial character,' to the factor of greatest significance in the constitution of human society. These differences led after 1933 to friction and ultimately to open denunciation of geopolitics by Nazi ideologues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bassin|first=Mark|date=April 1987|title=Race contra space: the conflict between German geopolitik and national socialism|journal=Political Geography Quarterly|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=115\u2013134|doi=10.1016/0260-9827(87)90002-4}}</ref> Nevertheless, German Geopolitik was discredited by its (mis)use in Nazi expansionist policy of [[World War II]] and has never achieved standing comparable to the pre-war period.\n\nThe resultant negative association, particularly in U.S. academic circles, between classical geopolitics and Nazi or [[imperialist]] ideology, is based on loose justifications. This has been observed in particular by critics of contemporary academic geography, and proponents of a \"neo\"-classical geopolitics in particular. These include Haverluk et al., who argue that the stigmatization of geopolitics in academia is unhelpful as geopolitics as a field of positivist inquiry maintains potential in researching and resolving topical, often politicized issues such as [[conflict resolution]] and prevention, and mitigating [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14650045.2013.803192 | volume=19 | title=The Three Critical Flaws of Critical Geopolitics: Towards a Neo-Classical Geopolitics | journal=Geopolitics | pages=19\u201339| year=2014 | last1=Haverluk | first1=Terrence W. | last2=Beauchemin | first2=Kevin M. | last3=Mueller | first3=Brandon A. | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1234503 }}</ref>\n\n===Disciplinary differences in perspectives===\nNegative associations with the term \"geopolitics\" and its practical application stemming from its association with World War II and pre-World War II German scholars and students of Geopolitics are largely specific to the field of academic Geography, and especially sub-disciplines of [[human geography]] such as political geography. However, this negative association is not as strong in disciplines such as history or political science, which make use of geopolitical concepts. Classical Geopolitics forms an important element of analysis for military history as well as for sub-disciplines of political science such as international relations and [[security studies]]. This difference in disciplinary perspectives is addressed by Bert Chapman in ''Geopolitics: A Guide To the Issues'', in which Chapman makes note that academic and professional International Relations journals are more amenable to the study and analysis of Geopolitics, and in particular Classical Geopolitics, than contemporary academic journals in the field of political geography.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chapman|first=Bert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swINFRDahjYC|title=Geopolitics: A Guide to the Issues|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-38579-7|location=|pages=|language=en|oclc=913615116}}</ref>\n\nIn disciplines outside Geography, Geopolitics is not negatively viewed (as it often is among academic geographers such as [[Carolyn Gallaher]] or [[Klaus Dodds]]) as a tool of imperialism or associated with Nazism, but rather viewed as a valid and consistent manner of assessing major international geopolitical circumstances and events, not necessarily related to armed conflict or military operations.\n\n== France ==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}\nFrench geopolitical doctrines broadly opposed to German [[Geopolitik]] and reject the idea of a fixed geography. French geography is focused on the evolution of polymorphic territories being the result of mankind's actions. It also relies on the consideration of long time periods through a refusal to take specific events into account. This method has been theorized by Professor Lacoste according to three principles: [[Social representation|Representation]]; [[Diachronie]]; and [[Diatopie]].\n\nIn ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', [[Montesquieu]] outlined the view that man and societies are influenced by climate. He believed that hotter climates create hot-tempered people and colder climates aloof people, whereas the mild climate of France is ideal for political systems. Considered as one of the founders of French geopolitics, [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]], is the author of a book considered as a reference in modern geography (Nouvelle G\u00e9ographie universelle). Alike Ratzel, he considers geography through a global vision. However, in complete opposition to Ratzel's vision, Reclus considers geography not to be unchanging; it is supposed to evolve commensurately to the development of human society. His marginal political views resulted in his rejection by academia.\n\n[[France|French]] [[geographer]] and geopolitician [[Jacques Ancel]] is considered to be the first theoretician of geopolitics in France, and gave a notable series of lectures at the European Center of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in Paris<!-- this is where Ancel worked \u2013 see https://books.google.com.co/books?id=kRl8CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=jacques+ancel+carnegie&source=bl&ots=3LGDeBAJYD&sig=8OhUn9kBpGDksGAHI0TCz7u48Ak&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1v7fzx_PXAhVncd8KHSPqBL0Q6AEINTAB#v=onepage&q=jacques%20ancel%20carnegie&f=false --> and published ''G\u00e9opolitique'' in 1936. Like Reclus, Ancel rejects German determinist views on geopolitics (including Haushofer's doctrines).\n\n[[Braudel]]'s broad view used insights from other social sciences, employed the concept of the ''longue dur\u00e9e'', and downplayed the importance of specific events. This method was inspired by the French [[geography|geographer]] [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (who in turn was influenced by German thought, particularly that of [[Friedrich Ratzel]] whom he had met in Germany). Braudel's method was to analyse the interdependence between individuals and their environment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Braudel|first=Fernand|title=The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II.

In the mid-1970s, [[Yves Lacoste]]\u2014a French [[geographer]] who was directly inspired by Ancel, Braudel and Vidal de la Blache\u2014wrote ''La g\u00e9ographie, \u00e7a sert d'abord \u00e0 faire la guerre'' (Geography first use is war) in 1976. This book\u2014which is very famous in France\u2014symbolizes the birth of this new school of geopolitics (if not so far the first French school of geopolitics as Ancel was very isolated in the 1930s\u201340s). Initially linked with communist party evolved to a less liberal approach. At the end of the 1980s he founded the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de G\u00e9opolitique (French Institute for Geopolitics) that publishes the [[H\u00e9rodote]] revue. While rejecting the generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the German and Anglo-American traditions (and the ''new geographers''), this school does focus on spatial dimension of geopolitics affairs on different levels of analysis. This approach emphasizes the importance of multi-level (or multi-scales) analysis and maps at the opposite of critical geopolitics which avoid such tools. Lacoste proposed that every conflict (both local or global) can be considered from a perspective grounded in three assumptions:\n# '''[[Social representation|Representation]]''': Each group or individuals is the product of an education and is characterized by specific representations of the world or others groups or individuals. Thus, basic societal beliefs are grounded in their ethnicity or specific location. The study of representation is a common point with the more contemporary critical geopolitics. Both are connected with the work of Henri Lefebvre (La production de l'espace, first published in 1974)\n# '''Diachronie.''' Conducting an historical analysis confronting \"long periods\" and short periods as the prominent French historian Fernand Braudel suggested.\n# '''Diatopie''': Conducting a cartographic survey through a multi-scale mapping.\n\nConnected with this stream, and former member of H\u00e9rodote editorial board, the French geographer [[Michel Foucher]] developed a long term analysis of international borders. He coined various neologism among them: ''Horogenesis'': Neologism that describes the concept of studying the ''birth of borders'', ''Dyade'': border shared by two neighbouring states (for instance US territory has two terrestrial dyades : one with Canada and one with Mexico). The main book of this searcher \"Fronts et fronti\u00e8res\" (Fronts and borders) first published in 1991, without equivalent remains untranslated in English. Michel Foucher is an expert of the [[African Union]] for borders affairs.\n\nMore or less connected with this school, St\u00e9phane Rosi\u00e8re can be quoted as the editor in Chief of the online journal ''L'Espace politique'', this journal created in 2007 became the most prominent French journal of political geography and Geopolitics with H\u00e9rodote.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=L'Espace Politique|url=https://journals.openedition.org/espacepolitique/|journal=L'Espace Politique|volume=|pages=|oclc=958694001|via=}}</ref>\n\nA much more conservative stream is personified by Fran\u00e7ois Thual. Thual was a French expert in geopolitics, and a former official of the Ministry of Civil Defence. Thual taught geopolitics of the religions at the French War College, and has written thirty books devoted mainly to geopolitical method and its application to various parts of the world. He is particularly interested in the Orthodox, Shiite, and Buddhist religions, and in troubled regions like the [[Caucasus]]. Connected with F. Thual, Aymeric Chauprade, former professor of geopolitics at the French War College and now member of the extreme-right party \"Front national\", subscribes to a supposed \"new\" French school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to ''realpolitik'' and \"clash of civilization\" (Huntington). The thought of this school is expressed through the French Review of Geopolitics (headed by Chauprade) and the International Academy of Geopolitics. Chauprade is a supporter of a Europe of nations, he advocates a European Union excluding Turkey, and a policy of compromise with Russia (in the frame of a Eurasian alliance which is ''en vogue'' among European extreme-right populists) and supports the idea of a multi-polar world\u2014including a balanced relationship between China and the U.S.\n\nFrench philosopher Michel Foucault's [[dispositif]] introduced for the purpose of [[biopolitics|biopolitical]] research was also adopted in the field of geopolitical thought where it now plays a role.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ingram |first1=Alan |date=2017 |title=Art, Geopolitics and Metapolitics at Tate Galleries London |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1532789/1/AM.pdf |journal=Geopolitics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages= 719\u2013739|doi=10.1080/14650045.2016.1263186}}</ref>\n\n== Russia ==\n\nIn the 1990s a senior researcher at the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{Interlanguage link multi|  Vadim Tsymbursky | ru |3= \u0426\u044b\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1957-2009), coined the term \"island-Russia\" and developed the \"Great Limitrophe\" concept.\n\nColonel-General [[Leonid Ivashov]] (retired), a Russian geopolitics specialist of the early 21st century, headed the [[Academy of Geopolitical Problems]] ({{lang-ru | \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c}}), which analyzes the international and domestic situations and develops geopolitical doctrine.

More so, the age grade is a socio-cultural organization whose role includes upholding the cultures and values of the community that were handed down from one generation to another.\n\nWhereas the age grade system as practiced by the Igbere people is as old as the Clan itself.
