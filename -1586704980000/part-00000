The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with [[Shirazi era|Arab merchants]] on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in the 11th century. This was the precursor to the Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th centuries, evidenced by ruins at [[Great Zimbabwe]], near [[Masvingo]], and by other smaller sites. The main archaeological site uses a unique dry stone architecture.\n\nThe Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of trading states which had developed in Zimbabwe by the time the first European explorers arrived from Portugal. These states traded gold, ivory, and copper for cloth and glass.<ref name=\"autogenerated241\">{{cite book|title= Historical Archaeology |last= Hall|first= Martin|author2= Stephen W.

This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of Great Zimbabwe. From {{circa}} 1450 to 1760 Zimbabwe gave way to the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. This Shona state ruled much of the area of present-day Zimbabwe, plus parts of central [[Mozambique]]. It is known by many names including the [[Mutapa Empire]], also known as ''Mwene Mutapa'' or ''Monomotapa'' as well as \"Munhumutapa\", and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the [[Arabs]] and Portugal. The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.<ref name=\"autogenerated241\"/>\n\nAs a direct response to increased [[Europe]]an presence in the interior a new Shona state emerged, known as the [[Rozwi Empire]] (1684\u20131834). Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (meaning \"destroyers\") expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau {{when|date=November 2018}} by force of arms.

Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental [[kraal]]s, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions.

ZAPU was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Warsaw Pact]] and associated nations such as Cuba, and adopted a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with [[Maoism]] and the bloc headed by the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a [[Rhodesian constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] the previous year, but this went unrecognised internationally.

Instead, as of 2018, it is about 13 million. The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease, and partly due to decreased fertility.

For instance, it lacks the critical mass of researchers needed to trigger innovation. Although the infrastructure is in place to harness research and development to Zimbabwe's socio-economic development, universities and research institutions lack the financial and human resources to conduct research and the regulatory environment hampers the transfer of new technologies to the business sector. The economic crisis has precipitated an exodus of university students and professionals in key areas of expertise (medicine, engineering, etc.) that is of growing concern. More than 22% of Zimbabwean tertiary students were completing their degrees abroad in 2012, compared to a 4% average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. In 2012, there were 200 researchers (head count) employed in the public sector, one-quarter of whom were women. This is double the continental average (91 in 2013) but only one-quarter the researcher density of South Africa (818 per million inhabitants). The government has created the Zimbabwe Human Capital Website to provide information for the diaspora on job and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDespite the fact that human resources are a pillar of any research and innovation policy, the ''Medium Term Plan'' ''2011\u20132015'' did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies in science and engineering. The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNor does the development agenda to 2018, the ''Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Economic Transformation,'' contain any specific targets for increasing the number of scientists and engineers, or the staffing requirements for industry and other productive sectors. In addition, the lack of co-ordination and coherence among governance structures has led to a multiplication of research priorities and poor implementation of existing policies.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Scientific publication trends in SADC countries, 2005-2014.svg|thumb|Scientific publication trends in the most productive SADC countries, 2005\u20132014.

It replaces the earlier policy dating from 2002. The 2012 policy prioritizes biotechnology, information and communication technologies (ICTs), space sciences, nanotechnology, indigenous knowledge systems, technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent environmental challenges. The ''Second Science and Technology Policy'' also asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at least 60% of university education on developing skills in science and technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of their time to studying science subjects.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2014, Zimbabwe counted 21 publications per million inhabitants in internationally catalogued journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded).

The goat's small intestines are wrapped around small pieces of large intestines before cooking.]]\nLike in many African countries, the majority of Zimbabweans depend on a few staple foods. \"Mealie meal\", also known as [[cornmeal]], is used to prepare ''[[sadza]]'' or ''isitshwala'', as well as [[porridge]] known as ''bota'' or ''ilambazi''. Sadza is made by mixing the cornmeal with water to produce a thick paste/porridge. After the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste.\n\nThis is usually eaten as lunch or dinner, usually with sides such as [[gravy]], [[vegetable]]s ([[spinach]], [[chomolia]], or [[spring greens]]/[[collard greens]]), [[bean]]s, and [[meat]] (stewed, grilled, roasted, or sundried). Sadza is also commonly eaten with curdled milk ([[sour milk]]), commonly known as \"lacto\" (''mukaka wakakora''), or dried [[Tanganyika sardine]], known locally as ''kapenta'' or ''matemba''. Bota is a thinner porridge, cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with [[peanut butter]], milk, butter, or [[jam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zambuko.com/mbirapage/resource_guide/pages/culture/sadza_text.html | publisher=Zambuko.com |title=Sadza ne Nyama: A Shona Staple Dish |accessdate=3 November 2007}}</ref> Bota is usually eaten for breakfast.\n\n[[Graduation]]s, [[wedding]]s, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat or cow, which will be barbecued or [[Roasting|roasted]] by the family.\n\n[[File:Boerewors raw.jpg|thumb|Raw [[boerewors]]]]\nEven though the [[Afrikaner]]s are a small group (10%) within the white minority group, Afrikaner recipes are popular.

For example, most people will have [[porridge]] in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked ''sadza'', or sandwiches (which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for [[tea]] to be had after dinner.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nRice, pasta, and [[Potato production in Zimbabwe|potato-based foods]] ([[french fries]] and [[mashed potato]]) also make up part of Zimbabwean cuisine. A local favourite is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} A potpourri of peanuts known as ''nzungu'', boiled and sundried maize, [[black-eyed pea]]s known as ''nyemba'', and [[bambara groundnut]]s known as ''nyimo'' makes a traditional dish called ''mutakura''. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as ''maputi'' (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to [[popcorn]]), roasted and salted [[peanut]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[sweet potato]], pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as [[horned melon]], ''gaka'', ''[[adansonia]]'', ''mawuyu'', ''[[uapaca kirkiana]]'', ''mazhanje'' (sugar plum), and many others.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{Main|Sport in Zimbabwe}}\n[[File:Canada wins Zimbabwe in Rio Olympics 07.jpg|thumb|[[Zimbabwe women's national football team]] at the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2016 Olympic Games]]]]\n[[Association football|Football]] ''(also known as soccer)'' is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Alao |first1=Abiodun |author1-link=Abiodun Alao |last2=Tofa |first2=Moses |author2-link=Moses Tofa |editor1-last=Falola |editor1-first=Toyin |editor1-link=Toyin Falola |editor2-last=Jean-Jacques |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-link=Daniel Jean-Jacques |encyclopedia=Africa: An Encyclopedia of Culture and Society [3 Volumes] |title=Zimbabwe |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YjoVCwAAQBAJ |page=1316}} |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1598846652 |pages=1305\u20131326}}</ref> [[Zimbabwe national football team|The Warriors]] have qualified for the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] three times (2004, 2006, 2017), and won the [[COSAFA Cup|Southern Africa championship]] on six occasions (2000, 2003, 2005, 2009, 2017, 2018) and the [[CECAFA Cup|Eastern Africa cup]] once (1985).

The capital and largest city is [[Harare]]. The second largest city is [[Bulawayo]].

The [[British South Africa Company]] of [[Cecil Rhodes]] first [[Rhodesia (region)|demarcated]] the present territory during the 1890s; it became the [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] British colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1923. In 1965, the conservative [[White people in Zimbabwe|white]] [[Minority rule|minority government]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] as [[Rhodesia]]. The state endured international isolation and a 15-year [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] with [[black nationalist]] forces; this culminated in a [[Lancaster House Agreement|peace agreement]] that established universal enfranchisement and ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980. Zimbabwe then joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], from which it was suspended in 2002 for breaches of international law by its then-government, and from which it withdrew in December 2003. The [[sovereign state]] is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[African Union]] (AU), and the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA).

The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with [[Shirazi era|Arab merchants]] on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in the 11th century. This was the precursor to the Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th centuries, evidenced by ruins at [[Great Zimbabwe]], near [[Masvingo]], and by other smaller sites. The main archaeological site uses a unique dry stone architecture.\n\nThe Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of trading states which had developed in Zimbabwe by the time the first European explorers arrived from Portugal.

This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of Great Zimbabwe. From {{circa}} 1450 to 1760 Zimbabwe gave way to the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. This Shona state ruled much of the area of present-day Zimbabwe, plus parts of central [[Mozambique]]. It is known by many names including the [[Mutapa Empire]], also known as ''Mwene Mutapa'' or ''Monomotapa'' as well as \"Munhumutapa\", and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the [[Arabs]] and Portugal.

The population growth in 1980 was among the highest in Africa at about 3.5 percent per annum, doubling every 21 years. Had this growth been maintained, the population would have been 31 million. Instead, as of 2018, it is about 13 million. The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease, and partly due to decreased fertility.

The highest peak in Zimbabwe, [[Mount Nyangani]] at {{convert|2,593|m|ft|abbr=on}} is located here as well as the [[Bvumba Mountains]] and the [[Nyanga National Park]].

Among the most famous of these are the [[Great Zimbabwe]] ruins in [[Masvingo]]. Other ruins include [[Khami|Khami Ruins, Zimbabwe]], [[Dhlo-Dhlo]] and [[Naletale]].\n\nThe [[Matobo National Park|Matobo Hills]] are an area of [[granite]] [[kopje]]s and wooded valleys commencing some {{convert|22|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of [[Bulawayo]] in southern Zimbabwe. The Hills were formed over 2,000 million years ago with granite being forced to the surface, then being eroded to produce smooth \"whaleback dwalas\" and broken kopjes, strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation. [[Mzilikazi]], founder of the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] nation, gave the area its name, meaning 'Bald Heads'. They have become a tourist attraction due to their ancient shapes and local wildlife.

Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 20.6]]\nTo do so, however, Zimbabwe will need to correct a number of structural weaknesses. For instance, it lacks the critical mass of researchers needed to trigger innovation. Although the infrastructure is in place to harness research and development to Zimbabwe's socio-economic development, universities and research institutions lack the financial and human resources to conduct research and the regulatory environment hampers the transfer of new technologies to the business sector. The economic crisis has precipitated an exodus of university students and professionals in key areas of expertise (medicine, engineering, etc.) that is of growing concern. More than 22% of Zimbabwean tertiary students were completing their degrees abroad in 2012, compared to a 4% average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. In 2012, there were 200 researchers (head count) employed in the public sector, one-quarter of whom were women. This is double the continental average (91 in 2013) but only one-quarter the researcher density of South Africa (818 per million inhabitants). The government has created the Zimbabwe Human Capital Website to provide information for the diaspora on job and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDespite the fact that human resources are a pillar of any research and innovation policy, the ''Medium Term Plan'' ''2011\u20132015'' did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies in science and engineering. The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNor does the development agenda to 2018, the ''Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Economic Transformation,'' contain any specific targets for increasing the number of scientists and engineers, or the staffing requirements for industry and other productive sectors. In addition, the lack of co-ordination and coherence among governance structures has led to a multiplication of research priorities and poor implementation of existing policies.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Scientific publication trends in SADC countries, 2005-2014.svg|thumb|Scientific publication trends in the most productive SADC countries, 2005\u20132014.

It replaces the earlier policy dating from 2002. The 2012 policy prioritizes biotechnology, information and communication technologies (ICTs), space sciences, nanotechnology, indigenous knowledge systems, technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent environmental challenges. The ''Second Science and Technology Policy'' also asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at least 60% of university education on developing skills in science and technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of their time to studying science subjects.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2014, Zimbabwe counted 21 publications per million inhabitants in internationally catalogued journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded).

World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M.

The goat's small intestines are wrapped around small pieces of large intestines before cooking.]]\nLike in many African countries, the majority of Zimbabweans depend on a few staple foods. \"Mealie meal\", also known as [[cornmeal]], is used to prepare ''[[sadza]]'' or ''isitshwala'', as well as [[porridge]] known as ''bota'' or ''ilambazi''. Sadza is made by mixing the cornmeal with water to produce a thick paste/porridge. After the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste.\n\nThis is usually eaten as lunch or dinner, usually with sides such as [[gravy]], [[vegetable]]s ([[spinach]], [[chomolia]], or [[spring greens]]/[[collard greens]]), [[bean]]s, and [[meat]] (stewed, grilled, roasted, or sundried). Sadza is also commonly eaten with curdled milk ([[sour milk]]), commonly known as \"lacto\" (''mukaka wakakora''), or dried [[Tanganyika sardine]], known locally as ''kapenta'' or ''matemba''. Bota is a thinner porridge, cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with [[peanut butter]], milk, butter, or [[jam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zambuko.com/mbirapage/resource_guide/pages/culture/sadza_text.html | publisher=Zambuko.com |title=Sadza ne Nyama: A Shona Staple Dish |accessdate=3 November 2007}}</ref> Bota is usually eaten for breakfast.\n\n[[Graduation]]s, [[wedding]]s, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat or cow, which will be barbecued or [[Roasting|roasted]] by the family.\n\n[[File:Boerewors raw.jpg|thumb|Raw [[boerewors]]]]\nEven though the [[Afrikaner]]s are a small group (10%) within the white minority group, Afrikaner recipes are popular.

For example, most people will have [[porridge]] in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked ''sadza'', or sandwiches (which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for [[tea]] to be had after dinner.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nRice, pasta, and [[Potato production in Zimbabwe|potato-based foods]] ([[french fries]] and [[mashed potato]]) also make up part of Zimbabwean cuisine. A local favourite is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} A potpourri of peanuts known as ''nzungu'', boiled and sundried maize, [[black-eyed pea]]s known as ''nyemba'', and [[bambara groundnut]]s known as ''nyimo'' makes a traditional dish called ''mutakura''. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as ''maputi'' (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to [[popcorn]]), roasted and salted [[peanut]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[sweet potato]], pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as [[horned melon]], ''gaka'', ''[[adansonia]]'', ''mawuyu'', ''[[uapaca kirkiana]]'', ''mazhanje'' (sugar plum), and many others.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{Main|Sport in Zimbabwe}}\n[[File:Canada wins Zimbabwe in Rio Olympics 07.jpg|thumb|[[Zimbabwe women's national football team]] at the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2016 Olympic Games]]]]\n[[Association football|Football]] ''(also known as soccer)'' is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Alao |first1=Abiodun |author1-link=Abiodun Alao |last2=Tofa |first2=Moses |author2-link=Moses Tofa |editor1-last=Falola |editor1-first=Toyin |editor1-link=Toyin Falola |editor2-last=Jean-Jacques |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-link=Daniel Jean-Jacques |encyclopedia=Africa: An Encyclopedia of Culture and Society [3 Volumes] |title=Zimbabwe |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YjoVCwAAQBAJ |page=1316}} |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1598846652 |pages=1305\u20131326}}</ref> [[Zimbabwe national football team|The Warriors]] have qualified for the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] three times (2004, 2006, 2017), and won the [[COSAFA Cup|Southern Africa championship]] on six occasions (2000, 2003, 2005, 2009, 2017, 2018) and the [[CECAFA Cup|Eastern Africa cup]] once (1985).

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine since March 16, 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. As of October 2018, 380 chapters have been collected into 36 volumes by [[Shueisha]]. The story focuses on a young boy named [[Gon Freecss]], who discovers that his father, who he was told had left him at a young age, is actually a world renowned [[List of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter characters#Hunter Association|Hunter]], a licensed profession for those who specialize in, but are not limited to, fantastic pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Despite being abandoned by his father, Gon departs upon a journey to follow in his footsteps, pass the rigorous Hunter Examination, and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters, including main cast members Kurapika, Leorio, and Killua, and also encounters the paranormal. The original inspiration for the manga came from Togashi's own [[collecting]] hobby.\n\nIn 1999, ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' was adapted into a 62-episode [[anime]] television series produced by [[Nippon Animation]] and directed by [[Kazuhiro Furuhashi]]. The show premiered on Japan's [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] and ran until 2001. Three separate [[original video animation]]s (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] aired on [[Nippon Television]] from October 2011 to September 2014 totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, [[video game]]s, [[Musical theatre|musicals]], and other media based on ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter''. The manga has been translated into English and released in North America by [[Viz Media]] since April 2005. Both television series were also licensed by Viz, with the first series having aired on the [[Funimation Channel]] in 2009 and the second series premiering on [[Adult Swim]]'s [[Toonami]] block on April 16, 2016.\n\n''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of Shueisha's [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]], having over 78 million copies in circulation as of 2019. \n\n\nLater on Killua and Gon start feeling feelings for each other and fall in love. This is what the new season will be about. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{main|List of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter characters}}\n\n===Setting===\n{{nihongo|Hunters|\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc|Hant\u0101}} are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking down secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals.

The trio then complete the game together against all odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite with his father.\n\nHowever, Gon decides to have Killua accompany him to meet his father using the artifacts, but they send them to meet Kite instead.

An insect that devours other creatures and then gives birth to progeny that inherit the characteristics of the different species it has eaten. The queen washes up onto an island nation called the Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region, where she quickly develops a taste for humans and builds a colony powerful enough to overcome the population, especially after her offspring learn the power of Nen after consuming some Hunters. Upon facing the Royal Guard of the Chimera Ants, Kite sacrifices himself to allow Gon and Killua to flee and alert the Hunter Association. After weeks of preparation, the Association sends a team of some of their most powerful Hunters, including [[Netero]], the president of the Association himself to defeat the Ants and their king [[Meruem]], whose subjects secretly overthrew the government of the nearby {{nihongo|Republic of East Gorteau|\u6771\u30b4\u30eb\u30c8\u30fc\u5171\u548c\u56fd}} as part of their plan of subduing all of mankind.

However, his family is unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her dangerous powers used against them, but after evading his older brother Illumi's attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring Alluka to Gon's side and have him fully recovered, before sealing her powers completely to ensure that she can have a normal life. Killua then parts ways with Gon, as he wants to travel the world with Alluka who had never seen the outside world before, while Gon himself finally meets his father and learns the true nature of his quest.\n\nSome time later, Netero's son [[Beyond Netero|Beyond]] assembles an expedition to the {{nihongo|Dark Continent|\u6697\u9ed2\u5927\u9678|Ankoku Tairiku}}.

''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' manga has received much praise for its plot and characters. In his 2007 book ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]'', [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] described its storyline as \"an almost random collection of psych-outs, battles, puzzles, and trickery\" that works on both a chapter-by-chapter basis and a larger scale.<ref name=\"thomson2\"/> Thompson elaborated that with all the goals and subplots of each of the main characters, the story could seemingly go on forever and is unpredictable enough to hold reader interest.<ref name=\"thomson2\"/> In a different review for [[Anime News Network]] in 2012, Thompson wrote that it was hard to summarize the story because it is every ''[[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' manga in one, with training sequences, tournament battles, a crime-mystery story arc, and a virtual-reality, [[Role-playing game|RPG]]-style story arc. But unlike most ''sh\u014dnen'' manga, he called ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' \"incredibly dense.\" Examples being its fictional nen ability, which is explained \"so thoroughly that you almost think it could exist,\" and the little challenges and games the characters face; \"Over and over Togashi invents some little closed system or rules just so the heroes can break them; if he ever wants to change careers, I'd suggest game designer.\" Thompson praised the character art as great, pointing out how instead of alternating between realistic and [[Super deformed|chibi]] like other artists, Togashi has cartoony and realistic characters interacting in the same panels. Thompson did note how the artwork during its magazine run is often \"sketchy\" and missing backgrounds, but that Togashi goes back and fixes it for its collected ''tank\u014dbon'' release. Mentioning Togashi's love of gore he stated \"the whole manga is about the mixture of childish adventure and creepy, adult themes\" and noted how some panels later in the manga are apparently censored for gore by being covered with [[screentone]].<ref>{{cite news | date=April 26, 2012 | title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Hunter x Hunter | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2012-04-26 | work=[[Anime News Network]] | accessdate=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the first story arc, Chris Sims of [[ComicsAlliance]] called ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' one of the most \"fun, ridiculous, and ludicrously violent comics I've ever read.\" He stated that while it has every stereotypical idea about ''sh\u014dnen'' manga in force, what sticks out the most is the violence.

Miyako Matsuda of ''Protoculture Addicts'', Carl Kimlinger of the [[Anime News Network]] (ANN), and Derrick L.

Together they create a ''shonen'' action series that is both fun to watch and curiously respectful of its audience's intelligence. A strange combination indeed.\"<ref name=\"annreview2\"/> Tucker admitted to being \"bewitched\" by the series mainly due to the remarkable and original characters, especially the interplay between the vastly different personalities of the Phantom Troupe members.<ref name=\"themreview\"/> Kimlinger gave particular praise to the characteristics of the complex villain Hisoka and the deep, emotional transformation of Kurapika in the latter half of the series.<ref name=\"annreview3\"/><ref name=\"annreview4\"/><ref name=\"annreview2\"/> Theron Martin, also of ANN, contrastingly found the plot of the earliest episodes to be clich\u00e9, called the protagonist Gon \"an obvious [[Son Goku (Dragon Ball)|Son Goku]] derivative\", and stated that many of the story's aspects have already been covered by other ''sh\u014dnen'' series such as ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' a decade earlier. Martin was also displeased by an alleged lack of character development on the main protagonists' parts in the initial episodes.<ref name=\"annreview1\"/>\n\nThe art and animation of the ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' anime have also been commended by the press. Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'', the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashi's work by Furuhashi as having \"understated energy and flair, making the most of the era's (1999) mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends' physical feats to fluid, exhilarating life.\"<ref name=\"annreview2\"/><ref name=\"themreview\"/> Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design. \"The artistry not only shows its age but, in fact, looks older than it actually is,\" the reviewer commented, \"hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater.\" Opinions of the series' sound and music have been somewhat mixed. Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'', and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean's voice overs.<ref name=\"annreview1\"/> Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed, but did not think it lived up to its potential.<ref name=\"themreview\"/> Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances, but criticized the English dub as \"a letdown since day one\".<ref name=\"annreview3\"/><ref name=\"annreview4\"/>\n\n====2011 series====\nMadhouse's 2011 adaptation has been met with near universal critical acclaim. Adrian Marcano from [[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] considered ''Hunter x Hunter 2011'' to be one of the greatest anime series ever. He said that the anime set itself apart with one of the greatest story arcs in anime history in which the villain, not the hero, takes the anime to instant classic status.

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine since March 16, 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. As of October 2018, 380 chapters have been collected into 36 volumes by [[Shueisha]]. The story focuses on a young boy named [[Gon Freecss]], who discovers that his father, who he was told had left him at a young age, is actually a world renowned [[List of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter characters#Hunter Association|Hunter]], a licensed profession for those who specialize in, but are not limited to, fantastic pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Despite being abandoned by his father, Gon departs upon a journey to follow in his footsteps, pass the rigorous Hunter Examination, and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters, including main cast members Kurapika, Leorio, and Killua, and also encounters the paranormal. The original inspiration for the manga came from Togashi's own [[collecting]] hobby.\n\nIn 1999, ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' was adapted into a 62-episode [[anime]] television series produced by [[Nippon Animation]] and directed by [[Kazuhiro Furuhashi]]. The show premiered on Japan's [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] and ran until 2001. Three separate [[original video animation]]s (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] aired on [[Nippon Television]] from October 2011 to September 2014 totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, [[video game]]s, [[Musical theatre|musicals]], and other media based on ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter''. The manga has been translated into English and released in North America by [[Viz Media]] since April 2005. Both television series were also licensed by Viz, with the first series having aired on the [[Funimation Channel]] in 2009 and the second series premiering on [[Adult Swim]]'s [[Toonami]] block on April 16, 2016.\n\n''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of Shueisha's [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]], having over 78 million copies in circulation as of 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{main|List of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter characters}}\n\n===Setting===\n{{nihongo|Hunters|\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc|Hant\u0101}} are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking down secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals.

Outclassed by the difficulty of the challenges in the game at first, they are soon joined and trained by [[Biscuit Krueger]], an experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master. With the help of Biscuit, Gon and Killua train their Nen and learn to shape their abilities to their traits. During their stay on Greed Island, Killua takes a short break to apply for the Hunter Examination again, this time passes with success. The trio then complete the game together against all odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite with his father.\n\nHowever, Gon decides to have Killua accompany him to meet his father using the artifacts, but they send them to meet Kite instead. The duo then decide to help with Kite's research, and upon discovering a giant insect limb the group discovers that it came from a man-sized [[List of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter characters#Chimera Ants|Chimera Ant]] queen. An insect that devours other creatures and then gives birth to progeny that inherit the characteristics of the different species it has eaten. The queen washes up onto an island nation called the Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region, where she quickly develops a taste for humans and builds a colony powerful enough to overcome the population, especially after her offspring learn the power of Nen after consuming some Hunters. Upon facing the Royal Guard of the Chimera Ants, Kite sacrifices himself to allow Gon and Killua to flee and alert the Hunter Association. After weeks of preparation, the Association sends a team of some of their most powerful Hunters, including [[Netero]], the president of the Association himself to defeat the Ants and their king [[Meruem]], whose subjects secretly overthrew the government of the nearby {{nihongo|Republic of East Gorteau|\u6771\u30b4\u30eb\u30c8\u30fc\u5171\u548c\u56fd}} as part of their plan of subduing all of mankind. Despite losing to Meruem in combat, Netero ends up killing him with a bomb implanted in his body that poisons him to death soon after. In the occasion, Gon has a showdown with Neferpitou, the Ant who killed Kite and despite having exacted his revenge is hospitalized and in critical condition.\n\nAfter the Chimera Ant incident is resolved, the Hunter Association's top echelons [[List of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter characters#Zodiacs|the Zodiacs]], from which Ging is a member, begin the process of choosing Netero's replacement as Chairman, while Killua returns home to ask for his younger sister [[Alluka Zoldyck|Alluka]] to save Gon's life. However, his family is unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her dangerous powers used against them, but after evading his older brother Illumi's attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring Alluka to Gon's side and have him fully recovered, before sealing her powers completely to ensure that she can have a normal life. Killua then parts ways with Gon, as he wants to travel the world with Alluka who had never seen the outside world before, while Gon himself finally meets his father and learns the true nature of his quest.\n\nSome time later, Netero's son [[Beyond Netero|Beyond]] assembles an expedition to the {{nihongo|Dark Continent|\u6697\u9ed2\u5927\u9678|Ankoku Tairiku}}.

Chrollo designed a sophisticated strategy and applied a combination of stolen skills that overwhelmed and killed Hisoka. Still, before dying, Hisoka used his Nen on his heart to wake his heart after death, and the tactic worked because Nen becomes stronger after death. After waking up, Hisoka humiliated [[Machi (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Machi]] and killed both [[Kortopi]] and [[Shalnark]], vowing to hunt the Phanton Troupe and kill it leg for leg before killing Chrollo.\n\nAboard Kakin's expedition's ship, the fourteen princes of Kakin take part in a battle to the death called Succession War to decide the next king. In an attempt to recruit Kurapika to the Zodiacs, [[Mizaistom Nana]] tells him that the 4th prince of Kakin has an extensive collection of eyes from the Kurta Clan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.shueisha.co.jp/items/contents.html?isbn=978-4-08-880352-4|title=HUNTER\u00d7HUNTER 33\uff0f\u51a8\u6a2b \u7fa9\u535a {{!}} \u96c6\u82f1\u793e\u306e\u672c \u516c\u5f0f|website=books.shueisha.co.jp|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> Upon learning that, Kurapika immediately joins the Zodiacs as Pariston's substitute and infiltrates the royalty's security force along Pro Hunters he hired from the Hunter Association, most notable Izunavi, [[Basho (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Basho]], [[Melody (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Melody]], [[Biscuit (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Biscuit]], and [[Hanzo (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Hanzo]]. Kurapika was hired to be the 14th prince's bodyguard and placed his fellow Pro Hunters strategically as bodyguards to other princes. Members of the Phantom Troupe (joined by [[Illumi]]) also infiltrate the ship targeting the treasures stored in the boat and revenge on Hisoka, who they suspect is boarded in the boat too.\n\nAs the Succession War starts, Kurapika learns that the elder princes were in an advantageous position, as they were already preparing for the war for a long time. To revert the situation and create a stalemate position where he could help himself and the younger princes to survive, Kurapika warns every prince and bodyguard about Nen and start teaching Nen to the royalty's security members who were not aware of Nen. Mizaistom and [[Botobai Gigante|Botobai]] were investigating homicides inside the boat. They took notice of the consequences of the princes' struggles, and their ties to the mafia, in the lower parts of the ship and started to take measures to avoid chaos and genocide inside the boat. The Phantom Troupe also takes notice of the existence of Kakin princes' ties to the mafia.

''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' manga has received much praise for its plot and characters. In his 2007 book ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]'', [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] described its storyline as \"an almost random collection of psych-outs, battles, puzzles, and trickery\" that works on both a chapter-by-chapter basis and a larger scale.<ref name=\"thomson2\"/> Thompson elaborated that with all the goals and subplots of each of the main characters, the story could seemingly go on forever and is unpredictable enough to hold reader interest.<ref name=\"thomson2\"/> In a different review for [[Anime News Network]] in 2012, Thompson wrote that it was hard to summarize the story because it is every ''[[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' manga in one, with training sequences, tournament battles, a crime-mystery story arc, and a virtual-reality, [[Role-playing game|RPG]]-style story arc. But unlike most ''sh\u014dnen'' manga, he called ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' \"incredibly dense.\" Examples being its fictional nen ability, which is explained \"so thoroughly that you almost think it could exist,\" and the little challenges and games the characters face; \"Over and over Togashi invents some little closed system or rules just so the heroes can break them; if he ever wants to change careers, I'd suggest game designer.\" Thompson praised the character art as great, pointing out how instead of alternating between realistic and [[Super deformed|chibi]] like other artists, Togashi has cartoony and realistic characters interacting in the same panels. Thompson did note how the artwork during its magazine run is often \"sketchy\" and missing backgrounds, but that Togashi goes back and fixes it for its collected ''tank\u014dbon'' release. Mentioning Togashi's love of gore he stated \"the whole manga is about the mixture of childish adventure and creepy, adult themes\" and noted how some panels later in the manga are apparently censored for gore by being covered with [[screentone]].<ref>{{cite news | date=April 26, 2012 | title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Hunter x Hunter | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2012-04-26 | work=[[Anime News Network]] | accessdate=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the first story arc, Chris Sims of [[ComicsAlliance]] called ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' one of the most \"fun, ridiculous, and ludicrously violent comics I've ever read.\" He stated that while it has every stereotypical idea about ''sh\u014dnen'' manga in force, what sticks out the most is the violence.

Miyako Matsuda of ''Protoculture Addicts'', Carl Kimlinger of the [[Anime News Network]] (ANN), and Derrick L.

Together they create a ''shonen'' action series that is both fun to watch and curiously respectful of its audience's intelligence. A strange combination indeed.\"<ref name=\"annreview2\"/> Tucker admitted to being \"bewitched\" by the series mainly due to the remarkable and original characters, especially the interplay between the vastly different personalities of the Phantom Troupe members.<ref name=\"themreview\"/> Kimlinger gave particular praise to the characteristics of the complex villain Hisoka and the deep, emotional transformation of Kurapika in the latter half of the series.<ref name=\"annreview3\"/><ref name=\"annreview4\"/><ref name=\"annreview2\"/> Theron Martin, also of ANN, contrastingly found the plot of the earliest episodes to be clich\u00e9, called the protagonist Gon \"an obvious [[Son Goku (Dragon Ball)|Son Goku]] derivative\", and stated that many of the story's aspects have already been covered by other ''sh\u014dnen'' series such as ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' a decade earlier. Martin was also displeased by an alleged lack of character development on the main protagonists' parts in the initial episodes.<ref name=\"annreview1\"/>\n\nThe art and animation of the ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' anime have also been commended by the press. Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'', the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashi's work by Furuhashi as having \"understated energy and flair, making the most of the era's (1999) mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends' physical feats to fluid, exhilarating life.\"<ref name=\"annreview2\"/><ref name=\"themreview\"/> Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design. \"The artistry not only shows its age but, in fact, looks older than it actually is,\" the reviewer commented, \"hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater.\" Opinions of the series' sound and music have been somewhat mixed. Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'', and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean's voice overs.<ref name=\"annreview1\"/> Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed, but did not think it lived up to its potential.<ref name=\"themreview\"/> Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances, but criticized the English dub as \"a letdown since day one\".<ref name=\"annreview3\"/><ref name=\"annreview4\"/>\n\n====2011 series====\nMadhouse's 2011 adaptation has been met with near universal critical acclaim.

Henry had declared his daughters [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] bastards, leaving Margaret very high in the line of succession; for her to contract an unauthorised marriage was politically outrageous, especially with the son of a powerful nobleman and near kin of the disgraced queen. Both Lord Thomas and Lady Margaret were committed to the [[Tower of London|Tower]]. On 18 July 1536, Parliament, by an [[bill of attainder|Act of Attainder]], condemned Thomas to death for attempting to 'interrupt ympedyte and lett the seid Succession of the Crowne'.

After the success of the film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' in May 2008, Marvel announced that ''The Avengers'' would be released in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by [[Zak Penn]]. Production began in April 2011 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], before moving to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in August and New York City in September. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.\n\n''The Avengers'' premiered at Hollywood's [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, 2012, as the last film of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU.

In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,{{refn|name=Tesseract|group=N|Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract is based on the [[Cosmic Cube]] from Marvel comics.<ref name=\"movieline\" /> After ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', he stated that it was also the Space [[Infinity Stone]].<ref name=\"CraveOnline3\" />}} a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. [[Nick Fury]], director of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and his lieutenant Agent [[Maria Hill]] arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a [[wormhole]], allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]], to aid him in his getaway.\n\nIn response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \"[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers Initiative]]\". Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata]] to recruit [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dr. Bruce Banner]] to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Coulson visits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.\n\nIn [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\n\nThe Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\n\nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master{{refn|name=Thanos|group=N|Feige confirmed that the \"master\" in the post-credits scene is [[Thanos]].<ref name=\"EmpirePodcast\" />}}<!-- NOTE!

Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' and ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"RDJ\" /> Downey said that he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead: \"Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, \"In ''Iron Man'', which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. ''Iron Man 2'' is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Downey earned $50 million \"once box-office bonuses and backend compensation [were] factored in\".<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]: <br />A [[World War II]] veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, in addition to ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Evans\" /> Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in ''The Avengers'': \"It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, \"I think there's certainly a dichotomy\u2014this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun.\"<ref name=\"MTVNews10\" /> Evans earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner / Hulk]]: <br />A genius scientist who, because of exposure to [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]], transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was considered to play Banner in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' before [[Edward Norton]] took the role,<ref name=\"CastRuffalo2\" /> was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down.<ref name=\"Ruffalo\" /> About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, \"I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation's ''[[Hamlet]]''.\" About the character, he said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself\u2014the dark and the light\u2014and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|Bill Bixby TV series]], which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities\".<ref name=\"EW1\" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\"<ref name=\"Kimmel\" /> This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''Avatar'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".<ref name=\"NYMag\" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name=\"CastRuffalo1\" /> To create the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was blended with those of [[Lou Ferrigno]] and others;<ref name=\"soundworks\" /> however, the Hulk's only speaking line (\"Puny god.\") was provided solely by Ruffalo.<ref name=\"HulkVoice\" /> Ruffalo earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]: <br />The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] deity of the [[Thor|same name]]. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]''.<ref name=\"MTVNews7\" /> Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, \"My body weight in protein pretty much!\"<ref name=\"EOnline\" /> He remarked that Thor's motivation \"is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . . I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Hemsworth earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]]: <br />A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Johannson\" /> About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye, Johansson said, \"Our characters have a long history. They've fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We're the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors \u2013 we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She's not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She's there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Regarding her training, Johansson said, \"Even though ''Iron Man 2'' was 'one-for-them,' I'd never done anything like that before. I'd never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For ''The Avengers'', I've spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it's crazy. I do nothing but fight\u2014all the time.\"<ref name=\"Biskind\" /> Johansson earned $4\u20136 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]]: <br />A master [[Archery|archer]] working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Renner\" /><ref name=\"ABCNews\" /> Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation.<ref name=\"WSJ\" /> About the role, Renner said, \"When I saw ''Iron Man'', I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn't really a superhero; he's just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that.\"<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Regarding Hawkeye's sniper mentality, Renner said, \"It's a lonely game. He's an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett's character, Natasha. It's like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission.\"<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity. \"Quite the opposite, he's the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his [tranquilizer-tipped] arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Renner earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deity of the [[Loki|same name]].<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> About his character's evolution from the film ''Thor'', Hiddleston said, \"I think the Loki we see in ''The Avengers'' is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in ''The Avengers'', he's seen a few things.\"<ref name=\"HiddlestonInt1\" /> About Loki's motivations, Hiddleston said, \"At the beginning of ''The Avengers'', he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter5\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />An agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who oversees many of the division's field operations.<ref name=\"Gregg\" /> Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel.<ref name=\"Gregg2\" /> Gregg said his role was expanded in ''The Avengers'': \"[What] Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn't the real script. But it wasn't, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years.\"<ref name=\"Gregg3\" /> Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character's backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.<ref name=\"Gregg3\" />\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as [[Maria Hill]]: <br />A high-ranking agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Nick Fury.<ref name=\"SmuldersCostume\" /> Smulders, whom Joss Whedon once considered for his [[Wonder Woman in other media#Live action film|unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film]], was selected from a short list of potential actresses including [[Morena Baccarin]]. Smulders' deal would integrate her into nine films.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter3\" /><ref name=\"Variety3\" /> Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, \"I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don't do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn't offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to.\"<ref name=\"HIMYM\" /> On relating to the character, Smulders said, \"I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We're asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter4\" />\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki's control who is studying the Tesseract's power.<ref name=\"Expressen\" /><ref name=\"SSA\" /> Regarding Loki's control over Selvig, Skarsg\u00e5rd said, \"Well with the scene we did in ''Thor'', it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik's mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik's mind.\"<ref name=\"SSA\" /> About his role, he said, \"[My character] is of importance but the size of the role is not big.\"<ref name=\"SSA\" />\n* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]]: <br />The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the \"Avengers Initiative\". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films.<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Jackson said he does more in ''The Avengers'' than in any of the previous films: \"You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me\". About the role, Jackson said, \"It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem.\" Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in ''[[Jackie Brown]]'', calling him \"a nice guy to hang out with.

He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better\".<ref name=\"SuperheroHype3\" /> Feige added, \"I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want[ed] to find a director that\u2019s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is.\"<ref name=\"MTVNews8\" /> Whedon stated at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], that what drew him to the film is that he loves how \"these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team\u2014and that is the definition of family\".<ref name=\"MTVNews4\" />\n\nWhen Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not \"have anything\" and they should \"pretend this draft never happened\".<ref name=\"WhedonBusinessInsider\" /> Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin \"at square one\".<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" /> Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline \"Avengers: Some Assembly Required\", riffing on the \"Avengers Assemble\" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the film done for its May 2012 release.<ref name=\"WhedonBusinessInsider\" /> The script would go through \"a lot of insane iterations of what might be\" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he \"wrote a huge bunch of pages starring [[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]].\" He also was \"worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel Stane]], [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]'s son, in it.\" Once all of the actors were \"locked in place the movie stayed on mission.\" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the [[X-Men]]. He felt \"these guys just don't belong together\" before realizing their interactions could be like ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967). Whedon also referenced ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), ''[[The Abyss]]'' (1989), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he \"fought\" for sole credit and was \"very upset about it.\" Penn felt the two \"could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.\"<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" />\n\n[[File:Joss Whedon looking right.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Joss Whedon at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\nThe casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of [[Jeremy Renner]],<ref name=\"Renner\" /> [[Mark Ruffalo]],<ref name=\"Ruffalo\" /> and [[Clark Gregg]].<ref name=\"Gregg\" /> Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back.<ref name=\"HitFix\" /> \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in ''The Avengers'',\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. ''The Avengers'' demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks.\"<ref name=\"HitFix2\" /> In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it \"purposefully misleading\" and an \"inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light\".<ref name=\"HitFix3\" /> In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name=\"NortonTHR\" />\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February.<ref name=\"SuperheroHype4\" /> Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D,<ref name=\"Showbiz411\" /> although Mark Ruffalo later [[twitter|tweeted]] that this was not the case.<ref name=\"Mruff221\" /> In October 2010, [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]]<ref name=\"LIBN\" /> and the [[Steiner Studios]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, were announced as filming locations,<ref name=\"NewsdayGrumman\" /> with set construction slated to begin in November,<ref name=\"LIBN\" /> but as Whedon later explained, \"Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque.\"<ref name=\"filmfestivaltraveler\" /> Also that October, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] agreed to pay Paramount at least $115&nbsp;million for the worldwide distribution rights to ''Iron Man&nbsp;3'' and ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Variety2\" /> The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8&nbsp;percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit\u2014placement of the company's [[production logo]] on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads \"Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures\" though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's [[Epix (TV network)|Epix]] retained pay TV rights.<ref name=\"Variety4\" />\n\nIn December 2010, Governor of New Mexico [[Bill Richardson]] and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito announced ''The Avengers'' would film primarily in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan,<ref name=\"FilmNewMexico\" /> but a plan to film in [[Detroit]] ended after Governor [[Rick Snyder]] issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive.<ref name=\"DetroitFreePress\" /> Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio [[John Kasich]] announced before Mayor [[Frank G. Jackson]]'s State of the City address that ''The Avengers'' would film in [[Cleveland]].<ref name=\"Cleveland\" />\n\nConcept illustrator and designer of Iron Man's Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that \"Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit [from ''Iron Man 2''], while still being a fully armored, heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle.\" To that end, Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in ''Iron Man&nbsp;2'' as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in ''Iron Man'' and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack.<ref name=\"Marvel4\" /> The [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] also provided science consultation for the film.<ref name=\"SEE\" />\n\nCasting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, [[Cobie Smulders]] acquired the role of Maria Hill,<ref name=\"Variety3\" /> after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, who Samuel L.

A Marvel spokesperson later told [[TMZ]] that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set.<ref name=\"TMZ\" /> The following month, [[second unit|secondary filming]] took place about an hour outside [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania in the [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler area]].<ref name=\"Vancheri\" /> A chase sequence was also shot in [[Worthington, Pennsylvania]] at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.<ref name=\"Vancheri2\" />\n\nProduction relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming transpired over a period of four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to be used in climactic battle scenes.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo\" /> [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] soldiers assigned to the [[Columbus, Ohio]]-based [[200th Military Police Command (United States)|391st Military Police Battalion]] provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, \"It's easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms, the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging\".<ref name=\"Army\" /> Filming also took place in the large [[vacuum chamber]] at the [[Glenn Research Center|NASA Plum Brook Station]] near [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. The station's [[Space Power Facility]] was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility.<ref name=\"Sandusky2\" /> A series of explosions were filmed at the [[Chevrolet]] powertrain plant in [[Parma, Ohio]] as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo2\" /> Scenes from the film were also shot on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] and the [[Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge]].<ref name=\"Sangiacomo3\" /> Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany, for filming.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo4\" />\n\nPrincipal photography concluded in New York City, where filming occurred over two days.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo5\" /> Filming locations in New York City included [[Park Avenue]] and [[Central Park]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHype5\" /><ref name=\"CentralParkFilming\" /> For scenes taking place in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to \"get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also making sure that the effects work doesn't look too computer generated\". \"We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments,\" Morrison explained, \"but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.\"<ref name=\"ARRI1\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Seamus McGarvey]] stated that he composed the frame with a 1.85:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] to cope with the varying heights of the main characters, explaining that \"shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important.\" The film was McGarvey's first venture shooting with a digital camera, the [[Arri Alexa]].<ref name=\"ARRI2\" /> The [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] and [[Canon EOS 7D]] [[digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLR cameras]] were used for some shots,<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter13\" /><ref name=\"Canon7D\" /><ref name=\"Canon DSLRs\" /> and [[high-speed photography|high-speed]] shots were captured on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] with the [[Arriflex 435]]. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, \"Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.\"<ref name=\"ARRI2\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn December 2011, Disney announced that the film would be [[2D to 3D conversion|converted]] to 3D.<ref name=\"Deadline2\" /> Said Whedon, \"I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies \u2013 I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years.\" Whedon also said that \"there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D\" but \"''The Avengers'' isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway\".<ref name=\"Sampson\" /> In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for [[IMAX 3D]] and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of ''Iron Man 2'' and ''Thor''.<ref name=\"IMAX\" />\n\nIn a May 2012 interview, Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. \"He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] was ''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977) that [[Jim Starlin]] did followed by ''[[Marvel Two-in-One|Marvel Two-in-One Annual]]'' #2 (1977) that contained the death of [[Adam Warlock]]. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'\"<ref name=\"Thanos\" /> An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown.<ref name=\"EW post-credits\" /> Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release.<ref name=\"Shawarma1\" /><ref name=\"Shawarma2\" /><ref name=\"Shawarma3\" /> Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]] dies in [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]]'s arms in the ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' episode, \"[[A Hole in the World]]\". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors [[Amy Acker]] and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, \"went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events,\" which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.<ref name=\"ShawarmaAngelInspiration\" />\n\n[[File:Hulk mocap.jpg|thumb|left|Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk (bottom) wearing a [[motion capture]] suit and prosthetics on his upper half to simulate the Hulk's size<ref name=\"ScreenCrush\" />]]\nThe film contains more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Weta Digital]], [[Scanline VFX]], [[Hydraulx]], Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, [[Luma Pictures]], Cantina Creative, Trixter, [[Modus FX]], Whiskytree, [[Digital Domain]], The Third Floor and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted eight weeks.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager on the film, helped by securing the rights to almost every building's likeness in the area ILM needed.<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" /> Disney and [[Sony Pictures]] agreed for [[Green Goblin|OsCorp]] Tower from ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.<ref name=\"latino-review\" />\n\nWeta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" /> Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.<ref name=\"fxguide\" />\n\nScanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, \"We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space\" including Loki's arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier's bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> Method Design in Los Angeles created the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, \"This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of ''The Avengers'' as well as 30 credits set in-scene.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|The Avengers (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that [[Alan Silvestri]], who [[Film score|scored]] ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', would write and compose the score for ''The Avengers''. Silvestri said, \"I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.\"<ref name=\"Silvestri\" /> Silvestri developed the score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.<ref name=\"SXSW1\" /> Whedon said, \"The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Hans Zimmer]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\"<ref name=\"SXSW1\" />\n\nIn March 2012, American [[alternative rock]] band [[Soundgarden]] announced through its Facebook page that its song \"[[Live to Rise]]\" would be included on the film's soundtrack.<ref name=\"Soundgarden\" /> Additionally, the Indian rock band [[Agnee (band)|Agnee]] released a music video for its single \"Hello Andheron\", which serves as the theme song for the film's Indian release.<ref name=\"Agnee\" /> [[Hollywood Records]] released the soundtrack [[concept album]] inspired by the film, ''Avengers Assemble'', on May 1, 2012, the same day as the score.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n===Trailers===\nThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L.

This led to confusion over the film's actual title. ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine reported that the film would be titled ''Marvel Avengers Assemble''<ref name=\"AvengersAssemble2\" /> while ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that it would be called simply ''Avengers Assemble''.<ref name=\"AvengersAssemble\" /> Marvel's UK website refers to the film as ''Marvel's Avengers Assemble'',<ref name=\"MarvelUK\" /> although David Cox of ''[[The Guardian]]'', in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this to be an error in the production notes, albeit grammatically clearer.<ref name=\"Cox\" /> According to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] and the [[Irish Film Classification Office]], the title is ''Marvel Avengers Assemble''.<ref name=\"BBFC\" /><ref name=\"IFCO\" /> [[Frank Lovece]] in FilmFestivalTraveler.com addressed the discrepancy, writing, \"''The Avengers'' \u2014 formally titled ''Marvel's The Avengers'' onscreen, though no apostrophe-s appears on the posters...\"<ref name=\"filmfestivaltraveler\" /> Producer Kevin Feige said there are only two words in the UK title, one more than in the U.S. title, and stated that \"decisions like that aren't made lightly and there are lots of marketing research, lawyers and things that get into the mix on it\".<ref name=\"digitalspy\" />\n\nThe film's world premiere was April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's [[El Capitan Theatre]].<ref name=\"premiere\" /> ''The Avengers'' closed the 11th Annual [[Tribeca Film Festival]] with a screening on April 28, 2012.<ref name=\"Tribeca\" /> The film received an expanded one-week theatrical push for the 2012 U.S. [[Labor Day]] weekend, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700.<ref name=\"LaborDayPush\" /> ''The Avengers'' was the last film released in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseOne\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]<ref name=\"HM Magazine1\" /><ref name=\"Bluray6\" /> on [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[Blu-ray 3D]], [[DVD]] and [[Digital copy|digital download]] on September 25, 2012 in the United States and as early as August 29, 2012 in various international markets.<ref name=\"Bluray\" /><ref name=\"Bluray5\" /> Producer Kevin Feige said the Blu-ray features a new [[Marvel One-Shots|Marvel One-Shot]] titled ''[[Item 47]]'' and \"a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process\" including \"a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders\" and \"some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury's interaction with the World Security Council\".<ref name=\"Bluray3\" />\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"Bluray2\" /> It was released on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"Bluray4\" /><ref name=\"Boxset release\" /> Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on August 14, 2018.<ref name=\"UltraHDRelease\" />\n\nSome fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon's audio commentary, and for altering the scene involving Phil Coulson's death from the film's theatrical version.<ref name=\"UKBluray\" /> Disney's UK division said the \"less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson's confrontation with Loki\" occurred because \"[e]ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release\".<ref name=\"UKBluray\" />\n\nUpon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart with 72% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray, a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.<ref name=\"Bluray6\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Avengers'' grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada and $895.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> It became the [[List of highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film worldwide]]<ref name=\"third highest news\" /> at that time as well as the [[2012 in film|highest-grossing 2012 film]], the highest-grossing [[Comic book|comic-book]] adaptation, the highest-grossing [[superhero film]] and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release.<ref name=\"highest-Disney\" /> The film's worldwide opening of $392.5&nbsp;million was the fourth-largest.<ref name=\"world-open\" /> ''The Avengers'' also became the fifth film distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney]] and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1&nbsp;billion.

But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter9\" /> To ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' journalist [[Peter Travers]], the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. \"It's also the blockbuster,\" Travers said, \"I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's ''Transformers'' with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.\"<ref name=\"rollz\" /> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.\"<ref name=\"Variety6\" /> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' complimented the film's frenetic pace,<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> while [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' commented that it \"provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Conversely, [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' believed that \"while ''The Avengers'' is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nThe performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"<ref name=\"nydaily\" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights\u2014alongside Downey.<ref name=\"newyorker\" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"<ref name=\"villagevoice\" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,<ref name=\"rollz\" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)\"<ref name=\"EW-review\" />\n\nReferring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''\u2014despite complimenting Downey's performance\u2014favored his work in ''Iron Man'' over his acting in ''The Avengers'': \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication\u2014the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world\u2014and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony.\"<ref name=\"wsj22\" /> Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.<ref name=\"nydaily\" />\n\nCommentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. [[Associated Press]] reviewer [[Christy Lemire]] wrote that the script \"sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath.\"<ref name=\"associatedpress\" /> Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> Longworth felt that while Whedon's script demonstrated the backstory of the characters, the film does not explore it \"in a substantive way\".<ref name=\"villagevoice\"

SEE TALK PAGE -->[[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].{{refn|name=Paramount|group=N}} It is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the sixth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was written and directed by [[Joss Whedon]] and features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes <!-- STARRING CREDITS PER FILM POSTER, SEE TALK PAGE! -->[[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Jeremy Renner]] as the titular Avengers team, alongside [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Clark Gregg]], [[Cobie Smulders]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. In the film, [[Nick Fury]], director of the spy agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], recruits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], and [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] to form a team that must stop Thor's brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] from subjugating Earth.\n\nThe film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from [[Merrill Lynch]] in April 2005. After the success of the film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' in May 2008, Marvel announced that ''The Avengers'' would be released in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by [[Zak Penn]]. Production began in April 2011 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], before moving to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in August and New York City in September. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.\n\n''The Avengers'' premiered at Hollywood's [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, 2012, as the last film of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score, and garnered [[List of accolades received by Marvel's The Avengers|numerous awards and nominations]] including [[Academy Award]] and [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations for achievements in visual effects. It set or tied numerous box office records, including the [[List of biggest opening weekends|biggest opening weekend]] in the United States and Canada. ''The Avengers'' grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide and became the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->third<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->-highest-grossing film of all time]], as well as the [[2012 in film|highest-grossing film of 2012]]. It is the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, it was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's poll of [[Empire (film magazine)#The 100 Greatest Movies|The 100 Greatest Movies]].\n\nThree sequels, titled ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', were released in May 2015, April 2018, and April 2019, respectively.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\nThe [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri]]. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,{{refn|name=Tesseract|group=N|Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract is based on the [[Cosmic Cube]] from Marvel comics.<ref name=\"movieline\" /> After ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', he stated that it was also the Space [[Infinity Stone]].<ref name=\"CraveOnline3\" />}} a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. [[Nick Fury]], director of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and his lieutenant Agent [[Maria Hill]] arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a [[wormhole]], allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]], to aid him in his getaway.\n\nIn response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \"[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers Initiative]]\". Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata]] to recruit [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dr. Bruce Banner]] to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Coulson visits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.\n\nIn [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\n\nThe Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\n\nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master{{refn|name=Thanos|group=N|Feige confirmed that the \"master\" in the post-credits scene is [[Thanos]].<ref name=\"EmpirePodcast\" />}}<!-- NOTE!

Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' and ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"RDJ\" /> Downey said that he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead: \"Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, \"In ''Iron Man'', which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. ''Iron Man 2'' is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Downey earned $50 million \"once box-office bonuses and backend compensation [were] factored in\".<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]: <br />A [[World War II]] veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, in addition to ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Evans\" /> Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in ''The Avengers'': \"It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, \"I think there's certainly a dichotomy\u2014this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun.\"<ref name=\"MTVNews10\" /> Evans earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner / Hulk]]: <br />A genius scientist who, because of exposure to [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]], transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was considered to play Banner in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' before [[Edward Norton]] took the role,<ref name=\"CastRuffalo2\" /> was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down.<ref name=\"Ruffalo\" /> About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, \"I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation's ''[[Hamlet]]''.\" About the character, he said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself\u2014the dark and the light\u2014and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|Bill Bixby TV series]], which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities\".<ref name=\"EW1\" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\"<ref name=\"Kimmel\" /> This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''Avatar'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".<ref name=\"NYMag\" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name=\"CastRuffalo1\" /> To create the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was blended with those of [[Lou Ferrigno]] and others;<ref name=\"soundworks\" /> however, the Hulk's only speaking line (\"Puny god.\") was provided solely by Ruffalo.<ref name=\"HulkVoice\" /> Ruffalo earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]: <br />The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] deity of the [[Thor|same name]]. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]''.<ref name=\"MTVNews7\" /> Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, \"My body weight in protein pretty much!\"<ref name=\"EOnline\" /> He remarked that Thor's motivation \"is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . . I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Hemsworth earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]]: <br />A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Johannson\" /> About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye, Johansson said, \"Our characters have a long history. They've fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We're the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors \u2013 we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She's not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She's there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Regarding her training, Johansson said, \"Even though ''Iron Man 2'' was 'one-for-them,' I'd never done anything like that before. I'd never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For ''The Avengers'', I've spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it's crazy. I do nothing but fight\u2014all the time.\"<ref name=\"Biskind\" /> Johansson earned $4\u20136 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]]: <br />A master [[Archery|archer]] working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Renner\" /><ref name=\"ABCNews\" /> Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation.<ref name=\"WSJ\" /> About the role, Renner said, \"When I saw ''Iron Man'', I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn't really a superhero; he's just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that.\"<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Regarding Hawkeye's sniper mentality, Renner said, \"It's a lonely game. He's an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett's character, Natasha. It's like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission.\"<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity. \"Quite the opposite, he's the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his [tranquilizer-tipped] arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Renner earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deity of the [[Loki|same name]].<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> About his character's evolution from the film ''Thor'', Hiddleston said, \"I think the Loki we see in ''The Avengers'' is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in ''The Avengers'', he's seen a few things.\"<ref name=\"HiddlestonInt1\" /> About Loki's motivations, Hiddleston said, \"At the beginning of ''The Avengers'', he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter5\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />An agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who oversees many of the division's field operations.<ref name=\"Gregg\" /> Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel.<ref name=\"Gregg2\" /> Gregg said his role was expanded in ''The Avengers'': \"[What] Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn't the real script. But it wasn't, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years.\"<ref name=\"Gregg3\" /> Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character's backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.<ref name=\"Gregg3\" />\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as [[Maria Hill]]: <br />A high-ranking agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Nick Fury.<ref name=\"SmuldersCostume\" /> Smulders, whom Joss Whedon once considered for his [[Wonder Woman in other media#Live action film|unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film]], was selected from a short list of potential actresses including [[Morena Baccarin]]. Smulders' deal would integrate her into nine films.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter3\" /><ref name=\"Variety3\" /> Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, \"I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don't do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn't offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to.\"<ref name=\"HIMYM\" /> On relating to the character, Smulders said, \"I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We're asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter4\" />\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki's control who is studying the Tesseract's power.<ref name=\"Expressen\" /><ref name=\"SSA\" /> Regarding Loki's control over Selvig, Skarsg\u00e5rd said, \"Well with the scene we did in ''Thor'', it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik's mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik's mind.\"<ref name=\"SSA\" /> About his role, he said, \"[My character] is of importance but the size of the role is not big.\"<ref name=\"SSA\" />\n* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]]: <br />The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the \"Avengers Initiative\". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films.<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Jackson said he does more in ''The Avengers'' than in any of the previous films: \"You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me\". About the role, Jackson said, \"It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem.\" Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in ''[[Jackie Brown]]'', calling him \"a nice guy to hang out with. You just don't want to cross him\".<ref name=\"BBCRadio\" /> Jackson earned $4\u20136 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n\n[[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]] reprise their roles from previous MCU films as [[Pepper Potts]] and [[Jasper Sitwell]], respectively. [[Paul Bettany]] returns to voice [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] Frequent Whedon collaborator [[Alexis Denisof]] portrays ''the Other,'' and [[Damion Poitier]] portrays his master, [[Thanos]] (unnamed in the film), in a post-credits scene.<ref name=\"Poitier\" /> [[Powers Boothe]] and [[Jenny Agutter]] appear as members of the World Security Council later revealed to be [[Gideon Malick]] and Councilwoman Hawley.<ref name=\"Boothe\" /><ref name=\"Agutter\" /> Avengers co-creator [[Stan Lee]] has a cameo appearance in a news report.

Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much.

Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, \"It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with ''Avengers'' you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor... [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created\".<ref name=\"MTVNews2\" /> In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced [[Emily Blunt]] in portraying Natasha Romanoff in ''Iron Man 2'', a deal that subsequently attached her to ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Johannson\" /> The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later.<ref name=\"Cinematical3\" /> Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" />\n\nIn July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, \"My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority\".<ref name=\"CraveOnline\" /> At first, Penn tried to reduce Thor's role in the script because he had doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. He changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor.<ref name=\"PennMarch2018\" /> The film had always intended to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had considered using [[Red Skull]].<ref name=\"RedSkull\" />\n\nIn January 2010, Marvel Studios chief [[Kevin Feige]] was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of ''Thor'' with the high-tech science fiction in ''Iron Man'' and ''The Avengers''. \"No,\" he said, \"because we're doing the [[Jack Kirby]]/Stan Lee/[[Walt Simonson]]/[[J.

He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better\".<ref name=\"SuperheroHype3\" /> Feige added, \"I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want[ed] to find a director that\u2019s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is.\"<ref name=\"MTVNews8\" /> Whedon stated at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], that what drew him to the film is that he loves how \"these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team\u2014and that is the definition of family\".<ref name=\"MTVNews4\" />\n\nWhen Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not \"have anything\" and they should \"pretend this draft never happened\".<ref name=\"WhedonBusinessInsider\" /> Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin \"at square one\".<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" /> Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline \"Avengers: Some Assembly Required\", riffing on the \"Avengers Assemble\" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the film done for its May 2012 release.<ref name=\"WhedonBusinessInsider\" /> The script would go through \"a lot of insane iterations of what might be\" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he \"wrote a huge bunch of pages starring [[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]].\" He also was \"worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel Stane]], [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]'s son, in it.\" Once all of the actors were \"locked in place the movie stayed on mission.\" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the [[X-Men]]. He felt \"these guys just don't belong together\" before realizing their interactions could be like ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967). Whedon also referenced ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), ''[[The Abyss]]'' (1989), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he \"fought\" for sole credit and was \"very upset about it.\" Penn felt the two \"could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.\"<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" />\n\n[[File:Joss Whedon looking right.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Joss Whedon at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\nThe casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of [[Jeremy Renner]],<ref name=\"Renner\" /> [[Mark Ruffalo]],<ref name=\"Ruffalo\" /> and [[Clark Gregg]].<ref name=\"Gregg\" /> Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back.<ref name=\"HitFix\" /> \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in ''The Avengers'',\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. ''The Avengers'' demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks.\"<ref name=\"HitFix2\" /> In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it \"purposefully misleading\" and an \"inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light\".<ref name=\"HitFix3\" /> In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name=\"NortonTHR\" />\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February.<ref name=\"SuperheroHype4\" /> Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D,<ref name=\"Showbiz411\" /> although Mark Ruffalo later [[twitter|tweeted]] that this was not the case.<ref name=\"Mruff221\" /> In October 2010, [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]]<ref name=\"LIBN\" /> and the [[Steiner Studios]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, were announced as filming locations,<ref name=\"NewsdayGrumman\" /> with set construction slated to begin in November,<ref name=\"LIBN\" /> but as Whedon later explained, \"Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque.\"<ref name=\"filmfestivaltraveler\" /> Also that October, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] agreed to pay Paramount at least $115&nbsp;million for the worldwide distribution rights to ''Iron Man&nbsp;3'' and ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Variety2\" /> The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8&nbsp;percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit\u2014placement of the company's [[production logo]] on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads \"Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures\" though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's [[Epix (TV network)|Epix]] retained pay TV rights.<ref name=\"Variety4\" />\n\nIn December 2010, Governor of New Mexico [[Bill Richardson]] and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito announced ''The Avengers'' would film primarily in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan,<ref name=\"FilmNewMexico\" /> but a plan to film in [[Detroit]] ended after Governor [[Rick Snyder]] issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive.<ref name=\"DetroitFreePress\" /> Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio [[John Kasich]] announced before Mayor [[Frank G.

A Marvel spokesperson later told [[TMZ]] that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set.<ref name=\"TMZ\" /> The following month, [[second unit|secondary filming]] took place about an hour outside [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania in the [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler area]].<ref name=\"Vancheri\" /> A chase sequence was also shot in [[Worthington, Pennsylvania]] at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.<ref name=\"Vancheri2\"/>\n\nProduction relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming transpired over a period of four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to be used in climactic battle scenes.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo\"/> [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] soldiers assigned to the [[Columbus, Ohio]]-based [[200th Military Police Command (United States)|391st Military Police Battalion]] provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, \"It's easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms, the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging\".<ref name=\"Army\"/> Filming also took place in the large [[vacuum chamber]] at the [[Glenn Research Center|NASA Plum Brook Station]] near [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. The station's [[Space Power Facility]] was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility.<ref name=\"Sandusky2\"/> A series of explosions were filmed at the [[Chevrolet]] powertrain plant in [[Parma, Ohio]] as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo2\"/> Scenes from the film were also shot on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] and the [[Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge]].<ref name=\"Sangiacomo3\"/> Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany, for filming.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo4\"/>\n\nPrincipal photography concluded in New York City, where filming occurred over two days.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo5\"/> Filming locations in New York City included [[Park Avenue]] and [[Central Park]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHype5\"/><ref name=\"CentralParkFilming\"/> For scenes taking place in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to \"get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also making sure that the effects work doesn't look too computer generated\". \"We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments,\" Morrison explained, \"but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.\"<ref name=\"ARRI1\"/>\n\nCinematographer [[Seamus McGarvey]] stated that he composed the frame with a 1.85:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] to cope with the varying heights of the main characters, explaining that \"shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important.\" The film was McGarvey's first venture shooting with a digital camera, the [[Arri Alexa]].<ref name=\"ARRI2\"/> The [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] and [[Canon EOS 7D]] [[digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLR cameras]] were used for some shots,<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter13\"/><ref name=\"Canon7D\"/><ref name=\"Canon DSLRs\"/> and [[high-speed photography|high-speed]] shots were captured on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] with the [[Arriflex 435]]. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, \"Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.\"<ref name=\"ARRI2\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nIn December 2011, Disney announced that the film would be [[2D to 3D conversion|converted]] to 3D.<ref name=\"Deadline2\" /> Said Whedon, \"I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies \u2013 I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years.\" Whedon also said that \"there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D\" but \"''The Avengers'' isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway\".<ref name=\"Sampson\" /> In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for [[IMAX 3D]] and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of ''Iron Man 2'' and ''Thor''.<ref name=\"IMAX\" />\n\nIn a May 2012 interview, Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. \"He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] was ''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977) that [[Jim Starlin]] did followed by ''[[Marvel Two-in-One|Marvel Two-in-One Annual]]'' #2 (1977) that contained the death of [[Adam Warlock]]. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'\"<ref name=\"Thanos\" /> An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown.<ref name=\"EW post-credits\"/> Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release.<ref name=\"Shawarma1\" /><ref name=\"Shawarma2\"/><ref name=\"Shawarma3\"/> Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]] dies in [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]]'s arms in the ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' episode, \"[[A Hole in the World]]\". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors [[Amy Acker]] and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, \"went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events,\" which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.<ref name=\"ShawarmaAngelInspiration\" />\n\n[[File:Hulk mocap.jpg|thumb|left|Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk (bottom) wearing a [[motion capture]] suit and prosthetics on his upper half to simulate the Hulk's size<ref name=\"ScreenCrush\"/>]]\nThe film contains more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Weta Digital]], [[Scanline VFX]], [[Hydraulx]], Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, [[Luma Pictures]], Cantina Creative, Trixter, [[Modus FX]], Whiskytree, [[Digital Domain]], The Third Floor and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name=\"fxguide\"/> [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"<ref name=\"AWN\"/>\n\nILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted eight weeks.<ref name=\"fxguide\"/> Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager on the film, helped by securing the rights to almost every building's likeness in the area ILM needed.<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" /> Disney and [[Sony Pictures]] agreed for [[Green Goblin|OsCorp]] Tower from ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.<ref name=\"latino-review\"/>\n\nWeta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\"<ref name=\"AWN\"/> Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.<ref name=\"fxguide\"/>\n\nScanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, \"We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space\" including Loki's arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier's bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other.<ref name=\"fxguide\"/> Method Design in Los Angeles created the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, \"This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of ''The Avengers'' as well as 30 credits set in-scene.\"<ref name=\"AWN\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{further|The Avengers (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that [[Alan Silvestri]], who [[Film score|scored]] ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', would write and compose the score for ''The Avengers''. Silvestri said, \"I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.\"<ref name=\"Silvestri\" /> Silvestri developed the score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.<ref name=\"SXSW1\" /> Whedon said, \"The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Hans Zimmer]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\"<ref name=\"SXSW1\" />\n\nIn March 2012, American [[alternative rock]] band [[Soundgarden]] announced through its Facebook page that its song \"[[Live to Rise]]\" would be included on the film's soundtrack.<ref name=\"Soundgarden\" /> Additionally, the Indian rock band [[Agnee (band)|Agnee]] released a music video for its single \"Hello Andheron\", which serves as the theme song for the film's Indian release.<ref name=\"Agnee\" /> [[Hollywood Records]] released the soundtrack [[concept album]] inspired by the film, ''Avengers Assemble'', on May 1, 2012, the same day as the score.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n===Trailers===\nThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L.

''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' said, \"The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise\" and is \"heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses {{sic}} of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk.

An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company's involvement with the film, \"As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for ''The Avengers''. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced.

But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter9\" /> To ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' journalist [[Peter Travers]], the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. \"It's also the blockbuster,\" Travers said, \"I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's ''Transformers'' with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.\"<ref name=\"rollz\" /> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.\"<ref name=\"Variety6\" /> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' complimented the film's frenetic pace,<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> while [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' commented that it \"provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Conversely, [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' believed that \"while ''The Avengers'' is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nThe performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"<ref name=\"nydaily\" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights\u2014alongside Downey.<ref name=\"newyorker\" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"<ref name=\"villagevoice\" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,<ref name=\"rollz\" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)\"<ref name=\"EW-review\" />\n\nReferring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''\u2014despite complimenting Downey's performance\u2014favored his work in ''Iron Man'' over his acting in ''The Avengers'': \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication\u2014the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world\u2014and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony.\"<ref name=\"wsj22\" /> Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.<ref name=\"nydaily\" />\n\nCommentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. [[Associated Press]] reviewer [[Christy Lemire]] wrote that the script \"sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath.\"<ref name=\"associatedpress\" /> Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> Longworth felt that while Whedon's script demonstrated the backstory of the characters, the film does not explore it \"in a substantive way\".<ref name=\"villagevoice\"

Clark is credited for creating the three-part harmony (separating vocal parts into [[soprano]], [[alto (voice)|alto]] and [[tenor]]), a technique which is prevalent among gospel choirs today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6802026|title=Dr Mattie Juliet Moss Clark|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMattie Juliet Moss was born the seventh of nine children to ministers Fred John Moss and Mattie Juliet Walker in [[Selma, Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cogic.org/imd/2016/11/26/dr-mattie-moss-clark |title=Bio|website=www.cogic.org}}</ref >She began playing piano at six.

Moss moved to Detroit in her early twenties to be with her sister, Sybil Burke, and became a member of Greater Love Tabernacle Church of God in Christ. It was there that she received the gift of the Holy Ghost, and became Minister of Music.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1958, she recorded \"Going to Heaven to Meet the King\", with the Southwest Michigan State Choir, becoming the first person to commit the sounds of a choir to record. She was also the first person to separate vocal parts into soprano, alto and tenor. <ref>https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2020/04/09/detroits-clark-sisters-finally-get-story-told-lifetime-film/5121066002/</ref> She received three gold albums with the Southwest Michigan State Choir, and went on to write and arrange hundreds of songs and recorded over 50 albums. She directed Cadillac Motor Company's Christmas choir for 11 years and also conducted community-wide mass choirs for the prestigious NAACP Freedom Fund Dinners.\n\nIn 1968, Clark and Elma Hendricks convened a Sing-A-Rama in Detroit at Reverend [[C. L. Franklin]]\u2018s [[New Bethel Baptist Church (Detroit, Michigan)]]. They formed a 1,000 voice choir and had legendary gospel singer, Reverend [[James Cleveland]] come in as a special guest. \u00a0Cleveland so enjoyed the music and teaching classes that he told Clark he would like to create a similar convocation and maybe call it the Music Workshop of America. \u00a0Clark suggested that he add \u201cGospel\u201d to the title to let prospective attendees know it was gospel music only. \u00a0Cleveland wasted no time in putting the word out. \u00a0The first [[Gospel Music Workshop of America]] (GMWA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://praisedc.com/1352932/black-history-inspiration-spotlight-rev-james-cleveland/|title=Black History Inspiration Spotlight: Rev.

In 1981, Trinity College in [[Pennsylvania]] conferred upon her one of their highest honors, the degree of Doctor of Humanities. After the death of Bishop Bailey in 1985, she continued as State Minister of Music for Southwest Michigan Jurisdiction #1, attending Greater Mitchell Church of God in Christ, under Bishop J.H. Sheard. <ref>https://www.malaco.com/artists/gospel/dr-mattie-moss-clark/</ref>\n\nShe was an editor and contributor to the hymnal published by the Church of God in Christ entitled, ''Yes, Lord.'' When the late Bishop J.O. Patterson appointed her the International President of the Music Department in 1968, she worked to instill within musicians and choirs a responsibility to Christ as well as capability for Christ. Throughout her efforts, young people especially received her and many were saved, filled with the Holy Ghost, and uplifted by her music and message.\n\nShe completely revolutionized the music departments. She gave definition to the role of State Minister of Music, traveled year-round to every state in the country conducting workshops, rehearsals and musicals to prepare choirs for service on the National Church level and organized the structure of the National Music Convention of the Church of God in Christ. \n\nDr. Clark introduced the workshop and seminar concept to the convention, and, along with her staff, structured classes for the convention and created \"A Song Is Born\", the program where new talent was introduced before thousands.\n\n==Personal life==\nClark married twice. By her first husband, whom she married on December 30, 1945, Leo Henry Cullum Sr., Clark mothered two children, Leo Henry Cullum, Jr. and [[Jacky Cullum Chisholm|Jacqueline Lenita \"Jacky\"]]. After their divorce, she married Elder Elbert Clark (1927-2001) on November 30, 1952 and had four children, Denise Darchell, [[Twinkie Clark|Elbernita]], [[Dorinda Clark Cole|Dorinda Grace]], and [[Karen Clark Sheard|Karen Valencia]]. The Clarks divorced in 1973. Dr. Clark mentored her daughters, having them sing as part of her and their father's church's choir. <ref>https://www.thecinemaholic.com/the-clark-sisters-first-ladies-of-gospel-true-story/</ref>\n\nIn 1973, shortly after divorcing Elbert Clark, Clark sparked the forming of [[The Clark Sisters]]. After nearly ten years, Clark passed all responsibility of the group to daughter Twinkie, who became the leader of the group. <ref>https://www.kennedy-center.org/artists/l/la-ln/the-legendary-clark-sisters/</ref> Though she became less active in her daughters' career, she remained frequently supportive, even attending and performing with her daughters at the [[25th Grammy Awards|1983 Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Later years==\nClark's health was starting to decline due to diabetes. Told by [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]], she had her right leg amputated and suffered a stroke which left her confined to a wheelchair. Despite failing health, Clark continued to record music into the last year of her life before succumbing to complications from diabetes on September 22, 1994 at Providence Hospital in [[Southfield]], Michigan, at age 69.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xwZlDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT182&ots=nWIi4WdOd2&dq=Mattie%20Moss%20Clark%20Holiness%20Temple%20Church%20of%20Christ%20in%20Prayer&pg=PT182#v=onepage&q=Mattie%20Moss%20Clark%20Holiness%20Temple%20Church%20of%20Christ%20in%20Prayer&f=false|title=The Dictionary of Pan-African Pentecostalism, Volume One: North America|last=Alexander|first=Estrelda Y.|date=2018-06-22|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-5326-6133-4|language=en}}</ref> \n\nDr. Mattie Moss Clark\u2019s funeral was held on September 28, 1994 at Bailey Cathedral Church of God In Christ in Detroit, Michigan.

Clark is credited for creating the three-part harmony (separating vocal parts into [[soprano]], [[alto (voice)|alto]] and [[tenor]]), a technique which is prevalent among gospel choirs today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6802026|title=Dr Mattie Juliet Moss Clark|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMattie Juliet Moss was born the seventh of nine children to ministers Fred John Moss and Mattie Juliet Walker in [[Selma, Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cogic.org/imd/2016/11/26/dr-mattie-moss-clark |title=Bio|website=www.cogic.org}}</ref >She began playing piano at six.

Moss moved to Detroit in her early twenties to be with her sister, Sybil Burke, and became a member of Greater Love Tabernacle Church of God in Christ. It was there that she received the gift of the Holy Ghost, and became Minister of Music.\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nIn 1958, she recorded \"Going to Heaven to Meet the King\", with the Southwest Michigan State Choir, becoming the first person to commit the sounds of a choir to record. She was also the first person to separate vocal parts into soprano, alto and tenor. <ref>https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2020/04/09/detroits-clark-sisters-finally-get-story-told-lifetime-film/5121066002/</ref> She received three gold albums with the Southwest Michigan State Choir, and went on to write and arrange hundreds of songs and recorded over 50 albums. She directed Cadillac Motor Company's Christmas choir for 11 years and also conducted community-wide mass choirs for the prestigious NAACP Freedom Fund Dinners.\n\nIn 1968, Clark and Elma Hendricks convened a Sing-A-Rama in Detroit at Reverend [[C. L. Franklin]]\u2018s [[New Bethel Baptist Church (Detroit, Michigan)]]. They formed a 1,000 voice choir and had legendary gospel singer, Reverend [[James Cleveland]] come in as a special guest. \u00a0Cleveland so enjoyed the music and teaching classes that he told Clark he would like to create a similar convocation and maybe call it the Music Workshop of America. \u00a0Clark suggested that he add \u201cGospel\u201d to the title to let prospective attendees know it was gospel music only. \u00a0Cleveland wasted no time in putting the word out. \u00a0The first [[Gospel Music Workshop of America]] (GMWA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://praisedc.com/1352932/black-history-inspiration-spotlight-rev-james-cleveland/|title=Black History Inspiration Spotlight: Rev.

In 1981, Trinity College in [[Pennsylvania]] conferred upon her one of their highest honors, the degree of Doctor of Humanities. After the death of Bishop Bailey in 1985, she continued as State Minister of Music for Southwest Michigan Jurisdiction #1, attending Greater Mitchell Church of God in Christ, under Bishop J.H. Sheard. <ref>https://www.malaco.com/artists/gospel/dr-mattie-moss-clark/</ref>\n\nShe was an editor and contributor to the hymnal published by the Church of God in Christ entitled, ''Yes, Lord.'' When the late Bishop J.O. Patterson appointed her the International President of the Music Department in 1968, she worked to instill within musicians and choirs a responsibility to Christ as well as capability for Christ. Throughout her efforts, young people especially received her and many were saved, filled with the Holy Ghost, and uplifted by her music and message.\n\nShe completely revolutionized the music departments. She gave definition to the role of State Minister of Music, traveled year-round to every state in the country conducting workshops, rehearsals and musicals to prepare choirs for service on the National Church level and organized the structure of the National Music Convention of the Church of God in Christ. \n\nDr. Clark introduced the workshop and seminar concept to the convention, and, along with her staff, structured classes for the convention and created \"A Song Is Born\", the program where new talent was introduced before thousands.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nClark married twice. By her first husband, whom she married on December 30, 1945, Leo Henry Cullum Sr., Clark mothered two children, Leo Henry Cullum, Jr. and [[Jacky Cullum Chisholm|Jacqueline Lenita \"Jacky\"]]. After their divorce, she married Elder Elbert Clark (1927-2001) on November 30, 1952 and had four children, Denise Darchell, [[Twinkie Clark|Elbernita]], [[Dorinda Clark Cole|Dorinda Grace]], and [[Karen Clark Sheard|Karen Valencia]]. The Clarks divorced in 1973. Dr. Clark mentored her daughters, having them sing as part of her and their father's church's choir. <ref>https://www.thecinemaholic.com/the-clark-sisters-first-ladies-of-gospel-true-story/</ref>\n\nIn 1973, shortly after divorcing Elbert Clark, Clark sparked the forming of [[The Clark Sisters]]. After nearly ten years, Clark passed all responsibility of the group to daughter Twinkie, who became the leader of the group. <ref>https://www.kennedy-center.org/artists/l/la-ln/the-legendary-clark-sisters/</ref> Though she became less active in her daughters' career, she remained frequently supportive, even attending and performing with her daughters at the [[25th Grammy Awards|1983 Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Later years==\nClark's health was starting to decline due to diabetes. Told by [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]], she had her right leg amputated and suffered a stroke which left her confined to a wheelchair. Despite failing health, Clark continued to record music into the last year of her life before succumbing to complications from diabetes on September 22, 1994 at Providence Hospital in [[Southfield]], Michigan, at age 69.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xwZlDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT182&ots=nWIi4WdOd2&dq=Mattie%20Moss%20Clark%20Holiness%20Temple%20Church%20of%20Christ%20in%20Prayer&pg=PT182#v=onepage&q=Mattie%20Moss%20Clark%20Holiness%20Temple%20Church%20of%20Christ%20in%20Prayer&f=false|title=The Dictionary of Pan-African Pentecostalism, Volume One: North America|last=Alexander|first=Estrelda Y.|date=2018-06-22|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-5326-6133-4|language=en}}</ref> \n\nDr. Mattie Moss Clark\u2019s funeral was held on September 28, 1994 at Bailey Cathedral Church of God In Christ in Detroit, Michigan.
