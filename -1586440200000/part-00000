This band will be covered with wings and changes colour to black during development.<ref name=\"Chinch Bugs in Home Lawns\" />\n\n==Distribution==\n''Blissus leucopterus'' are native to the Americas.

United States of America: McGraw-Hill Book Company.</ref>\n\n==Diet==\n''Blissus leucopterus'' feed on plants, both wild and cultivated, belonging to the grass family, such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, and corn. They suck the sap out of the growing plants. When the plants ripen or become dry, they travel to other growing plants to feed.\n\n==Life cycle==\nThe lifespan of the ''Blissus leucopterus'' is a typically less than one year. The eggs of two generations are laid down from spring to summer, when they develop into adults. During the fall, the adults from the first generation die off, while the adults from the second generation retreat from the crops to look for overwinter shelters. The adults overwinter in any type of shelters they can find, including in hedgerows, road sides, bushy fence rows, edges of woodlands, and soybean stubble, under tree barks and bunch grass, and inside field mice nests. Once they emerge from their hibernation, they return to the crop fields to feast and breed before their death.\n\n''Blissus leucopterus'' prefers hot, dry, and sunny conditions, while moist, warm, and humid conditions are detrimental for their population;<ref>{{cite web |title= IPM: Field Crops: Chinch Bug|url=http://extension.cropsci.illinois.edu/fieldcrops/insects/chinch_bug/ |accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=Illinois College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences }}</ref> these conditions promote the growth of fungus which is fatal to them. Other elements that reduce their population is heavy rains. Developing nymphs that are hit with rain become trapped in the soils, killing them.

The chinch bug naturally feeds on wild prairie grasses. As the midwestern states were settled in the nineteenth century and crops of wheat, corn, sorghum and other grains were planted, they adapted well to these new species as habitat and food species. Throughout the 20th century, the chinch bug was a major pest to farmers, as it quickly decimated corn or wheat fields. To deal with this problem, many farmers in the area changed their crops to soybeans, which were not a host to the chinch bug. This led to a huge decrease in the chinch bug population in this area. Today they are mostly a common lawn pest and are commonly treated with pesticides and pest-resistant grasses.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Henry\">{{cite journal\n|author=Henry, T.J.\n|year=1997\n|title=Phylogenetic analysis of family groups within the infraorder Pentatomomorpha (Hemiptera: Heteroptera), with emphasis on the Lygaeoidea\n|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America\n|volume=90\n|issue=3\n|pages=275\u2013301\n|doi=10.1093/aesa/90.3.275}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite web\n|title=chinch, n.{{sup|''1''}}\n|website=Oxford English Dictionary on-line\n|accessdate=16 December 2014\n|url=http://www.oed.com/\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Say\">{{cite book\n|author=Thomas Say\n|date=1831\n|chapter=Descriptions of new species of Heteropterous Hemiptera of North America\n|title=The complete writings of Thomas Say on the entomology of North America\n|editor=John L. le Conte\n|at=p. 329\n|chapter-url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/79301#page/357/mode/1up}}</ref>\n}}\n\n*http://bugguide.net/node/view/26129\n*Waldbauer, Gilbert, ''Insights from Insects, What Bad Bugs Can Teach Us''. 2005.

A closely related species is ''Blissus insularis'', the southern chinch bug.\n\nThe name of the chinch bug is derived from the Spanish word ''{{lang|es|chinche}}''. The word ''{{lang|es|chinche}}'' is also used for the [[Bed bug (insect)|bed bug]], and is derived from the Latin word ''cimex'' of the same meaning.<ref name=\"OED\"/>\n\nThese bugs tend to gather on sunny open patches of turfgrass.

United States of America: McGraw-Hill Book Company.</ref>\n\n==Diet==\n''Blissus leucopterus'' feed on plants, both wild and cultivated, belonging to the grass family, such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, and corn. They suck the sap out of the growing plants. When the plants ripen or become dry, they travel to other growing plants to feed.\n\n==Life cycle==\nThe lifespan of the ''Blissus leucopterus'' is a typically less than one year. The eggs of two generations are laid down from spring to summer, when they develop into adults. During the fall, the adults from the first generation die off, while the adults from the second generation retreat from the crops to look for overwinter shelters. The adults overwinter in any type of shelters they can find, including in hedgerows, road sides, bushy fence rows, edges of woodlands, and soybean stubble, under tree barks and bunch grass, and inside field mice nests. Once they emerge from their hibernation, they return to the crop fields to feast and breed before their death.\n\n''Blissus leucopterus'' prefers hot, dry, and sunny conditions, while moist, warm, and humid conditions are detrimental for their population;<ref>{{cite web |title= IPM: Field Crops: Chinch Bug|url=http://extension.cropsci.illinois.edu/fieldcrops/insects/chinch_bug/ |accessdate=16 December 2014|publisher=Illinois College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences }}</ref> these conditions promote the growth of fungus which is fatal to them. Other elements that reduce their population is heavy rains. Developing nymphs that are hit with rain become trapped in the soils, killing them.

Mixtures of proteins are separated by two properties in two dimensions on 2D gels. 2-DE was first independently introduced by [[Patrick O'Farrell|O'Farrell]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Farrell, PH |year=1975 |title=High resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis of proteins |journal=J.

In electrophoresis in the first dimension, molecules are separated linearly according to their isoelectric point.  In the second dimension, the molecules are then separated at 90 degrees from the first electropherogram according to molecular mass.  Since it is unlikely that two molecules will be similar in two distinct properties, molecules are more effectively separated in 2-D electrophoresis than in 1-D electrophoresis.\n\nThe two dimensions that proteins are separated into using this technique can be [[isoelectric point]], protein complex mass in the [[native PAGE|native]] state, or protein [[mass]].\n\nSeparation of the proteins by isoelectric point is called [[isoelectric focusing]] (IEF). Thereby, a gradient of pH is applied to a gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel, making one end more positive than the other.  At all pH values other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged.  If they are positively charged, they will be pulled towards the more negative end of the gel and if they are negatively charged they will be pulled to the more positive end of the gel.  The proteins applied in the first dimension will move along the gel and will accumulate at their isoelectric point; that is, the point at which the overall charge on the protein is 0 (a neutral charge).\n\nFor the analysis of the functioning of proteins in a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], the knowledge of their cooperation is essential. Most often proteins act together in complexes to be fully functional. The analysis of this sub [[organelle]] organisation of the cell requires techniques conserving the native state of the [[protein complex]]es. In native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ([[native PAGE]]), proteins remain in their native state and are separated in the electric field following their mass and the mass of their complexes respectively. To obtain a separation by size and not by net charge, as in IEF, an additional charge is transferred to the proteins by the use of [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]] or lithium dodecyl sulfate. After completion of the first dimension the complexes are destroyed by applying the denaturing SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, where the proteins of which the complexes are composed of are separated by their mass.\n\nBefore separating the proteins by mass, they are treated with [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) along with other reagents ([[SDS-PAGE]] in 1-D).  This denatures the proteins (that is, it unfolds them into long, straight molecules) and binds a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's length.  Because a protein's length (when unfolded) is roughly proportional to its mass, this is equivalent to saying that it attaches a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's mass.  Since the SDS molecules are negatively charged, the result of this is that all of the proteins will have approximately the same mass-to-charge ratio as each other.  In addition, proteins will not migrate when they have no charge (a result of the isoelectric focusing step) therefore the coating of the protein in SDS (negatively charged) allows migration of the proteins in the second dimension (SDS-PAGE, it  is not compatible for use in the first dimension as it is charged and a nonionic or zwitterionic detergent needs to be used).\nIn the second dimension, an electric potential is again applied, but at a 90 degree angle from the first field.  The proteins will be attracted to the more positive side of the gel (because SDS is negatively charged) proportionally to their mass-to-charge ratio.  As previously explained, this ratio will be nearly the same for all proteins.  The proteins' progress will be slowed by frictional forces.  The gel therefore acts like a molecular sieve when the current is applied, separating the proteins on the basis of their molecular weight with larger proteins being retained higher in the gel and smaller proteins being able to pass through the sieve and reach lower regions of the gel.\n\n== Detecting proteins ==\nThe result of this is a gel with proteins spread out on its surface.  These proteins can then be detected by a variety of means, but the most commonly used stains are [[silver stain|silver]] and [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]] staining.  In the former case, a silver colloid is applied to the gel.  The silver binds to cysteine groups within the protein.  The silver is darkened by exposure to ultra-violet light.  The amount of  silver can be related to the darkness, and therefore the amount of protein at a given location on the gel.  This measurement can only give approximate amounts, but is adequate for most purposes. Silver staining is 100x more sensitive than [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]] with a 40-fold range of linearity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Switzer RC 3rd, Merril CR, Shifrin S |title=A highly sensitive silver stain for detecting proteins and peptides in polyacrylamide gels |journal=Analytical Biochemistry |year=1979 |volume=98 |pages=231\u201337 |pmid=94518 |doi=10.1016/0003-2697(79)90732-2 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\nMolecules other than proteins can be separated by 2D electrophoresis. In [[supercoiling]] assays, coiled [[DNA]] is separated in the first dimension and denatured by a DNA intercalator (such as [[ethidium bromide]] or the less carcinogenic [[chloroquine]]) in the second. This is comparable to the combination of native PAGE /SDS-PAGE in protein separation.\n\n== Common techniques ==\n\n=== IPG-DALT ===\nA common technique is to use an [[Immobilized pH gradient]] (IPG) in the first dimension. This technique is referred to as '''IPG-DALT'''. The sample is first separated onto IPG gel (which is commercially available) then the gel is cut into slices for each sample which is then equilibrated in SDS-mercaptoethanol and applied to an [[SDS-PAGE]] gel for resolution in the second dimension. Typically IPG-DALT is not used for quantification of proteins due to the loss of low molecular weight components during the transfer to the SDS-PAGE gel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mikkelsen |first1=Susan |last2=Cort\u00f3n |first2=Eduardo|title=Bioanalytical Chemistry |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-0-471-62386-1 |page=224}}</ref>\n\n=== IEF SDS-PAGE ===\nSee [[Isoelectric focusing]]\n\n== 2D gel analysis software ==\n{{Main|2D gel analysis software}}\n\n[[File:2D gel images dual channel original.PNG|thumb|200px|Warping: Images of two 2D electrophoresis gels, overlaid with [http://www.decodon.com/ Delta2D].

The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''[[Goya: A Life in Song]]'' with [[Freddie Gershon]] and [[Sony Music|CBS Records]], a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[John F.

But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''[[Goya: A Life in Song]]'' with [[Freddie Gershon]] and [[Sony Music|CBS Records]], a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[John F.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=notre>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|American Presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Columbia]] has gained attention in terms of [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, Artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher Plato argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|publisher=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon of the Mount]] has constituted a key moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]] and the sense of idealism embodied within that school of thought.{{fact|date=April 2020}}]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] and particularly the setting forth of clear-cut principles on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] exhortations, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back. Specific phrases such as \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" have come about in terms of moral instruction to effectively convey this idealism.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] have widely retained these influences, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] have pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many have done so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. In terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for ideal ethics through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideal ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\", which in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel_Kant_3.jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=notre/> the philospher seeing the defiance of ideals such as his \"[[categorical imperative]]\" concept as not only being wrong on principle but also illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=notre/>\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nModern Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of egalitarian values previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennial]]s, and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\".

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Appeals to idealism in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances.

Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access given that both are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref>''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View''. Immanuel Kant. Translated by Victor Lyle Dowdell. Revised and Edited by Hans H. Rudnick. With an Introduction by Frederick P. Van De Pitte. Southern Illinois University Press. Carbondale & Edwardsville.</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers such as philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour. Moral values\nwhich reflect what you actually do are far more plausible, but only at the cost of no longer serving to legitimate your activity.\"<ref name=terry>{{citebook|date=2004|authorlink=Terry Eagleton||title=After Theory|publisher=[[Penguin Publishing]]|pages=151-152|ISBN=9780141927886|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3N6zL1qyHQC}}</ref>}}\n\n==Examples of morally idealistic views in created media==\n===Idealism in film and television===\n[[File:Leonard Nimoy William Shatner Star Trek 1968.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Star Trek franchise|''Star Trek'' franchise]] has traditionally set forth an optimistic view of humanity, stressing the capacity for moral idealism amidst adversity.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple forms of media in terms of [[Film|filmed]] and [[Television series|serially televised]] production have portrayed issues surrounding ideals and characters facing tests of their personal ethics.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=notre>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|American Presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Columbia]] has gained attention in terms of [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, Artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher Plato argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|publisher=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon of the Mount]] has constituted a key moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]] and the sense of idealism embodied within that school of thought.{{fact|date=April 2020}}]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] and particularly the setting forth of clear-cut principles on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] exhortations, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back. Specific phrases such as \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" have come about in terms of moral instruction to effectively convey this idealism.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] have widely retained these influences, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] have pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many have done so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. In terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for ideal ethics through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideal ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\", which in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel_Kant_3.jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=notre/> the philospher seeing the defiance of ideals such as his \"[[categorical imperative]]\" concept as not only being wrong on principle but also illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=notre/>\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nModern Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of egalitarian values previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennial]]s, and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness.

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older. The human race as a whole has become wiser as history has moved along. The source of these new alternatives is the human imagination. It is the ability to come up with new ideas, rather than the ability to get in touch with unchanging essences, that is the engine of moral progress.\"<ref name=rorty>{{citejournal|title=Is Philosophy Relevant to Applied Ethics?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3857921|first=Richard|last=Rorty|authorlink=Richard Rorty|journal=[[Business Ethics Quarterly]]|volume=16|number=3|date=July 2006|pages=369-380|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>}}\n\n===In secular ethics===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the widespread movement away from traditional [[Religion|religious beliefs]] in both the [[Anglosphere]] and other nations during the 20th century and into the 21st century, the question of to what extent the ideals held by the [[Irreligion|irreligious]] owe a debt to particular faith groups has attracted much attention. Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Appeals to idealism in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances. In general, Gaus has advocated for [[compromise]] and incremental socio-political reform.<ref name=will>{{citenews|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/8/4/12376522/political-idealism-enemy|date=August 4, 2016|title=How political idealism leads us astray|accessdate=April 4, 2020|authorlink=Will Wilkinson|first=Will|last=Wilkinson|publisher=[[Vox.com]]}}</ref>\n\n===In traditional achievement===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a less abstract sense, multiple famous private individuals have been thought to embody certain ideals due to multiple factors such as their [[courage]], [[intelligence]], [[personal endurance]], and so on. Although existing in real life and thus being subject to complexities that philosophical [[thought experiment]]s often don't feature, these [[moral example]]s have established a link between dry intellectual principles and broader issues found in regular people's decision making. Naturally, even the famous have possessed diverse and multi-faceted traits. To get considered representative of an ideal has usually constituted a necessary simplification process; with only a few traits on prominent display, some individuals have become easy [[archetype]]s which others have tried to [[Mimicry|mimic]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] has been held up as as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars. Multiple other prophets exist in Islam and have been considered worth devoted study including [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and previous figures such as [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Moses in Islam|Moses]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:President George W.

This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref>''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View''.

Carbondale & Edwardsville.</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers such as philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour. Moral values\nwhich reflect what you actually do are far more plausible, but only at the cost of no longer serving to legitimate your activity.\"<ref name=terry>{{citebook|date=2004|authorlink=Terry Eagleton||title=After Theory|publisher=[[Penguin Publishing]]|pages=151-152|ISBN=9780141927886|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3N6zL1qyHQC}}</ref>}}\n\n==Examples of morally idealistic views in created media==\n===Idealism in film and television===\n[[File:Leonard Nimoy William Shatner Star Trek 1968.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Star Trek franchise|''Star Trek'' franchise]] has traditionally set forth an optimistic view of humanity, stressing the capacity for moral idealism amidst adversity.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple forms of media in terms of [[Film|filmed]] and [[Television series|serially televised]] production have portrayed issues surrounding ideals and characters facing tests of their personal ethics.

Upon the actor's death in 2003, journal ''The Guardian'' published a review of his life that labeled him the \"screen epitome of idealistic individualism\"; the actor's [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal values]] became as much a part of his public persona as his film career, Peck particularly taking a stand in his choice of roles against [[antisemitism]].

Writing for ''[[CEC Critic]]'', professor Thomas S.

While the titular inquisitor rationally argues for the relativist view that people seek safety and security over higher callings, Christ surprisingly kisses the aged, emotionally distant leader on the lips; while still holding to his views, the moved inquisitor allows Christ to leave freely. The ethical conflict posed by the characters's fundamental opposition, notably, fails to come to a resolution in the work, the [[ambiguity]] gaining much notice by later commentators.<ref>{{citeweb|title=The Grand Inquisitor \u2014 Dostoevsky\u2019s Greatest Scene|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|url=https://medium.com/classical-humanist/the-grand-inquisitor-dostoevskys-greatest-scene-3616517002cc|first=Kevin|last=Shau|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Comic books]] often incorporate conflicts between traditional heroes and heroines, ones who act out of a sense of altruism and cling to strict sets of ideals, with [[Antihero|antiheroes]] and other morally ambiguous individuals that still feature prominent superpowers.

According to rumors, in a defense base (literally means \"Thu\") in [[B\u00ecnh An, B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng|B\u00ecnh An]], there was a tree on the hill (tree here is a kind of species in [[dipterocarpaceae]], and it is called \"Dau\" in Vietnamese language), \"Mot\" is number one in [[Vietnamese language]], so the name \"Thu Dau Mot\" was born, which means \"one-tree-defense\" literally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sugia.vn/home|title=Historical linguistics in Binh Duong|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nTh\u1ee7 D\u1ea7u M\u1ed9t has seen a rapid expansion and economic development since 1997, as the province has become an important industrial hub of the region.

According to rumors, in a defense base (literally means \"Thu\") in [[B\u00ecnh An, B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng|B\u00ecnh An]], there was a tree on the hill (tree here is a kind of species in [[dipterocarpaceae]], and it is called \"Dau\" in Vietnamese language), \"Mot\" is number one in [[Vietnamese language]], so the name \"Thu Dau Mot\" was born, which means \"one-tree-defense\" literally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sugia.vn/home|title=Historical linguistics in Binh Duong|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nTh\u1ee7 D\u1ea7u M\u1ed9t has seen a rapid expansion and economic development since 1997, as the province has become an important industrial hub of the region.
