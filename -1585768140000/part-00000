Since that time, the identity of the killer or killers has been widely debated, and over 100 '''Jack the Ripper suspects''' have been named.<ref name=\"whiteway\">Whiteway, Ken (2004). \"A Guide to the Literature of Jack the Ripper\".

They occurred between August and November 1888 within a few streets of each other, and are collectively called the \"canonical five\". The six other murders\u2014those of [[Emma Elizabeth Smith]], [[Martha Tabram]], Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman\u2014have been linked with Jack the Ripper to varying degrees.\n\nThe swiftness of the attacks, and the manner of the mutilations performed on some of the bodies, which included disembowelment and removal of organs, led to speculation that the murderer had the skills of a physician or butcher.<ref>e.g. Dr Winslow, the examining pathologist, quoted in Haggard, Robert F.

Lawton further stated that he believed Feigenbaum was Jack the Ripper. Though covered by the press at the time, the idea was not pursued for more than a century.

Jullian made a passing reference to rumours that Clarence might have been responsible for the murders. Though Jullian did not detail the dates or sources of the rumour, it is possible that the rumour derived indirectly from Dr. [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]].

Described as violently antisocial, the poor East End local was suggested as a suspect by author and Ripperologist [[Martin Fido]] in his book ''The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper'' (1987). Fido claimed that the name \"David Cohen\" was used at the time to refer to a Jewish immigrant who either could not be positively identified or whose name was too difficult for police to spell, in the same fashion that \"[[John Doe]]\" is used in the United States today.<ref name=\"fido\">Fido quoted in Rumbelow, pp.180\u2013181</ref> Fido identified Cohen with \"Leather Apron\" (see [[Jack the Ripper suspects#John Pizer|John Pizer]] above), and speculated that Cohen's true identity was Nathan Kaminsky, a bootmaker living in Whitechapel who had been treated at one time for syphilis and who could not be traced after mid-1888\u2014the same time that Cohen appeared.<ref>Fido, pp. 215\u2013219</ref> Fido believed that police officials confused the name Kaminsky with Kosminski, resulting in the wrong man coming under suspicion (see [[Jack the Ripper suspects#Aaron Kosminski|Aaron Kosminski]] above). Cohen exhibited violent, destructive tendencies while at the asylum, and had to be restrained. He died at the asylum in October 1889.<ref>Fido, p. 220</ref> In his book ''The Cases That Haunt Us'', former FBI criminal profiler [[John E.

On 12 November 1888, he made a formal statement to the London police that in the early hours of 9 November 1888, Mary Jane Kelly approached him in the street and asked him for money. He stated that he had then followed her and another man of conspicuous appearance to her room, and had watched the room for about three-quarters of an hour without seeing either leave. He gave a very detailed description of the man, claiming he was \"of Jewish appearance\", despite the darkness of that night.<ref>Cullen, p. 180; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 190\u2013192; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 376\u2013377; Fido, p. 96; Marriott, p. 263</ref> The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was disputed among the senior police. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful.<ref>Inspector Abberline's report, 12 November 1888, Metropolitan police archives, MEPO 3/140 ff. 230\u20132, quoted in Begg,''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 238\u2013239 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 377\u2013378</ref> However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness.<ref>Cook, ''Jack the Ripper'', p. 176</ref> Hutchinson's statement was made on the day that Mary Kelly's inquest was held, and he was not called to testify. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself,<!--Bob Hinton's \"From Hell...The Jack the Ripper Mystery\" & Stephen Wright's \"Jack the Ripper: An American View\"--> trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.<ref>Marriott, p. 263</ref>\n\n===James Kelly===\n{{Main article|James Kelly (murderer)}}\n[[File:Jkelly.jpg|left|60px|James Kelly]]'''James Kelly''' (20 April 1860 \u2013 17 September 1929) was first identified as a suspect in Terence Sharkey's ''Jack the Ripper. 100 Years of Investigation'' (Ward Lock 1987) and documented in ''Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper'', by Jim Tully, in 1997.<ref>Tully, Jim, '' Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper ''.</ref>\n\nJames Kelly murdered his wife in 1883 by stabbing her in the neck. Deemed insane, he was committed to the [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor Asylum]], from which he later escaped in early 1888, using a key he fashioned himself. After the last of the five canonical Ripper murders in London in November 1888, the police searched for Kelly at what had been his residence prior to his wife's murder, but they were not able to locate him. In 1927, almost forty years after his escape, he unexpectedly turned himself in to officials at the Broadmoor Asylum. He died two years later, presumably of natural causes.\n\nRetired New York Police Department cold-case detective [[Ed Norris]] examined the Jack the Ripper case for a Discovery Channel programme called ''Jack the Ripper in America''. In it, Norris claims that James Kelly was Jack the Ripper, and that he was also responsible for multiple murders in cities around the United States. Norris highlights a few features of the Kelly story to support his contention. Norris reported Kelly's Broadmoor Asylum file from before his escape and his eventual return has never been opened since 1927 until Norris was given special permission for access to it, and that the file is the perfect profile match for Jack the Ripper.<ref>''Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer And a Literary Phenomenon'' {{ISBN|0-873-38861-5}} pp. 194-195</ref>\n\n===Charles Allen Lechmere===\n'''Charles Allen Lechmere''' (1849\u20131920), also known as '''Charles Cross''', was a meat cart driver for the Pickfords company, and is conventionally regarded as an innocent witness who discovered the body of [[Mary Ann Nichols|Polly Nichols]]. In a documentary titled ''Jack the Ripper: The New Evidence'', Swedish journalist Christer Holmgren and criminologist Gareth Norris of [[Aberystwyth University]], with assistance from former detective Andy Griffiths, proposed that Lechmere was the Ripper. According to Holmgren, Lechmere lied to police, claiming that he had been with Nichols's body for a few minutes, whereas research on his route to work from his home demonstrated that he must have been with her for about nine minutes. \n\nWhen Lechmere called over Robert Paul to look at her, no blood was visible, but by the time a constable found her shortly afterward, a pool had formed around her neck, suggesting the cut to her throat was very fresh when Lechmere and Paul were present. In addition, neither man reported seeing or hearing anyone else in Buck's Row, which had no side exits. It was theorized that Lechmere had killed Nichols and begun the process of mutilating her body when he heard Paul's footsteps, and then rushed to portray himself as the discoverer of her body. Lechmere did not come forward until Paul mentioned him to the press, and he gave evidence under the name \"Charles Cross\" at the inquest; Cross was the surname of a stepfather.\n\nLechmere's home address, visits to family, and route to work link him to the times and places of murders; he passed three streets where [[Martha Tabram]], Polly Nichols, and Annie Chapman were murdered roughly at the same time the murders are estimated to have occurred. The \"Double Event\" murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes occurred on a Saturday, his only night off from work: Stride was killed near Lechmere's mother's house in an area he grew up in, and the direct route from Stride's murder scene to the location of Eddowes's murder followed a path to Lechmere's route to work that he had used for twenty years. Mary Kelly was also murdered on his route to work, and the time frame in which she is estimated to have been killed matches his route, although the day she was killed was a holiday and he may have had the day off. \n\nLechmere's family background is also similar to that of many serial killers: he grew up in a \"broken home\"; having never known his biological father, he had two stepfathers; and his childhood was characterized by an instability of residence, growing up in a series of different homes. In addition, his occupation as a meat cart driver would have allowed his blood-splattered appearance to escape suspicion. Holmgren believes that Lechmere may have been responsible for several other murders in addition to those of the canonical five victims and Martha Tabram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/conspiracy-the-missing-evidence/episodes/episode-3-616|title=Jack The Ripper: The Missing Evidence|work=Five}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2014/11/title-159995-en.html|title=Aberystwyth University \u2013 November|work=aber.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Connor |first1=Michael |title=Casebook: Jack the Ripper - Charles Cross was Jack the Ripper? |url=https://www.casebook.org/dissertations/rip-charles-cross-was-jtr.html |website=www.casebook.org |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/535861/How-police-overlooked-the-Ripper|title=EXCLUSIVE: Police overlooked Ripper 'hiding in plain sight'|first=Jaymi|last=McCann|date=16 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Jacob Levy===\n'''Jacob Levy''' (1856 \u2013  29 July 1891) was born in Aldgate in 1856.

Harrison dismissed the idea that Albert Victor was the Ripper but instead suggested that Stephen, a poet and one of Albert Victor's tutors from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], was a more likely suspect. Harrison's suggestion was based on Stephen's misogynistic writings and on similarities between his handwriting and that of the [[From Hell letter|\"From Hell\"]] letter, supposedly written by the Ripper. Harrison supposed that Stephen may have had sexual feelings for Albert Victor, and that Stephen's hatred of women arose from jealousy because Albert Victor preferred female company and did not reciprocate Stephen's feelings.<ref>[[Michael Harrison (writer)|Harrison, Michael]] (1972).

The suggestion was widely dismissed, as Albert Victor had strong alibis for the murders, and it is unlikely that he suffered from syphilis.<ref>e.g. Rumbelow, pp.211\u2013213</ref> Stowell later denied implying that Clarence was the Ripper<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (9&nbsp;November 1970). \"Jack the Ripper\". ''[[The Times]]'' p.9; Issue 58018; col.F</ref> but efforts to investigate his claims further were hampered, as Stowell was elderly, and he died from natural causes just days after the publication of his article. The same week, Stowell's son reported that he had burned his father's papers, saying \"I read just sufficient to make certain that there was nothing of importance.\"<ref>PHS (14&nbsp;November 1970). \"The Times Diary: Ripper file destroyed\". ''The Times'' p.12; Issue 58023; col.E</ref>\n\nSubsequently, [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]], such as [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]] in ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'', have elaborated on the supposed involvement of Clarence in the murders. Rather than implicate Albert Victor directly, they claim that he secretly married and had a daughter with a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] shop assistant, and that Queen Victoria, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], his [[Freemason]] friends, and the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] conspired to murder anyone aware of Albert Victor's supposed child. Many facts contradict this theory and its originator, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press that it was a hoax.<ref>''The Sunday Times'', 18&nbsp;June 1978, quoted in Rumbelow, p.237</ref> Variations of the theory involve the physician [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], the artist [[Walter Sickert]], and the poet [[James Kenneth Stephen]] to greater or lesser degrees, and have been fictionalised in novels and films, such as ''[[Murder by Decree]]'' and ''[[From Hell]]''.\n\n===Joseph Barnett===\n{{Main article|Joseph Barnett (Jack the Ripper suspect)}}\n[[File:Joseph-barnett-jack-the-rip.jpg|left|60px|Joseph Barnett]]'''Joseph Barnett''' (c. 1858\u20131927) was a former fish porter, and victim Mary Kelly's lover from 8 April 1887 to 30 October 1888, when they quarrelled and separated after he lost his job and she returned to prostitution to make a living. Inspector Abberline questioned him for four hours after Kelly's murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge.<ref name=\"rwr\"/> A century after the murders, author Bruce Paley proposed him as a suspect as Kelly's scorned or jealous lover, and suggested that he'd committed the other murders to scare Kelly off the streets and out of prostitution.<ref name=\"rwr\">Rumbelow, p. 262; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Other authors suggest he killed Kelly only, and mutilated the body to make it look like a Ripper murder, but Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him.<ref>Rumbelow, p. 262</ref> Other acquaintances of Kelly put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.<ref>Whitehead and Rivett, p. 123</ref>\n\n===Lewis Carroll===\n[[File:Lewis carroll.jpg|60px|frameless|left|Lewis Caroll]]\n{{Main article|Lewis Carroll}}\t\n'''Lewis Carroll''' ([[pen name]] of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) (27 January 1832 \u2013 14 January 1898) was the author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

Described as violently antisocial, the poor East End local was suggested as a suspect by author and Ripperologist [[Martin Fido]] in his book ''The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper'' (1987). Fido claimed that the name \"David Cohen\" was used at the time to refer to a Jewish immigrant who either could not be positively identified or whose name was too difficult for police to spell, in the same fashion that \"[[John Doe]]\" is used in the United States today.<ref name=\"fido\">Fido quoted in Rumbelow, pp.180\u2013181</ref> Fido identified Cohen with \"Leather Apron\" (see [[Jack the Ripper suspects#John Pizer|John Pizer]] above), and speculated that Cohen's true identity was Nathan Kaminsky, a bootmaker living in Whitechapel who had been treated at one time for syphilis and who could not be traced after mid-1888\u2014the same time that Cohen appeared.<ref>Fido, pp. 215\u2013219</ref> Fido believed that police officials confused the name Kaminsky with Kosminski, resulting in the wrong man coming under suspicion (see [[Jack the Ripper suspects#Aaron Kosminski|Aaron Kosminski]] above). Cohen exhibited violent, destructive tendencies while at the asylum, and had to be restrained. He died at the asylum in October 1889.<ref>Fido, p. 220</ref> In his book ''The Cases That Haunt Us'', former FBI criminal profiler [[John E. Douglas|John Douglas]] has asserted that behavioural clues gathered from the murders all point to a person \"known to the police as David Cohen&nbsp;... or someone very much like him\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Douglas, John |author2=Olshaker, Mark |year=2001|title=The Cases That Haunt Us |publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|pages=79\u201380|isbn=978-0-7432-1239-7}}</ref>\n\n===William Withey Gull===\n{{Main article|Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet}}\n[[File:Sir William Withey Gull.jpg|left|60px|Sir William Withey Gull]]'''Sir William Withey Gull''' (31 December 1816 \u2013 29 January 1890) was physician-in-ordinary to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. He was named as the Ripper as part of the evolution of the widely discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/royal conspiracy theory outlined in such books as ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]''. Coachman [[John Netley]] has been named as his accomplice. Thanks to the popularity of this theory among fiction writers and for its dramatic nature, Gull shows up as the Ripper in a number of books and films including the TV film ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1988), [[Alan Moore]] and [[Eddie Campbell]]'s graphic novel ''[[From Hell]]'' (1999), and its [[From Hell (film)|2001 film adaptation]], in which [[Ian Holm]] plays Gull. Conventional historians have never taken Gull seriously as a suspect due to sheer lack of evidence; in addition, he was in his seventies at the time of the murders and had recently suffered a [[stroke]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Douglas, John |author2=Olshaker, Mark |year=2001|title=The Cases That Haunt Us |publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|pages=72\u20134|isbn=978-0-7432-1239-7}}</ref>\n\n===George Hutchinson===\n{{Main article|George Hutchinson (Jack the Ripper suspect)}}\n'''George Hutchinson''' was an unemployed labourer. On 12 November 1888, he made a formal statement to the London police that in the early hours of 9 November 1888, Mary Jane Kelly approached him in the street and asked him for money. He stated that he had then followed her and another man of conspicuous appearance to her room, and had watched the room for about three-quarters of an hour without seeing either leave. He gave a very detailed description of the man, claiming he was \"of Jewish appearance\", despite the darkness of that night.<ref>Cullen, p. 180; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 190\u2013192; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 376\u2013377; Fido, p. 96; Marriott, p. 263</ref> The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was disputed among the senior police. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful.<ref>Inspector Abberline's report, 12 November 1888, Metropolitan police archives, MEPO 3/140 ff. 230\u20132, quoted in Begg,''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 238\u2013239 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 377\u2013378</ref> However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness.<ref>Cook, ''Jack the Ripper'', p. 176</ref> Hutchinson's statement was made on the day that Mary Kelly's inquest was held, and he was not called to testify. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself,<!--Bob Hinton's \"From Hell...The Jack the Ripper Mystery\" & Stephen Wright's \"Jack the Ripper: An American View\"--> trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.<ref>Marriott, p. 263</ref>\n\n===James Kelly===\n{{Main article|James Kelly (murderer)}}\n[[File:Jkelly.jpg|left|60px|James Kelly]]'''James Kelly''' (20 April 1860 \u2013 17 September 1929) was first identified as a suspect in Terence Sharkey's ''Jack the Ripper. 100 Years of Investigation'' (Ward Lock 1987) and documented in ''Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper'', by Jim Tully, in 1997.<ref>Tully, Jim, '' Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper ''.</ref>\n\nJames Kelly murdered his wife in 1883 by stabbing her in the neck. Deemed insane, he was committed to the [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor Asylum]], from which he later escaped in early 1888, using a key he fashioned himself. After the last of the five canonical Ripper murders in London in November 1888, the police searched for Kelly at what had been his residence prior to his wife's murder, but they were not able to locate him. In 1927, almost forty years after his escape, he unexpectedly turned himself in to officials at the Broadmoor Asylum. He died two years later, presumably of natural causes.\n\nRetired New York Police Department cold-case detective [[Ed Norris]] examined the Jack the Ripper case for a Discovery Channel programme called ''Jack the Ripper in America''. In it, Norris claims that James Kelly was Jack the Ripper, and that he was also responsible for multiple murders in cities around the United States. Norris highlights a few features of the Kelly story to support his contention. Norris reported Kelly's Broadmoor Asylum file from before his escape and his eventual return has never been opened since 1927 until Norris was given special permission for access to it, and that the file is the perfect profile match for Jack the Ripper.<ref>''Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer And a Literary Phenomenon'' {{ISBN|0-873-38861-5}} pp. 194-195</ref>\n\n===Charles Allen Lechmere===\n'''Charles Allen Lechmere''' (1849\u20131920), also known as '''Charles Cross''', was a meat cart driver for the Pickfords company, and is conventionally regarded as an innocent witness who discovered the body of [[Mary Ann Nichols|Polly Nichols]]. In a documentary titled ''Jack the Ripper: The New Evidence'', Swedish journalist Christer Holmgren and criminologist Gareth Norris of [[Aberystwyth University]], with assistance from former detective Andy Griffiths, proposed that Lechmere was the Ripper. According to Holmgren, Lechmere lied to police, claiming that he had been with Nichols's body for a few minutes, whereas research on his route to work from his home demonstrated that he must have been with her for about nine minutes. \n\nWhen Lechmere called over Robert Paul to look at her, no blood was visible, but by the time a constable found her shortly afterward, a pool had formed around her neck, suggesting the cut to her throat was very fresh when Lechmere and Paul were present. In addition, neither man reported seeing or hearing anyone else in Buck's Row, which had no side exits. It was theorized that Lechmere had killed Nichols and begun the process of mutilating her body when he heard Paul's footsteps, and then rushed to portray himself as the discoverer of her body. Lechmere did not come forward until Paul mentioned him to the press, and he gave evidence under the name \"Charles Cross\" at the inquest; Cross was the surname of a stepfather.\n\nLechmere's home address, visits to family, and route to work link him to the times and places of murders; he passed three streets where [[Martha Tabram]], Polly Nichols, and Annie Chapman were murdered roughly at the same time the murders are estimated to have occurred. The \"Double Event\" murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes occurred on a Saturday, his only night off from work: Stride was killed near Lechmere's mother's house in an area he grew up in, and the direct route from Stride's murder scene to the location of Eddowes's murder followed a path to Lechmere's route to work that he had used for twenty years. Mary Kelly was also murdered on his route to work, and the time frame in which she is estimated to have been killed matches his route, although the day she was killed was a holiday and he may have had the day off. \n\nLechmere's family background is also similar to that of many serial killers: he grew up in a \"broken home\"; having never known his biological father, he had two stepfathers; and his childhood was characterized by an instability of residence, growing up in a series of different homes. In addition, his occupation as a meat cart driver would have allowed his blood-splattered appearance to escape suspicion. Holmgren believes that Lechmere may have been responsible for several other murders in addition to those of the canonical five victims and Martha Tabram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/conspiracy-the-missing-evidence/episodes/episode-3-616|title=Jack The Ripper: The Missing Evidence|work=Five}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2014/11/title-159995-en.html|title=Aberystwyth University \u2013 November|work=aber.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Connor |first1=Michael |title=Casebook: Jack the Ripper - Charles Cross was Jack the Ripper? |url=https://www.casebook.org/dissertations/rip-charles-cross-was-jtr.html |website=www.casebook.org |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/535861/How-police-overlooked-the-Ripper|title=EXCLUSIVE: Police overlooked Ripper 'hiding in plain sight'|first=Jaymi|last=McCann|date=16 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Jacob Levy===\n'''Jacob Levy''' (1856 \u2013  29 July 1891) was born in Aldgate in 1856.

A diary purportedly by Maybrick, published in the 1990s by Michael Barrett, contains a confession to the Ripper murders. In 1995, Barrett confessed to writing the diary himself, and described the process of counterfeiting the diary in detail. He swore under oath that he and his wife, Anne, had forged it.<ref>Affidavit of Michael Barrett, 5 January 1995, quoted in Marriott, pp.272\u2013277</ref> Anne Barrett, after their divorce, later denied forgery, and their story changed several times over the years.

Le Queux claimed to have seen a manuscript in French written by [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] stating that Jack the Ripper was an insane Russian doctor named Alexander Pedachenko, an agent of the [[Okhrana]] (the Secret Police of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]), whose aim in committing the murders was to discredit Scotland Yard. He was supposedly assisted by two accomplices: \"Levitski\" and a tailoress called Winberg.<ref>Le Queux, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 197 and Whitehead and Rivett, p. 103</ref> However, there is no hard evidence that Pedachenko ever existed, and many parts of the story as recounted by Le Queux fall apart when examined closely.<ref>Begg, p. 309</ref> For example, one of the sources named in the manuscript was a London-based Russian journalist called Nideroest, who was known for inventing sensational stories. Reviewers of Le Queux's book were aware of Nideroest's background, and unabashedly referred to him as an \"unscrupulous liar\".<ref>Quoted in Rumbelow, p.198</ref> Pedachenko was promoted as a suspect by [[Donald McCormick]], who may have developed the story by adding his own inventions.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 147</ref>\n\n===Walter Sickert===\n{{Main article|Walter Sickert}}\n[[File:Walter Sickert photo by George Charles Beresford 1911 (1).jpg|left|60px|Walter Sickert]]'''Walter Richard Sickert''' (31 May 1860 \u2013 22 January 1942) was a German-born artist of British and Danish ancestry, who was first mentioned as a possible Ripper suspect in [[Donald McCormick]]'s book ''The Identity of Jack the Ripper'' (1959).<ref>Knight, p.250</ref> He had a fascination with the Ripper murders, going so far as to stay in a room that was rumoured to have once had Jack the Ripper himself as a lodger, and depicted similar scenes in many of his paintings.

Harrison dismissed the idea that Albert Victor was the Ripper but instead suggested that Stephen, a poet and one of Albert Victor's tutors from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], was a more likely suspect. Harrison's suggestion was based on Stephen's misogynistic writings and on similarities between his handwriting and that of the [[From Hell letter|\"From Hell\"]] letter, supposedly written by the Ripper. Harrison supposed that Stephen may have had sexual feelings for Albert Victor, and that Stephen's hatred of women arose from jealousy because Albert Victor preferred female company and did not reciprocate Stephen's feelings.<ref>[[Michael Harrison (writer)|Harrison, Michael]] (1972).

[[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]] argued that the murders were a [[Jack_the_Ripper:_The_Final_Solution|conspiracy]] involving multiple miscreants,<ref>Knight, Stephen (1976). ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]''.</ref> whereas others have proposed that each murder was committed by unconnected individuals acting independently of each other (which, if true, would mean there never actually was a single \"Ripper\" at all).<ref>e.g. Turnbull, Peter (1996). ''The Killer Who Never Was: A Re-appraisal of the Whitechapel Murders of 1888''. {{ISBN|1-900540-00-2}}</ref>\n\nThe police of the time believed the Ripper was a local Whitechapel resident.<ref>Robert Anderson's memoirs, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 626\u2013633</ref> His apparent ability to disappear immediately after the killings suggests an intimate knowledge of the Whitechapel neighbourhood, including its back alleys and hiding places.<ref>A \"Scotland Yard official\" quoted in the ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 8 April 1892, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 577\u2013578</ref> However, the population of Whitechapel was largely transient, impoverished and often used aliases. The lives of many of its residents were little recorded. Despite continued interest in the case and ongoing investigation by both professional and amateur researchers, the Ripper's true identity will almost certainly never be known.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Begg, Paul (2003).

He was [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[Heavyweight]] champion from 1944 to 1945. His son, who fought as [[Brian London]], also became [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[Heavyweight]] champion from 1958 to 1959.\n\n==Early career==\n\nHe was born in Stranton, [[West Hartlepool]], [[County Durham]]. He made his professional debut in January 1931, in West Hartlepool, winning by a knockout in the first round. He took the ring name of [[Jack London]], after the American author, who also covered fights for American boxing magazines. London was six feet tall and big framed, with a style that some regarded as crude and cumbersome. He fought most of his early fights in his native North East, whilst continuing to work as a lorry driver.\n\nHe did not fight in the capital until October 1932, losing at Blackfriars against Jack O\u2019Malley, an [[Australia]]n heavyweight due to an injured hand. In November 1933, he fought [[Ben Foord]], later to become British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion himself. London lost on points over ten rounds at the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]]. In December 1933, he also fought the Commonwealth (Empire) champion, [[Larry Gains]], being knocked out by the [[Canada|Canadian]] in the second round. In February 1935, he lost another points decision against Ben Foord. In March 1936 London fought the American ex-world-light-heavyweight champion, [[Tommy Loughran]], losing on points over ten rounds. London next had a points win against another American, Obie Walker, and then went to fight in [[Berlin]] against Hans Schonrath, gaining another points decision.\n\nLondon's recent successes against good quality opponents appeared to have put him in line for a title challenge against British heavyweight champion, [[Tommy Farr]], but Farr seemed reluctant to fight him, perhaps because he was not a draw for crowds. In May 1937 London fought the American, [[Buddy Baer]], brother of [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], losing on points over ten rounds. Baer was later to fight [[Joe Louis]] twice for the world heavyweight title, losing both fights. When Farr relinquished his heavyweight title, London was ignored and [[Len Harvey]] beat Eddie Phillips to take the vacant British heavyweight title in December 1938.\n\n==War==\nWar interrupted London's boxing career, and he joined the [[Royal Air Force]], being stationed near [[Blackpool]]. London so liked the place that he would later relocate his family there. London continued to fight during the war years but managed only twelve bouts. Len Harvey was still heavyweight champion but decided to challenge for the vacant British and Commonwealth light-heavyweight titles, beating [[Jock McAvoy]] on points. He then defended his light-heavyweight titles against [[Freddie Mills]] in June 1942 being knocked out in the second round. Harvey promptly retired leaving his heavyweight tiles vacant. London now had his chance.\n\nLondon fought a 3-round exhibition match for the RAF on 6 March 1940 at RAF Station Hednesford. He fought under his service rank of Corporal Harper against Corporal George James, and autographed programmes as Jack London.<ref>contemporary programme</ref>\n\n==Heavyweight title==\nLondon fought an eliminator for the British heavyweight title in March 1943, against Al Robinson, winning by a knockout in the eighth round. The path was open for a title fight between London and Freddie Mills, for the British and Commonwealth titles. The fight was finally arranged for September 1944 at [[Belle Vue, Manchester|Belle Vue]], in Manchester. Mills conceded about three stones in weight but was still 3-1 favourite. Neither of the two was a stylish boxer, and the two men slugged it out over fifteen rounds with London getting a narrow points decision. Mills was to go on to be world light-heavyweight champion.\n\nLondon had one more non-title fight which he won by a knockout, before defending his titles against [[Bruce Woodcock (boxer)|Bruce Woodcock]]. The fight was arranged for July 1945 at [[White Hart Lane]], [[Tottenham]], London. Woodcock was about two stones lighter than London, but was more nimble and was able to evade many of London's attacks, building up an early points lead. London started to come back at him with body punches, but in the sixth round Woodcock caught him with a left to put him down. He got up but was put down twice more, finally being counted out.\n\n==Subsequent career==\nLondon lost his next fight after losing his titles and briefly retired. However a failed business venture forced him back into the ring. He travelled to [[Stockholm]] where he was beaten by Olle Tandberg, then won two fights in [[South Africa]]. In 1947 he was beaten in an eliminator for the British heavyweight title.\n\nHe continued to fight in the North East, then in 1949 lost an eliminator for the Commonwealth heavyweight title. His last fight was against American, Aaron Wilson at Earls Court in November 1949. He was knocked out in the first round and realised that it was time to retire in earnest.\n\n==Retirement==\nLondon tried his hand at wrestling for a while, and then became a nightclub manager. He took a great interest in the boxing careers of his two sons John and Brian, and was proud to see Brian become British and Commonwealth champion as he had been. He saw Brian unsuccessfully fight [[Floyd Patterson]] for the world heavyweight title in 1959, but died before Brian fought [[Muhammad Ali]] for the same title in 1966.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of British heavyweight boxing champions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/Jack_London\n*  Ronnie Wharton (2005), ''Fighting Men of the North'', Tempus Publishing Limited, {{ISBN|0-7524-3551-5}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-ach|ach}}\n{{s-bef | before=[[Len Harvey]]<br>Retired}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[BBBofC|British]] [[List of British heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Champion]]<br>[[Commonwealth Boxing Council|Commonwealth]] [[Commonwealth Boxing Council#Heavyweight|Heavyweight Champion]]|years=15 September 1944 \u2013 17 July 1945}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[Bruce Woodcock (boxer)|Bruce Woodcock]]}}\n {{S-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:London, Jack}}\n[[Category:English male boxers]]\n[[Category:Heavyweight boxers]]\n[[Category:1913 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from West Hartlepool]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=June 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2014}}\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2014}}\n}}\n{{Infobox boxer\n| name = Jack London\n| image =\n| nationality = {{Flagicon|UK}} [[United Kingdom|British]]\n| realname = John George Harper\n| nicknames = \n| weight = [[Heavyweight]]\n| birth_date = 23 June 1913\n| birth_place = [[File:Flag of England.svg|25px]] [[West Hartlepool]], [[County Durham]], England\n|death_date= 19 December 1963 (aged 50)\n|death_place=[[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]], England\n| style = Orthodox\n| total = 142\n| wins = 95\n| losses = 40\n| draws = 5\n| KO = 52\n| no contests = 0\n}}\n\n'''Jack London''' (born '''John George Harper'''; 23 June 1913{{snd}}19 December 1963) was an [[England|English]] [[heavyweight]] [[boxing|boxer]].

He built a new moated manor house, which is described in the Black Book of the Exchequer \u2013 having a tiled roof, chimney, two bedchambers and an inner courtyard. Beyond the moat was an outer courtyard with a number of buildings for servants and supplies, and a short distance away was a watermill. The exact location of this house is not recorded, but a report of an area long ago known as 'Moated Place' puts the likely place between the Northumberland Arms and Twickenham Road, with the watermill being near Railshead, on the River Crane (not where the traditional Isleworth mill 'Kidd's Mill', because the stream there is artificial and did not exist at that time).<ref name=\"Make a City Here p68\"/> The seemingly classic medieval manor house was burned down during the [[Second Barons' War]] in 1264.\n\n===Advowson, right to appoint the vicar===\nThe Abbey of St Valeri in Picardy held the livings ([[benefice]]s) and revenues of several English parish church lands and, responding to growing disquiet over these foreign holdings, in 1391 it transferred those of Isleworth (for a fee) to William of Wykeham, who endowed them to [[Winchester College]], which he founded. The Wardens and Scholars of Winchester College therefore became proprietors of productive rectory (which had [[glebe]]lands). This lasted for 150 years, then in 1543 [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] exchanged with Winchester certain manors elsewhere for five churches in Middlesex, including All Saints. Four years later he gave the Isleworth rectory and advowson to the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], but they returned to the crown when the Duke was executed in 1552. Soon after, they were given to the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] and [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], with whom they remain today.<ref>'And So Make a City Here' by G E Bate F.R.Hist.S. pp106/7 published: Thomasons Hounslow 1948</ref>  The castle-like stone church tower by the river remains from this period, see below.\n\n===Transfer of Manor to Syon Monastery===\nIn 1415 [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] granted nuns from the Swedish [[Bridgettines|Bridgettine order]] land on the bank of the Thames, in Twickenham parish opposite his new [[Richmond Palace|Sheen Palace]], where they built their first house [[Syon Monastery]]. In 1422 Henry V transferred ownership of Isleworth Manor from the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] to Syon Monastery,<ref>Aungier, p.39; Rot.

It was Seymour who built [[Syon House]] in 1548.\n\n===Acquired by Earl of Northumberland===\nForty-six years later, in 1594 Queen Elizabeth I granted a lease of the manor of Syon to [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]] on his marriage to [[Dorothy Devereux]]  the younger daughter of [[Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex]], who later received a grant of the freehold from King James I in 1604.<ref>Victoria County History, A History of the Co. of Middlesex, Vol.3, Syon House, pp.97\u201398</ref> It has remained in the possession of the Percy family, now the Dukedom of Northumberland, for over four hundred years.

Lower Square and Church Street still have buildings dating from the 18th and early 19th centuries. A striking element of this period was the establishment in Isleworth of many mansions and large houses, principally for aristocrats and high achievers. This phenomenon arose owing mainly to the collection of royal and noble residences and ecclesiastical establishments that already existed nearby. The subject is examined in depth in the \"Notable houses\" section.\n\n===20th century===\nThe first half of the 20th century for Isleworth generally was characterised by a very substantial amount of artisan and white-collar residential development throughout the town, at the expense of numerous market gardens. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The former western area was ceded to the town and parish of [[Hounslow]], which was invested as a civil parish in 1927. This period also included the building of several new factories and offices, mostly towards the north-east, up to the town's eastern boundary with New Brentford. This rapid spread of building transformed the nature of Isleworth's layout in the space of just fifty years, from an agrarian pattern to an urban one.\n\nIsleworth's former Thames frontage of approximately one mile, excluding that of the [[Syon House|Syon estate]], which is shared with Brentford, was reduced to {{convert|0.5|mi}} in 1994 when a borough boundary realignment was ordered by the UK's Local Government Minister to add land to the district of [[St Margarets, London|St Margarets]], Twickenham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931391_en_1.htm|title=The Greater London and Surrey (County and London Borough Boundaries) (No.4) Order 1993|author=|date=|website=www.opsi.gov.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nElevations range from {{cvt|27|m|ft}} in the north west to {{cvt|4.9|m|ft}} by the Thames at the opposite extreme [[Ordnance Datum|OD]].

A six-lane dual carriageway for most of its length, with attendant cycle paths, it fulfilled the purpose of bypassing the bottlenecks of Brentford and Hounslow high streets to relieve the old road from London of traffic heading to and from Windsor and beyond. A later branch extension off this new road, named the Great South West Road, carried traffic south-westwards and this had the additional effect of relieving the London Road of traffic heading to and from Staines-upon-Thames and beyond.\n\nThe other throughway in this category is the Twickenham Road (A 310), which branches off London Road west of the Syon estate and takes traffic to Twickenham, Teddington and beyond. This was the King's Highway to Hampton Court, so in years past those houses fronting on Twickenham Road, such as Somerset House, [[Kendal House]] and the two Silver Halls would have been favoured with a royal gaze from time to time. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Bus and tram===\nHorse bus operation came to Isleworth in the mid 1800s.\nThe predominant London bus operator from 1856 to 1933 was the [[London General Omnibus Company]], after which the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] was formed.\nOn 19 October 1856 the LGOC took over an existing horse bus operation between Isleworth and [[St Pauls Cathedral]] with the buses painted red. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nElectric trams started running in Isleworth in 1901, from a depot situated on the north side of London Road, near the border with [[Hounslow]]. The original operating company was [[London United Tramways]], which was subsumed into the new [[London Passenger Transport Board]] in 1933. In 1935 the depot was converted to [[Trolleybuses in London|trolleybus]] operation. It was designed in a horseshoe shape with a travelator at the far end, which had a turntable added for the trolleybuses. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Originally known as Hounslow Depot, it was renamed Isleworth and given the code \"IH\" in 1950. It had a capacity for 37 vehicles and only ever operated one service: the 57 tram route which, on conversion, became the 657 trolleybus route. Both the 57 and 657 operated between [[Hounslow]] and [[Shepherd's Bush]] Green via Isleworth, [[Brentford]], [[Chiswick]], and Goldhawk Road. From 1902 the Hounslow terminus of the 57 tram was the \"Hussar\" in Staines Road, Hounslow Heath. In July 1922 the service was cut back to terminate at the \"Bell\" at the western end of Hounslow High Street. A special turning place half a mile along Staines Road, at its junction with Wellington Road, was built for the 657 trolleybus. At different times there were ambitious plans to extend the tram lines westward to [[Staines-upon-Thames]] and even to [[Maidenhead]], but these never came about and the modern replacement motor bus route 237 traverses exactly the same roads between Hounslow Heath and Shepherd's Bush as the trams did over 110 years ago (with a short extension to White City). {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhen the 657 figured in the final London trolleybus conversion of all, on 8 May 1962, Isleworth Depot was closed and its staff were transferred to nearby [[Hounslow]] Bus Garage (coded \"AV\"). The replacement motor bus service was provided by an extension of [[London Buses route 117|route 117]], which up to then had run between Egham and Hounslow. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 1978 the 117 between Hounslow and Shepherd's Bush was superseded by an eastward extension to [[London Buses route 237|route 237]]. Until this time the 237 had operated between [[Chertsey]] and Hounslow with single deck buses \u2013 a truly suburban route. As part of the [[privatisation of London bus services]], Hounslow Garage passed to [[London United Busways|London United]] that later was purchased by [[Transdev (historic)|Transdev]] and later over by the [[RATP Group]].\n\nAnother trolleybus service serving Isleworth was the 667, formerly the 67 tram, which passed through en route from [[Hampton Court]] to [[Hammersmith]] via [[Hampton Hill]], [[Fulwell, London|Fulwell]], [[Twickenham]], Busch Corner, Brentford and Chiswick. Upon its transfer to motor bus operation, as part of the final London trolleybus conversions, the route had its number changed from 667 to [[London Buses route 267|267]]. Tram 67, trolleybus 667 and motor bus 267 were all operated from [[Fulwell bus garage]]. The history of the ownership of Fulwell (coded \"FW\") is exactly as for Hounslow Garage above.\n\nOn Summer Bank Holidays a special service was operated between Shepherd's Bush and Hampton Court. In tram days this was route 65, but trolleybuses showed number 667 towards Hampton Court and 657 on the return journey. This service did not survive the trolleybuses' withdrawal.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nA long-established motor bus route serving Isleworth (and Hounslow) was the number 37. This was one of the earliest motor bus routes introduced by the [[London General Omnibus Company]] and it originally ran from Isleworth to [[Peckham]] via [[St Margarets, London|St Margarets]], [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], [[Putney]], [[Wandsworth]], [[Clapham Junction]], [[Clapham Common]], [[Brixton]], [[Herne Hill]] and [[East Dulwich]]. It was later extended westward to Hounslow (going round the back streets to avoid the low railway bridge in St John's Road and to serve [[Isleworth railway station]]) and for a brief time in the 1920s offered a summer Sunday service extension as far as Maidenhead. Even without that short-lived extension the 37 was one of London's longest routes. Between 1922 and 1938 its western terminus was the \"Hussar\" at Hounslow Heath but was then cut back to turn at Hounslow Bus Garage (later Bus Station). At the beginning the terminus in Isleworth was the forecourt of the Northumberland Arms public house and the destination boards displayed \"ISLEWORTH Market Place\". Later, for \"short\" journeys, this was changed to stands in Magdala Road and then in South Street, outside the Public Hall. In 1991 this historic route was curtailed to run between Peckham and Putney, and the section between Richmond and Hounslow via Isleworth became a new, more localised service numbered H37.\n\n===Rail===\nIsleworth has only one rail service. It consists of a loop branch line running off the minor main line service operated by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]] between central London and Reading. On the down-service the loop begins at the Barnes junction, then travels through Chiswick and Brentford before entering Isleworth by crossing the River Brent just south of the A4 trunk road. Thereafter it serves the two stations of Syon Lane and Isleworth before leaving the town just north of the Woodlands estate and passing under Bridge Road. The service usually runs at fifteen-minute intervals. Following its next stop at Hounslow the loop re-enters the main line on the up-service shortly before the Whitton station.\n\n'''Nearest National Rail stations'''\n* [[Isleworth railway station|Isleworth]]\n* [[Syon Lane railway station|Syon Lane]]\n\n'''Nearest London Underground stations'''\n* [[Osterley station|Osterley]] ''Piccadilly Line''\n* [[Hounslow East station|Hounslow East]] ''Piccadilly Line''\n* [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]] ''District Line''\n\n===River passenger services (history)===\n[[File:pleasureboatisleworth1952.gif|thumb|right|Typical pleasure boat of the mid-20th century seen from Isleworth Promenade in 1952]]\n1840 ''George J Aungier:''\n\"There is a ferry, called Church Ferry, for foot passengers, from the church over the river to West Sheen, Kew, &c. and another at the southern extremity of the village, called Rails-head Ferry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3VsJAAAAIAAJ&dq=Aungier&printsec=frontcover#PPA133,M1|title=The History and Antiquities of Syon Monastery: The Parish of Isleworth, and the Chapelry of Hounslow|first=George James|last=Aungier|date=3 April 2018|publisher=J.B.

He steadily created a renowned botanical masterpiece on the estate, achieved primarily with many of the great variety of foreign plants he had collected on his great travels around the world, particularly with Captain Cook to Australia and the South Seas. Banks died in 1820, and over the next thirty years the house was considerably modified and enlarged by a new owner, Henry Pownall, who then sold the estate in 1850 for partial redevelopment.\nThe images on the right show the house as it looked in 1810, and then in 1850.\n\n[[File:VanGogh 1887 Selbstbildnis.jpg|right|thumb|Vincent van Gogh, painted by himself ten years after residing in Isleworth]]\n[[File:Turner selfportrait.jpg|left|thumb|William Turner]]\n\n*In 1804, [[JMW Turner|William Turner]] lived for a short time in Sion Ferry House in Isleworth, where he drew inspiration from the picturesque banks of the River Thames.

There was a triple attraction to the area in those times. Its rural, waterside beauty had become well recognised over two hundred years or so, and a few palaces, monasteries and mansions already existed. Then the royal court began to appear at Kew, so the adjacent districts on both sides of the Thames became very fashionable places for the rich and famous to build their grand homes.

As a result, most of Isleworth's riverside is that part overlooking the {{convert|8.6|acre|adj=on}} islet of Isleworth [[Ait]]: the short-length River Crane flows into the Thames south of the Isleworth Ait, and its artificial distributary the [[Duke of Northumberland]]'s River west of the Isleworth Ait, one of two [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]] distributaries constructed for aesthetic reasons in the 1600\u20131750 period.\n\n==Etymology==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!Date!!Form!!Source\n|-\n| 695|| Gislheresuuyrth|| An [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[charter]].\n|-\n| 1086|| Gistelesworde|| [[The Domesday Book|The Domesday Survey]]\n|-\n| 1301 ||Istelworth|| Roll.\n|-\n| 1415 ||Ystelworth||Roll.\n|-\n| 1418 ||Thistelworth||Plea Roll of the Court of Common Pleas<ref>National Archives; CP 40/629; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no629/aCP40no629fronts/IMG_0798.htm, with London, in the margin, and the plaintiff Thomas Brigge or Berigge, clerk, on a plea of debt, with Richard Beaupe of Thistelworth, Middx</ref>\n|-\n|  ||Yhistelforth||rowspan=\"2\"|George James Aungier, in \"History of [[Syon Monastery]], the Parish of Isleworth and the [[Chapelry]] of [[Hounslow]]\", 1840\n|-\n| || Islleworth\n|-\n| 1540 ||Istyllworth|| Local document\n|-\n| || Istelworthe||An assize document in the reign of [[Elizabeth I]]\n|-\n| 1554 ||Thyslyworth|| Plea Roll, Court of Common Pleas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT3/M/CP40no1157/aCP40no1157fronts/IMG_1355.htm|title=AALT Page|author=|date=|website=aalt.law.uh.edu|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1593 ||Thistleworth or Gistelesworth|| Norden and Lysons, historians\n|-\n| 1702|| Istleworth|| Shown on a memorial in the parish church.\n|-\n| 1742 ||Isleworth|| Title of an engraving by Thomas Priest.<ref>[http://collage.cityoflondon.gov.uk/collage/app?service=external/Item&sp=Z33195&sp=30420&sp=X Collage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526195332/http://collage.cityoflondon.gov.uk/collage/app?service=external%2FItem&sp=Z33195&sp=30420&sp=X |date=26 May 2011 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman and Anglo Saxon===\nExcavations around the eastern end of the [[Syon Park]] estate have unearthed evidence of a Romano-British settlement.

He built a new moated manor house, which is described in the Black Book of the Exchequer \u2013 having a tiled roof, chimney, two bedchambers and an inner courtyard. Beyond the moat was an outer courtyard with a number of buildings for servants and supplies, and a short distance away was a watermill. The exact location of this house is not recorded, but a report of an area long ago known as 'Moated Place' puts the likely place between the Northumberland Arms and Twickenham Road, with the watermill being near Railshead, on the River Crane (not where the traditional Isleworth mill 'Kidd's Mill', because the stream there is artificial and did not exist at that time).<ref name=\"Make a City Here p68\"/> The seemingly classic medieval manor house was burned down during the [[Second Barons' War]] in 1264.\n\n===Advowson, right to appoint the vicar===\nThe Abbey of St Valeri in Picardy held the livings ([[benefice]]s) and revenues of several English parish church lands and, responding to growing disquiet over these foreign holdings, in 1391 it transferred those of Isleworth (for a fee) to William of Wykeham, who endowed them to [[Winchester College]], which he founded. The Wardens and Scholars of Winchester College therefore became proprietors of productive rectory (which had [[glebe]]lands). This lasted for 150 years, then in 1543 [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] exchanged with Winchester certain manors elsewhere for five churches in Middlesex, including All Saints. Four years later he gave the Isleworth rectory and advowson to the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], but they returned to the crown when the Duke was executed in 1552. Soon after, they were given to the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] and [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], with whom they remain today.<ref>'And So Make a City Here' by G E Bate F.R.Hist.S. pp106/7 published: Thomasons Hounslow 1948</ref>  The castle-like stone church tower by the river remains from this period, see below.\n\n===Transfer of Manor to Syon Monastery===\nIn 1415 [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] granted nuns from the Swedish [[Bridgettines|Bridgettine order]] land on the bank of the Thames, in Twickenham parish opposite his new [[Richmond Palace|Sheen Palace]], where they built their first house [[Syon Monastery]].

Lower Square and Church Street still have buildings dating from the 18th and early 19th centuries. A striking element of this period was the establishment in Isleworth of many mansions and large houses, principally for aristocrats and high achievers. This phenomenon arose owing mainly to the collection of royal and noble residences and ecclesiastical establishments that already existed nearby. The subject is examined in depth in the \"Notable houses\" section.\n\n===20th century===\nThe first half of the 20th century for Isleworth generally was characterised by a very substantial amount of artisan and white-collar residential development throughout the town, at the expense of numerous market gardens. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The former western area was ceded to the town and parish of [[Hounslow]], which was invested as a civil parish in 1927. This period also included the building of several new factories and offices, mostly towards the north-east, up to the town's eastern boundary with New Brentford. This rapid spread of building transformed the nature of Isleworth's layout in the space of just fifty years, from an agrarian pattern to an urban one.\n\nIsleworth's former Thames frontage of approximately one mile, excluding that of the [[Syon House|Syon estate]], which is shared with Brentford, was reduced to {{convert|0.5|mi}} in 1994 when a borough boundary realignment was ordered by the UK's Local Government Minister to add land to the district of [[St Margarets, London|St Margarets]], Twickenham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931391_en_1.htm|title=The Greater London and Surrey (County and London Borough Boundaries) (No.4) Order 1993|author=|date=|website=www.opsi.gov.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nElevations range from {{cvt|27|m|ft}} in the north west to {{cvt|4.9|m|ft}} by the Thames at the opposite extreme [[Ordnance Datum|OD]].

A six-lane dual carriageway for most of its length, with attendant cycle paths, it fulfilled the purpose of bypassing the bottlenecks of Brentford and Hounslow high streets to relieve the old road from London of traffic heading to and from Windsor and beyond. A later branch extension off this new road, named the Great South West Road, carried traffic south-westwards and this had the additional effect of relieving the London Road of traffic heading to and from Staines-upon-Thames and beyond.\n\nThe other throughway in this category is the Twickenham Road (A 310), which branches off London Road west of the Syon estate and takes traffic to Twickenham, Teddington and beyond. This was the King's Highway to Hampton Court, so in years past those houses fronting on Twickenham Road, such as Somerset House, [[Kendal House]] and the two Silver Halls would have been favoured with a royal gaze from time to time. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Bus and tram===\nHorse bus operation came to Isleworth in the mid 1800s.\nThe predominant London bus operator from 1856 to 1933 was the [[London General Omnibus Company]], after which the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] was formed.\nOn 19 October 1856 the LGOC took over an existing horse bus operation between Isleworth and [[St Pauls Cathedral]] with the buses painted red. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nElectric trams started running in Isleworth in 1901, from a depot situated on the north side of London Road, near the border with [[Hounslow]]. The original operating company was [[London United Tramways]], which was subsumed into the new [[London Passenger Transport Board]] in 1933. In 1935 the depot was converted to [[Trolleybuses in London|trolleybus]] operation. It was designed in a horseshoe shape with a travelator at the far end, which had a turntable added for the trolleybuses. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Originally known as Hounslow Depot, it was renamed Isleworth and given the code \"IH\" in 1950. It had a capacity for 37 vehicles and only ever operated one service: the 57 tram route which, on conversion, became the 657 trolleybus route. Both the 57 and 657 operated between [[Hounslow]] and [[Shepherd's Bush]] Green via Isleworth, [[Brentford]], [[Chiswick]], and Goldhawk Road. From 1902 the Hounslow terminus of the 57 tram was the \"Hussar\" in Staines Road, Hounslow Heath. In July 1922 the service was cut back to terminate at the \"Bell\" at the western end of Hounslow High Street. A special turning place half a mile along Staines Road, at its junction with Wellington Road, was built for the 657 trolleybus. At different times there were ambitious plans to extend the tram lines westward to [[Staines-upon-Thames]] and even to [[Maidenhead]], but these never came about and the modern replacement motor bus route 237 traverses exactly the same roads between Hounslow Heath and Shepherd's Bush as the trams did over 110 years ago (with a short extension to White City). {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhen the 657 figured in the final London trolleybus conversion of all, on 8 May 1962, Isleworth Depot was closed and its staff were transferred to nearby [[Hounslow]] Bus Garage (coded \"AV\"). The replacement motor bus service was provided by an extension of [[London Buses route 117|route 117]], which up to then had run between Egham and Hounslow. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 1978 the 117 between Hounslow and Shepherd's Bush was superseded by an eastward extension to [[London Buses route 237|route 237]]. Until this time the 237 had operated between [[Chertsey]] and Hounslow with single deck buses \u2013 a truly suburban route. As part of the [[privatisation of London bus services]], Hounslow Garage passed to [[London United Busways|London United]] that later was purchased by [[Transdev (historic)|Transdev]] and later over by the [[RATP Group]].\n\nAnother trolleybus service serving Isleworth was the 667, formerly the 67 tram, which passed through en route from [[Hampton Court]] to [[Hammersmith]] via [[Hampton Hill]], [[Fulwell, London|Fulwell]], [[Twickenham]], Busch Corner, Brentford and Chiswick. Upon its transfer to motor bus operation, as part of the final London trolleybus conversions, the route had its number changed from 667 to [[London Buses route 267|267]]. Tram 67, trolleybus 667 and motor bus 267 were all operated from [[Fulwell bus garage]]. The history of the ownership of Fulwell (coded \"FW\") is exactly as for Hounslow Garage above.\n\nOn Summer Bank Holidays a special service was operated between Shepherd's Bush and Hampton Court. In tram days this was route 65, but trolleybuses showed number 667 towards Hampton Court and 657 on the return journey. This service did not survive the trolleybuses' withdrawal.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nA long-established motor bus route serving Isleworth (and Hounslow) was the number 37. This was one of the earliest motor bus routes introduced by the [[London General Omnibus Company]] and it originally ran from Isleworth to [[Peckham]] via [[St Margarets, London|St Margarets]], [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], [[Putney]], [[Wandsworth]], [[Clapham Junction]], [[Clapham Common]], [[Brixton]], [[Herne Hill]] and [[East Dulwich]]. It was later extended westward to Hounslow (going round the back streets to avoid the low railway bridge in St John's Road and to serve [[Isleworth railway station]]) and for a brief time in the 1920s offered a summer Sunday service extension as far as Maidenhead. Even without that short-lived extension the 37 was one of London's longest routes. Between 1922 and 1938 its western terminus was the \"Hussar\" at Hounslow Heath but was then cut back to turn at Hounslow Bus Garage (later Bus Station). At the beginning the terminus in Isleworth was the forecourt of the Northumberland Arms public house and the destination boards displayed \"ISLEWORTH Market Place\". Later, for \"short\" journeys, this was changed to stands in Magdala Road and then in South Street, outside the Public Hall. In 1991 this historic route was curtailed to run between Peckham and Putney, and the section between Richmond and Hounslow via Isleworth became a new, more localised service numbered H37.\n\n===Rail===\nIsleworth has only one rail service. It consists of a loop branch line running off the minor main line service operated by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]] between central London and Reading. On the down-service the loop begins at the Barnes junction, then travels through Chiswick and Brentford before entering Isleworth by crossing the River Brent just south of the A4 trunk road. Thereafter it serves the two stations of Syon Lane and Isleworth before leaving the town just north of the Woodlands estate and passing under Bridge Road. The service usually runs at fifteen-minute intervals. Following its next stop at Hounslow the loop re-enters the main line on the up-service shortly before the Whitton station.\n\n'''Nearest National Rail stations'''\n* [[Isleworth railway station|Isleworth]]\n* [[Syon Lane railway station|Syon Lane]]\n\n'''Nearest London Underground stations'''\n* [[Osterley station|Osterley]] ''Piccadilly Line''\n* [[Hounslow East station|Hounslow East]] ''Piccadilly Line''\n* [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]] ''District Line''\n\n===River passenger services (history)===\n[[File:pleasureboatisleworth1952.gif|thumb|right|Typical pleasure boat of the mid-20th century seen from Isleworth Promenade in 1952]]\n1840 ''George J Aungier:''\n\"There is a ferry, called Church Ferry, for foot passengers, from the church over the river to West Sheen, Kew, &c. and another at the southern extremity of the village, called Rails-head Ferry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3VsJAAAAIAAJ&dq=Aungier&printsec=frontcover#PPA133,M1|title=The History and Antiquities of Syon Monastery: The Parish of Isleworth, and the Chapelry of Hounslow|first=George James|last=Aungier|date=3 April 2018|publisher=J.B.

It became known as 'Spring Grove House'. Although he also had a home in central London he spent much time and effort on his Isleworth property. He steadily created a renowned botanical masterpiece on the estate, achieved primarily with many of the great variety of foreign plants he had collected on his great travels around the world, particularly with Captain Cook to Australia and the South Seas. Banks died in 1820, and over the next thirty years the house was considerably modified and enlarged by a new owner, Henry Pownall, who then sold the estate in 1850 for partial redevelopment.\nThe images on the right show the house as it looked in 1810, and then in 1850.\n\n[[File:VanGogh 1887 Selbstbildnis.jpg|right|thumb|Vincent van Gogh, painted by himself ten years after residing in Isleworth]]\n[[File:Turner selfportrait.jpg|left|thumb|William Turner]]\n\n*In 1804, [[JMW Turner|William Turner]] lived for a short time in Sion Ferry House in Isleworth, where he drew inspiration from the picturesque banks of the River Thames.

Its rural, waterside beauty had become well recognised over two hundred years or so, and a few palaces, monasteries and mansions already existed. Then the royal court began to appear at Kew, so the adjacent districts on both sides of the Thames became very fashionable places for the rich and famous to build their grand homes.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204.

By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were laid around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, so ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul.

Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage anti-aircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. In late August the weather improved, allowing the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded causing superficial damage. Six planes were shot down in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|p=28}} Goodwood IV followed on the 29th, with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable''. Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s gunners shot down one [[Fairey Firefly|Firefly]] and a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]]. The battleship expended 54&nbsp;rounds from her main guns, 161 from the 15&nbsp;cm guns and up to 20&nbsp;percent of her light anti-aircraft ammunition.{{sfn|Brown, ''Tirpitz''|p=39}}\n\n==== Operations Paravane and Obviate ====\n[[File:Tirpitz at Tromso fjord in November 1944.JPG|thumb|''Tirpitz'' at her mooring off the island of H\u00e5k\u00f8ya in November 1944|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing a body of water with a large warship near the shore]]\n\n{{main|Operation Paravane|Operation Obviate}}\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the great majority of the strikes launched by the [[Fleet Air Arm]] in mid-1944 led to the task of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s destruction being transferred to the RAF's [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&nbsp;5 Group]]. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sandbank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees, and the captain issued the order to abandon ship. The list increased to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50; this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss. Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released after a month, demoted, and reassigned to an [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter squadron in Germany.{{sfn|Morgan & Weal|p=60}} Ehrler was exonerated by further investigations which concluded poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe had caused the fiasco;{{sfn|Schuck|p=177}} the aircrews had not been informed that ''Tirpitz'' had been moved off H\u00e5k\u00f8ya two weeks before the attack.{{sfn|Hafsten|p=221}}\n\nThe wreck of ''Tirpitz'' remained in place until after the war, when a joint German-Norwegian company began salvage operations. Work lasted from 1948 until 1957;{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} fragments of the ship were sold by a Norwegian company.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} [[Ludovic Kennedy]] wrote in his history of the vessel that she \"lived an invalid's life and died a cripple's death\".{{sfn|Van der Vat|p=508}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last=Bishop\n  | first=Patrick\n  | title=Target Tirpitz\n  | publisher=HarperPress\n  | year=2012\n  | isbn=978-0-00-731924-4\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Bishop}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Blair\n  | first = Clay\n  | authorlink = Clay Blair\n  | year = 1996\n  | title = Hitler's U-Boat War\n  | volume = 1 The hunters, 1939\u20131942\n  | publisher = Random House\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-304-35260-9\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Blair}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Breyer\n  | first = Siegfried\n  | year = 1989\n  | title = Battleship \"Tirpitz\"\n  | publisher = Schiffer Pub\n  | location = West Chester\n  | isbn = 978-0-88740-184-8\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Breyer}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Brown\n  | first = David\n  | year = 1977\n  | title = Tirpitz: the floating fortress\n  | publisher = Naval Institute Press\n  | location = Annapolis\n  | isbn = 978-0-85368-341-4\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Brown, ''Tirpitz''}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Brown\n  | first = J.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

While the ship was in Kiel, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the breakout of the Soviet fleet based in [[Leningrad]]. ''Tirpitz'' was briefly made the [[flagship]] of the squadron, which consisted of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, the [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}, several destroyers, and two flotillas of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=247}} The Baltic Fleet, under the command of [[Vizeadmiral|Vice Admiral]] [[Otto Ciliax]],{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=239}} patrolled off the [[Aaland Islands]] from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and ''Tirpitz'' resumed training.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=247\u2013248}} During the training period, ''Tirpitz'' tested her primary and secondary guns on the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Hessen||2}},{{sfn|Sweetman|p=11}} which had been converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=20}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on ''Tirpitz'' while she was stationed in Kiel.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}}\n\n=== Deployment to Norway ===\n[[File:Tirpitz camouflaged.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' camouflaged in the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]]]]\nGrand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Kriegsmarine'', proposed on 13 November that ''Tirpitz'' be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's anti-aircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} The ship's commander, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] (KzS\u2013Captain at Sea)'' [[Karl Topp]],{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}} The following day, ''Tirpitz'' left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nThe ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23:00 on 14 January and made for [[Trondheim]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} British military intelligence, which was capable of decrypting the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages sent by the German navy, detected the departure of the vessel, but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=16}} Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]], the commander in chief of the British [[Home Fleet]], was not made aware of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s activities until 17 January, well after the ship had arrived in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=17}} On 16 January, British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim. ''Tirpitz'' then moved to the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]], just north of Trondheim.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The movement was codenamed Operation ''Polarnacht'' (Polar Night); the battleship was escorted by the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z4 Richard Beitzen||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z5 Paul Jakobi||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z8 Bruno Heinemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z29||2}} for the voyage.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] transmitted the location to London.{{sfn|Ottosen|pp=39\u201341}} She was moored next to a cliff, which protected the ship from air attacks from the southwest.

Frequent fuel shortages curtailed training and kept the battleship and her escorts moored behind their protective netting. The crew was primarily occupied with maintaining the ship and continuously manning anti-aircraft defences. Sports activities were organised to keep the crew occupied and physically fit.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=207}}\n\n=== Operations against Allied convoys ===\nSeveral factors hindered ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s freedom of operation in Norway. The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support [[Operation Cerberus]], the movement of the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} through the [[English Channel]]. These caused a planned attack against the outbound [[convoy PQ 8]] at the end of January to be abandoned.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=23\u201324}} In early February, ''Tirpitz'' took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation ''Cerberus''. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=24\u201325}} Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers ''Admiral Scheer'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' and several destroyers. ''Prinz Eugen'' had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the F\u00e6ttenfjord, and was temporarily out of action.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under way, probably in 1941]]\nIn March 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and ''Admiral Scheer'', along with the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z14 Friedrich Ihn||2}}, ''Z5 Paul Jakobi'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z7 Hermann Schoemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z25||2}} and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s,{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound [[Convoy PQ 12]] as part of [[Operation Sportpalast|''Unternehmen Sportpalast'']] (Operation Sports Palace).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}}{{sfn|Sweetman|p=27}} ''Admiral Scheer'',{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} with a design speed of {{convert|26|kn}},{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=60}} was too slow to operate with ''Tirpitz'' and was left in port,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} as was the destroyer ''Paul Jakobi''. The two torpedo boats were also released from the operation.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} On 5&nbsp;March, [[Luftwaffe]] reconnaissance aircraft spotted PQ&nbsp;12 near [[Jan Mayen Island]]; the reconnaissance failed to note the battleship {{HMS|Duke of York|17|6}} or the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, both of which were escorting the convoy, along with four destroyers. Unknown to the Germans, Admiral Tovey was providing distant support to the convoys with the battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}}, and six destroyers. Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s attack, which allowed them to reroute the convoys. Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue ''Tirpitz'' on 9&nbsp;March,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and ''Tirpitz'' successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=250\u2013251}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=149}} After the conclusion of the attack, ''Tirpitz'' made for [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjord]], and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} On 30 March, thirty-three [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax bombers]] attacked the ship; they scored no hits, and five aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=156}} The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April. On the night of 27\u201328 April, thirty-one Halifaxes and twelve [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]] attacked; five of the bombers were shot down. Another raid, composed of twenty-three Halifaxes and eleven Lancasters, took place the following night. Two of the bombers were shot down by the German anti-aircraft defences.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=162}}\n\nThe actions of ''Tirpitz'' and her escorting destroyers in March used up {{convert|8230|t|LT}} of [[fuel oil]], which greatly reduced the available fuel supply. It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated out of [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port. Shortly after ''Tirpitz'' left Norway, the Soviet submarine [[Soviet submarine K-21|''K-21'']] fired two or four torpedoes at the ship, all of which missed.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}{{sfn|Polmar & Noot|pp=115\u2013116}} The Soviets claimed two hits on the battleship.{{sfn|Blair|p=644}} Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British [[Admiralty]], which ordered the convoy to disperse. Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to [[U-boat]]s and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports. ''Tirpitz'' returned to [[Altafjord]] via the [[Lofoten Islands]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'', escorted by several destroyers, steaming in the [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] in October 1942]]\nFollowing ''R\u00f6sselsprung'', the Germans moved ''Tirpitz'' to [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] near Narvik. By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were laid around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, so ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused them to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4&nbsp;January 1943 in [[Trondheim Fjord]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 21 February, Topp was promoted to [[Rear Admiral]] and was replaced by Captain [[Hans Karl Meyer|Hans Meyer]]; five days later the battleship ''Scharnhorst'' was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]] was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nBy the time ''Scharnhorst'' arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had temporarily ceased. To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] on 31 December 1942, ordered [[Operation Zitronella|an attack]] on [[Spitzbergen]], which housed a British weather station and refuelling base.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Spitzbergen was defended by a garrison of 152 men from the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]].{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}} The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6&nbsp;September; in a [[Ruse of war|''ruse de guerre'']], ''Tirpitz'' flew the [[white ensign]] on the approach to the island the following day.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=76}} During the bombardment, ''Tirpitz'' fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=77}} This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}}{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=76\u201377}} By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}}\n\n=== British attacks on ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' in the [[Ofotfjord]]/[[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]]]]\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\n\n==== Operation Source ====\n{{main|Operation Source}}\n\nThe British were determined to neutralise ''Tirpitz'' and remove the threat she posed to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied arctic convoys]]. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines. ''X5'' was detected {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nThe mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated {{convert|45|to|55|m|abbr=on}} off the port bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=259}} A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship, and bulkheads in the [[double bottom]] buckled. Some {{convert|1430|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a [[List (watercraft)|list]] of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship {{ship|German repair ship|Neumark||2}}; historians [[William Garzke]] and [[Robert Dulin]] remarked that the successful repair effort was \"one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=262}} Repairs lasted until 2&nbsp;April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}}\n\n==== Operation Tungsten ====\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' under attack by British carrier aircraft on 3 April 1944]]\n{{main|Operation Tungsten}}\n\nThe British were aware that ''Neumark'' and the repair crews left in March, which intimated ''Tirpitz'' was nearly operational.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} A major air strike\u2014[[Operation Tungsten]]\u2014involving the fleet carriers ''Victorious'' and {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Emperor|D98|2}}, {{HMS|Fencer|D64|2}}, {{HMS|Pursuer|D73|2}}, and {{HMS|Searcher|D40|2}},{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} was set for 4&nbsp;April 1944, but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that ''Tirpitz'' was to depart at 05:29 on 3&nbsp;April for sea trials.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} The attack consisted of 40 [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] dive-bombers carrying {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves, scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|pp=25, 27}} The aircraft achieved surprise, and only one was lost in the first wave; it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft batteries to be fully manned. The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German anti-aircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. [[William Garzke]] and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}} while Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, ''KzS'' Hans Meyer.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=243}} Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage anti-aircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. In late August the weather improved, allowing the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded causing superficial damage. Six planes were shot down in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|p=28}} Goodwood IV followed on the 29th, with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable''. Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s gunners shot down one [[Fairey Firefly|Firefly]] and a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]]. The battleship expended 54&nbsp;rounds from her main guns, 161 from the 15&nbsp;cm guns and up to 20&nbsp;percent of her light anti-aircraft ammunition.{{sfn|Brown, ''Tirpitz''|p=39}}\n\n==== Operations Paravane and Obviate ====\n[[File:Tirpitz at Tromso fjord in November 1944.JPG|thumb|''Tirpitz'' at her mooring off the island of H\u00e5k\u00f8ya in November 1944|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing a body of water with a large warship near the shore]]\n\n{{main|Operation Paravane|Operation Obviate}}\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the great majority of the strikes launched by the [[Fleet Air Arm]] in mid-1944 led to the task of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s destruction being transferred to the RAF's [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&nbsp;5 Group]]. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sandbank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees, and the captain issued the order to abandon ship. The list increased to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50; this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss. Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released after a month, demoted, and reassigned to an [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter squadron in Germany.{{sfn|Morgan & Weal|p=60}} Ehrler was exonerated by further investigations which concluded poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe had caused the fiasco;{{sfn|Schuck|p=177}} the aircrews had not been informed that ''Tirpitz'' had been moved off H\u00e5k\u00f8ya two weeks before the attack.{{sfn|Hafsten|p=221}}\n\nThe wreck of ''Tirpitz'' remained in place until after the war, when a joint German-Norwegian company began salvage operations.

When the life of a specific person is in danger, almost any ''[[Mitzvah#Mitzvot and Jewish law|mitzvah lo ta'aseh]]'' (command to not do an action) of the [[Torah]] becomes inapplicable.<ref>George Robinson ''Essential Judaism: a complete guide to beliefs, customs and rituals'' 2001 p100\n\"For example, as noted in Chapter 2, the principle of pikuakh nefesh, of saving a life, takes precedence over virtually all other mitzvot.... Rather than commit any of these three offenses, a Jew is expected to give up his or her life.\"</ref>\n\n==Biblical source==\nThe [[Torah]], in [[Leviticus]] 18:5, states \"You shall therefore keep my statutes and my rules; if a person does them, he shall live by them: I am the {{LORD}}.\"<ref>Leviticus 18:5 Hebrew  \"\u05d0\u05b2\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05e8 \u05d9\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05b6\u05c2\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b9\u05ea\u05b8\u05dd \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd \u05d5\u05b8\u05d7\u05b7\u05d9 \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05b6\u05dd\"</ref>  [[Ezekiel]] 20:11 also states this phrase, \"And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.\" The implication here is that Jews should live by Torah law rather than die because of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.85b.3?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en|title=Yoma85b|website=www.sefaria.org|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n==Talmudic discussion==\nThe [[Talmud]] discusses a number of cases as examples in which biblically mandated laws can be disregarded for the sake of saving a human life. ([[Talmud#Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud)|B]].[[Yoma]] 84b) All of these examples relate to [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] prohibitions: rescuing a child from the sea, [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat#Demolition|breaking apart a wall]] that has collapsed on a child, breaking down a door about to close on an infant, and [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat#Extinguishing a fire|extinguishing a fire]] to save a life.\n\nThe ''[[Mishna]]'' there discusses when one is permitted to break his or her [[fasting|fast]] on [[Yom Kippur|the Day of Atonement]]: \"If one is seized by a ravenous hunger (ostensibly referring to something life threatening{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}), he may be given to eat even [[Unclean animals|unclean things]] until his eyes are lightened.\" (B.[[Yoma]] 83a)\n\n==Drawing the line==\nThe principle of preservation of life, pikuach nefesh, has limitations. The individual whose life is to be saved must be a specific, identifiable individual, rather than an abstract or potential beneficiary.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Another question is what constitutes a life-threatening situation. Some situations are clearly life-threatening, such as one who is dying of a disease and will die without medical intervention, or one who is drowning and will not be able to escape the water without help from another. In other situations, it may be unclear if a life is truly in danger. For example, if a person is feeling \"extreme pain,\" this may be tremendously uncomfortable, but it is unclear whether it may lead to death. It is always considered preferable to err on the side of caution (e.g. \"violating\" Jewish laws), even if this retroactively turns out to be unnecessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1113745/jewish/Saving-Lives-on-Shabbat.htm|title=Saving Lives on Shabbat|website=www.chabad.org|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref> If one is in danger of losing a limb, mobility, eyesight, suffering the loss of some other function vital to one's future survival, or may be in danger of a new health problem developing that may ultimately shorten one's life, the situation is considered to be life-threatening.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Uncertainty===\nIf it cannot be ascertained whether or not a situation is life-threatening, the situation must be considered life-threatening until proven otherwise, thereby allowing action to be taken. It is of prime importance that if one believes a life may be in danger, and seconds may count, that persons involved not delay helping the victim out of fear of violating halakha, or in order to determine if such a violation is permissible according to halakha. If one takes action in violation of halakha to save a life when they believe the situation is life-threatening, but later learns that there was no threat to a human life, they have not sinned, and must not feel guilty over having made such a mistake.<ref>Barry L.

But when seconds count, there must be no delay in determining who is more qualified.<ref>Fred Rosner, J. David Bleich, Menachem M.

But if there is a choice between two Jews, and there is clearly plenty of time to decide, it is preferable that the more observant of the Jews break the halakha.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} This shows the importance of breaking halakha when a life is on the line, and that less observant Jews are not permitted to serve the purpose of breaking halakha where it is possible for more observant Jews to do so.\n\n==Examples of pikuach nefesh that override other religious considerations==\n\n===Organ donation===\nAccording to some halakhic rulers, [[organ donation in Jewish law]] is one classic example of the obligation to violate a commandment because of pikuach nefesh.  Saving a life can override the prohibition against desecrating a corpse. However, due to the limitation that a specific life must be in danger, a specific organ recipient must generally be identified before the organ is removed. Organ removal to organ banks for possible future use is generally prohibited by all Orthodox Judaism [[posek|halakhic decisors]].<ref>[http://www.hods.org/English/h-issues/articlesE.asp HODS - Halachic Organ Donor Society<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Goldie Milgram  ''Living Jewish Life Cycle: How to Create Meaningful Jewish Rites of ...'' 2009  p209  \"In our time, not to bequeath your organs has become a transgression of the mitzvah of pikuah nefesh, \u201csaving a life,\u201d a primary Jewish value.

The earliest known example of this took place in 167 BCE, when [[Mattathias]] and the [[Hasmoneans]] declared that it was permitted for their followers to fight on the Sabbath day to defend themselves from attack. One is allowed to travel in order to save another's life, and medical care may be provided to critically ill patients (see [[Driving on Shabbat in Jewish law|Driving on Shabbat]]). According to [[Moshe Feinstein]], it is permissible to travel to accompany a woman in labor to a hospital because the Talmud is especially solicitous of health with respect to pregnancy and childbirth.<ref name=\"Neuwirth\">Rabbi [[Yehoshua Neuwirth]]. ''[[Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah]]''. Jerusalem: Mekhon Nishmat Aharon ve-Ya'akov, 1993.</ref> Shabbat laws can also be bent for a woman who has given birth in the last three days to make sure that she is comfortable and healthy.<ref name=\"Neuwirth\" />\n\nOne is allowed to drive a woman to a hospital on Shabbat to give birth, since birth can be life-threatening without medical supervision. Similarly, one may [[39 categories of activity#Writing|sign]] a consent form for surgery on Shabbat if the surgery will otherwise be delayed.<ref name=\"Neuwirth\" />\n\nIf one's close relative is transported to the hospital under emergency circumstances during Shabbat, one is allowed to drive or accept a ride to the hospital in order to provide company to their relative at the hospital, since this may be life-saving. One may also be needed at the hospital to sign potentially life-saving consent forms.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n====Telephone====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIf a medical emergency is known or suspected that warrants placing a phone call rather than transportation in a motor vehicle, the telephone may be used. If the situation has a lower level of urgency, the receiver shall be removed and the buttons pressed [[shinuy|in an unusual manner]] (by using the elbow or the knuckles, or a pencil). If the person involved is expecting a call to be returned to deal with the issue, answering the phone is permitted, and if another uninvolved person has placed the call, the person involved shall state, for example, that they are waiting for a call from the doctor.\n\n====Work====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\n[[Image:Sabbath elevator.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Shabbat elevators]]\nIt is permissible for one whose profession it is to save lives (such as a [[physician]], [[nurse]], or [[emergency medical technician]]) to work on Shabbat in order to save lives. It is permissible even for such a professional to use a telephone or pager to be alerted to their need for a life-saving act or to communicate life saving information, or to travel by any means necessary to the location where the potentially life-saving act will be performed.  Some hospitals, such as [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], have a designated [[Shabbat elevator]] for staff and visitors to use on those days; the elevators automatically stops on every floor, so that the observant persons do not have to push a floor button, which would be work.\n\nOne is not allowed to work on Shabbat due to economic hardships, no matter how severe their circumstances are.\n\n====Fire====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nExtinguishing a fire on Shabbat or Yom Tov is forbidden under Jewish law. Extinguishing a fire or using the phone to call the fire department only in order to save one's property from damage is forbidden. However, it is still permissible to do so in most cases due to the danger caused to others unknown to the person who discovers the fire. Even if all people can escape a building, as long as the fire burns, there is a danger it can spread to other nearby buildings, thereby endangering the lives of others in them. Even in a rural area, where there are no other buildings nearby, there is the danger the fire can spread to a nearby forest, starting a more devastating [[forest fire]], which may endanger others. Only if it can clearly be established that no such risks are present is it forbidden to break Shabbat.\n\n===Eating===\n\n====Non-kosher food====\nNon-kosher food may be eaten under the following circumstances:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n*If no kosher food is available to the person, and failure to eat the non-kosher food may result in starvation.\n*If a non-kosher food product specifically is needed to cure an illness.\n\nIf necessary for recovery, a patient may eat non-[[kosher foods]]. In the [[Talmud#Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud)|Babylonian Talmud]], Chapter 82a of Tractate [[Yoma]] mentions [[food craving|pregnancy craving]]s for non-kosher food (the passage discusses a pregnant woman who craves pork on [[Yom Kippur]]) as the paradigmatic example of a presumed life-threatening situation where a person is allowed to eat non-kosher food (and is permitted to eat it on Yom Kippur).\n\n====Fasting====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nOn Yom Kippur, the fast preferably may only be broken if one is advised by a physician not to fast, and then consults a rabbi regarding the physician's advice. The general practice is to eat only as much as is necessary in order to satisfy one's needs. If one is advised by a physician not to fast, but is unable to consult a rabbi, one should eat in accordance with the physician's advice.\n\nIf one senses they may have a health problem that may be aggravated by fasting, but no physicians or rabbis are available to give advice, they should use their own judgment, and is permitted to refrain from fasting. In such cases, one must not delay eating in order to speak with the appropriate authority, or feel guilty for eating in this situation.\n\nOne who must eat on Yom Kippur is required to eat only as much as is necessary to avoid aggravating a medical condition. Fasting, as much as possible, takes priority over prayer (and thus more should not be eaten merely to enable one to attend synagogue or pray with more concentration). All blessings normally recited before and after eating are recited as usual.\n\nFasts other than Yom Kippur are viewed more leniently. Anyone who feels unable to fast is permitted to break the fast without consulting a physician or rabbi.\n\nOn all fasts, one who is taking a medication for any reason is permitted to use food or water as necessary to aid in taking the medication. If the medication has instructions to consume food or beverage with the medication, one is not permitted to fast, and they need not further consult a physician or rabbi.\n\nA person who becomes severely dehydrated during any fast shall consume sufficient fluids to restore their body to normal hydration levels.\n\n====Waiting for the proper time to eat====\nRabbinical law prohibits eating at certain times even on non-fast days, such as prior to daily morning prayer, prior to the recitation of [[kiddush]] on Shabbat or Yom Tov, and between the ending of Shabbat and [[Havdallah]]. In particular, these laws are to strictly be followed by adult males and should be followed by adult females who are not pregnant or nursing. While it is optimal to wait out these shorter periods of time rather than eating, even for one whose medical condition demands frequent eating, there are exceptions:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n*A pregnant woman or a woman who is nursing a baby who has a craving shall eat without delay. For all other women and for boys yet to have reached bar mitzvah age, these laws are treated more leniently.\n*One who must take a medicine at a specific time may consume any food or drink necessary in order to consume the medicine or that must be eaten with the medicine.\n*A person who is severely dehydrated may consume fluids as necessary to restore their body to normal hydration levels.\n*A person who lacks the strength to perform the necessary service without nourishment may eat the minimum amount necessary to perform the service with [[kavanah]].\n\n==Exceptions==\nThere are some Jewish laws that may not be violated, even when a life is in danger. In these cases, a life must be sacrificed rather than a halakha be broken. These include:\n\n===Defaming God's name===\nSins that involve [[Chillul Hashem]] (the defamation of God's name) may not be committed even to save one's life. These include [[idolatry]], [[blasphemy]], or denial of God's existence. Forbidden violations include:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n*Worship of any god other than [[Names of God in Judaism#HaShem|Hashem]]\n*Bowing to any god other than Hashem for show just to please the enemy, or other signs of pretending to worship such a god, even if one's intention is not to worship\n*Violating any negative commandment in submission to a persecuting enemy whose purpose is to stand against God\n*Construction of such a god for oneself or others to worship, or support of such worship\n*Entry into a building where a god other than Hashem is being worshipped. (This specific prohibition is not agreed upon by all rabbis, however.)<ref>https://www.thejc.com/judaism/rabbi-i-have-a-problem/is-it-forbidden-for-jews-to-enter-a-church-1.4626</ref> It is for this reason that one may not enter a church during services, even to save a life. Entering a church when services are not going on has lesser restrictions. \n*Recitation or printing God's name in vain\n*Destruction of God's name from a printed sheet of paper or [[parchment]] except in the performance of rituals prescribed in the Torah\n*Pretending God does not exist in order to avoid persecution\n\n=== Forbidden sexual relations ===\n\nSexual acts which are considered ''[[Forbidden relationships in Judaism]]'' may not be done, even if necessary to save a life. These acts include:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n* [[Incest]]\n* A man having sex with another man's wife\n* [[Zoophilia]]\n\n===Murder===\nAny act that intentionally causes the death of another person (considered to be an act of murder), that injures a person so the potential for death from the injuries is high, or that otherwise creates a dangerous situation that will very likely put one or more lives at risk, is not permitted for the preservation of life. Forbidden examples are:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n* Harvesting organs from the body of a person who is clearly alive\n* Live organ donation, where the risk of death to the donor is extremely high. If the risk is low, the donation is permitted.\n* Driving at a very high speed in order to reach a hospital if a crash with an innocent motorist is almost assured\n\n====Exceptions====\nAn exception in which killing another person is permitted is the case of a ''[[rodef]]'' (aggressor), who may be killed in order to save the life of oneself or another. This permits wartime killings and killings in self-defense or to save another from an aggressor in Judaism. Also, [[abortion]] is permitted in Jewish law if the unborn fetus is endangering the mother's life, because the fetus is considered to be a ''rodef.'' The \"rodef\" assertion is also used to permit the separation of [[conjoined twins]] when it is likely or even certain that one will die as a result of the operation if this is necessary to save the other.\n\n====Life for a life====\nWhile one is not permitted to automatically give up one's life in order to save the life of another (an act of [[suicide]], [[Jewish views on suicide|forbidden in Jewish law]]), one may ''risk'' their own life to save the life of another. It is, however, forbidden to place one's own life at more risk than the other person is already in.\n\nOne may not put another's life in danger, especially against that person's will, in order to save their own life or that of another.\n\nScholars have long questioned whether or not stealing is permitted in order to save a life. Most have concluded that stealing sustenance from a poor person is prohibited under life-threatening circumstances, since the life of a poor person who loses even a small portion of their sustenance is considered to be endangered. Also, operating a business or similar operation that intentionally robs or defrauds the poor of all or any part of their sustenance is strictly forbidden, even to save a life. Robbing or defrauding a large business, organization, or the government is forbidden if the poor will suffer as a result of the business, organization, or government losing these funds. If a business suffers the loss of money due to fraud or theft, it may pass the losses onto customers by raising its prices, and as a result, the poor may have to spend more. The government, if cheated, may raise taxes, even to the poor, or cut services from which the poor benefit.\n\nThe commandment to save life may also have reference to [[ethical arguments regarding torture]].<ref>CHAPTER 10 ''Torture and Torah: Defense of Dignity and Life in Jewish Law'' Melissa Weintraub p123  in ed. George Hunsinger ''Torture is a moral issue: Christians, Jews, Muslims, and people of ...

([[Talmud#Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud)|B]].[[Yoma]] 84b) All of these examples relate to [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] prohibitions: rescuing a child from the sea, [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat#Demolition|breaking apart a wall]] that has collapsed on a child, breaking down a door about to close on an infant, and [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat#Extinguishing a fire|extinguishing a fire]] to save a life.\n\nThe ''[[Mishna]]'' there discusses when one is permitted to break his or her [[fasting|fast]] on [[Yom Kippur|the Day of Atonement]]: \"If one is seized by a ravenous hunger (ostensibly referring to something life threatening{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}), he may be given to eat even [[Unclean animals|unclean things]] until his eyes are lightened.\" (B.[[Yoma]] 83a)\n\n==Drawing the line==\nThe principle of preservation of life, pikuach nefesh, has limitations. The individual whose life is to be saved must be a specific, identifiable individual, rather than an abstract or potential beneficiary.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Another question is what constitutes a life-threatening situation. Some situations are clearly life-threatening, such as one who is dying of a disease and will die without medical intervention, or one who is drowning and will not be able to escape the water without help from another. In other situations, it may be unclear if a life is truly in danger. For example, if a person is feeling \"extreme pain,\" this may be tremendously uncomfortable, but it is unclear whether it may lead to death. It is always considered preferable to err on the side of caution (e.g. \"violating\" Jewish laws), even if this retroactively turns out to be unnecessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1113745/jewish/Saving-Lives-on-Shabbat.htm|title=Saving Lives on Shabbat|website=www.chabad.org|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref> If one is in danger of losing a limb, mobility, eyesight, suffering the loss of some other function vital to one's future survival, or may be in danger of a new health problem developing that may ultimately shorten one's life, the situation is considered to be life-threatening.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Uncertainty===\nIf it cannot be ascertained whether or not a situation is life-threatening, the situation must be considered life-threatening until proven otherwise, thereby allowing action to be taken. It is of prime importance that if one believes a life may be in danger, and seconds may count, that persons involved not delay helping the victim out of fear of violating halakha, or in order to determine if such a violation is permissible according to halakha. If one takes action in violation of halakha to save a life when they believe the situation is life-threatening, but later learns that there was no threat to a human life, they have not sinned, and must not feel guilty over having made such a mistake.<ref>Barry L.

But if there is a choice between two Jews, and there is clearly plenty of time to decide, it is preferable that the more observant of the Jews break the halakha.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} This shows the importance of breaking halakha when a life is on the line, and that less observant Jews are not permitted to serve the purpose of breaking halakha where it is possible for more observant Jews to do so.\n\n==Examples of pikuach nefesh that override other religious considerations==\n\n===Organ donation===\nAccording to some halakhic rulers, [[organ donation in Jewish law]] is one classic example of the obligation to violate a commandment because of pikuach nefesh.  Saving a life can override the prohibition against desecrating a corpse. However, due to the limitation that a specific life must be in danger, a specific organ recipient must generally be identified before the organ is removed. Organ removal to organ banks for possible future use is generally prohibited by all Orthodox Judaism [[posek|halakhic decisors]].<ref>[http://www.hods.org/English/h-issues/articlesE.asp HODS - Halachic Organ Donor Society<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Goldie Milgram  ''Living Jewish Life Cycle: How to Create Meaningful Jewish Rites of ...'' 2009  p209  \"In our time, not to bequeath your organs has become a transgression of the mitzvah of pikuah nefesh, \u201csaving a life,\u201d a primary Jewish value.

The earliest known example of this took place in 167 BCE, when [[Mattathias]] and the [[Hasmoneans]] declared that it was permitted for their followers to fight on the Sabbath day to defend themselves from attack. One is allowed to travel in order to save another's life, and medical care may be provided to critically ill patients (see [[Driving on Shabbat in Jewish law|Driving on Shabbat]]). According to [[Moshe Feinstein]], it is permissible to travel to accompany a woman in labor to a hospital because the Talmud is especially solicitous of health with respect to pregnancy and childbirth.<ref name=\"Neuwirth\">Rabbi [[Yehoshua Neuwirth]]. ''[[Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah]]''. Jerusalem: Mekhon Nishmat Aharon ve-Ya'akov, 1993.</ref> Shabbat laws can also be bent for a woman who has given birth in the last three days to make sure that she is comfortable and healthy.<ref name=\"Neuwirth\" />\n\nOne is allowed to drive a woman to a hospital on Shabbat to give birth, since birth can be life-threatening without medical supervision. Similarly, one may [[39 categories of activity#Writing|sign]] a consent form for surgery on Shabbat if the surgery will otherwise be delayed.<ref name=\"Neuwirth\" />\n\nIf one's close relative is transported to the hospital under emergency circumstances during Shabbat, one is allowed to drive or accept a ride to the hospital in order to provide company to their relative at the hospital, since this may be life-saving. One may also be needed at the hospital to sign potentially life-saving consent forms.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n====Telephone====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIf a medical emergency is known or suspected that warrants placing a phone call rather than transportation in a motor vehicle, the telephone may be used. If the situation has a lower level of urgency, the receiver shall be removed and the buttons pressed [[shinuy|in an unusual manner]] (by using the elbow or the knuckles, or a pencil). If the person involved is expecting a call to be returned to deal with the issue, answering the phone is permitted, and if another uninvolved person has placed the call, the person involved shall state, for example, that they are waiting for a call from the doctor.\n\n====Work====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\n[[Image:Sabbath elevator.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Shabbat elevators]]\nIt is permissible for one whose profession it is to save lives (such as a [[physician]], [[nurse]], or [[emergency medical technician]]) to work on Shabbat in order to save lives. It is permissible even for such a professional to use a telephone or pager to be alerted to their need for a life-saving act or to communicate life saving information, or to travel by any means necessary to the location where the potentially life-saving act will be performed.  Some hospitals, such as [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], have a designated [[Shabbat elevator]] for staff and visitors to use on those days; the elevators automatically stops on every floor, so that the observant persons do not have to push a floor button, which would be work.\n\nOne is not allowed to work on Shabbat due to economic hardships, no matter how severe their circumstances are.\n\n====Fire====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nExtinguishing a fire on Shabbat or Yom Tov is forbidden under Jewish law. Extinguishing a fire or using the phone to call the fire department only in order to save one's property from damage is forbidden. However, it is still permissible to do so in most cases due to the danger caused to others unknown to the person who discovers the fire. Even if all people can escape a building, as long as the fire burns, there is a danger it can spread to other nearby buildings, thereby endangering the lives of others in them. Even in a rural area, where there are no other buildings nearby, there is the danger the fire can spread to a nearby forest, starting a more devastating [[forest fire]], which may endanger others. Only if it can clearly be established that no such risks are present is it forbidden to break Shabbat.\n\n===Eating===\n\n====Non-kosher food====\nNon-kosher food may be eaten under the following circumstances:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n*If no kosher food is available to the person, and failure to eat the non-kosher food may result in starvation.\n*If a non-kosher food product specifically is needed to cure an illness.\n\nIf necessary for recovery, a patient may eat non-[[kosher foods]]. In the [[Talmud#Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud)|Babylonian Talmud]], Chapter 82a of Tractate [[Yoma]] mentions [[food craving|pregnancy craving]]s for non-kosher food (the passage discusses a pregnant woman who craves pork on [[Yom Kippur]]) as the paradigmatic example of a presumed life-threatening situation where a person is allowed to eat non-kosher food (and is permitted to eat it on Yom Kippur).\n\n====Fasting====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nOn Yom Kippur, the fast preferably may only be broken if one is advised by a physician not to fast, and then consults a rabbi regarding the physician's advice. The general practice is to eat only as much as is necessary in order to satisfy one's needs. If one is advised by a physician not to fast, but is unable to consult a rabbi, one should eat in accordance with the physician's advice.\n\nIf one senses they may have a health problem that may be aggravated by fasting, but no physicians or rabbis are available to give advice, they should use their own judgment, and is permitted to refrain from fasting. In such cases, one must not delay eating in order to speak with the appropriate authority, or feel guilty for eating in this situation.\n\nOne who must eat on Yom Kippur is required to eat only as much as is necessary to avoid aggravating a medical condition. Fasting, as much as possible, takes priority over prayer (and thus more should not be eaten merely to enable one to attend synagogue or pray with more concentration). All blessings normally recited before and after eating are recited as usual.\n\nFasts other than Yom Kippur are viewed more leniently. Anyone who feels unable to fast is permitted to break the fast without consulting a physician or rabbi.\n\nOn all fasts, one who is taking a medication for any reason is permitted to use food or water as necessary to aid in taking the medication. If the medication has instructions to consume food or beverage with the medication, one is not permitted to fast, and they need not further consult a physician or rabbi.\n\nA person who becomes severely dehydrated during any fast shall consume sufficient fluids to restore their body to normal hydration levels.\n\n====Waiting for the proper time to eat====\nRabbinical law prohibits eating at certain times even on non-fast days, such as prior to daily morning prayer, prior to the recitation of [[kiddush]] on Shabbat or Yom Tov, and between the ending of Shabbat and [[Havdallah]]. In particular, these laws are to strictly be followed by adult males and should be followed by adult females who are not pregnant or nursing. While it is optimal to wait out these shorter periods of time rather than eating, even for one whose medical condition demands frequent eating, there are exceptions:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n*A pregnant woman or a woman who is nursing a baby who has a craving shall eat without delay. For all other women and for boys yet to have reached bar mitzvah age, these laws are treated more leniently.\n*One who must take a medicine at a specific time may consume any food or drink necessary in order to consume the medicine or that must be eaten with the medicine.\n*A person who is severely dehydrated may consume fluids as necessary to restore their body to normal hydration levels.\n*A person who lacks the strength to perform the necessary service without nourishment may eat the minimum amount necessary to perform the service with [[kavanah]].\n\n==Exceptions==\nThere are some Jewish laws that may not be violated, even when a life is in danger. In these cases, a life must be sacrificed rather than a halakha be broken. These include:\n\n===Defaming God's name===\nSins that involve [[Chillul Hashem]] (the defamation of God's name) may not be committed even to save one's life. These include [[idolatry]], [[blasphemy]], or denial of God's existence. Forbidden violations include:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n*Worship of any god other than [[Names of God in Judaism#HaShem|Hashem]]\n*Bowing to any god other than Hashem for show just to please the enemy, or other signs of pretending to worship such a god, even if one's intention is not to worship\n*Violating any negative commandment in submission to a persecuting enemy whose purpose is to stand against God\n*Construction of such a god for oneself or others to worship, or support of such worship\n*Entry into a building where a god other than Hashem is being worshipped. (This specific prohibition is not agreed upon by all rabbis, however.)<ref>https://www.thejc.com/judaism/rabbi-i-have-a-problem/is-it-forbidden-for-jews-to-enter-a-church-1.4626</ref> It is for this reason that one may not enter a church during services, even to save a life. Entering a church when services are not going on has lesser restrictions. \n*Recitation or printing God's name in vain\n*Destruction of God's name from a printed sheet of paper or [[parchment]] except in the performance of rituals prescribed in the Torah\n*Pretending God does not exist in order to avoid persecution\n\n=== Forbidden sexual relations ===\n\nSexual acts which are considered ''[[Forbidden relationships in Judaism]]'' may not be done, even if necessary to save a life. These acts include:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n* [[Incest]]\n* A man having sex with another man's wife\n* [[Zoophilia]]\n\n===Murder===\nAny act that intentionally causes the death of another person (considered to be an act of murder), that injures a person so the potential for death from the injuries is high, or that otherwise creates a dangerous situation that will very likely put one or more lives at risk, is not permitted for the preservation of life. Forbidden examples are:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n* Harvesting organs from the body of a person who is clearly alive\n* Live organ donation, where the risk of death to the donor is extremely high. If the risk is low, the donation is permitted.\n* Driving at a very high speed in order to reach a hospital if a crash with an innocent motorist is almost assured\n\n====Exceptions====\nAn exception in which killing another person is permitted is the case of a ''[[rodef]]'' (aggressor), who may be killed in order to save the life of oneself or another. This permits wartime killings and killings in self-defense or to save another from an aggressor in Judaism. Also, [[abortion]] is permitted in Jewish law if the unborn fetus is endangering the mother's life, because the fetus is considered to be a ''rodef.'' The \"rodef\" assertion is also used to permit the separation of [[conjoined twins]] when it is likely or even certain that one will die as a result of the operation if this is necessary to save the other.\n\n====Life for a life====\nWhile one is not permitted to automatically give up one's life in order to save the life of another (an act of [[suicide]], [[Jewish views on suicide|forbidden in Jewish law]]), one may ''risk'' their own life to save the life of another. It is, however, forbidden to place one's own life at more risk than the other person is already in.\n\nOne may not put another's life in danger, especially against that person's will, in order to save their own life or that of another.\n\nScholars have long questioned whether or not stealing is permitted in order to save a life. Most have concluded that stealing sustenance from a poor person is prohibited under life-threatening circumstances, since the life of a poor person who loses even a small portion of their sustenance is considered to be endangered. Also, operating a business or similar operation that intentionally robs or defrauds the poor of all or any part of their sustenance is strictly forbidden, even to save a life. Robbing or defrauding a large business, organization, or the government is forbidden if the poor will suffer as a result of the business, organization, or government losing these funds. If a business suffers the loss of money due to fraud or theft, it may pass the losses onto customers by raising its prices, and as a result, the poor may have to spend more. The government, if cheated, may raise taxes, even to the poor, or cut services from which the poor benefit.\n\nThe commandment to save life may also have reference to [[ethical arguments regarding torture]].<ref>CHAPTER 10 ''Torture and Torah: Defense of Dignity and Life in Jewish Law'' Melissa Weintraub p123  in ed. George Hunsinger ''Torture is a moral issue: Christians, Jews, Muslims, and people of ...

In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language, or a loanword is much more common (e.g. in Turkish, the preferred word for \"fire\" is the Persian-derived ''ate\u015f'', whereas the native ''od'' is dead). Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.\n<!--\nThis is a cognate table, so please do not add any non-cognates -->\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:

Due to government relocation programs, thousands of Iraqi Turkmen were relocated from their traditional homelands in northern Iraq and replaced by Arabs, in an effort to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the region.<ref name=\"Jenkins 2008 loc=15\">{{Harvnb|Jenkins|2008|loc=15}}.</ref> Furthermore, Iraqi Turkmen villages and towns were destroyed to make way for Arab migrants, who were promised free land and financial incentives. For example, the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'th regime]] recognised that the city of [[Kirkuk]] was historically an Iraqi Arab city and remained firmly in its cultural orientation.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=64\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=64}}.</ref> Thus, the first wave of Arabization saw Arab families move from the centre and south of Iraq into Kirkuk to work in the expanding oil industry. Although the Iraqi Turkmen were not actively forced out, new Arab quarters were established in the city and the overall demographic balance of the city changed as the Arab migrations continued.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=64\"/>\n\nSeveral presidential decrees and directives from state security and intelligence organizations indicate that the Iraqi Turkmen were a particular focus of attention during the assimilation process during the Ba'th regime. For example, the Iraqi Military Intelligence issued directive 1559 on 6 May 1980 ordering the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen officials from Kirkuk, issuing the following instructions: \"identify the places where Turkmen officials are working in governmental offices [in order] to deport them to other governorates in order to disperse them and prevent them from concentrating in this governorate [Kirkuk]\".<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=65\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=65}}.</ref> In addition, on 30 October 1981, the Revolution's Command Council issued decree 1391, which authorized the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen from Kiruk with paragraph 13 noting that \"this directive is specially aimed at Turkmen and Kurdish officials and workers who are living in Kirkuk\".<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=65\"/>\n\nAs primary victims of these Arabization policies, the Iraqi Turkmen suffered from land expropriation and job discrimination, and therefore would register themselves as \"Arabs\" in order to avoid discrimination.<ref name=\"International Crisis Group 2006 loc=5\">{{Harvnb|International Crisis Group|2006|loc=5}}.</ref> Thus, [[ethnic cleansing]] was an element of the Ba'thist policy aimed at reducing the influence of the Iraqi Turkmen in northern Iraq's Kirkuk.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=66}}.</ref> Those Iraqi Turkmen who remained in cities such as Kirkuk were subject to continued assimilation policies;<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/> school names, neighbourhoods, villages, streets, markets and even mosques with names of Turkic origin were changed to names that emanated from the Ba'th Party or from Arab heroes.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/> Moreover, many Iraqi Turkmen villages and neighbourhoods in Kirkuk were simply demolished, particularly in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/>\n\n== Extinct Turkic languages ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=30|Number\n!width=150|Name\n!width=150|Time of Extinct\n|-\n| align=center|-\n| [[Proto-Turkic language|Proto Turkic]] || align=center|Reconstructed language\n|-\n| align=center|1\n| [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] || align=center|8th century\n|-\n| align=center|2\n| [[Old Anatolian Turkish]] || align=center|15th century\n|-\n| align=center|3\n| [[Pecheneg language|Pecheneg]] || align=center|12th century\n|-\n| align=center|4\n| [[Orkhon Turkic language|Orkhon Turkic]] || align=center|13th century\n|-\n| align=center|5\n| [[Khazar language|Khazar]] || align=center|13th century\n|-\n| align=center|6\n| [[Old Uyghur language|Old Uyghur]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|7\n| [[Khorezmian language (Turkic)|Khorezmian]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|8\n| [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|9\n| [[Middle Turkic languages|Middle Turkic]] || align=center|15th century \n|-\n| align=center|10\n| [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]] || align=center|17th century\n|-\n| align=center|11\n| [[Cuman language|Cuman]] || align=center|1770\n|-\n| align=center|12\n| [[Old Tatar language|Old Tatar]] || align=center|19th century\n|-\n| align=center|13\n| [[Fergana Kipchak language|Fergana Kipchak]] || align=center|1920s\n|-\n| align=center|14\n| [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] || align=center|1921\n|-\n| align=center|15\n| [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] || align=center|1928\n|-\n| align=center|16\n| [[Fuyu Kyrgyz language|Fuyu Girgis]] || align=center|20th century\n|-\n| align=center|17\n| [[Dukhan language|Dukhan]] || align=center|21st century\n|-\n| align=center|18\n| [[Salchuq language|Salchuq]] || align=center|2013\n|}\n\n== Other possible relations ==\nThe Turkic language family is currently regarded as one of the world's primary [[Language family|language families]].<ref>George van DRIEM: Handbuch der Orientalistik.

In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language, or a loanword is much more common (e.g. in Turkish, the preferred word for \"fire\" is the Persian-derived ''ate\u015f'', whereas the native ''od'' is dead). Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.\n<!--\nThis is a cognate table, so please do not add any non-cognates -->\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:

Due to government relocation programs, thousands of Iraqi Turkmen were relocated from their traditional homelands in northern Iraq and replaced by Arabs, in an effort to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the region.<ref name=\"Jenkins 2008 loc=15\">{{Harvnb|Jenkins|2008|loc=15}}.</ref> Furthermore, Iraqi Turkmen villages and towns were destroyed to make way for Arab migrants, who were promised free land and financial incentives. For example, the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'th regime]] recognised that the city of [[Kirkuk]] was historically an Iraqi Arab city and remained firmly in its cultural orientation.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=64\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=64}}.</ref> Thus, the first wave of Arabization saw Arab families move from the centre and south of Iraq into Kirkuk to work in the expanding oil industry. Although the Iraqi Turkmen were not actively forced out, new Arab quarters were established in the city and the overall demographic balance of the city changed as the Arab migrations continued.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=64\"/>\n\nSeveral presidential decrees and directives from state security and intelligence organizations indicate that the Iraqi Turkmen were a particular focus of attention during the assimilation process during the Ba'th regime. For example, the Iraqi Military Intelligence issued directive 1559 on 6 May 1980 ordering the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen officials from Kirkuk, issuing the following instructions: \"identify the places where Turkmen officials are working in governmental offices [in order] to deport them to other governorates in order to disperse them and prevent them from concentrating in this governorate [Kirkuk]\".<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=65\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=65}}.</ref> In addition, on 30 October 1981, the Revolution's Command Council issued decree 1391, which authorized the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen from Kiruk with paragraph 13 noting that \"this directive is specially aimed at Turkmen and Kurdish officials and workers who are living in Kirkuk\".<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=65\"/>\n\nAs primary victims of these Arabization policies, the Iraqi Turkmen suffered from land expropriation and job discrimination, and therefore would register themselves as \"Arabs\" in order to avoid discrimination.<ref name=\"International Crisis Group 2006 loc=5\">{{Harvnb|International Crisis Group|2006|loc=5}}.</ref> Thus, [[ethnic cleansing]] was an element of the Ba'thist policy aimed at reducing the influence of the Iraqi Turkmen in northern Iraq's Kirkuk.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=66}}.</ref> Those Iraqi Turkmen who remained in cities such as Kirkuk were subject to continued assimilation policies;<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/> school names, neighbourhoods, villages, streets, markets and even mosques with names of Turkic origin were changed to names that emanated from the Ba'th Party or from Arab heroes.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/> Moreover, many Iraqi Turkmen villages and neighbourhoods in Kirkuk were simply demolished, particularly in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/>\n\n== Extinct Turkic languages ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=30|Number\n!width=150|Name\n!width=150|Time of Extinct\n|-\n| align=center|-\n| [[Proto-Turkic language|Proto Turkic]] || align=center|Reconstructed language\n|-\n| align=center|1\n| [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] || align=center|8th century\n|-\n| align=center|2\n| [[Old Anatolian Turkish]] || align=center|15th century\n|-\n| align=center|3\n| [[Pecheneg language|Pecheneg]] || align=center|12th century\n|-\n| align=center|4\n| [[Orkhon Turkic language|Orkhon Turkic]] || align=center|13th century\n|-\n| align=center|5\n| [[Khazar language|Khazar]] || align=center|13th century\n|-\n| align=center|6\n| [[Old Uyghur language|Old Uyghur]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|7\n| [[Khorezmian language (Turkic)|Khorezmian]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|8\n| [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|9\n| [[Middle Turkic languages|Middle Turkic]] || align=center|15th century \n|-\n| align=center|10\n| [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]] || align=center|17th century\n|-\n| align=center|11\n| [[Cuman language|Cuman]] || align=center|1770\n|-\n| align=center|12\n| [[Old Tatar language|Old Tatar]] || align=center|19th century\n|-\n| align=center|13\n| [[Fergana Kipchak language|Fergana Kipchak]] || align=center|1920s\n|-\n| align=center|14\n| [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] || align=center|1921\n|-\n| align=center|15\n| [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] || align=center|1928\n|-\n| align=center|16\n| [[Fuyu Kyrgyz language|Fuyu Girgis]] || align=center|20th century\n|-\n| align=center|17\n| [[Dukhan language|Dukhan]] || align=center|21st century\n|-\n| align=center|18\n| [[Salchuq language|Salchuq]] || align=center|2013\n|}\n\n== Other possible relations ==\nThe Turkic language family is currently regarded as one of the world's primary [[Language family|language families]].<ref>George van DRIEM: Handbuch der Orientalistik.

The name had no official status until the 1987 creation of the Isle of Dogs Neighbourhood by [[Tower Hamlets London Borough Council]].  It has been known locally as simply \"the Island\" since the 19th century.<ref name=BritHist/>\n\nThe whole area was once simply known as Stepney Marsh; [[Anton van den Wyngaerde]]'s \"Panorama of London\" dated 1543 depicts and refers to the Isle of Dogs. Records show that ships preparing to carry the English royal household to [[Calais]] in 1520 docked at the southern bank of the island. The name ''Isle of Dogges'' occurs in the ''Thamesis Descriptio'' of 1588, applied to a small island in the south-western part of the peninsula. The name is next applied to the ''Isle of Dogs Fam'' (originally known as ''Pomfret Manor'') shown on a map of 1683. At the same time, the area was variously known as ''Isle of Dogs'' or the ''Blackwell levels''. By 1855, it was incorporated within the parish of [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] under the aegis of the Poplar Board of Works. This was incorporated into the [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar]] on its formation in 1900.<ref name=BritHist/>\n\n==Geology==\nThe soil is [[Alluvium|alluvial]] and silty in nature, underlaid by clay or mud, with a [[peat]] layer in places.<ref name=BritHist>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46507 The Isle of Dogs: Introduction, Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs (1994), pp. 375-87] accessed: 9 February 2007</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe first known written mention of the Isle of Dogs is in the \u2018Letters & Papers of Henry VIII\u2019.

B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Poplar Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe Isle of Dogs is situated some distance downriver from the [[City of London]]. The area was originally sparsely populated marshland before its drainage and planting in the 13th century. A catastrophic flood occurred in 1488, resulting in the area returning to its previous marshy condition. This was not reversed until [[Dutch people|Dutch]] engineers re-drained it in the 17th century.<ref name=\"barryoneoff1\"/>\n\nOne road led across the Marshes to an ancient ferry, at Ferry Road. There was rich grazing on the marsh, and cattle were slaughtered in fields known as the ''Killing Fields'', south of Poplar High Street.\n\nThe western side of the island was known as ''Marsh Wall'', and the district became known as ''Millwall'' with the building of the docks, and from the number of [[windmill]]s constructed along the top of the flood defence.\n\n===Docks===\n[[File:Isle of dogs 1899.jpg|right|thumb|upright|1899 The Isle of Dogs, at the height of its commercial success]]\n\nThe [[urbanisation]] of the Isle of Dogs took place in the 19th century following the construction of the [[West India Docks]], which opened in 1802. This heralded the area's most successful period, when it became an important centre for trade. The [[East India Docks]] were subsequently opened in 1806, followed by [[Millwall Dock]] in 1868. By the 1880s, the casual employment system caused Dock workers to [[London Dock Strike of 1889|unionise]] under [[Ben Tillett]] and [[John Burns]].<ref>John Burns is commemorated in the name given to a current [[Woolwich Ferry]]</ref> This led to a demand for ''6d per hour'' (2.5p), and an end to casual labour in the docks. After a bitter struggle, the [[London Dock Strike of 1889]] was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the unionisation of casual workers.\n\nThe three dock systems were unified in 1909 when the [[Port of London Authority]] took control of the docks. With the docks stretching across from East to West with locks at each end, the Isle of Dogs could now once again almost be described as a genuine island.\n\nDock workers settled on the \"island\" as the docks grew in importance, and by 1901, 21,000 people lived there, largely dependent on the river trade on the Isle as well as in Greenwich and [[Deptford]] across the river to the south and west. The Isle of Dogs was connected to the rest of London by the [[London and Blackwall Railway]], opened in 1840 and progressively extended thereafter. In 1902, the ferry to Greenwich was replaced by the construction of the [[Greenwich foot tunnel]], and  [[Island Gardens]] park was laid out in 1895, providing views across the river. The London and Blackwall Railway closed in 1926. Until the building of the Docklands Light Railway in 1987, the only public transport accessing and exiting the Island consisted of buses using its perimeter roads. These were frequently and substantially delayed by the movement of up to four bridges which allowed ships access to the  West India Docks and Millwall Docks. The insular nature of the Island caused its separateness from the rest of London, and its unique nature.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the docks were a key target for the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]] and were heavily bombed. A number of local civilians were killed in the bombing and extensive destruction was caused on the ground, with many warehouses being destroyed and much of the dock system being put out of action for an extended period. [[Unexploded ordnance|Unexploded bombs]] from this period continue to be discovered today.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=World War II bomb found at Canary Wharf|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6920474.stm|date=28 July 2007}}</ref>  [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft batteries]] were based on [[Mudchute]] Farm; their concrete bases remain today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mudchute in WWII|url=http://www.mudchute.org/about-us/mudchute-in-wwii|publisher=Mudchute Park & Farm|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Heinkel over Wapping.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Heinkel He 111]] bomber over the [[Surrey Commercial Docks]] in [[South London]] and [[Wapping]] and the '''[[Isle of Dogs]]''' in the [[East End of London]] on 7 September 1940]]\n\nAfter the war, the docks underwent a brief resurgence and were even upgraded in 1967. However, with the advent of [[containerization|containerisation]], which the docks could not handle, they became obsolete soon afterwards. The docks closed progressively during the 1970s, with the last &ndash; the West India and Millwall docks &ndash; closing down in 1980. This left the area in a severely dilapidated state, with large areas being derelict and abandoned.\n\n===Industry===\nThe Docks brought with them many associated industries, such as flour and sugar processing, and also ship building. On 31 January 1858 the largest ship of that time, the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']] designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott, Russell & Co, of Millwall. The {{Convert|211|m|ft}} length was too big for the river so the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch this was the last big ship to be built on the Island and the industry fell into a decline. However, parts of the launching slipway and plate works have been preserved in situ and may be seen close to [[Masthouse Terrace Pier]].\n\n===London Docklands Development Corporation===\nThe Isle of Dogs' economic problems led to mass unemployment among the former dockyard workers and caused serious social deprivation. Ted Johns, a local community campaigner, and his supporters, in protest at the lack of social provision from the state, made a unilateral declaration of independence for the area from the United Kingdom as the Republic of the Isles of Dogs<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ianbone.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/march-1st-1970-isle-of-dogs-declares-independence/amp/|title=March 1st  1970 \u2013 ISLE OF DOGS DECLARES INDEPENDENCE!|date=5 August 2009|publisher=}}</ref> and set up an 'Island Council' with Johns himself as its elected president and blocked the two swing-bridges providing the only access to the area by road.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1461749/Ted-Johns.html Ted Johns] ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London). 14 May 2004.</ref> Successive [[UK Labour Party|Labour]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments proposed a number of action plans during the 1970s but it was not until 1981 that the [[London Docklands Development Corporation|London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC)]] was established to redevelop the area. The Isle of Dogs became part of an [[enterprise zone]], which covered 1.95&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land and encompassed the West India, Millwall and East India Docks. New housing, office space and transport infrastructure were built. This included the [[Docklands Light Railway]] and later the [[Jubilee line]] extension, which eventually brought access to the [[London Underground]] to the area for the first time.\n\nSince its construction in 1987\u20131991, the area has been dominated by the expanding [[Canary Wharf]] development with over {{Convert|437,000|m2|sqft}} of office and retail space having been created; 93,000 now work in Canary Wharf alone.<ref>[http://www.canarywharf.com/mainFrm1.asp?strSelectedArea=History Welcome to the Canary Wharf Group plc website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203014042/http://www.canarywharf.com/mainFrm1.asp?strSelectedArea=History |date= 3 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===LDDC legacy===\nIt has been stated by some,{{who?|date=December 2019}} that the redevelopment has not benefited the long-term residents as much as it might, with accusations of a \"land grab\" of riverside sites for private apartment blocks during the period of relaxation of planning conditions under the LDDC.<ref>[http://www.archis.org/plain/object.php?object=789&year=&num= James Steele, \"The Market and Meaning in Contemporary British Architecture\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017042601/http://archis.org/plain/object.php?object=789&year=&num= |date=17 October 2007 }} accessed 13 February 2007</ref> Some tensions remain, as in most areas of central London, between the close-knit island community and professionals who have more recently moved to the area.

Records show that ships preparing to carry the English royal household to [[Calais]] in 1520 docked at the southern bank of the island. The name ''Isle of Dogges'' occurs in the ''Thamesis Descriptio'' of 1588, applied to a small island in the south-western part of the peninsula. The name is next applied to the ''Isle of Dogs Fam'' (originally known as ''Pomfret Manor'') shown on a map of 1683. At the same time, the area was variously known as ''Isle of Dogs'' or the ''Blackwell levels''. By 1855, it was incorporated within the parish of [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] under the aegis of the Poplar Board of Works. This was incorporated into the [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar]] on its formation in 1900.<ref name=BritHist/>\n\n==Geology==\nThe soil is [[Alluvium|alluvial]] and silty in nature, underlaid by clay or mud, with a [[peat]] layer in places.<ref name=BritHist>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46507 The Isle of Dogs: Introduction, Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs (1994), pp. 375-87] accessed: 9 February 2007</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe first known written mention of the Isle of Dogs is in the \u2018Letters & Papers of Henry VIII\u2019.

B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Poplar Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe Isle of Dogs is situated some distance downriver from the [[City of London]]. The area was originally sparsely populated marshland before its drainage and planting in the 13th century. A catastrophic flood occurred in 1488, resulting in the area returning to its previous marshy condition. This was not reversed until [[Dutch people|Dutch]] engineers re-drained it in the 17th century.<ref name=\"barryoneoff1\"/>\n\nOne road led across the Marshes to an ancient ferry, at Ferry Road. There was rich grazing on the marsh, and cattle were slaughtered in fields known as the ''Killing Fields'', south of Poplar High Street.\n\nThe western side of the island was known as ''Marsh Wall'', and the district became known as ''Millwall'' with the building of the docks, and from the number of [[windmill]]s constructed along the top of the flood defence.\n\n===Docks===\n[[File:Isle of dogs 1899.jpg|right|thumb|upright|1899 The Isle of Dogs, at the height of its commercial success]]\n\nThe [[urbanisation]] of the Isle of Dogs took place in the 19th century following the construction of the [[West India Docks]], which opened in 1802. This heralded the area's most successful period, when it became an important centre for trade. The [[East India Docks]] were subsequently opened in 1806, followed by [[Millwall Dock]] in 1868. By the 1880s, the casual employment system caused Dock workers to [[London Dock Strike of 1889|unionise]] under [[Ben Tillett]] and [[John Burns]].<ref>John Burns is commemorated in the name given to a current [[Woolwich Ferry]]</ref> This led to a demand for ''6d per hour'' (2.5p), and an end to casual labour in the docks. After a bitter struggle, the [[London Dock Strike of 1889]] was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the unionisation of casual workers.\n\nThe three dock systems were unified in 1909 when the [[Port of London Authority]] took control of the docks. With the docks stretching across from East to West with locks at each end, the Isle of Dogs could now once again almost be described as a genuine island.\n\nDock workers settled on the \"island\" as the docks grew in importance, and by 1901, 21,000 people lived there, largely dependent on the river trade on the Isle as well as in Greenwich and [[Deptford]] across the river to the south and west. The Isle of Dogs was connected to the rest of London by the [[London and Blackwall Railway]], opened in 1840 and progressively extended thereafter. In 1902, the ferry to Greenwich was replaced by the construction of the [[Greenwich foot tunnel]], and  [[Island Gardens]] park was laid out in 1895, providing views across the river. The London and Blackwall Railway closed in 1926. Until the building of the Docklands Light Railway in 1987, the only public transport accessing and exiting the Island consisted of buses using its perimeter roads. These were frequently and substantially delayed by the movement of up to four bridges which allowed ships access to the  West India Docks and Millwall Docks. The insular nature of the Island caused its separateness from the rest of London, and its unique nature.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the docks were a key target for the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]] and were heavily bombed. A number of local civilians were killed in the bombing and extensive destruction was caused on the ground, with many warehouses being destroyed and much of the dock system being put out of action for an extended period. [[Unexploded ordnance|Unexploded bombs]] from this period continue to be discovered today.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=World War II bomb found at Canary Wharf|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6920474.stm|date=28 July 2007}}</ref>  [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft batteries]] were based on [[Mudchute]] Farm; their concrete bases remain today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mudchute in WWII|url=http://www.mudchute.org/about-us/mudchute-in-wwii|publisher=Mudchute Park & Farm|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Heinkel over Wapping.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Heinkel He 111]] bomber over the [[Surrey Commercial Docks]] in [[South London]] and [[Wapping]] and the '''[[Isle of Dogs]]''' in the [[East End of London]] on 7 September 1940]]\n\nAfter the war, the docks underwent a brief resurgence and were even upgraded in 1967. However, with the advent of [[containerization|containerisation]], which the docks could not handle, they became obsolete soon afterwards. The docks closed progressively during the 1970s, with the last &ndash; the West India and Millwall docks &ndash; closing down in 1980. This left the area in a severely dilapidated state, with large areas being derelict and abandoned.\n\n===Industry===\nThe Docks brought with them many associated industries, such as flour and sugar processing, and also ship building. On 31 January 1858 the largest ship of that time, the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']] designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott, Russell & Co, of Millwall. The {{Convert|211|m|ft}} length was too big for the river so the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch this was the last big ship to be built on the Island and the industry fell into a decline. However, parts of the launching slipway and plate works have been preserved in situ and may be seen close to [[Masthouse Terrace Pier]].\n\n===London Docklands Development Corporation===\nThe Isle of Dogs' economic problems led to mass unemployment among the former dockyard workers and caused serious social deprivation. Ted Johns, a local community campaigner, and his supporters, in protest at the lack of social provision from the state, made a unilateral declaration of independence for the area from the United Kingdom as the Republic of the Isles of Dogs<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ianbone.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/march-1st-1970-isle-of-dogs-declares-independence/amp/|title=March 1st  1970 \u2013 ISLE OF DOGS DECLARES INDEPENDENCE!|date=5 August 2009|publisher=}}</ref> and set up an 'Island Council' with Johns himself as its elected president and blocked the two swing-bridges providing the only access to the area by road.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1461749/Ted-Johns.html Ted Johns] ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London). 14 May 2004.</ref> Successive [[UK Labour Party|Labour]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments proposed a number of action plans during the 1970s but it was not until 1981 that the [[London Docklands Development Corporation|London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC)]] was established to redevelop the area. The Isle of Dogs became part of an [[enterprise zone]], which covered 1.95&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land and encompassed the West India, Millwall and East India Docks. New housing, office space and transport infrastructure were built. This included the [[Docklands Light Railway]] and later the [[Jubilee line]] extension, which eventually brought access to the [[London Underground]] to the area for the first time.\n\nSince its construction in 1987-1991, the area has been dominated by the expanding [[Canary Wharf]] development with over {{Convert|437,000|m2|sqft}} of office and retail space having been created; 93,000 now work in Canary Wharf alone.<ref>[http://www.canarywharf.com/mainFrm1.asp?strSelectedArea=History Welcome to the Canary Wharf Group plc website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203014042/http://www.canarywharf.com/mainFrm1.asp?strSelectedArea=History |date= 3 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===LDDC legacy===\nIt has been stated by some,{{who?|date=December 2019}} that the redevelopment has not benefited the long-term residents as much as it might, with accusations of a \"land grab\" of riverside sites for private apartment blocks during the period of relaxation of planning conditions under the LDDC.<ref>[http://www.archis.org/plain/object.php?object=789&year=&num= James Steele, \"The Market and Meaning in Contemporary British Architecture\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017042601/http://archis.org/plain/object.php?object=789&year=&num= |date=17 October 2007 }} accessed 13 February 2007</ref> Some tensions remain, as in most areas of central London, between the close-knit island community and professionals who have more recently moved to the area.

There is a notch of sorts in one of the right places, and in 2008 Houdin's co-author Bob Brier, with a National Geographic film crew, entered a previously unremarked chamber that could be the start of one of these internal ramps.<ref>Bob Brier (2009) [http://archive.archaeology.org/0907/etc/khufu_pyramid.html \"Update: Return to the Great Pyramid\"] ''Archaeology'' 62(4): 27-29</ref> In 1986 a member of the French team (see below) saw a desert fox at this notch, rather as if it had ascended internally.\n\nHoudin's thesis remains unproven and in 2007, UCL Egyptologist David Jeffreys described the internal spiral hypothesis as \"far-fetched and horribly complicated\", while Oxford University's [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]], declared he was \"suspicious of any theory that seeks to explain only how the Great Pyramid was built\".<ref>[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/299582/Secrets+of+a+lost+world.htm Secrets of a lost world] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119161734/http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/299582/Secrets%2Bof%2Ba%2Blost%2Bworld.htm |date=November 19, 2008 }} The Engineer, May 8, 2007.</ref> \n\nThe team concluded that the pyramid\u2019s architect, [[Hemiunu]], concerned that the cracks imperiled the whole structure, had cut a tunnel into a sealed space above the burial chamber to assess the damage, and then had filled the cracks with plaster as a tell-tale that would indicate if they were widening. The beams held and the pyramid was completed.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | title=Khufu: The Secrets Behind the Building of the Great Pyramid | first=Jean-Pierre | last=Houdin | ISBN=978-977-17-3061-3 | publisher=Farid Atiya Press | date=2006}}\n* {{cite book | title=The Secret of the Great Pyramid: How One Man's Obsession Led to the Solution of Ancient Egypt's Greatest Mystery | url=https://archive.org/details/secretofgreatpyr00brie | url-access=registration | first1=Bob | last1=Brier | first2=Jean-Pierre | last2=Houdin | ISBN=978-0-06-165552-4 | publisher=Collins | date=2008}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.3ds.com/khufu Khufu Reborn]: Jean-Pierre Houdin's theory step by step in real-time 3D\n* [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/pyramid.html Smithsonian article Monumental Shift]\n* [http://www.construire-la-grande-pyramide.fr/html/jphgb.htm Jean-Pierre Houdin association ACGP]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Houdin, Jean-Pierre}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:20th-century French architects]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Architects from Paris]]\n[[Category:Pyramids]]\n[[Category:French Egyptologists]]\n", "name_user": "Lowenna", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Old link did not work", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Houdin"}
