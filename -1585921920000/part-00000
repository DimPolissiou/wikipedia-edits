His video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].\n\nIn 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for \"Best Long Form Music Video\" for another work with Madonna \u2013 directing \"The Confessions Tour\" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite

His video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].\n\nIn 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for \"Best Long Form Music Video\" for another work with Madonna \u2013 directing \"The Confessions Tour\" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite

It is on the [[Witten/Dortmund\u2013Oberhausen/Duisburg railway|Witten/Dortmund\u2013Oberhausen/Duisburg line]] and is classified by [[Deutsche Bahn]] as a [[German railway station categories|category 3 station]].<ref name =categories /> \n\n== Location and layout ==\n[[File:05225 Bf M\u00fclheim (Ruhr)-Styrum.JPG|thumb|left|Overview of the track layout of M\u00fclheim-Styrum station in 2015. On the left are the passenger tracks, on the right the freight tracks and the connecting tracks to the Mannesmann site. Signal box \"Mf\" is on the right]]\nThe station is served by passenger and freight traffic. The track system comprises a total of five platform tracks. S-Bahn trains to and from Duisburg use tracks 2 and 5, the trains to and from Oberhausen use tracks 3 and 4 on the two island platforms. The house platform (platform 1) and track 6 (which has no platform) are used for long-distance and regional trains. Sidings 8\u201318 are to the north of this (although track 12 is vacant).\n \nIn the station there are two track connections to the [[Mannesmann]] tube factory and to the Friedrich Wilhelms steel works.\n \nThe station has been controlled from the M\u00fclheim-Styrum signal box since 1967.

The town administers three villages: Bodrogu Vechi (''\u00d3bodrog''), Sederhat (''Szederh\u00e1t'') and Turnu (''Tornya'').\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|2002 |13024\n|2011 |11885\n}}\n\nAccording to the census of 2011 the population of the town counts 12,762 inhabitants. The ethnic composition is as follows: 62.2% Romanians, 28% Hungarians, 8.4% Roma, 0.33% Slovaks, 0.36% Serbs and 0.7% are of other or undeclared nationalities.\n\n==History==\nDue to the abundance of archaeological finds of the zone an important historic period known as the [[Periam-Pecica culture]] was named after the settlement. The history of the localities Pecica, Bodrogu Vechi, Sederhat and Turnu is closely connected with the events making highly memorable the entire zone of the Arad Plateau.\n[[File:PecicaCulCntr.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pecica Cultural Center]]\n\nThe first mention in documents of the locality dates back to 1335 when it was known as Petk. Sederhat was registered only in 1913, Turnu in 1333 under the name of Mok, while Bodrogu Vechi in 1422 under the name of Bodruch. It has a complex political history with periods of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, periods of [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania]]. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], it became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] within [[Austria-Hungary]] up until the [[Treaty of Trianon]].

The town administers three villages: Bodrogu Vechi (''\u00d3bodrog''), Sederhat (''Szederh\u00e1t'') and Turnu (''Tornya'').\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|2002 |13024\n|2011 |11885\n}}\n\nAccording to the census of 2011 the population of the town counts 12,762 inhabitants. The ethnic composition is as follows: 62.2% Romanians, 28% Hungarians, 8.4% Roma, 0.33% Slovaks, 0.36% Serbs and 0.7% are of other or undeclared nationalities.\n\n==History==\nDue to the abundance of archaeological finds of the zone an important historic period known as the [[Periam-Pecica culture]] was named after the settlement. The history of the localities Pecica, Bodrogu Vechi, Sederhat and Turnu is closely connected with the events making highly memorable the entire zone of the Arad Plateau.\n[[File:PecicaCulCntr.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pecica Cultural Center]]\n\nThe first mention in documents of the locality dates back to 1335 when it was known as Petk. Sederhat was registered only in 1913, Turnu in 1333 under the name of Mok, while Bodrogu Vechi in 1422 under the name of Bodruch. It has a complex political history with periods of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, periods of [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania]]. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], it became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] within [[Austria-Hungary]] up until the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Since then the town has been part of Romania.\n\n==Economy==\nAlthough the economy of the town is prevalent agricultural, the secondary and tertiary economic sectors have also developed\nrecently.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland.<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s.

A 1625 order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] refers to the Great Kirk congregation, which was then meeting in St Giles', as the \"High Kirk\".

The Covenant remained in the possession of the family of the Laird of Dundas until 1924, when it was purchased by Alexander Wallace and donated to St Giles' in 1926. It now stands in a plain oak frame in the Chepman Aisle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stgilescathedral.org.uk/the-national-covenant-of-scotland/|title=The National Covenant of Scotland|website=stgilescathedral.org.uk|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Thistle Chapel==\n[[File:Thistle Chapel Interior.jpg|thumb|180px|The interior of the Thistle Chapel showing the ceiling and knights' stalls]]\n{{see|Thistle Chapel}}\n\nLocated at the south-east corner of St Giles', the Thistle Chapel is the chapel of the [[Order of the Thistle]]; it is accessed externally by the east door of the church and from the church itself by the south choir aisle.\n\nAt the foundation of the [[Order of the Thistle]] in 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] ordered [[Holyrood Abbey]] be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]].

It now stands in a plain oak frame in the Chepman Aisle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stgilescathedral.org.uk/the-national-covenant-of-scotland/|title=The National Covenant of Scotland|website=stgilescathedral.org.uk|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Thistle Chapel==\n[[File:Thistle Chapel Interior.jpg|thumb|180px|The interior of the Thistle Chapel showing the ceiling and knights' stalls]]\n{{see|Thistle Chapel}}\n\nLocated at the south-east corner of St Giles', the Thistle Chapel is the chapel of the [[Order of the Thistle]]; it is accessed externally by the east door of the church and from the church itself by the south choir aisle.\n\nAt the foundation of the [[Order of the Thistle]] in 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] ordered [[Holyrood Abbey]] be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

The Commission recommended that the division consist of the whole of the [[Cross Gates|Crossgates]], [[Roundhay]], [[Seacroft]], and [[Shadwell, West Yorkshire|Shadwell]] wards, together with the larger parts of two other wards which were to be divided between divisions: North-East ward save for a small part west of Accommodation Road in [[Burmantofts]] which was placed in the South-East division and that part of North ward east of [[Gledhow]] Park and [[Moor Allerton]].<ref>\"87. Parliamentary Borough of Leeds\" in \"Report of the Boundary Commission (England and Wales)\", Cd. 8757, vol II.</ref> This created a division with a population of 74,054 (according to the 1911 Census); 38,307 lived in the part of North ward, 28,349 in the part of North-East ward, and 7,398 in Roundhay, Seacroft, Shadwell and Cross Gates. Parliament enacted the new boundaries without alteration in the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]].\n\nThe initial report of the [[Boundary Commission for England|Boundary Commission]] in 1947 recommended that the North East division consist of the [[Burmantofts]], [[Harehills]], [[Potternewton]] and [[Roundhay]] wards. This meant a slightly smaller electorate (in respect of the register in force on 15 October 1946) from 78,498 to a still hefty 66,671; the main change was the removal of [[Seacroft]] to the South East division.<ref>\"Initial Report of the Boundary Commission for England\", [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 7260, p. 54.</ref> The Government brought in a Representation of the People Bill based on the recommendations, but after pressure from some affected local authorities, decided give extra seats to some towns and cities where the electorate had resulted in the area narrowly missing out on an additional Member: on 18 March 1948 the Government put down amendments to the Bill which included increasing the number of seats in the County Borough of Leeds from six to seven.<ref>\"Constituency Changes\", ''The Times'', 19 March 1948, p. 4.</ref> The Boundary Commission produced revised recommendations contained the wards of Burmantofts, Harehills and Roundhay, and having an electorate of 51,181.<ref>\"Representation of the People Bill. Statement showing the names, contents and electorates of certain proposed new constituencies\", [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 7363, p. 6.</ref> The Boundary Commission consulted on their proposals and received objections to the arrangements in the west of the city which led them to revise the recommendations in May 1948. The alterations had knock-on effects on the North East division, which was now recommended to comprise the North, Roundhay and Woodhouse wards for 56,283 electors.<ref>\"Representation of the People Bill. Report of Boundary Commissioners for England on Representations relating to certain proposed new constituencies.\", [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 7400, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nWhen the Home Secretary [[James Chuter Ede]] proposed altering the Bill in line with the altered recommendations, the sitting MP for Leeds North-East [[Alice Bacon, Baroness Bacon|Alice Bacon]] (supported by [[George Porter (politician)|George Porter]], MP for Leeds Central) moved an amendment to alter the name of a division the Boundary Commission had called 'East Central' to 'North East', and altering the division the Boundary Commission had called 'North East' to 'North'. The Government accepted the amendment,<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/jun/15/first-schedule-parliamentary#S5CV0452P0_19480615_HOC_608 Hansard]'', HC 5ser vol 452 cols 374\u20136.</ref> as effected in the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. The Leeds North East division from then consisted of the [[Burmantofts]], [[Harehills]], [[Potternewton]] and [[Richmond Hill, Leeds|Richmond Hill]] wards and had a 1946 electorate of 49,882. The division was considerably smaller in area after changes in 1950.\n\nAlterations in ward boundaries in Leeds on 28 July 1950 led the Boundary Commission to make an interim report on alterations of constituency boundaries in 1951; although the definition of the constituency was the same, the ward changes had a minor impact on the divisional boundaries.<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England Report\", [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 8100, p. 3; [[F. W. S. Craig]], \"British Parliamentary Election Results 1950\u20131973\", 2nd edition, Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1983, p. 181.</ref> In 1954 the Boundary Commission looked again at boundaries, and recommended that the North East division of Leeds consist of the wards of Allerton, Potternewton, Roundhay and Woodhouse. Three out of the four wards (Allerton, Roundhay and Woodhouse wards) came from the abolished [[Leeds North (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North]], while Burmantofts and Harehills wards were removed to Leeds East, and Richmond Hill ward went to Leeds South East.<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England\", First Periodical Report, [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 9311, pp. 62\u20133.</ref>\n\nBy the time of the Second Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in the late 1960s, the wards of the County Borough of Leeds had again been altered. The commission recommended that the Borough Constituency of Leeds North East consist of the wards of [[Chapel Allerton]], Harehills, Roundhay, [[Scott Hall, Leeds|Scott Hall]] and Talbot. The change decreased the electorate (on the October 1968 register) slightly from 53,719 to 53,461.<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England\", Second Periodical Report, [[Command paper|Cmnd.]] 4084, p. 128, 134.</ref> These boundary changes took effect from the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]]. The Third Periodical Review in 1983 initially proposed a Leeds North East County Constituency comprising 33,200 electors out of 60,120 in the existing borough together with half of the previous Leeds North West seat and [[Harewood]] and [[Wetherby]] from the Barkston Ash seat. At a public inquiry the plans were challenged and the assistant Commissioner recommended that the Leeds North East constituency remain urban and based on the previous seat, comprising Chapel Allerton, Moortown, North and Roundhay wards; this alteration was accepted by the Boundary Commission.<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England\", Third Periodical Report, [[Command paper|Cmnd.]] 8797-I, pp. 72\u20134.</ref> The changes still removed 10,000 electors, mostly to Leeds East but some to Leeds Central and Elmet, and brought in 16,000 electors, mostly from Leeds North West and Barkston Ash and a small number from Leeds South East.<ref>\"The BBC/ITN Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies\", Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1983, pp. 89, 195.</ref> No changes were made in the Fourth Periodical Review in 1995.<ref>\"The Media Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies\", Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre, 1995, p. 108.</ref>\n;Current boundaries\n[[Boundary changes for the 2010 United Kingdom general election|Boundary changes]] implemented the [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] \u2014 their final recommendations almost matched initial proposals and so the seat comprises [[Alwoodley (ward)|Alwoodley]], [[Chapel Allerton]], [[Moortown, Leeds|Moortown]] and [[Roundhay]]<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England\", Fifth Periodical Report, [[Command paper|Cm.]] 7032, pp. 190\u2013203.</ref> \u2014 which took effect at the 2010 general election. By these changes, 2,100 electors out of 64,106 in the existing seat were removed to Elmet and Rothwell, while 3,875 were added from Leeds North West, 700 from Leeds Central, and 349 from Leeds East.<ref>\"Media Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies\", Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre, 2007, pp. 107, 244.</ref>\n\n== Constituency profile ==\nThis is a diverse constituency covering the northern half of the City of [[Leeds]].

A year after Hamilton increased his majority in 2001, psephologists Simon Henig and Lewis Baston wrote that it was now possible to think of Labour winning Leeds North East in a general election which it lost.<ref>Simon Henig, Lewis Baston, \"The Political Map of Britain\", Politico's Publishing, 2002, p. 746.</ref> \n''The Guardian'' described the seat in 2010 as:\n{{quote|'Diverse Leeds seat including innercity, smart suburbs and farmland.'}}\n\nThe seat stretches from the countryside around the [[Eccup]] reservoir to the north, through affluent residential suburbs such as [[Alwoodley]], [[Roundhay]], and [[Moortown, Leeds|Moortown]], with their large Jewish populations, up-and-coming neighbourhoods popular with young professionals such as [[Chapel Allerton]], down to deprived inner-city areas such as [[Chapeltown, West Yorkshire|Chapeltown]], the centre of Leeds' Afro-Caribbean community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/help/localstatistics|title=Local statistics - Office for National Statistics|website=www.ons.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAt the first election in 1918, it was decided that a Conservative candidate would receive the Coalition 'coupon' in Leeds North East, as four Liberals had received coupons in other Leeds divisions and Labour was allowed an unopposed return in Leeds South-East. Major John Birchall, the Coalition Conservative candidate, was opposed by Labour Party candidate [[John Bromley (politician)|John Bromley]], leader of the Locomotive Engineman's Society. ''[[The Times]]'' described Bromley as \"prone to verbal violence\" and with \"an unnecessary railway strike in his war service record\". A third candidate, Captain W.P. Brigstock, announced himself for the [[National Party (UK, 1917)|National Party]], but was felt to have negligible prospects and did not stand.<ref>\"Asquith Liberals in Yorkshire\", ''The Times'', 30 November 1918, p. 9.</ref> Birchall won comfortably, and went on to represent the seat until he retired in February 1940. His majority never fell below 4,000.\n\nBirchall's resignation resulted in a [[UK Parliamentary by-elections|by-election]] in March 1940, Professor [[John James Craik-Henderson|J.J. Craik Henderson]] was nominated as a Conservative. Under the war-time electoral truce no Labour or Liberal candidate stood, but he was opposed by Sydney Allen of the [[British Union of Fascists]] who campaigned on an anti-war policy. Henderson won [[1940 Leeds North East by-election|the by-election]] with 97.1% of the vote. Despite the division's history, Labour went into the 1945 general election with a degree of optimism.<ref>\"West Riding Liberals' revival effort\", ''Manchester Guardian'', 3 July 1945, p. 2.</ref> As it turned out Professor Craik Henderson could not defend his seat, and [[Alice Bacon, Baroness Bacon|Alice Bacon]] won for Labour on a 22.6% [[swing (politics)|swing]].\n\nThe constituency with new boundaries at the 1950 election was reckoned to be helpful to Alice Bacon,<ref>\"New Boundaries in Leeds make prophets cautious\", ''Manchester Guardian'', 2 February 1950, p. 6.</ref> and therefore likely to be held by Labour.<ref>\"Doubts about Steel\", ''The Times'', 9 February 1950, p. 3.</ref> She indeed held the seat at both the 1950 and 1951 general elections.\n\nThe complex changes to Leeds' Parliamentary boundaries in 1955, which reduced the city from seven seats to six, particularly affected Leeds North East which was reckoned to be the seat which was abolished.<ref>\"Alterations to Parliamentary boundaries proposed\", ''Manchester Guardian'', 19 March 1954, p. 3.</ref> In the event Alice Bacon was selected in Leeds South East, while that seat's sitting MP [[Denis Healey]] was selected for the new Leeds East constituency. George Porter, sitting MP for Leeds Central, failed to be selected for any new seat when his constituency was abolished and retired. The new North East division was effectively based on the old North division, and that seat's sitting Conservative MP [[Osbert Peake]] came forward as candidate. He was thought to have a slightly less safe seat in the new Leeds North East.<ref>\"Conservative hopes of a 3\u20133 score at Leeds\", ''Manchester Guardian'', 5 May 1955, p. 8.</ref> Peake won easily, and after he received a peerage, his successor Sir [[Keith Joseph]] held on in a [[1956 Leeds North East by-election|1956 by-election]].\n\nJoseph had a relatively safe seat at first but his majority fell in the elections of the 1960s. At the 1970 general election, it was noted that the seat had the highest immigrant population among the constituencies in Leeds, and had also produced the smallest swing to the Conservatives at that election.<ref>[[Michael Steed]], \"An Analysis of the Results\", p. 406-7 in \"The British General Election of 1970\" by [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, Macmillan, 1970.</ref> The 1979 general election saw the constituency swing to Labour, against the national trend;<ref>\"The British General Election of 1979\" by [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, Macmillan, 1979, p. 377.</ref> in 1987 it was noted that while the Conservatives had held the seat, they had done poorly in terms of votes.<ref>\"Analysis\" by John Curtice and Michael Steed in \"The British General Election of 1987\" by [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, Macmillan, 1987, p. 332.</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the 1997 general election, the seat was a target for the Labour Party. The Leeds North East [[Constituency Labour Party]] selected [[Liz Davies]], an Islington councillor on the party's left wing, but the Labour Party [[National Executive Committee]] refused to endorse her candidacy over connections to the [[Labour Left Briefing|Labour Briefing]] magazine; her appeal to the Labour Party conference was unsuccessful. The winner of the second selection, [[Fabian Hamilton]], was identified as a [[Blairism|Blairite]] and comfortably gained the seat when the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election was called]].<ref>\"The British General Election of 1997\" by [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, Macmillan, 1997, p. 193-4.</ref> The result of the 2010 general election saw Hamilton retain the seat, with a further pro-Labour swing in 2015 and a majority of nearly 17,000 in 2017, the largest since Labour gained the seat two decades ago.

[[parliamentary borough]] was recommended by the Boundary Commission in its report of 1917. The Commission recommended that the division consist of the whole of the [[Cross Gates|Crossgates]], [[Roundhay]], [[Seacroft]], and [[Shadwell, West Yorkshire|Shadwell]] wards, together with the larger parts of two other wards which were to be divided between divisions: North-East ward save for a small part west of Accommodation Road in [[Burmantofts]] which was placed in the South-East division and that part of North ward east of [[Gledhow]] Park and [[Moor Allerton]].<ref>\"87. Parliamentary Borough of Leeds\" in \"Report of the Boundary Commission (England and Wales)\", Cd. 8757, vol II.</ref> This created a division with a population of 74,054 (according to the 1911 Census); 38,307 lived in the part of North ward, 28,349 in the part of North-East ward, and 7,398 in Roundhay, Seacroft, Shadwell and Cross Gates. Parliament enacted the new boundaries without alteration in the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]].\n\nThe initial report of the [[Boundary Commission for England|Boundary Commission]] in 1947 recommended that the North East division consist of the [[Burmantofts]], [[Harehills]], [[Potternewton]] and [[Roundhay]] wards. This meant a slightly smaller electorate (in respect of the register in force on 15 October 1946) from 78,498 to a still hefty 66,671; the main change was the removal of [[Seacroft]] to the South East division.<ref>\"Initial Report of the Boundary Commission for England\", [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 7260, p. 54.</ref> The Government brought in a Representation of the People Bill based on the recommendations, but after pressure from some affected local authorities, decided give extra seats to some towns and cities where the electorate had resulted in the area narrowly missing out on an additional Member: on 18 March 1948 the Government put down amendments to the Bill which included increasing the number of seats in the County Borough of Leeds from six to seven.<ref>\"Constituency Changes\", ''The Times'', 19 March 1948, p. 4.</ref> The Boundary Commission produced revised recommendations contained the wards of Burmantofts, Harehills and Roundhay, and having an electorate of 51,181.<ref>\"Representation of the People Bill. Statement showing the names, contents and electorates of certain proposed new constituencies\", [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 7363, p. 6.</ref> The Boundary Commission consulted on their proposals and received objections to the arrangements in the west of the city which led them to revise the recommendations in May 1948. The alterations had knock-on effects on the North East division, which was now recommended to comprise the North, Roundhay and Woodhouse wards for 56,283 electors.<ref>\"Representation of the People Bill. Report of Boundary Commissioners for England on Representations relating to certain proposed new constituencies.\", [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 7400, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nWhen the Home Secretary [[James Chuter Ede]] proposed altering the Bill in line with the altered recommendations, the sitting MP for Leeds North-East [[Alice Bacon, Baroness Bacon|Alice Bacon]] (supported by [[George Porter (politician)|George Porter]], MP for Leeds Central) moved an amendment to alter the name of a division the Boundary Commission had called 'East Central' to 'North East', and altering the division the Boundary Commission had called 'North East' to 'North'. The Government accepted the amendment,<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/jun/15/first-schedule-parliamentary#S5CV0452P0_19480615_HOC_608 Hansard]'', HC 5ser vol 452 cols 374\u20136.</ref> as effected in the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. The Leeds North East division from then consisted of the [[Burmantofts]], [[Harehills]], [[Potternewton]] and [[Richmond Hill, Leeds|Richmond Hill]] wards and had a 1946 electorate of 49,882. The division was considerably smaller in area after changes in 1950.\n\nAlterations in ward boundaries in Leeds on 28 July 1950 led the Boundary Commission to make an interim report on alterations of constituency boundaries in 1951; although the definition of the constituency was the same, the ward changes had a minor impact on the divisional boundaries.<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England Report\", [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 8100, p. 3; [[F. W. S. Craig]], \"British Parliamentary Election Results 1950\u20131973\", 2nd edition, Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1983, p. 181.</ref> In 1954 the Boundary Commission looked again at boundaries, and recommended that the North East division of Leeds consist of the wards of Allerton, Potternewton, Roundhay and Woodhouse. Three out of the four wards (Allerton, Roundhay and Woodhouse wards) came from the abolished [[Leeds North (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North]], while Burmantofts and Harehills wards were removed to Leeds East, and Richmond Hill ward went to Leeds South East.<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England\", First Periodical Report, [[Command paper|Cmd.]] 9311, pp. 62\u20133.</ref>\n\nBy the time of the Second Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in the late 1960s, the wards of the County Borough of Leeds had again been altered. The commission recommended that the Borough Constituency of Leeds North East consist of the wards of [[Chapel Allerton]], Harehills, Roundhay, [[Scott Hall, Leeds|Scott Hall]] and Talbot. The change decreased the electorate (on the October 1968 register) slightly from 53,719 to 53,461.<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England\", Second Periodical Report, [[Command paper|Cmnd.]] 4084, p. 128, 134.</ref> These boundary changes took effect from the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]]. The Third Periodical Review in 1983 initially proposed a Leeds North East County Constituency comprising 33,200 electors out of 60,120 in the existing borough together with half of the previous Leeds North West seat and [[Harewood]] and [[Wetherby]] from the Barkston Ash seat. At a public inquiry the plans were challenged and the assistant Commissioner recommended that the Leeds North East constituency remain urban and based on the previous seat, comprising Chapel Allerton, Moortown, North and Roundhay wards; this alteration was accepted by the Boundary Commission.<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England\", Third Periodical Report, [[Command paper|Cmnd.]] 8797-I, pp. 72\u20134.</ref> The changes still removed 10,000 electors, mostly to Leeds East but some to Leeds Central and Elmet, and brought in 16,000 electors, mostly from Leeds North West and Barkston Ash and a small number from Leeds South East.<ref>\"The BBC/ITN Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies\", Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1983, pp. 89, 195.</ref> No changes were made in the Fourth Periodical Review in 1995.<ref>\"The Media Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies\", Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre, 1995, p. 108.</ref>\n;Current boundaries\n[[Boundary changes for the 2010 United Kingdom general election|Boundary changes]] implemented the [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] \u2014 their final recommendations almost matched initial proposals and so the seat comprises [[Alwoodley (ward)|Alwoodley]], [[Chapel Allerton]], [[Moortown, Leeds|Moortown]] and [[Roundhay]]<ref>\"Boundary Commission for England\", Fifth Periodical Report, [[Command paper|Cm.]] 7032, pp. 190\u2013203.</ref> \u2014 which took effect at the 2010 general election. By these changes, 2,100 electors out of 64,106 in the existing seat were removed to Elmet and Rothwell, while 3,875 were added from Leeds North West, 700 from Leeds Central, and 349 from Leeds East.<ref>\"Media Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies\", Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre, 2007, pp. 107, 244.</ref>\n\n== Constituency profile ==\nThis is a diverse constituency covering the northern half of the City of [[Leeds]]. It was once a Conservative [[safe seat|stronghold]], represented for thirty-one years by the senior Tory politician and former cabinet minister [[Keith Joseph]] that has since 1997 seen relatively strong [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] support as many large Victorian houses have gradually been converted into flats and multiple-occupancy homes,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129132219/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html|deadurl=y|title=2011 census interactive maps, see density statistics|archivedate=29 January 2016}}</ref> helping them gain the seat in 1997 for the first time since the 1950s, and have held on since.  A year after Hamilton increased his majority in 2001, psephologists Simon Henig and Lewis Baston wrote that it was now possible to think of Labour winning Leeds North East in a general election which it lost.<ref>Simon Henig, Lewis Baston, \"The Political Map of Britain\", Politico's Publishing, 2002, p. 746.</ref> \n''The Guardian'' described the seat in 2010 as:\n{{quote|'Diverse Leeds seat including innercity, smart suburbs and farmland.'}}\n\nThe seat stretches from the countryside around the [[Eccup]] reservoir to the north, through affluent residential suburbs such as [[Alwoodley]], [[Roundhay]], and [[Moortown, Leeds|Moortown]], with their large Jewish populations, up-and-coming neighbourhoods popular with young professionals such as [[Chapel Allerton]], down to deprived inner-city areas such as [[Chapeltown, West Yorkshire|Chapeltown]], the centre of Leeds' Afro-Caribbean community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/help/localstatistics|title=Local statistics - Office for National Statistics|website=www.ons.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAt the first election in 1918, it was decided that a Conservative candidate would receive the Coalition 'coupon' in Leeds North East, as four Liberals had received coupons in other Leeds divisions and Labour was allowed an unopposed return in Leeds South-East. Major John Birchall, the Coalition Conservative candidate, was opposed by Labour Party candidate [[John Bromley (politician)|John Bromley]], leader of the Locomotive Engineman's Society. ''[[The Times]]'' described Bromley as \"prone to verbal violence\" and with \"an unnecessary railway strike in his war service record\". A third candidate, Captain W.P. Brigstock, announced himself for the [[National Party (UK, 1917)|National Party]], but was felt to have negligible prospects and did not stand.<ref>\"Asquith Liberals in Yorkshire\", ''The Times'', 30 November 1918, p. 9.</ref> Birchall won comfortably, and went on to represent the seat until he retired in February 1940. His majority never fell below 4,000.\n\nBirchall's resignation resulted in a [[UK Parliamentary by-elections|by-election]] in March 1940, Professor [[John James Craik-Henderson|J.J. Craik Henderson]] was nominated as a Conservative. Under the war-time electoral truce no Labour or Liberal candidate stood, but he was opposed by Sydney Allen of the [[British Union of Fascists]] who campaigned on an anti-war policy. Henderson won [[1940 Leeds North East by-election|the by-election]] with 97.1% of the vote. Despite the division's history, Labour went into the 1945 general election with a degree of optimism.<ref>\"West Riding Liberals' revival effort\", ''Manchester Guardian'', 3 July 1945, p. 2.</ref> As it turned out Professor Craik Henderson could not defend his seat, and [[Alice Bacon, Baroness Bacon|Alice Bacon]] won for Labour on a 22.6% [[swing (politics)|swing]].\n\nThe constituency with new boundaries at the 1950 election was reckoned to be helpful to Alice Bacon,<ref>\"New Boundaries in Leeds make prophets cautious\", ''Manchester Guardian'', 2 February 1950, p. 6.</ref> and therefore likely to be held by Labour.<ref>\"Doubts about Steel\", ''The Times'', 9 February 1950, p. 3.</ref> She indeed held the seat at both the 1950 and 1951 general elections.\n\nThe complex changes to Leeds' Parliamentary boundaries in 1955, which reduced the city from seven seats to six, particularly affected Leeds North East which was reckoned to be the seat which was abolished.<ref>\"Alterations to Parliamentary boundaries proposed\", ''Manchester Guardian'', 19 March 1954, p. 3.</ref> In the event Alice Bacon was selected in Leeds South East, while that seat's sitting MP [[Denis Healey]] was selected for the new Leeds East constituency. George Porter, sitting MP for Leeds Central, failed to be selected for any new seat when his constituency was abolished and retired. The new North East division was effectively based on the old North division, and that seat's sitting Conservative MP [[Osbert Peake]] came forward as candidate. He was thought to have a slightly less safe seat in the new Leeds North East.<ref>\"Conservative hopes of a 3\u20133 score at Leeds\", ''Manchester Guardian'', 5 May 1955, p. 8.</ref> Peake won easily, and after he received a peerage, his successor Sir [[Keith Joseph]] held on in a [[1956 Leeds North East by-election|1956 by-election]].\n\nJoseph had a relatively safe seat at first but his majority fell in the elections of the 1960s. At the 1970 general election, it was noted that the seat had the highest immigrant population among the constituencies in Leeds, and had also produced the smallest swing to the Conservatives at that election.<ref>[[Michael Steed]], \"An Analysis of the Results\", p. 406-7 in \"The British General Election of 1970\" by [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, Macmillan, 1970.</ref> The 1979 general election saw the constituency swing to Labour, against the national trend;<ref>\"The British General Election of 1979\" by [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, Macmillan, 1979, p. 377.</ref> in 1987 it was noted that while the Conservatives had held the seat, they had done poorly in terms of votes.<ref>\"Analysis\" by John Curtice and Michael Steed in \"The British General Election of 1987\" by [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, Macmillan, 1987, p. 332.</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the 1997 general election, the seat was a target for the Labour Party. The Leeds North East [[Constituency Labour Party]] selected [[Liz Davies]], an Islington councillor on the party's left wing, but the Labour Party [[National Executive Committee]] refused to endorse her candidacy over connections to the [[Labour Left Briefing|Labour Briefing]] magazine; her appeal to the Labour Party conference was unsuccessful. The winner of the second selection, [[Fabian Hamilton]], was identified as a [[Blairism|Blairite]] and comfortably gained the seat when the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election was called]].<ref>\"The British General Election of 1997\" by [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, Macmillan, 1997, p. 193-4.</ref> The result of the 2010 general election saw Hamilton retain the seat, with a further pro-Labour swing in 2015 and a majority of nearly 17,000 in 2017, the largest since Labour gained the seat two decades ago. Although Hamilton's share of the vote fell in 2019, the Conservative share fell further and his majority increased to over 17,000.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n[[File:Official portrait of Fabian Hamilton MP crop 3.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Fabian Hamilton]], [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Leeds North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North East]] since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|l|1|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party!!Notes\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| [[John Birchall]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| Resigned 1940\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1940 Leeds North East by-election|1940 by-election]]\n| [[John Craik-Henderson]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]]\n| [[Alice Bacon, Baroness Bacon|Alice Bacon]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955]]\n| [[Osbert Peake, 1st Viscount Ingleby|Osbert Peake]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| Resigned 1956\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1956 Leeds North East by-election|1956 by-election]]\n| [[Keith Joseph]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]]\n| [[Timothy Kirkhope]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]\n| [[Fabian Hamilton]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|}\n\n==Elections==\n===Elections in the 2010s===\n\n{{Election box begin |\n  |title=[[2019 United Kingdom general election|General election 2019]]: Leeds North East<ref>https://www.leeds.gov.uk/your-council/elections/parliamentary-general-election-results</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies/E14000779|title=Leeds North East parliamentary constituency - Election 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = [[Fabian Hamilton]]\n  |votes      = 29,024\n  |percentage = 57.5\n  |change     = -5.6\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = [[Amjad Bashir]]<sup>1</sup>\n  |votes      = 11,935\n  |percentage = 23.6\n  |change     = -7.4\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n  |candidate  = Jon Hannah\n  |votes      = 5,665 \n  |percentage = 11.2\n  |change     = +7.5\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n |party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n |candidate  = Rachel Hartshorne\n |votes      = \t1,931  \n |percentage = 3.8\n |change     = +2.5\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Brexit Party\n  |candidate  = Inaya Folarin Iman\n  |votes      = 1,769\n  |percentage = 3.5\n  |change     = N/A\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n |party      = Alliance for Green Socialism\n |candidate  = Celia Foote\n |votes      = 176\n |percentage = 0.3\n |change     = +0.1\n}}\n{{Election box majority|\n |votes = 17,089\n |percentage = 33.9\n |change = +1.8\n}}\n{{Election box turnout|\n |votes = 50,500\n |percentage = 71.6\n |change = -4.25\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link|\n  |winner     = Labour Party (UK)\n  |swing      = +0.9\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n<sup>1</sup> The Conservative Party suspended Amjad Bashir on 20 November 2019.

In reviewing both the literature and fossil record in 2007 Wood and Constantino recognised two competing hypotheses, one that aethiopicus, boisei and robustus are a distinct [[clade]] with boisei and robustus evolving from aethiopicus. The second is that there was some parallel evolution of two distinct lines, with boisei evolving from aethiopicus, but robustus evolving separately from A. Africanus. (They also acknowledge that Skelton & McHenry in 1992 proposed that aethiopicus is separate from a boisei/robustus clade).<ref name=\"WoodConstantino\">{{cite journal |author1=Wood, Bernard |author2=Constantino, Paul |date=January 2007 |title=Paranthropus boisei: Fifty Years of Evidence and Analysis. |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]] |pmid=18046746 |volume=Suppl 45 |issue=6680 |pages=106\u2013132 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20732|url=https://mds.marshall.edu/bio_sciences_faculty/37 }}</ref>\n\n==Evolutionary role==\nThe fossil record seems to indicate that ''Australopithecus'' is the common ancestor of the distinct group of hominids now called ''[[Paranthropus]]'' (the \"robust australopiths\"), and most likely the genus ''Homo'', which includes modern humans. Although the intelligence of these early hominids was likely no more sophisticated than in modern apes, the bipedal stature is the key element that distinguishes the group from previous primates, which were [[quadrupeds]]. The morphology of ''Australopithecus'' upset what scientists previously believed \u2014 namely, that strongly increased brain size had preceded bipedalism.\n\nIf ''A. afarensis'' was the definite hominid that left the footprints at [[Laetoli]], that strengthens the notion that ''A. afarensis'' had a small brain, but was a biped. Fossil evidence such as this makes it clear that bipedalism far predated large brains. However, it remains a matter of controversy as to how bipedalism first emerged (several concepts are still being studied). The advantages of bipedalism were that it left the hands free to grasp objects (e.g., carry food and young), and allowed the eyes to look over tall grasses for possible food sources or predators. However, many anthropologists argue that these advantages were not large enough to cause the emergence of bipedalism.\n\nA recent study of primate evolution and morphology noted that all apes, both modern and fossil, show skeletal adaptations to erect posture of the trunk, and that fossils such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggested that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Studies of modern [[orangutan]]s in [[Sumatra]] have shown that these apes use four legs when walking on large, stable branches, and swing underneath slightly smaller branches, but are bipedal and keep their legs very straight when walking on multiple flexible branches under 4&nbsp;cm diameter, while also using their arms for balance and additional support.

Their molars were parallel, like those of great apes, and they had a slight pre-canine diastema. But, their canines were smaller, like modern humans, and with the teeth less interlocked than in previous hominins. In fact, in some australopithecines the canines are shaped more like incisors.<ref name=\"Kay1985\">Kay, R.F., 1985, 'DENTAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DIET OF ''AUSTRALOPITHECUS''<nowiki/>', ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', 14, pp. 315-341.</ref>\n\nThe molars of ''Australopithicus'' fit together in much the same way human's do, with low crowns and four low, rounded cusps used for crushing.

It is possible that they had more tough, fibrous plant material in their diets while the smaller species of ''Australopithecus'' had more meat. But it is also possibly due to their generally larger build requiring more food. Their larger molars do support a slightly different diet, including some hard food.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nAustralopithecines also had thick enamel, like those in genus ''Homo'', while other great apes have markedly thinner enamel. One explanation for the thicker enamel is that these hominins were living more on the ground than in the trees and were foraging for tubers, nuts, and cereal grains. They would also have been eating a lot of gritty dirt with the food, which would wear at enamel, so thicker enamel would be advantageous. Or, it could simply indicate a change in diet. Robust australopithecines wore their molar surfaces down flat, unlike the more gracile species, who kept their crests, which certainly seems to suggest a different diet. The gracile ''Australopithecus'' had larger incisors, which indicates tearing and more meat in the diet, likely scavenged. The wear patterns on the tooth surfaces support a largely herbivorous diet.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nWhen we examine the buccal microwear patterns on the teeth of ''A. afarensis'' and ''A. anamensis'', we see that ''A. afarensis'' did not consume a lot of grasses or seeds, but rather ate fruits and leaves, but ''A. anamensis'' did eat grasses and seeds in addition to fruits and leaves.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mart\u00ednez | first1 = L. | last2 = Estebaranz-S\u00e1nchez | first2 = F. | last3 = Galbany | first3 = J. | last4 = P\u00e9rez-P\u00e9rez | first4 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Testing Dietary Hypotheses of East African Hominines Using Buccal Dental Microwear Data | url = | journal = [[PLOS One]] | volume = 11 | issue = 11| pages = 1\u201325 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0165447 | pmid = 27851745 | pmc = 5112956 }}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\n[[Image:A.afarensis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Artistic interpretation of ''Australopithecus afarensis'']]\nIn a 1979 preliminary microwear study of ''Australopithecus'' fossil teeth, anthropologist Alan Walker theorized that robust australopiths were largely [[frugivorous]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Billings, Tom |accessdate=2007-01-06 |title=Humanity's Evolutionary Prehistoric Diet and Ape Diets--continued, Part D) |url= http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview1d.shtml#microwear%20studies| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070108045411/http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview1d.shtml| archivedate= 8 January 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''Australopithecus'' species mainly ate fruit, vegetables, small lizards, and tubers.

In reviewing both the literature and fossil record in 2007 Wood and Constantino recognised two competing hypotheses, one that aethiopicus, boisei and robustus are a distinct [[clade]] with boisei and robustus evolving from aethiopicus. The second is that there was some parallel evolution of two distinct lines, with boisei evolving from aethiopicus, but robustus evolving separately from A. Africanus.

Although the intelligence of these early hominids was likely no more sophisticated than in modern apes, the bipedal stature is the key element that distinguishes the group from previous primates, which were [[quadrupeds]]. The morphology of ''Australopithecus'' upset what scientists previously believed \u2014 namely, that strongly increased brain size had preceded bipedalism.\n\nIf ''A. afarensis'' was the definite hominid that left the footprints at [[Laetoli]], that strengthens the notion that ''A. afarensis'' had a small brain, but was a biped. Fossil evidence such as this makes it clear that bipedalism far predated large brains. However, it remains a matter of controversy as to how bipedalism first emerged (several concepts are still being studied). The advantages of bipedalism were that it left the hands free to grasp objects (e.g., carry food and young), and allowed the eyes to look over tall grasses for possible food sources or predators. However, many anthropologists argue that these advantages were not large enough to cause the emergence of bipedalism.\n\nA recent study of primate evolution and morphology noted that all apes, both modern and fossil, show skeletal adaptations to erect posture of the trunk, and that fossils such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggested that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Studies of modern [[orangutan]]s in [[Sumatra]] have shown that these apes use four legs when walking on large, stable branches, and swing underneath slightly smaller branches, but are bipedal and keep their legs very straight when walking on multiple flexible branches under 4&nbsp;cm diameter, while also using their arms for balance and additional support. This enables them to get nearer to the edge of the tree canopy to get fruit or cross to another tree.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thorpe |first1=SK |last2=Holder |first2=RL |last3=Crompton |first3=RH. |year=2007 |title=Origin of human bipedalism as an adaptation for locomotion on flexible branches |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=316 |issue=5829| pages=1328\u201331 |pmid=17540902 |doi=10.1126/science.1140799|bibcode=2007Sci...316.1328T }}</ref>\n\nThe ancestors of [[gorilla]]s and [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s are suggested to have become more specialised in climbing vertical tree trunks, using a bent hip and bent knee posture that matches the knuckle-walking posture they use for ground travel.

But, their canines were smaller, like modern humans, and with the teeth less interlocked than in previous hominins. In fact, in some australopithecines the canines are shaped more like incisors.<ref name=\"Kay1985\">Kay, R.F., 1985, 'DENTAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DIET OF ''AUSTRALOPITHECUS''<nowiki/>', ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', 14, pp. 315-341.</ref>\n\nThe molars of ''Australopithicus'' fit together in much the same way human's do, with low crowns and four low, rounded cusps used for crushing.

It is possible that they had more tough, fibrous plant material in their diets while the smaller species of ''Australopithecus'' had more meat. But it is also possibly due to their generally larger build requiring more food. Their larger molars do support a slightly different diet, including some hard food.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nAustralopithecines also had thick enamel, like those in genus ''Homo'', while other great apes have markedly thinner enamel. One explanation for the thicker enamel is that these hominins were living more on the ground than in the trees and were foraging for tubers, nuts, and cereal grains. They would also have been eating a lot of gritty dirt with the food, which would wear at enamel, so thicker enamel would be advantageous. Or, it could simply indicate a change in diet. Robust australopithecines wore their molar surfaces down flat, unlike the more gracile species, who kept their crests, which certainly seems to suggest a different diet. The gracile ''Australopithecus'' had larger incisors, which indicates tearing and more meat in the diet, likely scavenged. The wear patterns on the tooth surfaces support a largely herbivorous diet.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nWhen we examine the buccal microwear patterns on the teeth of ''A. afarensis'' and ''A. anamensis'', we see that ''A. afarensis'' did not consume a lot of grasses or seeds, but rather ate fruits and leaves, but ''A. anamensis'' did eat grasses and seeds in addition to fruits and leaves.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mart\u00ednez | first1 = L. | last2 = Estebaranz-S\u00e1nchez | first2 = F. | last3 = Galbany | first3 = J. | last4 = P\u00e9rez-P\u00e9rez | first4 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Testing Dietary Hypotheses of East African Hominines Using Buccal Dental Microwear Data | url = | journal = [[PLOS One]] | volume = 11 | issue = 11| pages = 1\u201325 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0165447 | pmid = 27851745 | pmc = 5112956 }}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\n[[Image:A.afarensis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Artistic interpretation of ''Australopithecus afarensis'']]\nIn a 1979 preliminary microwear study of ''Australopithecus'' fossil teeth, anthropologist Alan Walker theorized that robust australopiths were largely [[frugivorous]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Billings, Tom |accessdate=2007-01-06 |title=Humanity's Evolutionary Prehistoric Diet and Ape Diets--continued, Part D) |url= http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview1d.shtml#microwear%20studies| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070108045411/http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview1d.shtml| archivedate= 8 January 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''Australopithecus'' species mainly ate fruit, vegetables, small lizards, and tubers.

By 1950, Mayr was treating ''Australopithecus'' as a species of Homo, ''Homo transvaalensis'', on the grounds that all bipedal apes should be treated as part of Homo.<ref name=\"Schwartz2015\" /> However, the contra view taken by Robinson in 1954, excluding Australopiths from Homo, became the prevalent view in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Schwartz2015\" />\n\nThe first australopithecine discovered in eastern Africa was a skull belonging to an ''A. boisei'' that was excavated in 1959 in the [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] by [[Mary Leakey]]. Since then, the Leakey family have continued to excavate the gorge, uncovering further evidence for australopithecines, as well as for ''[[Homo habilis]]'' and ''[[Homo erectus]]''.<ref name=\"historyofstudy\" /> The scientific community took 20 years to widely accept ''Australopithecus'' as a member of the family tree.\n\nThen, in 1997, an almost complete ''Australopithecus'' skeleton with skull was found in the [[Sterkfontein caves]] of [[Gauteng]], South Africa. It is now called \"Little Foot\" and it is around 3.7 million years old. It was named ''[[Australopithecus prometheus]]''<ref>BRUXELLES L., CLARKE R.
