The Latin term was borrowed from the Germanic adjective meaning \"of the people\" but, unlike it, was used ''only'' to refer to languages. In [[Early Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Western Europe]] non-native Latin was the language of science, church and administration, hence Latin ''theodiscus'' and its Germanic counterparts were used as [[antonym]]s of Latin, to refer to the \"native language spoken by the general populace\". They were subsequently used in the [[Frankish Empire]] to denote the native [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[vernacular]]s. As such, they were no longer used as antonym of Latin, but of [[Walha|''walhisk'']], a language descendant from Latin, but nevertheless the speech of the general populace as well.<ref>M.

Historical linguists have noted that the medieval \"Duche\" itself most likely shows an external [[Middle Dutch]] influence, in that it shows a [[voiced alveolar stop]] rather than the expected [[voiced dental fricative]]. This would be a logical result of the [[Medieval English wool trade]], which brought the English in close linguistic contact with the cloth merchants living in the Dutch-speaking cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], who at the time, referred to their language as ''dietsc''.<ref>P.A.F. van Veen en N. van der Sijs (1997), Etymologisch woordenboek: de herkomst van onze woorden, 2e druk, Van Dale Lexicografie, Utrecht/Antwerpen</ref>\n\nIts exact meaning is dependant on context, but tends to be vague regardless.<ref>H. Kurath: Middle English Dictionary, part 14, University of Michigan Press, 1952, 1346.</ref> When concerning language, the word ''duche'' could be used as a hypernym for several languages (The North est Contrey which lond spekyn all maner Duche tonge \u2014 The North [of Europe] is an area, in which all lands speak all manner of \"Dutch\" languages) but it could also suggest singular use (In Duche a rudder is a knyght \u2014 In \"Dutch\" a rudder [cf.

Many factors facilitated this, including close geographic proximity, trade and [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|military conflicts]].<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]</ref><ref>L. Weisgerber, Deutsch als Volksname 1953</ref> Due to the latter, \"Dutch\" also became pejorative label pinned by English speakers on almost anything they regard as inferior, irregular, or contrary to their own practice.

Generally, it referred to the Dutch, their language or the [[Dutch Republic]], but it was also used as an informal monniker (for example in the works of [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Washington Irving]]) for people who would today be considered Germans or German-speaking, most notably the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. This lingering ambiguity was most likely caused by close proximity to German-speaking immigrants, who referred to themselves or (in the case of the Pennsylvania Dutch) their language as \"Deutsch\" or \"Deitsch\".<ref>Hughes Oliphant Old: The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church, Volume 6: The Modern Age.

In the earliest sources, its primary use was to differentiate between Germanic and the Romance dialects, as expressed by the Middle Dutch poet [[Jan van Boendale]], who wrote:<ref>M. Philippa e.a.

De Grauwe: Emerging Mother-Tongue Awareness: The special case of Dutch and German in the Middle Ages and the early Modern Period (2002), p. 98-110.</ref> Apart from the sparsely populated eastern borderlands, there was little to no contact with contemporary speakers of German dialects, let alone a concept of the existence of German as language in its modern sense among the Dutch. Because medieval trade focussed on travel by water and with the most heavily populated areas adjacent to Northwestern France, the average 15th century Dutchman stood a far greater chance of hearing French or English than a dialect of the German interior, despite its relative geographical closeness.<ref>A. Duke: Dissident Identities in the Early Modern Low Countries (2016)</ref> Medieval Dutch authors had a vague, generalised sense of common linguistic roots between their language and various German dialects, but no concept of speaking the same language existed. Instead they saw their linguistic surroundings mostly in terms of small scale regiolects.<ref>L. De Grauwe: Emerging Mother-Tongue Awareness: The special case of Dutch and German in the Middle Ages and the early Modern Period (2002), p. 102.</ref>\n\nThe [[15th century]] saw the first attested use of \"Nederlandsch\" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Netherlandish, Lowlandish) alongside \"Duytsch\" (the Early Modern spelling of the earlier \"Dietsc/Duutsc\") as a term for the Dutch language and it would eventually manifest itself as the main [[ethnonym]].<ref>M. Janssen: Atlas van de Nederlandse taal: Editie Vlaanderen, Lannoo Meulenhoff, 2018, p.29.</ref> The use of \"low(er)\" or \"nether\" in describing the area now known as the Low Countries has a long historical record. In the [[13th century]] [[epic]] the [[Nibelungenlied]], written in [[Middle High German]], the protagonist [[Sigurd]] is said to hail from the city of [[Xanten]] in the \"Niderlant\", meaning the [[Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta|Rhine delta]].<ref>F. W. \n Panzer:Nibelungische Problematik: Siegfried und Xanten, 1954, p.9.</ref> In [[Old French]], the inhabitants of the Low Countries were known as the \"Avalois\", meaning \"those of the [Rhine/Scheldt/Meuse] estuary\"; compare contemporary [[French language|French]] \"en aval\" and \"[[\u00e0 vau-l'eau]]\" meaning \"downstream\". The Dukes of Burgundy referred to their Dutch possessions as \"pays d'embas\" (French: \"lower  lands\") as opposed to their higher/upper territorial possessions in Burgundy itself, which was echoed in the [[Middle French|Middle]] and [[Modern French]] \"Pays-Bas\" meaning \"Low Countries\".<ref>M. de Vries & L.A. te Winkel: [[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]], the Hague, Nijhoff, 1864-2001.</ref> \n\nIn the second half of the [[16th century]] the [[neologism]] \"Nederduytsch\" (literally: Nether-Dutch, Low-Dutch) appeared in print, in a way combining the earlier \"Duytsch\" and \"Nederlandsch\" into one compound. The term was prefered by many leading contemporary grammarians such as Balthazar Huydecoper, Arnold Moonen and Jan ten Kate because it provided a continuity with [[Middle Dutch]] (\"Duytsch\" being the evolution of medieval \"Dietsc\"), was at the time considered the  proper translation of the Roman Province of [[Germania Inferior]] (which not only encompassed much of the contemporary Dutch-speaking area / Netherlands, but also added classical prestige to the name) and amplified the dichotomy between Early Modern Dutch and the \"Dutch\" (German) dialects spoken around the [[Middle Rhine|Middle]] and [[Upper Rhine]] which had begun to be called ''overlantsch'' of ''hoogdutysch'' (literally:  Overlandish, High-\"Dutch\") by Dutch river merchants sailing upriver.<ref>G.A.R. de Smet, Die Bezeichnungen der niederl\u00e4ndischen Sprache im Laufe ihrer Geschichte; in: Rheinische Vierteljahrsbl\u00e4tter 37 (1973), p. 315-327</ref> Though \"Duytsch\" forms part of the compound in both Nederduytsch and Hoogduytsch, this should not be taken to imply that the Dutch saw their language as being especially closely related to the German dialects spoken in Southerwestern Germany. On the contrary, the term \"Hoogduytsch\" specifically came into being as a special category because Dutch travelers visiting these parts found it hard to understand the local vernacular: in a letter dated to [[1487]] a Flemish merchant from Bruges instructs his agent to conduct trade transactions in [[Freiburg]] in French, rather than the local tongue to avoid any misunderstandings.<ref>G.A.R. de Smet, Die Bezeichnungen der niederl\u00e4ndischen Sprache im Laufe ihrer Geschichte; in: Rheinische Vierteljahrsbl\u00e4tter 37 (1973), p. 315-327</ref> In [[1571]] use of \"Nederduytsch\" greatly increased because the [[Synod of Emden]] chose the name \"Nederduytsch Hervormde Kerk\" as the official designation of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. The synods choice of \"Nederduytsch\" over the more dominant \"Nederlandsch\", was inspired by the phonological similarities between \"neder-\" and \"nederig\" (the latter meaning \"humble\") and the fact that it did not contain a worldly element (\"land\"), whereas \"Nederlandsch\" did.<ref>G.A.R. de Smet, Die Bezeichnungen der niederl\u00e4ndischen Sprache im Laufe ihrer Geschichte; in: Rheinische Vierteljahrsbl\u00e4tter 37 (1973), p. 315-327</ref> \n\nAs the Dutch increasingly referred to their own language as \"Nederlandsch\" or \"Nederduytsch\", the term \"Duytsch\" became more ambiguous. Dutch [[Humanism|humanists]], started to use \"Duytsch\" in a sense which would today be called \"Germanic\", for example in a dialogue recorded in the influential Dutch grammar book \"Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst\", published in [[1584]]: \n\n{{Verse translation|lang=nl|R. ghy zeyde flux dat de Duytsche taal by haar zelven bestaat/ ick heb my wel laten segghen, \ndat onze spraack uyt het Hooghduytsch zou ghesproten zyn. \nS: Ick spreeck int ghemeen vande duytse taal, die zelve voor een taal houdende. \n|R: You've just said that the Dutch language exists in its own right, \nbut I've heard it said that our language comes from High Dutch (ie.

Initially the word \"Duytsch\" itself remained vague in exact meaning, but after the 1650s a trend emerges in which \"Duytsch\" is taken as the shorthand for \"Hooghduytsch\". This process was probably accelerated by the large number of Germans employed as agricultural day laborers and mercenary soldiers in the [[Dutch Republic]] and the ever increasing popularity of \"Nederlandsch\" and \"Nederduytsch\" over \"Duytsch\", the use of which had already been in decline for over a century, thereby acquiring its current meaning (German) in Dutch.<ref>L. De Grauwe: Emerging Mother-Tongue Awareness: The special case of Dutch and German in the Middle Ages and the early Modern Period (2002), p. 102.</ref> \n\nWhile \"Nederduytsch\" briefly eclipsed the use of \"Nederlandsch\" during the [[17th century]], it always remained a somewhat officious, literary and scholarly term among the general populace and steadily started to lose ground to \"Nederlandsch\" in print after 1700.<ref>W. de Vreese: Over de benaming onzer taal inzonderheid over \"Nederlandsch\", 1910, p. 16-27.</ref> When, in [[1815]], the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was proclaimed, it was specifically noted that the official language of the kingdom was \"Nederlandsch\" and that the Dutch Reformed Church, as the official [[State Church]], would be known as the \"Nederlandsch Hervormde Kerk\" resulting in a profound drop in the already declining use of the word. The Dutch-speaking [[Cape Colony]] came under British control two years prior in [[1814]], resulting in the continued use of \"nederduytsch\" by the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa]] in its official nomenclature to the present day.

Initially this group comprised of Dutch, [[English language|English]], [[Low German]] and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], but in modern scholarship only refers to [[Low German]]-varieties. Hence in contemporary Dutch, \"Nederduits\" is used to describe Low German varieties, specifically those spoken in Northern Germany as the varieties spoken in the eastern Netherlands, while related, are referred to as \"Nedersaksisch\".<ref>M. Janssen: Atlas van de Nederlandse taal: Editie Vlaanderen, Lannoo Meulenhoff, 2018, p. 82.</ref> Likewise in the 19th century, the term \"Diets\" was revived by Dutch linguists and historians as a poetic name for [[Middle Dutch]] and [[Middle Dutch literature|its literature]].<ref>M.

In 788, the Annals of the Frankish Kingdom report the punishment of a [[Bavaria]]n [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria|duke]]: \"quod theodisca lingua herisliz dictum\", meaning \"known in the language of the people as herisliz\". ''Herisliz''  is a German word now obsolete: the \"slicing\", i.e. tearing apart of the \"[[army|Heer]]\" ([[Desertion]]).<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [diets]</ref>\n\nIn German dialects, a large amount of forms of \"theodiscus\" existed throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and which all referred to either the broader Romance/Germanic [[dichotomy]] in the West and South or the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]/Germanic bipartition in the East. In [[Old High German]] both ''diutisk'' and ''diutisc'' are known, that developed in [[Middle High German]] as ''diutsc''. In [[Middle Low German]] it was known as ''{{wikt-lang|de|d\u00fcdesch}}'' and [[Low German|Modern Low German]] as ''{{wikt-lang|de|d\u00fctsch}}''. However, in German, the use of the term referring to Germans specifically as opposed to people speaking Germanic languages in general evolves during the [[Early Modern Period]] and it is in the late 17th and 18th century that the modern meaning of ''{{wikt-lang|de|deutsch|Deutsch}}'' is established.<ref>L.

A well known example are the ''[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]'', who are not of Dutch descent but originally German immigrants, and speak not Dutch but a German dialect and refer to themselves as ''{{wikt-lang|de|deitsch|Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch}}''.<ref>The Pennsylvania Dutch Country, by I.

Historical linguists have noted that the medieval \"Duche\" itself most likely shows an external [[Middle Dutch]] influence, in that it shows a [[voiced alveolar stop]] rather than the expected [[voiced dental fricative]]. This would be a logical result of the [[Medieval English wool trade]], which brought the English in close linguistic contact with the cloth merchants living in the Dutch-speaking cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], who at the time, referred to their language as ''dietsc''.<ref>P.A.F. van Veen en N. van der Sijs (1997), Etymologisch woordenboek: de herkomst van onze woorden, 2e druk, Van Dale Lexicografie, Utrecht/Antwerpen</ref>\n\nIts exact meaning is dependant on context, but tends to be vague regardless.<ref>H. Kurath: Middle English Dictionary, part 14, University of Michigan Press, 1952, 1346.</ref> When concerning language, the word ''duche'' could be used as a hypernym for several languages (The North est Contrey which lond spekyn all maner Duche tonge \u2014 The North [of Europe] is an area, in which all lands speak all manner of \"Dutch\" languages) but it could also suggest singular use (In Duche a rudder is a knyght \u2014 In \"Dutch\" a rudder [cf.

Many factors facilitated this, including close geographic proximity, trade and [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|military conflicts]].<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]</ref><ref>L.

Generally, it referred to the Dutch, their language or the [[Dutch Republic]], but it was also used as an informal monniker (for example in the works of [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Washington Irving]]) for people who would today be considered Germans or German-speaking, most notably the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. This lingering ambiguity was most likely caused by close proximity to German-speaking immigrants, who referred to themselves or (in the case of the Pennsylvania Dutch) their language as \"Deutsch\" or \"Deitsch\".<ref>Hughes Oliphant Old: The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church, Volume 6: The Modern Age.

Because medieval trade focussed on travel by water and with the most heavily populated areas adjacent to Northwestern France, the average 15th century Dutchman stood a far greater chance of hearing French or English than a dialect of the German interior, despite its relative geographical closeness.<ref>A. Duke: Dissident Identities in the Early Modern Low Countries (2016)</ref> Medieval Dutch authors had a vague, generalised sense of common linguistic roots between their language and various German dialects, but no concept of speaking the same language existed. Instead they saw their linguistic surroundings mostly in terms of small scale regiolects.<ref>L. De Grauwe: Emerging Mother-Tongue Awareness: The special case of Dutch and German in the Middle Ages and the early Modern Period (2002), p. 102.</ref>\n\nThe [[15th century]] saw the first attested use of \"Nederlandsch\" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Netherlandish, Lowlandish) alongside \"Duytsch\" (the Early Modern spelling of the earlier \"Dietsc/Duutsc\") as a term for the Dutch language and it would eventually manifest itself as the main [[ethnonym]].<ref>M. Janssen: Atlas van de Nederlandse taal: Editie Vlaanderen, Lannoo Meulenhoff, 2018, p.29.</ref> The use of \"low(er)\" or \"nether\" in describing the area now known as the Low Countries has a long historical record. In the [[13th century]] [[epic]] the [[Nibelungenlied]], written in [[Middle High German]], the protagonist [[Sigurd]] is said to hail from the city of [[Xanten]] in the \"Niderlant\", meaning the [[Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta|Rhine delta]].<ref>F. W. \n Panzer:Nibelungische Problematik: Siegfried und Xanten, 1954, p.9.</ref> In [[Old French]], the inhabitants of the Low Countries were known as the \"Avalois\", meaning \"those of the [Rhine/Scheldt/Meuse] estuary\"; compare contemporary [[French language|French]] \"en aval\" and \"[[\u00e0 vau-l'eau]]\" meaning \"downstream\". The Dukes of Burgundy referred to their Dutch possessions as \"pays d'embas\" (French: \"lower  lands\") as opposed to their higher/upper territorial possessions in Burgundy itself, which was echoed in the [[Middle French|Middle]] and [[Modern French]] \"Pays-Bas\" meaning \"Low Countries\".<ref>M. de Vries & L.A. te Winkel: [[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]], the Hague, Nijhoff, 1864-2001.</ref> \n\nIn the second half of the [[16th century]] the [[neologism]] \"Nederduytsch\" (literally: Nether-Dutch, Low-Dutch) appeared in print, in a way combining the earlier \"Duytsch\" and \"Nederlandsch\" into one compound. The term was prefered by many leading contemporary grammarians such as Balthazar Huydecoper, Arnold Moonen and Jan ten Kate because it provided a continuity with [[Middle Dutch]] (\"Duytsch\" being the evolution of medieval \"Dietsc\"), was at the time considered the  proper translation of the Roman Province of [[Germania Inferior]] (which not only encompassed much of the contemporary Dutch-speaking area / Netherlands, but also added classical prestige to the name) and amplified the dichotomy between Early Modern Dutch and the \"Dutch\" (German) dialects spoken around the [[Middle Rhine|Middle]] and [[Upper Rhine]] which had begun to be called ''overlantsch'' of ''hoogdutysch'' (literally:  Overlandish, High-\"Dutch\") by Dutch river merchants sailing upriver.<ref>G.A.R. de Smet, Die Bezeichnungen der niederl\u00e4ndischen Sprache im Laufe ihrer Geschichte; in: Rheinische Vierteljahrsbl\u00e4tter 37 (1973), p. 315-327</ref> Though \"Duytsch\" forms part of the compound in both Nederduytsch and Hoogduytsch, this should not be taken to imply that the Dutch saw their language as being especially closely related to the German dialects spoken in Southerwestern Germany. On the contrary, the term \"Hoogduytsch\" specifically came into being as a special category because Dutch travelers visiting these parts found it hard to understand the local vernacular: in a letter dated to [[1487]] a Flemish merchant from Bruges instructs his agent to conduct trade transactions in [[Freiburg]] in French, rather than the local tongue to avoid any misunderstandings.<ref>G.A.R. de Smet, Die Bezeichnungen der niederl\u00e4ndischen Sprache im Laufe ihrer Geschichte; in: Rheinische Vierteljahrsbl\u00e4tter 37 (1973), p. 315-327</ref> In [[1571]] use of \"Nederduytsch\" greatly increased because the [[Synod of Emden]] chose the name \"Nederduytsch Hervormde Kerk\" as the official designation of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. The synods choice of \"Nederduytsch\" over the more dominant \"Nederlandsch\", was inspired by the phonological similarities between \"neder-\" and \"nederig\" (the latter meaning \"humble\") and the fact that it did not contain a worldly element (\"land\"), whereas \"Nederlandsch\" did.<ref>G.A.R. de Smet, Die Bezeichnungen der niederl\u00e4ndischen Sprache im Laufe ihrer Geschichte; in: Rheinische Vierteljahrsbl\u00e4tter 37 (1973), p. 315-327</ref> \n\nAs the Dutch increasingly referred to their own language as \"Nederlandsch\" or \"Nederduytsch\", the term \"Duytsch\" became more ambiguous. Dutch [[Humanism|humanists]], started to use \"Duytsch\" in a sense which would today be called \"Germanic\", for example in a dialogue recorded in the influential Dutch grammar book \"Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst\", published in [[1584]]: \n\n{{Verse translation|lang=nl|R. ghy zeyde flux dat de Duytsche taal by haar zelven bestaat/ ick heb my wel laten segghen, \ndat onze spraack uyt het Hooghduytsch zou ghesproten zyn. \nS: Ick spreeck int ghemeen vande duytse taal, die zelve voor een taal houdende. \n|R: You've just said that the Dutch language exists in its own right, \nbut I've heard it said that our language comes from High Dutch (ie.

Initially the word \"Duytsch\" itself remained vague in exact meaning, but after the 1650s a trend emerges in which \"Duytsch\" is taken as the shorthand for \"Hooghduytsch\". This process was probably accelerated by the large number of Germans employed as agricultural day laborers and mercenary soldiers in the [[Dutch Republic]] and the ever increasing popularity of \"Nederlandsch\" and \"Nederduytsch\" over \"Duytsch\", the use of which had already been in decline for over a century, thereby acquiring its current meaning (German) in Dutch.<ref>L.

The Dutch-speaking [[Cape Colony]] came under British control two years prior in [[1814]], resulting in the continued use of \"nederduytsch\" by the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa]] in its official nomenclature to the present day.

Hence in contemporary Dutch, \"Nederduits\" is used to describe Low German varieties, specifically those spoken in Northern Germany as the varieties spoken in the eastern Netherlands, while related, are referred to as \"Nedersaksisch\".<ref>M. Janssen: Atlas van de Nederlandse taal: Editie Vlaanderen, Lannoo Meulenhoff, 2018, p. 82.</ref> Likewise in the 19th century, the term \"Diets\" was revived by Dutch linguists and historians as a poetic name for [[Middle Dutch]] and [[Middle Dutch literature|its literature]].<ref>M. Janssen: Atlas van de Nederlandse taal: Editie Vlaanderen, Lannoo Meulenhoff, 2018, p. 30.</ref>\n\n== Semantic development within German==\nThe second recorded use of \"theodisca\" as a reference to a Germanic language was [[Old High German]]. In 788, the Annals of the Frankish Kingdom report the punishment of a [[Bavaria]]n [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria|duke]]: \"quod theodisca lingua herisliz dictum\", meaning \"known in the language of the people as herisliz\". ''Herisliz''  is a German word now obsolete: the \"slicing\", i.e. tearing apart of the \"[[army|Heer]]\" ([[Desertion]]).<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [diets]</ref>\n\nIn German dialects, a large amount of forms of \"theodiscus\" existed throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and which all referred to either the broader Romance/Germanic [[dichotomy]] in the West and South or the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]/Germanic bipartition in the East. In [[Old High German]] both ''diutisk'' and ''diutisc'' are known, that developed in [[Middle High German]] as ''diutsc''. In [[Middle Low German]] it was known as ''{{wikt-lang|de|d\u00fcdesch}}'' and [[Low German|Modern Low German]] as ''{{wikt-lang|de|d\u00fctsch}}''. However, in German, the use of the term referring to Germans specifically as opposed to people speaking Germanic languages in general evolves during the [[Early Modern Period]] and it is in the late 17th and 18th century that the modern meaning of ''{{wikt-lang|de|deutsch|Deutsch}}'' is established.<ref>L. Weisgerber, Deutsch als Volksname 1953</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]] the German [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] ''Deutsch'' would sometimes be rendered as ''Dutch'', due to the perceived similar pronunciation of both words and also due to the fact that, early on, ''Dutch'' was not reserved only for the people of the [[Netherlands]] but for any Germanic speakers from the Continent. A well known example are the ''[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]'', who are not of Dutch descent but originally German immigrants, and speak not Dutch but a German dialect and refer to themselves as ''{{wikt-lang|de|deitsch|Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch}}''.<ref>The Pennsylvania Dutch Country, by I. Richman, 2004: \"Taking the name Pennsylvania Dutch from a corruption of their own word for themselves, \"Deutsch,\" the first German settlers arrived in Pennsylvania in 1683. By the time of the American Revolution, their influence was such that Benjamin Franklin, among others, worried that German would become the commonwealth's official language.\"</ref><ref>Moon Spotlight Pennsylvania Dutch Country, by A.

However, two years of severe drought in 1965 and 1966 convinced India to reform its agricultural policy and that they could not rely on foreign aid and imports for food security. India adopted significant policy reforms focused on the goal of food grain self-sufficiency. This ushered in India's [[Green Revolution]]. It began with the decision to adopt superior yielding, disease resistant wheat varieties in combination with better farming knowledge to improve productivity. The state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] led India's [[Green Revolution|green revolution]] and earned the distinction of being the country's bread basket.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2004, Punjab |date=2004 |author=[[Government of Punjab, India|The Government of Punjab]] |accessdate=9 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708073911/http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf| archivedate= 8 July 2011 | url-status= live}} Section: \"The Green Revolution\", pp. 17\u201320.</ref>\n\nThe initial increase in production was centred on the irrigated areas of the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]] and western [[Uttar Pradesh]]. With the farmers and the government officials focusing on farm productivity and knowledge transfer, India's total food grain production soared. A hectare of Indian wheat farm that produced an average of 0.8 tonnes in 1948, produced 4.7 tonnes of wheat in 1975 from the same land. Such rapid growth in farm productivity enabled India to become self-sufficient by the 1970s. It also empowered the smallholder farmers to seek further means to increase food staples produced per hectare. By 2000, Indian farms were adopting wheat varieties capable of yielding 6 tonnes of wheat per hectare.<ref name=fao1a>{{cite web|title=Rapid growth of select Asian economies|year=2009|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/ag087e/AG087E05.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Brief history of wheat improvement in India|year=2011|publisher=Directorate of Wheat Research, ICAR India|url=http://www.dwr.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=116}}</ref>\n[[File:Sunflower farm, Agriculture in India, January 2013.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sunflower farm in Lepakshi, Andhra Pradesh.]]\nWith agricultural policy success in wheat, India's Green Revolution technology spread to rice. However, since irrigation infrastructure was very poor, Indian farmers innovated with tube-wells, to harvest [[ground water]]. When gains from the new technology reached their limits in the states of initial adoption, the technology spread in the 1970s and 1980s to the states of eastern India \u2014 [[Bihar]], [[Odisha]] and [[West Bengal]]. The lasting benefits of the improved seeds and new technology extended principally to the irrigated areas which account for about one-third of the harvested crop area. In the 1980s, Indian agriculture policy shifted to \"evolution of a production pattern in line with the demand pattern\" leading to a shift in emphasis to other agricultural commodities like oil seed, fruit and vegetables. Farmers began adopting improved methods and technologies in dairying, fisheries and livestock, and meeting the diversified food needs of a growing population.\n\nAs with rice, the lasting benefits of improved seeds and improved farming technologies now largely depends on whether India develops infrastructure such as irrigation network, flood control systems, reliable electricity production capacity, all-season rural and urban highways, cold storage to prevent spoilage, modern retail, and competitive buyers of produce from Indian farmers. This is increasingly the focus of Indian agriculture policy.\n\nIndia ranks 74 out of 113 major countries in terms of [[Global food security index|food security index]].<ref name=\"India: Global Food Security Index\"/> India's agricultural economy is undergoing structural changes. Between 1970 and 2011, the GDP share of agriculture has fallen from 43% to 16%. This isn't because of reduced importance of agriculture or a consequence of agricultural policy. This is largely because of the rapid economic growth in services, industrial output, and non-agricultural sectors in India between 2000 and 2010.\n\nAgricultural scientist [[MS Swaminathan]] has played a vital role in the green revolution. In 2013 NDTV awarded him as 25 living legend of India for outstanding contribution to agriculture and making India a food sovereign country.\n[[File:Buckingham Canal near KL University.JPG|alt=|thumb|An irrigation canal in Punjab.

Corresponding analyses for the index of total agricultural production show a similar pattern, with the growth rate for 1994\u20132000 attaining only 1.5% per annum.<ref>{{cite web|title=SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN INDIA: FOOD SECURITY AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY|year=2003|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/005/ac484e/ac484e00.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe biggest problem of farmers is the low price for their farm produce. A recent study showed that proper pricing based on energy of production and equating farming wages to Industrial wages may be beneficial for the farmers.<ref>[https://www.thebetterindia.com/107507/bring-cheer-farming-community-giving-produce-proper-price/ How much should a fair price of farmer's produce be?]</ref>\n\n===Infrastructure===\nIndia has very poor rural roads affecting timely supply of inputs and timely transfer of outputs from Indian farms. Irrigation systems are inadequate, leading to crop failures in some parts of the country because of lack of water. In other areas regional floods, poor seed quality and inefficient farming practices, lack of cold storage and harvest spoilage cause over 30% of farmer's produce going to waste, lack of [[Retailing in India|organised retail]] and competing buyers thereby limiting Indian farmer's ability to sell the surplus and commercial crops.\n\nThe Indian farmer receives just 10% to 23% of the price the Indian consumer pays for exactly the same produce, the difference going to losses, inefficiencies and middlemen. Farmers in developed economies of Europe and the United States receive 64% to 81%.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Productivity===\nAlthough India has attained self-sufficiency in food staples, the productivity of its farms is below that of Brazil, the United States, France and other nations. Indian [[wheat]] farms, for example, produce about a third of the wheat per hectare per year compared to farms in France. Rice productivity in India was less than half that of China. Other staples productivity in India is similarly low. Indian [[total factor productivity]] growth remains below 2% per annum; in contrast, China's total factor productivity growths is about 6% per annum, even though China also has smallholding farmers. Several studies suggest India could eradicate its hunger and malnutrition and be a major source of food for the world by achieving productivity comparable with other countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nBy contrast, Indian farms in some regions post the best yields, for sugarcane, cassava and tea crops.<ref>[http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor Production Crops \u2013 Yield by Country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114151638/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 |date=14 January 2013 }}, FAO United Nations 2011</ref>\n\nCrop yields vary significantly between Indian states. Some states produce two to three times more grain per acre than others.\n\nAs the map shows, the traditional regions of high agricultural productivity in India are the north west (Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh), coastal districts on both coasts, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. In recent years, the states of Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh in central India and Gujarat in the west have shown rapid agricultural growth.<ref>{{cite report |author=Ashok Gulati |author2=Pallavi Rajkhowa |author3=Pravesh Sharma |date=April 2017|title= Making Rapid Strides- Agriculture in Madhya Pradesh: Sources, Drivers, and Policy Lessons|url= http://icrier.org/pdf/Working_Paper_339.pdf|publisher= ICRIER|page= 9|access-date= 11 January 2019|quote= \"Figure 8: State-wise Agriculture Growth Rate (2005\u201306 to 2014\u201315)\"}}</ref>\n\nThe table compares the statewide average yields for a few major agricultural crops in India, for 2001\u20132002.<ref name=ap1/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |-\n !

No single state of India is best in every crop. Tamil Nadu achieved highest yields in rice and sugarcane, [[Haryana]] in wheat and coarse grains, Karnataka in cotton, Bihar in pulses, while other states do well in horticulture, aquaculture, flower and fruit plantations. These differences in agricultural productivity are a function of local infrastructure, soil quality, micro-climates, local resources, farmer knowledge and innovations.<ref name=ap1/>\n\nThe Indian food distribution system is highly inefficient. Movement of agricultural produce is heavily regulated, with inter-state and even inter-district restrictions on marketing and movement of agricultural goods.<ref name=ap1/>\n\nOne study suggests Indian agricultural policy should best focus on improving rural infrastructure primarily in the form of irrigation and flood control infrastructure, knowledge transfer of better yielding and more disease resistant seeds. Additionally, cold storage, hygienic food packaging and efficient modern retail to reduce waste can improve output and rural incomes.<ref name=ap1/>\n\nThe low productivity in India is a result of the following factors:\n* The average size of land holdings is very small (less than 2 hectares) and is subject to fragmentation due to land ceiling acts, and in some cases, family disputes. Such small holdings are often over-manned, resulting in disguised unemployment and low productivity of labour. Some reports claim smallholder farming may not be cause of poor productivity, since the productivity is higher in China and many developing economies even though China smallholder farmers constitute over 97% of its farming population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rapid growth of select Asian economies|year=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/ag087e/ag087e00.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> A Chinese smallholder farmer is able to rent his land to larger farmers, China's organised retail and extensive Chinese highways are able to provide the incentive and infrastructure necessary to its farmers for sharp increases in farm productivity.\n* Adoption of modern agricultural practices and use of [[Agricultural machinery|technology]] is inadequate in comparison with Green Revolution methods and technologies, hampered by ignorance of such practices, high costs and impracticality in the case of small land holdings.\n* According to the [[World Bank]], Indian branch's ''Priorities for Agriculture and Rural Development'', India's large [[agricultural subsidies]] are hampering productivity-enhancing investment. This evaluation is based largely on a productivity agenda and does not take any ecological implications into account.

Indian population has tripled, and food-grain production more than quadrupled. There has been a substantial increase in available food-grain per capita.\n[[File:Rice fields water tank in punjab.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|The state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] led India's [[Green Revolution]] and earned the distinction of being the country's bread basket.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2004, Punjab |date=2004 |author=[[Government of Punjab, India|The Government of Punjab]] |accessdate=9 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708073911/http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf| archivedate= 8 July 2011 | url-status= live}} Section: \"The Green Revolution\", pp. 17\u201320.</ref>]]\nBefore the mid-1960s India relied on imports and food aid to meet domestic requirements. However, two years of severe drought in 1965 and 1966 convinced India to reform its agricultural policy and that they could not rely on foreign aid and imports for food security. India adopted significant policy reforms focused on the goal of food grain self-sufficiency. This ushered in India's [[Green Revolution]]. It began with the decision to adopt superior yielding, disease resistant wheat varieties in combination with better farming knowledge to improve productivity. The state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] led India's [[Green Revolution|green revolution]] and earned the distinction of being the country's bread basket.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2004, Punjab |date=2004 |author=[[Government of Punjab, India|The Government of Punjab]] |accessdate=9 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708073911/http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf| archivedate= 8 July 2011 | url-status= live}} Section: \"The Green Revolution\", pp. 17\u201320.</ref>\n\nThe initial increase in production was centred on the irrigated areas of the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]] and western [[Uttar Pradesh]]. With the farmers and the government officials focusing on farm productivity and knowledge transfer, India's total food grain production soared. A hectare of Indian wheat farm that produced an average of 0.8 tonnes in 1948, produced 4.7 tonnes of wheat in 1975 from the same land. Such rapid growth in farm productivity enabled India to become self-sufficient by the 1970s. It also empowered the smallholder farmers to seek further means to increase food staples produced per hectare. By 2000, Indian farms were adopting wheat varieties capable of yielding 6 tonnes of wheat per hectare.<ref name=fao1a>{{cite web|title=Rapid growth of select Asian economies|year=2009|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/ag087e/AG087E05.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Brief history of wheat improvement in India|year=2011|publisher=Directorate of Wheat Research, ICAR India|url=http://www.dwr.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=116}}</ref>\n[[File:Sunflower farm, Agriculture in India, January 2013.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sunflower farm in Lepakshi, Andhra Pradesh.]]\nWith agricultural policy success in wheat, India's Green Revolution technology spread to rice. However, since irrigation infrastructure was very poor, Indian farmers innovated with tube-wells, to harvest [[ground water]]. When gains from the new technology reached their limits in the states of initial adoption, the technology spread in the 1970s and 1980s to the states of eastern India \u2014 [[Bihar]], [[Odisha]] and [[West Bengal]]. The lasting benefits of the improved seeds and new technology extended principally to the irrigated areas which account for about one-third of the harvested crop area. In the 1980s, Indian agriculture policy shifted to \"evolution of a production pattern in line with the demand pattern\" leading to a shift in emphasis to other agricultural commodities like oil seed, fruit and vegetables. Farmers began adopting improved methods and technologies in dairying, fisheries and livestock, and meeting the diversified food needs of a growing population.\n\nAs with rice, the lasting benefits of improved seeds and improved farming technologies now largely depends on whether India develops infrastructure such as irrigation network, flood control systems, reliable electricity production capacity, all-season rural and urban highways, cold storage to prevent spoilage, modern retail, and competitive buyers of produce from Indian farmers. This is increasingly the focus of Indian agriculture policy.\n\nIndia ranks 74 out of 113 major countries in terms of [[Global food security index|food security index]].<ref name=\"India: Global Food Security Index\"/> India's agricultural economy is undergoing structural changes. Between 1970 and 2011, the GDP share of agriculture has fallen from 43% to 16%. This isn't because of reduced importance of agriculture or a consequence of agricultural policy. This is largely because of the rapid economic growth in services, industrial output, and non-agricultural sectors in India between 2000 and 2010.\n\nAgricultural scientist [[MS Swaminathan]] has played a vital role in the green revolution. In 2013 NDTV awarded him as 25 living legend of India for outstanding contribution to agriculture and making India a food sovereign country.\n[[File:Buckingham Canal near KL University.JPG|alt=|thumb|An irrigation canal in Punjab.

Corresponding analyses for the index of total agricultural production show a similar pattern, with the growth rate for 1994\u20132000 attaining only 1.5% per annum.<ref>{{cite web|title=SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN INDIA: FOOD SECURITY AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY|year=2003|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/005/ac484e/ac484e00.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe biggest problem of farmers is the low price for their farm produce. A recent study showed that proper pricing based on energy of production and equating farming wages to Industrial wages may be beneficial for the farmers.<ref>[https://www.thebetterindia.com/107507/bring-cheer-farming-community-giving-produce-proper-price/ How much should a fair price of farmer's produce be?]</ref>\n\n===Infrastructure===\nIndia has very poor rural roads affecting timely supply of inputs and timely transfer of outputs from Indian farms. Irrigation systems are inadequate, leading to crop failures in some parts of the country because of lack of water. In other areas regional floods, poor seed quality and inefficient farming practices, lack of cold storage and harvest spoilage cause over 30% of farmer's produce going to waste, lack of [[Retailing in India|organised retail]] and competing buyers thereby limiting Indian farmer's ability to sell the surplus and commercial crops.\n\nThe Indian farmer receives just 10% to 23% of the price the Indian consumer pays for exactly the same produce, the difference going to losses, inefficiencies and middlemen. Farmers in developed economies of Europe and the United States receive 64% to 81%.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Productivity===\nAlthough India has attained self-sufficiency in food staples, the productivity of its farms is below that of Brazil, the United States, France and other nations. Indian [[wheat]] farms, for example, produce about a third of the wheat per hectare per year compared to farms in France. Rice productivity in India was less than half that of China. Other staples productivity in India is similarly low. Indian [[total factor productivity]] growth remains below 2% per annum; in contrast, China's total factor productivity growths is about 6% per annum, even though China also has smallholding farmers. Several studies suggest India could eradicate its hunger and malnutrition and be a major source of food for the world by achieving productivity comparable with other countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nBy contrast, Indian farms in some regions post the best yields, for sugarcane, cassava and tea crops.<ref>[http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor Production Crops \u2013 Yield by Country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114151638/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 |date=14 January 2013 }}, FAO United Nations 2011</ref>\n\nCrop yields vary significantly between Indian states. Some states produce two to three times more grain per acre than others.\n\nAs the map shows, the traditional regions of high agricultural productivity in India are the north west (Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh), coastal districts on both coasts, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.

No single state of India is best in every crop. Tamil Nadu achieved highest yields in rice and sugarcane, [[Haryana]] in wheat and coarse grains, Karnataka in cotton, Bihar in pulses, while other states do well in horticulture, aquaculture, flower and fruit plantations. These differences in agricultural productivity are a function of local infrastructure, soil quality, micro-climates, local resources, farmer knowledge and innovations.<ref name=ap1/>\n\nThe Indian food distribution system is highly inefficient. Movement of agricultural produce is heavily regulated, with inter-state and even inter-district restrictions on marketing and movement of agricultural goods.<ref name=ap1/>\n\nOne study suggests Indian agricultural policy should best focus on improving rural infrastructure primarily in the form of irrigation and flood control infrastructure, knowledge transfer of better yielding and more disease resistant seeds. Additionally, cold storage, hygienic food packaging and efficient modern retail to reduce waste can improve output and rural incomes.<ref name=ap1/>\n\nThe low productivity in India is a result of the following factors:\n* The average size of land holdings is very small (less than 2 hectares) and is subject to fragmentation due to land ceiling acts, and in some cases, family disputes. Such small holdings are often over-manned, resulting in disguised unemployment and low productivity of labour. Some reports claim smallholder farming may not be cause of poor productivity, since the productivity is higher in China and many developing economies even though China smallholder farmers constitute over 97% of its farming population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rapid growth of select Asian economies|year=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/ag087e/ag087e00.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> A Chinese smallholder farmer is able to rent his land to larger farmers, China's organised retail and extensive Chinese highways are able to provide the incentive and infrastructure necessary to its farmers for sharp increases in farm productivity.\n* Adoption of modern agricultural practices and use of [[Agricultural machinery|technology]] is inadequate in comparison with Green Revolution methods and technologies, hampered by ignorance of such practices, high costs and impracticality in the case of small land holdings.\n* According to the [[World Bank]], Indian branch's ''Priorities for Agriculture and Rural Development'', India's large [[agricultural subsidies]] are hampering productivity-enhancing investment.
