Lithograph by [[Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler]].]]\nThe '''history of Pittsburgh''' began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern [[Pittsburgh]] region, known as \"Dionde:g\u00e2'\" in the [[Seneca language]].<ref name = \"sacredtexts\">{{cite web|title=Glossary of Seneca Words|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/iro/parker/cohl167.htm|website=Internet Sacred Text Archive}}</ref> Eventually French and [[British Empire|British]] explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River]]s meet to form the [[Ohio River|Ohio]], which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when [[French and Indian War|France and Britain fought for control in the 1750s]]. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi.\n\nFollowing [[American Revolution|American independence]] in 1783, the village around [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] continued to grow.  The region saw the short-lived [[Whiskey Rebellion]], when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The [[War of 1812]] cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.  By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 [[Pittsburgh Railway Riots|railway riots]] it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|nationwide strikes]] of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel.\n\nPittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the [[New Deal Coalition]] under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.\n\nFollowing World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance.\" The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]] is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities.\n\n==Native American era==\n[[File:NativeTowns Pittsburgh.png|thumb|right|350px|Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years.

[[Paleo-Indian]]s conducted a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago.

In the event, the colonists did not succeed in improving the Amerindian path to a wagon road much beyond the [[Cumberland Narrows]] [[mountain pass|pass]] before they were confronted by hostile Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track.\n\nThe French had built nearby [[Logstown]] as a trade and council center for the Native Americans to increase their influence in the Ohio Valley.<ref name=\"Logs\"/> Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by [[Celeron de Bienville]], a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.<ref name=\"FortsCom\"/> De Bienville warned away English traders and posted markers claiming the territory.<ref>Crumrine, Boyd, L.H.

They also cut a road through the woods and built [[Fort Le Boeuf]] on [[French Creek (Allegheny River)|French Creek]], from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny.

The fort, named [[Fort Prince George]], was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and built [[Fort Duquesne]].<ref name=\"Albert\"/><ref name=\"ftpitt\"/>\n\nGovernor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column.

Two regiments marched from [[Fort Cumberland (Maryland)|Fort Cumberland]] across the [[Allegheny Mountains]] and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. [[Braddock Road (Braddock expedition)|Braddock's Road]], as it was known, blazed the way for the future [[National Road]] (US40). The expedition crossed the [[Monongahela River]] on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition at [[Braddock's Field]], nine miles (14&nbsp;km) from Fort Duquesne.<ref name=\"jubilee\">''The Unwritten History of Braddock's Field (Pennsylvania)'', editor Geo.

This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.<ref name=\"ftpitt\"/>\n\nOn September 8, 1756, an [[Kittanning Expedition|expedition of 300 militiamen]] destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of [[Kittanning (village)|Kittanning]], and in the summer of 1758, British [[John Forbes (General)|General John Forbes]] began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built [[Fort Ligonier]] and [[Fort Bedford]], from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13\u201314, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was massacred in the [[Battle of Fort Duquesne]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost [[Fort Frontenac]] and largely evacuated [[Fort Duquesne]], he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758 and ordered the construction of [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], named after British Secretary of State [[William Pitt the Elder]]. He also named the settlement between the rivers, \"Pittsborough\" (see [[Etymology of Pittsburgh]]).<ref name=\"Lorant\"/><ref name=\"ftpitt\"/> The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/> The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] and French defeat.<ref name=\"ftpitt\"/> They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River.\n\n==Gateway to the West (1763\u20131799)==\nIn 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town,\" near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town,\" along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] counted 332 people and 104 houses.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/462222/Pittsburgh |title=Pittsburgh |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia |year=2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn a final Native American attempt to drive out the British west of the Appalachians, known as [[Pontiac's War]], the [[Odawa]] leader [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]] began with an assault on British forts in May 1763. Ohio Valley and Great Lakes tribes overran many forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.<ref name=Lorant/> Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763.

In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a [[redoubt]], the [[Fort Pitt Blockhouse]], which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].<ref name=\"ftpitt\"/>\n[[File:Fort Pitt 1795 large.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Fort Pitt, 1795]]\nThe [[Iroquois]] signed the [[Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768]], ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]], and the rest were [[Welsh people|Welsh]], German and others.<ref name=\"Bartlett\">{{cite book |title=Keeping House, Women's Lives in Western Pennsylvania |last=Bartlett |first=Virginia K. |publisher=Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-8229-5538-5}}</ref> These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.<ref name=\"Bartlett\"/> Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.<ref name=\"Sipe\"/>\n\nIncreasing violence, especially by the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami tribe|Miami]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] tribes, led to [[Dunmore's War]] in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the [[American Revolution]], as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General [[Edward Hand]] took command. In 1779, Colonel [[Daniel Brodhead IV|Daniel Brodhead]] led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] villages along the upper Allegheny.<ref name=\"Sipe\"/>\n\nWith the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the [[jurisdiction of Pittsburgh]] region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], the [[Iroquois]] ceded the land north of the [[Purchase Line]] to Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Sipe\"/>\n\n[[File:Pittsburgh 1795 large.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of Pittsburgh in 1795]]\n\nAfter the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was [[boat building]]. [[Flatboats]] could used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while [[keelboats]] were capable of traveling upriver.<ref name=citydata>{{cite web |author=Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania |title=Pittsburgh: History |url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Pittsburgh-History.html |publisher=City-Data |accessdate=November 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe village began to develop vital institutions. [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]], a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The Academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Through one hundred and fifty years: the University of Pittsburgh |year=2007 |first=Agnes |last=Lynch Starrett |publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}</ref>\n\nMany farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at [[Braddock's Field]] and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.<ref name=\"jubilee\"/>\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, ''Western Experiment.''<ref>{{cite book |title=Monongahela, the River and Its Region |last=Wiley |first=Richard Taylor |publisher=The Ziegler Company |year=1937}}</ref> During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats.

Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. [[Blacksmiths]] forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/>\n\nThe 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first [[steamboat]] was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The [[War of 1812]] catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/> Also, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/> When, on March 18, 1816, [[Pittsburgh]] was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of [[coal dust]].<ref name=cl>{{cite web |title=Pittsburgh in 1816 |year=1916 |url=http://www.clpgh.org/research/pittsburgh/history/pgh1816.html |publisher=Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145839/http://www.clpgh.org/research/Pittsburgh/history/pgh1816.html |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOther emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from [[Baltimore]] to [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east-west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the [[Bridges of Pittsburgh|\"City of bridges\"]] over its two rivers.<ref name=\"pghbridges\">{{cite web | title = Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh, PA | work = PGHBridges.com | url =http://pghbridges.com/index.htm |accessdate=April 14, 2007}}</ref> On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of [[Philadelphia]].

In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first [[locomotive]] west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the [[Allegheny County Courthouse|Second Court House]], on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|80|ft|m}} high.<ref name=\"Boucher\">{{cite book |title=A century and a half of Pittsburgh and her people |url=https://archive.org/details/centuryandhalfof03bouc |last=Boucher |first=John Newton |publisher=The Lewis Publishing Company |year=1908}}</ref>\n[[File:WLA cma View of the Great Fire of Pittsburgh 1846.jpg|thumb|right|Great Fire of Pittsburgh, 1845]]\n\nLike many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.<ref>{{cite book |title=History of the Allegheny Fire Department |publisher=Allegheny Fire Dept. |year=1895}}</ref> Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a [[Great Fire of Pittsburgh|great fire]] burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages.<ref name=\"Ballous\"/> As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived.

He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch Irish]] held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"<ref>John Ingham, ''The Iron Barons'' (1978) quotes pp 7 and 228.</ref>\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, [[Thomas Mellon]] (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful [[Mellon family]], which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as [[James H. Laughlin]] (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"<ref>Gregory Barnhisel ''James Laughlin, New Directions, and the Remaking of Ezra Pound'' (2005) p. 48.</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]-fire [[smelting]] to the region. The [[American Civil War]] boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the [[Allegheny Arsenal]] and the [[Fort Pitt Foundry]].<ref name=\"Boucher\"/> Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.<ref>{{cite book |title=Allegheny County's Hundred Years |last=Thurston |first=George H |publisher=A. A. Anderson Son, Pittsburgh |year=1888}}</ref> By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the [[Edgar Thomson Works]] in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]] began to make steel rail using the new [[Bessemer process]].<ref name=\"Galloway\">{{cite book |title=History of Pittsburgh |first1=Miriam |last1=Meislik |author2=Ed Galloway |publisher=Society of American Archivists, Pittsburgh |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nIndustrialists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[Andrew W. Mellon]], and [[Charles M. Schwab]] built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was [[George Westinghouse]], credited with such advancements as the [[Air brake (rail)|air brake]] and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), [[Union Switch & Signal]] (1881), and [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] (1886).<ref name=\"westinghouse\">{{cite web |url=http://www.westinghouse.com/timeline.html |title=Westinghouse, Our Past |publisher=Westinghouse |year=2007 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509071422/http://www.westinghouse.com/timeline.html |archivedate=May 9, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, [[Mellon Financial Corporation|T. Mellon & Sons Bank]], founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became [[Alcoa]].<ref name=\"Galloway\"/>\n\nIngham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.<ref>John N. Ingham, \"Iron and Steel in the Pittsburgh Region: The Domain of Small Business,\" ''Business and Economic History'' 1991 20: 107\u2013116</ref>\n\n===Geography of industrialization===\nBeginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.<ref>Edward K. Muller, \"Industrial Suburbs and the Growth of Metropolitan Pittsburgh, 1870\u20131920,\" ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 2001 27(1): 58\u201373</ref>\n\nRepresentative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of [[Vandergrift, Pennsylvania|Vandergrift]], according to Mosher (1995).  Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as [[welfare capitalism]], with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the [[United States Steel Corporation]].<ref>Anne E.

Heinz]], founded the [[H.J. Heinz Company]] in 1872. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heinzfamily.org/aboutus/heinzhistory.html |title=Heinz Family History |accessdate=November 6, 2008}}</ref> but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.<ref>{{cite book |first=Kenneth A. |last=Heineman |title=A Catholic New Deal: Religion and Reform in Depression Pittsburgh |year=1999 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=0-271-01896-8}}</ref>\n\n===Labor unions===\nAs a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the [[Pittsburgh Railway Riots]].<ref>''Harper's Weekly, Journal of Civilization'' Vol. XXL, No. 1076'' New York, August 11, 1877.</ref> Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.\n[[File:Harpers 8 11 1877 Steeple View of Pittsburgh Conflagaration.jpg|thumb|left|370px|Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, Pittsburgh, July 21\u201322, 1877]]\n\nIn 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when [[Carnegie Steel Company]]'s manager [[Henry Clay Frick]] sent in [[Pinkerton Detective Agency|Pinkertons]] to break the [[Homestead Strike]].  Labor strife continued into the years of the [[Great Depression]], as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organized [[H.J. Heinz]] workers, with the assistance of the [[Catholic Radical Alliance]].\n\n===Carnegie===\n[[Andrew Carnegie]], an immigrant from Scotland, a former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] executive turned steel magnate, founded the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first [[Carnegie Library]], in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]]. In 1901, as the [[U.S. Steel]] Corporation formed, he sold his mills to [[J.P. Morgan]] for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Carnegie, Andrew |url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=nora;cc=;view=toc;subview=short;idno=nora0148-6 |title=The North American Review Volume 0148 Issue 391 |accessdate=February 10, 2014}}</ref> He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations.

New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]], [[Polish Hill]], [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield]], and [[Squirrel Hill]], home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 2002 Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study |url=http://www.ujfpittsburgh.org/page.aspx?ID=46650 |publisher=United Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh |date=December 2002 |accessdate=November 6, 2008}}</ref> The [[Strip District (Pittsburgh)|Strip District]], the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.<ref name=\"Galloway\"/>\n===African Americans===\n{{Further|Great Migration (African American)}}\nThe years 1916\u20131940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and jpb opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. <ref>Joe W.

Trotter, and Eric Ledell Smith, eds. ''African Americans in Pennsylvania: Shifting Historical Perspectives'' (Penn State Press, 2010).</ref>\nHistorian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:\n:Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\nThe newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:\n:Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]''); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" pp 156-57.</ref>\n\nThe cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the [[Hill District]]. It became  an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as [[Duke Ellington]] and Pittsburgh natives [[Billy Strayhorn]] and [[Earl Hines]] played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the [[Pittsburgh Crawfords]] and the [[Homestead Grays]], often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the [[Negro National League (1933-1948)|Negro National League]] in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name=\"Galloway\"/>\n\n===1930s===\nPittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,<ref>Between 1884 and 1933, only two Democrats served as mayors of Pittsburgh, Bernard McKenna from 1893 through 1896 and George Guthrie between 1906 and 1909.</ref> and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the [[New Deal Coalition]]. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.<ref>Stefano Luconi, \"The Roosevelt Majority: The Case of Italian Americans in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia,\" ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' 1996 15(2): 32\u201359</ref><ref>Richard C.

However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels.

Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the [[1973 oil crisis]], and increasing use of other materials.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/><ref name=\"wolf\">{{cite book |title=And the Wolf Finally Came: The Decline of the American Steel Industry |url=https://archive.org/details/andwolffinallyca00hoer |url-access=registration |first=John P. |last=Hoerr |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8229-5398-6}}</ref>  The era began with the [[RIDC]]'s \"Building on Basics\" report in 1974.<ref>{{Citation| last  = | first = | author-link = | title = Area's Economy Reported Strong| newspaper = Beaver County Times| location = Beaver, PA| volume = | issue  = | date   = September 23, 1974| page   = | url    = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pf0qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=btoFAAAAIBAJ&dq=regional%20industrial%20hiram%20milton&pg=5972%2C2066214}}</ref>\n\n===Collapse of steel===\n{{Further|Steel crisis}}\nFree market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of [[United Steelworkers]] regarding wage cuts and [[work-rule]] reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management.

As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.\n\n===Corporations===\nTop corporate headquarters such as [[Gulf Oil]] (1985), [[Koppers]] (1987), [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] (1996) and [[Rockwell International]] (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the \"brain drain\") as well as massive charitable contributions by the \"home based\" companies to local cultural and educational institutions.  At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier.  Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day.\n\nToday, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the [[Edgar Thomson Works]] in nearby [[Braddock, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Braddock]].\n\n===Higher education===\nPittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings, [[The University of Pittsburgh]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Duquesne University]].  [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]] had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.<ref>Annette L. Giovengo, \"The Historical Roles of Pittsburgh's Research Universities in Regional Economic Development,\" ''Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine'' 1987 70(3): 257\u2013277</ref>  Other regional collegiate institutions include [[Robert Morris University]], [[Chatham University]], [[Carlow University]],  [[Point Park University]], [[La Roche College]], [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]], Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and the [[Community College of Allegheny County]].\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (26,000 employees) and the [[West Penn Allegheny Health System]] (13,000 employees).<ref>{{cite web | title = Top Private Employers | work = Pittsburgh Regional Alliance | url = http://www.alleghenyconference.org/public/cfm/d_and_d/index.cfm? | accessdate=April 14, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061010050140/http://www.alleghenyconference.org/public/cfm/d_and_d/index.cfm |archivedate = October 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wpahs.org Allegheny Health Network]</ref>\n\n===Civic improvements===\nDespite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued.  In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the [[Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation]] (Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies.  Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]], a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh.  In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic [[adaptive reuse]] development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.  Aided by an initial generous gift from the [[Allegheny Foundation]] in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the [[Monongahela River]], opposite the [[Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh)]]. Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to [[Forest City Enterprises]] which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people \u2013 teachers, students, adults, and visitors \u2013 to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation |url=http://www.phlf.org/about-landmarks/a-brief-history-of-pittsburgh-history-landmarks-foundation/ |year=2008 |publisher=Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929032210/http://www.phlf.org/about-landmarks/a-brief-history-of-pittsburgh-history-landmarks-foundation/ |archivedate=September 29, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for [[community development]], through the work of activists such as [[Dorothy Mae Richardson]], who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide [[NeighborWorks America]]. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.\n\nIn 1985, the [[J & L Steel]] site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built.

Lithograph by [[Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler]].]]\nThe '''history of Pittsburgh''' began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern [[Pittsburgh]] region, known as \"Dionde:g\u00e2'\" in the [[Seneca language]].' <ref name = \"sacredtexts\">{{cite web|title=Glossary of Seneca Words|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/iro/parker/cohl167.htm|website=Internet Sacred Text Archive}}</ref> Eventually French and [[British Empire|British]] explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River]]s meet to form the [[Ohio River|Ohio]], which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when [[French and Indian War|France and Britain fought for control in the 1750s]]. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi.\n\nFollowing [[American Revolution|American independence]] in 1783, the village around [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] continued to grow.  The region saw the short-lived [[Whiskey Rebellion]], when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The [[War of 1812]] cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.  By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 [[Pittsburgh Railway Riots|railway riots]] it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|nationwide strikes]] of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel.\n\nPittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the [[New Deal Coalition]] under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.\n\nFollowing World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance.\" The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]] is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities.\n\n==Native American era==\n[[File:NativeTowns Pittsburgh.png|thumb|right|350px|Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years.

[[Paleo-Indian]]s conducted a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago.

The [[Ford (river)|river crossing]] and flats at [[Redstone Creek (Pennsylvania)|Redstone creek]], was the [[Redstone Old Fort|earliest point]] and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified as [[Fort Burd]] (now [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania|Brownsville]]) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became [[Braddock's Road]] a few years later through present-day [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania|New Stanton]]. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in improving the Amerindian path to a wagon road much beyond the [[Cumberland Narrows]] [[mountain pass|pass]] before they were confronted by hostile Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track.\n\nThe French had built nearby [[Logstown]] as a trade and council center for the Native Americans to increase their influence in the Ohio Valley.<ref name=\"Logs\"/> Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by [[Celeron de Bienville]], a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.<ref name=\"FortsCom\"/> De Bienville warned away English traders and posted markers claiming the territory.<ref>Crumrine, Boyd, L.H.

At present-day [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], an advance party built [[Fort Presque Isle]]. They also cut a road through the woods and built [[Fort Le Boeuf]] on [[French Creek (Allegheny River)|French Creek]], from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny.

Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column.

Two regiments marched from [[Fort Cumberland (Maryland)|Fort Cumberland]] across the [[Allegheny Mountains]] and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. [[Braddock Road (Braddock expedition)|Braddock's Road]], as it was known, blazed the way for the future [[National Road]] (US40). The expedition crossed the [[Monongahela River]] on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition at [[Braddock's Field]], nine miles (14&nbsp;km) from Fort Duquesne.<ref name=\"jubilee\">''The Unwritten History of Braddock's Field (Pennsylvania)'', editor Geo.

This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.<ref name=\"ftpitt\"/>\n\nOn September 8, 1756, an [[Kittanning Expedition|expedition of 300 militiamen]] destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of [[Kittanning (village)|Kittanning]], and in the summer of 1758, British [[John Forbes (General)|General John Forbes]] began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built [[Fort Ligonier]] and [[Fort Bedford]], from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13\u201314, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was massacred in the [[Battle of Fort Duquesne]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost [[Fort Frontenac]] and largely evacuated [[Fort Duquesne]], he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758 and ordered the construction of [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], named after British Secretary of State [[William Pitt the Elder]]. He also named the settlement between the rivers, \"Pittsborough\" (see [[Etymology of Pittsburgh]]).<ref name=\"Lorant\"/><ref name=\"ftpitt\"/> The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/> The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] and French defeat.<ref name=\"ftpitt\"/> They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River.\n\n==Gateway to the West (1763\u20131799)==\nIn 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town,\" near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town,\" along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] counted 332 people and 104 houses.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/462222/Pittsburgh |title=Pittsburgh |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia |year=2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn a final Native American attempt to drive out the British west of the Appalachians, known as [[Pontiac's War]], the [[Odawa]] leader [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]] began with an assault on British forts in May 1763. Ohio Valley and Great Lakes tribes overran many forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.<ref name=Lorant/> Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763. The [[siege of Fort Pitt]] lasted for two months.<ref name=\"ftpitt\"/> Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the [[Battle of Bushy Run]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This victory sealed British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a [[redoubt]], the [[Fort Pitt Blockhouse]], which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].<ref name=\"ftpitt\"/>\n[[File:Fort Pitt 1795 large.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Fort Pitt, 1795]]\nThe [[Iroquois]] signed the [[Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768]], ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]], and the rest were [[Welsh people|Welsh]], German and others.<ref name=\"Bartlett\">{{cite book |title=Keeping House, Women's Lives in Western Pennsylvania |last=Bartlett |first=Virginia K. |publisher=Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-8229-5538-5}}</ref> These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.<ref name=\"Bartlett\"/> Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.<ref name=\"Sipe\"/>\n\nIncreasing violence, especially by the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami tribe|Miami]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] tribes, led to [[Dunmore's War]] in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the [[American Revolution]], as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General [[Edward Hand]] took command. In 1779, Colonel [[Daniel Brodhead IV|Daniel Brodhead]] led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] villages along the upper Allegheny.<ref name=\"Sipe\"/>\n\nWith the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the [[jurisdiction of Pittsburgh]] region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], the [[Iroquois]] ceded the land north of the [[Purchase Line]] to Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Sipe\"/>\n\n[[File:Pittsburgh 1795 large.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of Pittsburgh in 1795]]\n\nAfter the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was [[boat building]]. [[Flatboats]] could used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while [[keelboats]] were capable of traveling upriver.<ref name=citydata>{{cite web |author=Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania |title=Pittsburgh: History |url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Pittsburgh-History.html |publisher=City-Data |accessdate=November 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe village began to develop vital institutions. [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]], a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The Academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Through one hundred and fifty years: the University of Pittsburgh |year=2007 |first=Agnes |last=Lynch Starrett |publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}</ref>\n\nMany farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at [[Braddock's Field]] and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.<ref name=\"jubilee\"/>\n\nThe town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, ''Western Experiment.''<ref>{{cite book |title=Monongahela, the River and Its Region |last=Wiley |first=Richard Taylor |publisher=The Ziegler Company |year=1937}}</ref> During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats.

Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. [[Blacksmiths]] forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/>\n\nThe 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first [[steamboat]] was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The [[War of 1812]] catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/> Also, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/> When, on March 18, 1816, [[Pittsburgh]] was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of [[coal dust]].<ref name=cl>{{cite web |title=Pittsburgh in 1816 |year=1916 |url=http://www.clpgh.org/research/pittsburgh/history/pgh1816.html |publisher=Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145839/http://www.clpgh.org/research/Pittsburgh/history/pgh1816.html |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOther emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from [[Baltimore]] to [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east-west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the [[Bridges of Pittsburgh|\"City of bridges\"]] over its two rivers.<ref name=\"pghbridges\">{{cite web | title = Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh, PA | work = PGHBridges.com | url =http://pghbridges.com/index.htm |accessdate=April 14, 2007}}</ref> On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of [[Philadelphia]].

In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first [[locomotive]] west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the [[Allegheny County Courthouse|Second Court House]], on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|80|ft|m}} high.<ref name=\"Boucher\">{{cite book |title=A century and a half of Pittsburgh and her people |url=https://archive.org/details/centuryandhalfof03bouc |last=Boucher |first=John Newton |publisher=The Lewis Publishing Company |year=1908}}</ref>\n[[File:WLA cma View of the Great Fire of Pittsburgh 1846.jpg|thumb|right|Great Fire of Pittsburgh, 1845]]\n\nLike many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.<ref>{{cite book |title=History of the Allegheny Fire Department |publisher=Allegheny Fire Dept. |year=1895}}</ref> Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a [[Great Fire of Pittsburgh|great fire]] burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages.<ref name=\"Ballous\"/> As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived.

He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch Irish]] held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"<ref>John Ingham, ''The Iron Barons'' (1978) quotes pp 7 and 228.</ref>\n\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, [[Thomas Mellon]] (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful [[Mellon family]], which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as [[James H. Laughlin]] (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"<ref>Gregory Barnhisel ''James Laughlin, New Directions, and the Remaking of Ezra Pound'' (2005) p. 48.</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]-fire [[smelting]] to the region. The [[American Civil War]] boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the [[Allegheny Arsenal]] and the [[Fort Pitt Foundry]].<ref name=\"Boucher\"/> Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.<ref>{{cite book |title=Allegheny County's Hundred Years |last=Thurston |first=George H |publisher=A. A. Anderson Son, Pittsburgh |year=1888}}</ref> By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the [[Edgar Thomson Works]] in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]] began to make steel rail using the new [[Bessemer process]].<ref name=\"Galloway\">{{cite book |title=History of Pittsburgh |first1=Miriam |last1=Meislik |author2=Ed Galloway |publisher=Society of American Archivists, Pittsburgh |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nIndustrialists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[Andrew W. Mellon]], and [[Charles M. Schwab]] built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was [[George Westinghouse]], credited with such advancements as the [[Air brake (rail)|air brake]] and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), [[Union Switch & Signal]] (1881), and [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] (1886).<ref name=\"westinghouse\">{{cite web |url=http://www.westinghouse.com/timeline.html |title=Westinghouse, Our Past |publisher=Westinghouse |year=2007 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509071422/http://www.westinghouse.com/timeline.html |archivedate=May 9, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, [[Mellon Financial Corporation|T. Mellon & Sons Bank]], founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became [[Alcoa]].<ref name=\"Galloway\"/>\n\nIngham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.<ref>John N. Ingham, \"Iron and Steel in the Pittsburgh Region: The Domain of Small Business,\" ''Business and Economic History'' 1991 20: 107\u2013116</ref>\n\n===Geography of industrialization===\nBeginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.<ref>Edward K. Muller, \"Industrial Suburbs and the Growth of Metropolitan Pittsburgh, 1870\u20131920,\" ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 2001 27(1): 58\u201373</ref>\n\nRepresentative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of [[Vandergrift, Pennsylvania|Vandergrift]], according to Mosher (1995).  Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as [[welfare capitalism]], with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the [[United States Steel Corporation]].<ref>Anne E.

During the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the [[Pittsburgh Railway Riots]].<ref>''Harper's Weekly, Journal of Civilization'' Vol. XXL, No. 1076'' New York, August 11, 1877.</ref> Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.\n[[File:Harpers 8 11 1877 Steeple View of Pittsburgh Conflagaration.jpg|thumb|left|370px|Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, Pittsburgh, July 21\u201322, 1877]]\n\nIn 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when [[Carnegie Steel Company]]'s manager [[Henry Clay Frick]] sent in [[Pinkerton Detective Agency|Pinkertons]] to break the [[Homestead Strike]].  Labor strife continued into the years of the [[Great Depression]], as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organized [[H.J. Heinz]] workers, with the assistance of the [[Catholic Radical Alliance]].\n\n===Carnegie===\n[[Andrew Carnegie]], an immigrant from Scotland, a former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] executive turned steel magnate, founded the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first [[Carnegie Library]], in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]]. In 1901, as the [[U.S. Steel]] Corporation formed, he sold his mills to [[J.P. Morgan]] for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men.

New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]], [[Polish Hill]], [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield]], and [[Squirrel Hill]], home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 2002 Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study |url=http://www.ujfpittsburgh.org/page.aspx?ID=46650 |publisher=United Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh |date=December 2002 |accessdate=November 6, 2008}}</ref> The [[Strip District (Pittsburgh)|Strip District]], the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.<ref name=\"Galloway\"/>\n===African Americans===\n{{Further|Great Migration (African American)}}\nThe years 1916\u20131940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and jpb opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. <ref>Joe W.

Trotter, and Eric Ledell Smith, eds. ''African Americans in Pennsylvania: Shifting Historical Perspectives'' (Penn State Press, 2010).</ref>\nHistorian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:\n:Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\nThe newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:\n:Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]''); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" pp 156-57.</ref>\n\nThe cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the [[Hill District]]. It became  an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as [[Duke Ellington]] and Pittsburgh natives [[Billy Strayhorn]] and [[Earl Hines]] played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the [[Pittsburgh Crawfords]] and the [[Homestead Grays]], often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the [[Negro National League (1933-1948)|Negro National League]] in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name=\"Galloway\"/>\n\n===1930s===\nPittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,<ref>Between 1884 and 1933, only two Democrats served as mayors of Pittsburgh, Bernard McKenna from 1893 through 1896 and George Guthrie between 1906 and 1909.</ref> and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the [[New Deal Coalition]]. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.<ref>Stefano Luconi, \"The Roosevelt Majority: The Case of Italian Americans in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia,\" ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' 1996 15(2): 32\u201359</ref><ref>Richard C.

Guffey and Lawrence used the [[New Deal]] programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only \"a challenge\" but also \"an opportunity.\" He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage.<ref>Bruce M.

However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.<ref>Stefano Luconi, \"The Enforcement of the 1941 Smoke-Control Ordinance and Italian Americans in Pittsburgh,\" ''Pennsylvania History'' 1999 66(4): 580\u2013594</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!Year\n!City Population\n!City Rank<ref name=\"census\"/>\n|-\n|1860\n|49,221\n|17\n|-\n|1870\n|86,076\n|16\n|-\n|1880\n|156,389\n|12\n|-\n|1890\n|238,617\n|13\n|-\n|1900\n|321,616\n|11\n|-\n|1910\n|533,905\n|8\n|-\n|1920\n|588,343\n|9\n|-\n|1930\n|669,817\n|10\n|-\n|1940\n|671,659\n|10\n|-\n|1950\n|676,806\n|12\n|}\n\n{{anchor|Renaissance I}}\n\n==Renaissance I (1946\u20131973)==\n{{redirect|Pittsburgh Renaissance|the basketball team|Pittsburgh Rens}}\n[[File:ThreeRiversStadium.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The multi-purpose [[Three Rivers Stadium]] was built in 1970 as part of the Renaissance I project.

Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the [[1973 oil crisis]], and increasing use of other materials.<ref name=\"Lorant\"/><ref name=\"wolf\">{{cite book |title=And the Wolf Finally Came: The Decline of the American Steel Industry |url=https://archive.org/details/andwolffinallyca00hoer |url-access=registration |first=John P. |last=Hoerr |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8229-5398-6}}</ref>  The era began with the [[RIDC]]'s \"Building on Basics\" report in 1974.<ref>{{Citation| last  = | first = | author-link = | title = Area's Economy Reported Strong| newspaper = Beaver County Times| location = Beaver, PA| volume = | issue  = | date   = September 23, 1974| page   = | url    = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pf0qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=btoFAAAAIBAJ&dq=regional%20industrial%20hiram%20milton&pg=5972%2C2066214}}</ref>\n\n===Collapse of steel===\n{{Further|Steel crisis}}\nFree market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of [[United Steelworkers]] regarding wage cuts and [[work-rule]] reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable \"mini-mills\" and non-union mills with lower labor costs.<ref name=\"wolf\"/>\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the [[deindustrialization]] of the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/2012/12/23/In-desperate-1983-there-was-nowhere-for-Pittsburgh-s-economy-to-go-but-up/stories/201212230258 |title=In desperate 1983, there was nowhere for Pittsburgh's economy to go but up |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=February 10, 2014 |first=Bill |last=Toland |date=December 23, 2012}}</ref> Following the 1981\u20131982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers.<ref name=\"wolf\"/> The steel mills began to shut down.

As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.\n\n===Corporations===\nTop corporate headquarters such as [[Gulf Oil]] (1985), [[Koppers]] (1987), [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] (1996) and [[Rockwell International]] (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the \"brain drain\") as well as massive charitable contributions by the \"home based\" companies to local cultural and educational institutions.  At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier.  Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day.\n\nToday, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the [[Edgar Thomson Works]] in nearby [[Braddock, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Braddock]].\n\n===Higher education===\nPittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings, [[The University of Pittsburgh]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Duquesne University]].  [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]] had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.<ref>Annette L. Giovengo, \"The Historical Roles of Pittsburgh's Research Universities in Regional Economic Development,\" ''Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine'' 1987 70(3): 257\u2013277</ref>  Other regional collegiate institutions include [[Robert Morris University]], [[Chatham University]], [[Carlow University]],  [[Point Park University]], [[La Roche College]], [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]], Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and the [[Community College of Allegheny County]].\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (26,000 employees) and the [[West Penn Allegheny Health System]] (13,000 employees).<ref>{{cite web | title = Top Private Employers | work = Pittsburgh Regional Alliance | url = http://www.alleghenyconference.org/public/cfm/d_and_d/index.cfm? | accessdate=April 14, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061010050140/http://www.alleghenyconference.org/public/cfm/d_and_d/index.cfm |archivedate = October 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wpahs.org Allegheny Health Network]</ref>\n\n===Civic improvements===\nDespite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued.  In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the [[Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation]] (Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies.  Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]], a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh.  In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic [[adaptive reuse]] development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.  Aided by an initial generous gift from the [[Allegheny Foundation]] in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the [[Monongahela River]], opposite the [[Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh)]]. Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to [[Forest City Enterprises]] which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people \u2013 teachers, students, adults, and visitors \u2013 to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation |url=http://www.phlf.org/about-landmarks/a-brief-history-of-pittsburgh-history-landmarks-foundation/ |year=2008 |publisher=Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929032210/http://www.phlf.org/about-landmarks/a-brief-history-of-pittsburgh-history-landmarks-foundation/ |archivedate=September 29, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for [[community development]], through the work of activists such as [[Dorothy Mae Richardson]], who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide [[NeighborWorks America]]. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.\n\nIn 1985, the [[J & L Steel]] site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.<ref name=\"WQED\"/> In the 1980s, the \"Renaissance II\" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as [[PPG Place]].
