It is suggested{{citation needed|reason=By whom?|date=April 2015}} that the Kumeyaay name for the area was transcribed by the Spanish settlers as ''{{lang|es|La Jolla}}''. An alternative, [[false etymology|pseudo-etymological]] suggestion for the origin of the name is that it is an alternate spelling of the Spanish phrase ''{{lang|es|la [[wikt:joya#Spanish|joya]]}}'', which means \"the jewel\".

When California became a state in 1850, the La Jolla area was incorporated as part of the chartered City of San Diego. In 1870, Charles Dean acquired several of the pueblo lots and subdivided them into an area that became known as La Jolla Park. Dean was unable to develop the land and left San Diego in 1881. A [[Real estate bubble|real estate boom]] in the 1880s led speculators Frank T. Botsford and George W. Heald to further develop the sparsely settled area.\n\nIn the 1890s, the San Diego, Pacific Beach, and La Jolla Railway was built, connecting La Jolla to the rest of San Diego. La Jolla became known as a resort area. To attract visitors to the beach, the railway built facilities such as a bath house and a dance pavilion. Visitors were housed in small cottages and bungalows above La Jolla Cove, as well as a temporary [[tent city]] erected every summer. Two of the cottages that were built in 1894 still exist: the \"Red Roost\" and the \"Red Rest\", also known as the \"Neptune and Cove Tea Room\"; the two cottages have been vacant since the 1980s, and are covered in tarpaulins. The La Jolla Park Hotel opened in 1893. The Hotel Cabrillo was built in 1908 by \"Squire\" James A. Wilson and was later incorporated into the La Valencia Hotel.<ref name=\"Hollins\">{{cite journal|last=Hollins|first=Jeremy|title=Village Memories: A Photo Essay on La Jolla's Past|journal=Journal of San Diego History|pages=295\u2013305|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v54-4/pdf/v54-4Hollins.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, La Jolla comprised 100 buildings and 350 residents. The first reading room (library) was built in 1898.<ref name = \"Hollins\" /> A volunteer fire brigade was organized in 1907; the city of San Diego established a regular fire house in 1914.

She was wealthy in her own right from her investments and writing, and she inherited a large sum from her brother George H. Scripps in 1900. She devoted herself to philanthropic endeavors, particularly those benefiting her adopted home of La Jolla. She commissioned many of La Jolla's most notable buildings, usually designed by [[Irving Gill]] or his nephew and partner [[Louis John Gill]]. Many of these buildings are now on the  [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]] or are listed as historic by the city of San Diego; these include the [[La Jolla Woman's Club]] (1914), the [[La Jolla Recreational Center]] (1915), the earliest buildings of [[The Bishop's School (La Jolla)|The Bishop's School]], and the [[Old Scripps Building]] at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], as well as her own residence, built in 1915 and now housing the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]]. Her donations also launched the [[Scripps Health|Scripps Memorial Hospital]] in 1924 (originally located on Prospect Street in La Jolla until it moved to its present site in 1964), the Scripps Metabolic Clinic (now the [[Scripps Research Institute]]), and the [[Children's Pool Beach|Children's Pool]]. Ellen Browning Scripps also founded [[Scripps College]], a women's college,  in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrippscollege.edu/about/ellen-browning-scripps|title=About Scripps College - History|website=www.scrippscollege.edu}}</ref> Scripps College is located in [[Claremont, California|Claremont]] in Los Angeles County (not to be confused with [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], a community of [[San Diego]]).\n\n===Scripps Institution of Oceanography===\n[[File:SIOpier.jpg|right|thumb|Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier]]\nThe [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], one of the nation's oldest oceanographic institutes, was founded in 1903 by [[William Emerson Ritter]], chair of the zoology department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], with financial support from Scripps and her brother [[E. W. Scripps]]. At first the institution operated out of a boathouse in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]]. In 1905 they purchased a {{convert|170|acre|ha|adj=on}} site in La Jolla where the Institution still stands today. The first laboratory buildings there opened in 1907. The institution became part of the [[University of California]] in 1912. Ultimately it became the nucleus for the establishment of the University of California San Diego.\n\n===Camp Matthews===\nFrom 1917 through 1964 the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained a military base in La Jolla. The base was used for marksmanship training and was known as [[Camp Calvin B. Matthews]]. During and after [[World War II]] the population of La Jolla grew, causing residential development to draw close to the base, so that it became less and less suitable as a firing range because of risk to the adjacent civilian population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/SDMarines.html#18 |title=A Brief History of the U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego |last=Denger |first=Mark J. |work=The California State Military Museum |access-date=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424141525/http://www.militarymuseum.org/SDMarines.html |archivedate=24 April 2013 |df= }}</ref> Meanwhile, the site was being eyed as a location for a proposed new campus of the University of California. In 1962 Camp Matthews was declared surplus by the Marine Corps.

The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, under its director [[Roger Revelle]], had become an important defense contractor, and local aerospace companies like [[Convair]] were pressing for local training for their scientists and engineers.

Such \"[[Covenant (law)|restrictive covenants]]\" were once fairly common throughout the United States; the 1948 Supreme Court case ''[[Shelley v.

This unique ZIP code allows addresses to read La Jolla, CA, and is the only community within the City of San Diego so recognized. Additionally, it is in the 919xx/920xx sequence used for suburban and rural ZIP Codes in San Diego County, rather than the 921xx sequence used for the remainder of the City of San Diego proper. These conditions sometimes lead to the erroneous impression that La Jolla is a separate city, rather than a part of San Diego. The 92037 ZIP code extends the northeasterly boundary to Genesee Avenue and the northerly boundary to [[Del Mar, California]]. The UCSD campus, although it is part of La Jolla, has ZIP Codes 92092 and 92093.\n\nDespite the city and postal service definitions, La Jolla does not have universally accepted boundaries. In the 1980s, the trustees of Scripps Hospital voted to move the campus from downtown La Jolla to [[University City, San Diego|University City]], east of Interstate 5 and not within the traditional boundaries of La Jolla. The governing documents of the hospital required it to be located in La Jolla, however. A court ruled that \"La Jolla\" exists merely as a \"state of mind\" and thus allowed the relocation of the hospital.<ref>Morgan, Neil.

It is suggested{{citation needed|reason=By whom?|date=April 2015}} that the Kumeyaay name for the area was transcribed by the Spanish settlers as ''{{lang|es|La Jolla}}''. An alternative, [[false etymology|pseudo-etymological]] suggestion for the origin of the name is that it is an alternate spelling of the Spanish phrase ''{{lang|es|la [[wikt:joya#Spanish|joya]]}}'', which means \"the jewel\".

When California became a state in 1850, the La Jolla area was incorporated as part of the chartered City of San Diego. In 1870, Charles Dean acquired several of the pueblo lots and subdivided them into an area that became known as La Jolla Park. Dean was unable to develop the land and left San Diego in 1881. A [[Real estate bubble|real estate boom]] in the 1880s led speculators Frank T. Botsford and George W. Heald to further develop the sparsely settled area.\n\nIn the 1890s, the San Diego, Pacific Beach, and La Jolla Railway was built, connecting La Jolla to the rest of San Diego. La Jolla became known as a resort area. To attract visitors to the beach, the railway built facilities such as a bath house and a dance pavilion. Visitors were housed in small cottages and bungalows above La Jolla Cove, as well as a temporary [[tent city]] erected every summer. Two of the cottages that were built in 1894 still exist: the \"Red Roost\" and the \"Red Rest\", also known as the \"Neptune and Cove Tea Room\"; the two cottages have been vacant since the 1980s, and are covered in tarpaulins. The La Jolla Park Hotel opened in 1893. The Hotel Cabrillo was built in 1908 by \"Squire\" James A. Wilson and was later incorporated into the La Valencia Hotel.<ref name=\"Hollins\">{{cite journal|last=Hollins|first=Jeremy|title=Village Memories: A Photo Essay on La Jolla's Past|journal=Journal of San Diego History|pages=295\u2013305|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v54-4/pdf/v54-4Hollins.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, La Jolla comprised 100 buildings and 350 residents.

She was wealthy in her own right from her investments and writing, and she inherited a large sum from her brother George H. Scripps in 1900. She devoted herself to philanthropic endeavors, particularly those benefiting her adopted home of La Jolla. She commissioned many of La Jolla's most notable buildings, usually designed by [[Irving Gill]] or his nephew and partner [[Louis John Gill]]. Many of these buildings are now on the  [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]] or are listed as historic by the city of San Diego; these include the [[La Jolla Woman's Club]] (1914), the [[La Jolla Recreational Center]] (1915), the earliest buildings of [[The Bishop's School (La Jolla)|The Bishop's School]], and the [[Old Scripps Building]] at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], as well as her own residence, built in 1915 and now housing the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]]. Her donations also launched the [[Scripps Health|Scripps Memorial Hospital]] in 1924 (originally located on Prospect Street in La Jolla until it moved to its present site in 1964), the Scripps Metabolic Clinic (now the [[Scripps Research Institute]]), and the [[Children's Pool Beach|Children's Pool]]. Ellen Browning Scripps also founded [[Scripps College]], a women's college,  in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrippscollege.edu/about/ellen-browning-scripps|title=About Scripps College - History|website=www.scrippscollege.edu}}</ref> Scripps College is located in [[Claremont, California|Claremont]] in Los Angeles County (not to be confused with [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], a community of [[San Diego]]).\n\n===Scripps Institution of Oceanography===\n[[File:SIOpier.jpg|right|thumb|Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier]]\nThe [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], one of the nation's oldest oceanographic institutes, was founded in 1903 by [[William Emerson Ritter]], chair of the zoology department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], with financial support from Scripps and her brother [[E. W. Scripps]]. At first the institution operated out of a boathouse in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]]. In 1905 they purchased a {{convert|170|acre|ha|adj=on}} site in La Jolla where the Institution still stands today. The first laboratory buildings there opened in 1907. The institution became part of the [[University of California]] in 1912. Ultimately it became the nucleus for the establishment of the University of California San Diego.\n\n===Camp Matthews===\nFrom 1917 through 1964 the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained a military base in La Jolla. The base was used for marksmanship training and was known as [[Camp Calvin B. Matthews]]. During and after [[World War II]] the population of La Jolla grew, causing residential development to draw close to the base, so that it became less and less suitable as a firing range because of risk to the adjacent civilian population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/SDMarines.html#18 |title=A Brief History of the U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego |last=Denger |first=Mark J. |work=The California State Military Museum |access-date=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424141525/http://www.militarymuseum.org/SDMarines.html |archivedate=24 April 2013 |df= }}</ref> Meanwhile, the site was being eyed as a location for a proposed new campus of the University of California. In 1962 Camp Matthews was declared surplus by the Marine Corps. The base formally closed in 1964, and that same year the first class of undergraduates enrolled in the University of California San Diego.\n\n===University of California, San Diego===\nLocal civic leaders had long toyed with the idea of a [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego campus]] of the [[University of California]], and the quest became more definite following World War II. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, under its director [[Roger Revelle]], had become an important defense contractor, and local aerospace companies like [[Convair]] were pressing for local training for their scientists and engineers. The state legislature proposed the idea in 1955, and the Regents of the University formally approved it in 1960.<ref name=\"Shragge\">{{cite journal|last=Shragge|first=Abraham J.|date=Fall 2001|title=Growing Up Together: The University of California's One Hundred-Year Partnership with the San Diego Region|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=47|issue=4|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/2001-4/ucsd.htm}}</ref> During the planning stage of the university's establishment, it was briefly known as the \"University of California, La Jolla\", but the name was changed to \"University of California, San Diego\" before its founding in 1960.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://ucsd.edu/timeline/|title=Timeline|work=University of California San Diego|access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref> The founding chancellor was [[Herbert York]], named in 1961, and the second chancellor was [[John Semple Galbraith]], named in 1964.

The landmark [[Geisel Library]] with its [[Brutalist architecture]] opened in 1970.\n\n===Antisemitism===\nThe Camp Matthews site for the University was selected with some hesitation; one of the concerns was \"whether La Jollans in particular would lay aside old prejudices in order to welcome a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse professoriate into their midst\".<ref name = \"Shragge\" /> La Jolla had a history of restrictive housing policies, often specified in deeds and ownership documents. In La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Hermosa, only people with pure [[Europe]]an ancestry could own property; this excluded [[Judaism|Jews]], who were not considered [[White people|white]]. Such \"[[Covenant (law)|restrictive covenants]]\" were once fairly common throughout the United States; the 1948 Supreme Court case ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' ruled them to be unenforceable, and Congress outlawed them twenty years later via the Fair Housing Act (Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8|title=Title VIII: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity|work=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|access-date=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708050943/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Ffair_housing_equal_opp%2Fprogdesc%2Ftitle8|archivedate=8 July 2015|df=}}</ref> However, realtors and property owners in La Jolla continued to use more subtle ways of preventing or discouraging Jews from owning property there.<ref name=\"Garson\">For example, when the world-famous mathematician and philosopher [[Jacob Bronowski]] came to the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies|Salk Institute]] in 1963, he wanted to build a home on La Jolla Farms Road for his family.

It has been replaced twice, most recently in 1954 with a {{convert|29|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cross ({{convert|43|ft|m}} tall including the base). Originally known as the \"Mount Soledad Easter Cross\", its presence on publicly owned land was challenged in the 1980s as a violation of the [[separation of church and state]].

This unique ZIP code allows addresses to read La Jolla, CA, and is the only community within the City of San Diego so recognized. Additionally, it is in the 919xx/920xx sequence used for suburban and rural ZIP Codes in San Diego County, rather than the 921xx sequence used for the remainder of the City of San Diego proper. These conditions sometimes lead to the erroneous impression that La Jolla is a separate city, rather than a part of San Diego. The 92037 ZIP code extends the northeasterly boundary to Genesee Avenue and the northerly boundary to [[Del Mar, California]]. The UCSD campus, although it is part of La Jolla, has ZIP Codes 92092 and 92093.\n\nDespite the city and postal service definitions, La Jolla does not have universally accepted boundaries. In the 1980s, the trustees of Scripps Hospital voted to move the campus from downtown La Jolla to [[University City, San Diego|University City]], east of Interstate 5 and not within the traditional boundaries of La Jolla. The governing documents of the hospital required it to be located in La Jolla, however. A court ruled that \"La Jolla\" exists merely as a \"state of mind\" and thus allowed the relocation of the hospital.<ref>Morgan, Neil.

It is considered as a symbol of Scotland (having been voted Scotland's greatest man-made wonder in 2016), and is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. It was designed by the English engineers [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|Sir John Fowler]] and [[Benjamin Baker (engineer)|Sir Benjamin Baker]]. It is sometimes referred to as the '''Forth Rail Bridge''' (to distinguish it from the adjacent [[Forth Road Bridge]]), although this has never been its official name.\n\nConstruction of the bridge began in 1882 and it was opened on 4 March 1890 by the [[Duke of Rothesay]], the future [[Edward VII]]. The bridge carries the [[Edinburgh\u2013Aberdeen line]] across the Forth between the villages of [[South Queensferry]] and [[North Queensferry]] and has a total length of {{convert|2467|m|order=flip}}. When it opened it had the [[list of longest cantilever bridge spans|longest single cantilever bridge span]] in the world, until 1919 when the [[Quebec Bridge]] in [[Canada]] was completed. It continues to be the world's second-longest single cantilever span, with a span of {{convert|521|m|order=flip}}.\n\nThe bridge and its associated railway infrastructure are owned by [[Network Rail]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:The guts of the Forth Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 1318782.jpg|thumb|View of the structure]]\n\n===Earlier proposals===\n{{Main|History of the Forth Crossing}}\n\nBefore the construction of the bridge, [[Ferry|ferries]] were used to cross the Firth.<ref name=m58>{{harvnb|McKean|2006|p=58}}</ref> In 1806, a pair of tunnels, one for each direction, was proposed, and in 1818 [[James Anderson (civil engineer)|James Anderson]] produced a design for a three-span suspension bridge close to the site of the present one.<ref name=2006p2>{{harvnb|Harding|Gerard|Ryall|2006|p=2}}</ref> Calling for approximately {{convert|2500|t}} of iron, Wilhelm Westhofen said of it \"and this quantity [of iron] distributed over the length would have given it a very light and slender appearance, so light indeed that on a dull day it would hardly have been visible, and after a heavy gale probably no longer to be seen on a clear day either\".<ref name=w1>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=1}}</ref>\n\nFor the railway age, [[Thomas Bouch]] designed for the [[Edinburgh and Northern Railway]] a [[roll-on/roll-off]] [[Train ferry|ferry]] between [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]] and [[Burntisland]] that opened in 1850, which proved so successful that another was ordered for the Tay.<ref name=\"m58-59\">{{harvnb|McKean|2006|pp=58\u201359}}</ref> In late 1863, a joint project between the [[North British Railway]] and [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]], which would merge in 1865, appointed Stephenson and Toner to design a bridge for the Forth, but the commission was given to Bouch around six months later.<ref name=m62>{{harvnb|McKean|2006|p=62}}</ref>\n\nIt had proven difficult to engineer a [[suspension bridge]] that was able to carry railway traffic, and Thomas Bouch, engineer to the [[North British Railway]] (NBR) and [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]], was in 1863\u20131864 working on a [[Single-track railway|single-track]] [[girder bridge]] crossing the Forth near [[Charlestown, Fife|Charlestown]], where the river is around {{convert|2|mi|km}} wide, but mostly relatively shallow.<ref name=m62/><ref name=\"rp24-27\">{{harvnb|Paxton|1990|pp=24\u201327}}</ref> The promoters, however, were concerned about the ability to set foundations in the silty river bottom, as borings had gone as deep as {{convert|231|ft}} into the mud without finding any rock, but Bouch conducted experiments to demonstrate that it was possible for the silt to support considerable weight.<ref name=rp29>{{harvnb|Paxton|1990|p=29}}</ref> Experiments in late 1864 with weighted caissons achieved a pressure of {{convert|5|t/sqft|LT/sqft ST/sqft|abbr=on}} on the silt, encouraging Bouch to continue with the design.<ref name=rp29/> In August 1865, Richard Hodgson, chairman of the NBR, proposed that the company invest {{GBP|18000}} to try a different kind of foundation, as the weighted caissons had not been successful.<ref name=\"m73-74\">{{harvnb|McKean|2006|pp=73\u201374}}</ref> Bouch proposed using a large pine platform underneath the piers, {{convert|80|x|60|x|7|ft|m}} (the original design called for a {{convert|114|x|80|x|9|ft|m}} platform of green beech) weighed down with {{convert|10000|t}} of [[pig iron]] which would sink the wooden platform to the level of the silt.<ref name=rp29/> The platform was launched on 14 June 1866 after some difficulty in getting it to move down the greased planks it rested on, and then moored in the harbour for six weeks pending completion.<ref name=rp29/><ref name=m77>{{harvnb|McKean|2006|p=77}}</ref> The bridge project was aborted just before the platform was sunk as the NBR expected to lose \"through traffic\" following the amalgamation of the [[Caledonian Railway]] and the [[Scottish North Eastern Railway]].<ref name=rp29/> In September 1866, a committee of shareholders investigating rumours of financial difficulties found that accounts had been falsified, and the chairman and the entire board had resigned by November.<ref name=m78>{{harvnb|McKean|2006|p=78}}</ref> By mid-1867 the NBR was nearly bankrupt, and all work on the Forth and Tay bridges was stopped.<ref name=m81>{{harvnb|McKean|2006|p=81}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Forth Bridge (1890) Figs. 2 and 3, Page

[[Inchgarvie]].<ref name=rp32/>\n\nAfter the [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge collapsed]] in 1879, confidence in Bouch dried up and the work stopped.<ref name=rp32/> The public inquiry into the disaster, chaired by [[Henry Cadogan Rothery]], found the Tay Bridge to be \"badly designed, badly constructed and badly maintained\", with Bouch being \"mainly to blame\" for the defects in construction and maintenance and \"entirely responsible\" for the defects in design.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerhayes|2010|p=7}}</ref>\n\nAfter the disaster, which occurred in high winds for which Bouch had

name=w23>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=23}}</ref> The first caisson, for the south-west pier at South Queensferry was launched on 26 May 1884, and the last caisson was launched on 29 May 1885 for the south-west pier at Inchgarvie.<ref name=w23/> When the caissons had been launched and moored, they were extended upwards with a temporary portion in order to keep water out and allow the granite pier to be built when in place.<ref name=w23/>\n\nAbove the foundations each of which is different to suit the different sites, is a tapered circular granite pier with a diameter of {{convert|55|ft}} at the bottom and a height of {{convert|36|ft}}.<ref name=w31>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=31}}</ref>\n\n====Inchgarvie====\nThe rock on which the two northern piers at Inchgarvie are located is submerged at high water, and of the other two piers, the site of eastern one is about half submerged and the western one three-quarters submerged.<ref name=w18>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=18}}</ref> This meant work initially had to be done at low tide.<ref name=w18/>\n\nThe southern piers on Inchgarvie are sited on solid rock with a slope of around 1 in 5, so the rock was prepared with concrete and sandbags to make a landing-spot for the caissons.<ref name=w26/><ref name=w20>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=20}}</ref> Excavation was carried out by [[drilling and blasting]], but no blasting was done within {{convert|1.5|ft|abbr=on}} of the caissons, and the remaining rock was quarried to within {{convert|6|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=w18/>\n\n====North Queensferry====\nOnce the positions of the piers had been established, the first task at the Fife end was to level the site of the northernmost piers, a bedrock of whinstone rising to a level of {{convert|10|to|20|ft}} above high water, to a height of {{convert|7|ft}} above high water.<ref name=w17/> The south piers at North Queensferry are sited on rock sloping into the sea, and the site was prepared by [[diamond drilling]] holes for explosive charges and blasting the rock.<ref name=w18/>\n\n====South Queensferry====\n[[File:Forth Bridge (1890) Fig. 46, Page 26.png|thumb|left|The tilted caisson]]\n[[File:Forth Bridge (1890) Fig. 51, Page 28.png|thumb|left|The mode of sinking the South Queensferry caissons]]\n\nThe four South Queensferry caissons were all sunk by the pneumatic method, and are identical in design except for differences in height.<ref name=w22/> A '''T''' shaped jetty was built at the site of the South Queensferry piers, to allow one caisson to be attached to each corner, and when launched the caissons were attached to the jetty and permitted to rise and fall with the tide.<ref name=w23/><ref name=w21>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=21}}</ref> Excavation beneath the caissons was generally only carried out at high tide when the caisson was supported by buoyancy, and then when the tide fell the air pressure was reduced in order to allow the caisson to sink down, and digging would begin anew.<ref name=w27/>\n\nThe north-west caisson was towed into place in December 1884, but an exceptionally low tide on New Year's Day 1885 caused the caisson to sink into the mud of the river bed and adopt a slight tilt.<ref name=w26>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=26}}</ref> When the tide rose, it flooded over the lower edge, filling the caisson with water, and when the tide fell but the water did not drain from the caisson, its top-heaviness caused to tilt further.<ref name=w26/> Plates were bolted on by divers to raise the edge of the caisson above water level, and the caisson was reinforced with wooden struts as water was pumped out, but pumping took place too quickly and the water pressure tore a hole between {{convert|25|and|30|ft}} long.<ref name=w26/> It was decided to construct a \"barrel\" of large timbers inside the caisson to reinforce it, and it was ten months before the caisson could be pumped out and dug free.<ref name=w26/> The caisson was refloated on 19 October 1885, and then moved into position and sunk with suitable modifications.<ref name=w26/>\n\n===Approach viaducts===\nThe approach viaducts to the north and south had to be carried at {{convert|130|ft|6|in}} above the level of high water, and it was decided to build them at a lower level and then raise them in tandem with the construction of the masonry piers.<ref name=w32>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=32}}</ref> The two viaducts have fifteen spans between them, each one {{convert|168|ft}} long and weighing slightly over {{convert|200|t}}.<ref name=w32/> Two spans are attached together to make a continuous [[girder]], with an [[expansion joint]] between each pair of spans.<ref name=w32/> Due to the slope of the hill under the viaducts, the girders were assembled at different heights, and only joined when they had reached the same level.<ref name=w33>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=33}}</ref> Lifting was done using large [[hydraulic ram]]s, and took place in increments of around {{convert|3|ft|6|in}} every four days.<ref name=w33/>\n\n===Building the cantilevers===\nThe tubular members were constructed in the No. 2 workshop further up the hill at South Queensferry.<ref name=w38>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=38}}</ref> To bend plates into the required shape, they were first heated in a gas furnace, and then pressed into the correct curve.<ref name=w38/> The curved plates were then assembled on a [[mandrel]], and holes drilled for rivets, before they were marked individually and moved to the correct location to be added to the structure.<ref name=w38/> Lattice members and other parts were also assembled at South Queensferry, using cranes and highly efficient hydraulic rivetters.<ref name=w39>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=39}}</ref>\n<!--\n====Bedplates====\nAbove the twelve circular granite piers are the bedplates, some of which are constructed in such a way as to allow limited movement.<w39>\n\nThe bridge is bolted to the piers by holding-down bolts around {{convert|2.5|in}} thick and {{convert|25|ft}} long, with 48 bolts in each of the twelve piers.<w32> The bolts are angled slightly\n-->\n\n===Opening===\nThe bridge was completed in December 1889, and load testing of the completed bridge was carried out on 21 January 1890. Two trains, each consisting of three heavy locomotives and 50 wagons loaded with coal, totalling 1,880 tons in weight, were driven slowly from South Queensferry to the middle of the north cantilever, stopping frequently to measure the deflection of the bridge. This represented more than twice the design load of the bridge: the deflection under load was as expected.<ref name=\"Descriptionand1890\" /> A few days previously there had been a violent storm, producing the highest wind pressure recorded to date at Inchgarvie, and the deflection of the cantilevers had been less than 25&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;in). The first complete crossing took place on 24 February, when a train consisting of two carriages carrying the chairmen of the various railway companies involved made several crossings. The bridge was opened on 4 March 1890 by the Duke of Rothesay, later King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], who drove home the last rivet, which was gold plated and suitably inscribed.<ref name=Gazetteer/> The key for the official opening was made by Edinburgh silversmith John Finlayson Bain, commemorated in a plaque on the bridge.

The construction of some of these lines was only completed on 2 June 1890, delaying the implementation of a full express train service over the bridge until that date. Even then, there was considerable congestion at Edinburgh Waverley station with remarshalling of the portions of the new, more intensive train service.<ref>''Aberdeen Weekly Journal'', 4 June 1890</ref>\n\n===Accidents and deaths===\nAt its peak, approximately 4,600 workers were employed in the bridge's construction. Wilhelm Westhofen recorded in 1890 that 57 lives were lost. In 2005 the Forth Bridge Memorial Committee was set up to erect a monument to those lost, and a team of local historians set out to name all those who died.<ref name=b82>{{harvnb|Wills|2009|p=82}}</ref> As of 2009, 73 deaths have been connected with the construction of the bridge and its immediate aftermath.<ref name=b86>{{harvnb|Wills|2009|p=86}}</ref> It is thought that the figure of 57 deaths excluded those who died working on the approaches to the bridge, as those parts were completed by a subcontractor, as well as those who died after the Sick and Accident Club stopped.<ref name=b86/> Of the 73 recorded deaths, 38 were as a result of falling, 9 of being crushed, 9 drowned, 8 struck by a falling object, 3 died in a fire in a [[bothy]], 1 of [[Decompression sickness|caisson disease]], and the cause of five deaths is unknown.<ref name=b90>{{harvnb|Wills|2009|p=90}}</ref>\n\nThe Sick and Accident Club was founded in 1883, and membership was compulsory for all contractors' employees.<ref name=rp136/> It would provide medical treatment to men and sometimes their families, and pay them if they were unable to work.<ref name=rp136/> The club also paid for funerals within certain limits, and would provide grants to the widows of men killed or the wives of those permanently disabled.<ref name=rp136>{{harvnb|Paxton|1990|p=136}}</ref> Eight men were saved from drowning by rowing boats positioned in the river under the working areas.<ref name=w14/>\n\n==Later history==\n\n===Race to the North===\nBefore the opening of the Forth Bridge, the railway journey from London to [[Aberdeen]] had taken about 13 hours running from {{stnlnk|Euston}} and using the [[London and North Western Railway]] and [[Caledonian Railway]] on a [[West Coast Main Line|west coast route]]. With competition opened up along the [[East Coast Main Line|east coast route]] from the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern]], [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern]] and [[North British Railway|North British]] railways and starting from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], unofficial racing took place between the two consortia, reducing the journey time to about 8\u00bd hours on the overnight runs. This reached a climax in 1895 with sensational daily press reports about the \"[[Race to the North]]\". When race fever subsided the journey times became around 10\u00bd hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Nock|1958|pp=64,66}}</ref>\n\n===World wars===\n\n[[File:Are these \"just a few splashes\", Mr. Churchill?.jpg|thumb|A German photograph allegedly taken during the raid]]\nIn the [[First World War]] British sailors would time their departures or returns to the base at [[Rosyth]] by asking when they would pass under the bridge.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/northseadiary00kingiala/northseadiary00kingiala_djvu.txt |title=A North Sea diary, 1914\u20131918 |author=King-Hall, Stephen |publisher=Newnes |date= |accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref> <!--This practice continued at least up to the 1990s.

It is sometimes referred to as the '''Forth Rail Bridge''' (to distinguish it from the adjacent [[Forth Road Bridge]]), although this has never been its official name.\n\nConstruction of the bridge began in 1882 and it was opened on 4 March 1890 by the [[Duke of Rothesay]], the future [[Edward VII]]. The bridge carries the [[Edinburgh\u2013Aberdeen line]] across the Forth between the villages of [[South Queensferry]] and [[North Queensferry]] and has a total length of {{convert|2467|m|order=flip}}. When it opened it had the [[list of longest cantilever bridge spans|longest single cantilever bridge span]] in the world, until 1919 when the [[Quebec Bridge]] in [[Canada]] was completed.

mostly relatively shallow.<ref name=m62/><ref name=\"rp24-27\">{{harvnb|Paxton|1990|pp=24\u201327}}</ref> The promoters, however, were concerned about the ability to set foundations in the silty river bottom, as borings had gone as deep as {{convert|231|ft}} into the mud without finding any rock, but Bouch conducted experiments to demonstrate that it was possible for the silt to support considerable weight.<ref name=rp29>{{harvnb|Paxton|1990|p=29}}</ref> Experiments in late 1864 with weighted caissons achieved a pressure of {{convert|5|t/sqft|LT/sqft ST/sqft|abbr=on}} on the silt, encouraging Bouch to continue with the design.<ref name=rp29/> In August 1865, Richard Hodgson, chairman of the NBR, proposed that the company invest {{GBP|18000}} to try a different kind of foundation, as the weighted caissons had not been successful.<ref name=\"m73-74\">{{harvnb|McKean|2006|pp=73\u201374}}</ref> Bouch proposed using a large pine platform underneath the piers,

when the caisson was supported by buoyancy, and then when the tide fell the air pressure was reduced in order to allow the caisson to sink down, and digging would begin anew.<ref name=w27/>\n\nThe north-west caisson was towed into place in December 1884, but an exceptionally low tide on New Year's Day 1885 caused the caisson to sink into the mud of the river bed and adopt a slight tilt.<ref name=w26>{{harvnb|Westhofen|1890|p=26}}</ref> When the tide rose, it flooded over the lower edge, filling the caisson with water, and when the tide fell but the water did not drain from the caisson,

was pumped out, but pumping took place too quickly and the water pressure tore a hole between {{convert|25|and|30|ft}} long.<ref name=w26/> It was decided to construct a \"barrel\" of large timbers inside the caisson to reinforce it, and it was ten months before the caisson could be pumped out and dug free.<ref name=w26/> The caisson was refloated on 19 October 1885, and then moved into position

bend plates into the required shape, they were first heated in a gas furnace, and then pressed into the correct curve.<ref name=w38/> The curved plates were then assembled on a [[mandrel]], and holes drilled for rivets, before they were marked individually and moved to the correct location to be added to the structure.<ref name=w38/> Lattice members and other parts were also assembled at South

completed bridge was carried out on 21 January 1890. Two trains, each consisting of three heavy locomotives and 50 wagons loaded with coal, totalling 1,880 tons in weight, were driven slowly from South Queensferry to the middle of the north cantilever, stopping frequently to measure the deflection of the bridge.
