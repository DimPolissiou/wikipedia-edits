{"title_page": "List of DC Comics publications (A\u2013B)", "text_new": "'''[[DC Comics]]''' is one of the largest [[comic book]] publishers in [[North America]]. DC has published comic books under a number of different imprints and corporate names. This is a list of all series, mini-series, limited series, one-shots and graphic novels published under the imprints DC or AA, and published by National Periodical Publications, National Comics Publications, All-American Comics, Inc., National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, Inc., and related corporate names, as well as imprints publishing titles directly related to the [[DC Universe]] characters and continuity, such as [[Elseworlds]] and [[DC Black Label]]. The list does not include collected editions; trade paperbacks; digital comics; free, promotional giveaways; or magazines, nor does it include series from imprints mainly publishing titles that are separate from the DC Universe continuity, such as [[List of Vertigo publications|Vertigo]] or [[List of Wildstorm titles|WildStorm]]; series published under those imprints that are related to the DC Universe continuity are noted, but not listed.\n\nWhile generally the most recognizable name of a comic is printed on the cover, the cover title can be changed for a number of reasons. For example, ''Action Comics'' has frequently been listed as ''Action Comics featuring Superman'' or ''Superman in Action Comics'', or even on occasion ''Supergirl in Action Comics''. The official name, however, is found in the indicia, in small print inside the comics.\n\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (C\u2013F)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (G\u2013J)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (K\u2013O)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (P\u2013S)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (T\u2013Z)]]\n\n==0\u20139==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!width=22%| Title\n!width=8%| Series\n!width=8%| Issues\n!width=18%| Dates\n!width=44%| Notes\n!Reference\n|-\n| ''[[1st Issue Special]]''\n|\n| #1\u201313\n| Apr 1975 \u2013 Apr 1976\n|\n|\n|-\n|''3-D Batman''\n|\n| 2 issues\n| 1953; 1966\n| One-shot; 1966 issue is a reprint of the 1953 issue\n|\n|-\n|''9-11: September 11, 2001''\n|\n| #1\u20132\n| Jan 2002 \u2013 Feb 2002\n| Limited series; co-published with [[Dark Horse Comics]]\n|\n|-\n|''[[52 (comics)|52]]''\n|\n| #1\u201352\n| May 2006 \u2013 May 2007\n| Weekly limited series\n|\n|-\n|''52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen''\n| \n| #1\u20136\n| Oct 2007 \u2013 Mar 2008\n| Limited series\n|\n|-\n|''[[80-Page Giant|80-Page Giant Magazine]]''\n|\n| #1\u201315\n| Aug 1964 \u2013 Oct 1965\n| Series continued (#G16\u2013G89) as giant-sized \"dual-numbered\" editions of existing titles\n|\n|-\n| ''100-Page Super Spectacular''\n|\n| #4\u20136; 14\u201322\n| 1971; Feb 1973 \u2013 Nov 1973\n| Special editions featuring [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], [[Sgt.

DC has published comic books under a number of different imprints and corporate names. This is a list of all series, mini-series, limited series, one-shots and graphic novels published under the imprints DC or AA, and published by National Periodical Publications, National Comics Publications, All-American Comics, Inc., National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, Inc., and related corporate names, as well as imprints publishing titles directly related to the [[DC Universe]] characters and continuity, such as [[Elseworlds]] and [[DC Black Label]]. The list does not include collected editions; trade paperbacks; digital comics; free, promotional giveaways; or magazines, nor does it include series from imprints mainly publishing titles that are separate from the DC Universe continuity, such as [[List of Vertigo publications|Vertigo]] or [[List of Wildstorm titles|WildStorm]]; series published under those imprints that are related to the DC Universe continuity are noted, but not listed.\n\nWhile generally the most recognizable name of a comic is printed on the cover, the cover title can be changed for a number of reasons. For example, ''Action Comics'' has frequently been listed as ''Action Comics featuring Superman'' or ''Superman in Action Comics'', or even on occasion ''Supergirl in Action Comics''. The official name, however, is found in the indicia, in small print inside the comics.\n\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (C\u2013F)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (G\u2013J)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (K\u2013O)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (P\u2013S)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (T\u2013Z)]]\n\n==0\u20139==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!width=22%| Title\n!width=8%| Series\n!width=8%| Issues\n!width=18%| Dates\n!width=44%| Notes\n!Reference\n|-\n| ''[[1st Issue Special]]''\n|\n| #1\u201313\n| Apr 1975 \u2013 Apr 1976\n|\n|\n|-\n|''3-D Batman''\n|\n| 2 issues\n| 1953; 1966\n| One-shot; 1966 issue is a reprint of the 1953 issue\n|\n|-\n|''9-11: September 11, 2001''\n|\n| #1\u20132\n| Jan 2002 \u2013 Feb 2002\n| Limited series; co-published with [[Dark Horse Comics]]\n|\n|-\n|''[[52 (comics)|52]]''\n|\n| #1\u201352\n| May 2006 \u2013 May 2007\n| Weekly limited series\n|\n|-\n|''52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen''\n| \n| #1\u20136\n| Oct 2007 \u2013 Mar 2008\n| Limited series\n|\n|-\n|''[[80-Page Giant|80-Page Giant Magazine]]''\n|\n| #1\u201315\n| Aug 1964 \u2013 Oct 1965\n| Series continued (#G16\u2013G89) as giant-sized \"dual-numbered\" editions of existing titles\n|\n|-\n| ''100-Page Super Spectacular''\n|\n| #4\u20136; 14\u201322\n| 1971; Feb 1973 \u2013 Nov 1973\n| Special editions featuring [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], [[Sgt.

The Abagusii are also found in other regions of geographical Western Kenya. The Abagusii speak [[Gusii language|Ekegusii language]] which is classified together with the [[Great Lakes Bantu languages]].  Mogusii is culturally identified as their founder and patriarch. The Abagusii are however, unrelated to the [[Kisi people]] of Malawi and the [[Kissi people]] of West Africa, other than the three very distinct communities having similar sounding tribal names.\n\n[[Kisii, Kenya|Kisii town]] - known as [[Kisii, Kenya|Bosongo]] or Getembe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ekegusiiencyclopedia.com/towns-urban-centres|title=Urban centres in Gusii|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> by the locals - is located in [[Nyanza Province]] to the southwest of Kenya and is home to the Abagusii people. However, the term Kisii refers to the town and not to the people. The name Bosongo is believed to have originated from Abasongo (to mean the Whites or the place where white people settle(d)) who lived in the town during the colonial times.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritative Ekegusii-English Dictionary|last=Bosire|first=Kennedy|publisher=Ekegusii Encyclopedia Project|year=2013|isbn=|location=Nairobi|pages=}}</ref>\nAccording to the 1979 census, Kisii District had a population of 588,000. The AbaGusii increased to 2.2 million in the latest Kenya Census 2009.\n\n==Etymology of the Word Kisii==\nThe term Kisii is a Swahili name that is used by Swahili speakers to refer to the Abagusii people. The term was also popularly used during the colonial period by the British administration in reference to Abagusii as it was much easier to pronounce.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The term Kisii however has no meaning in Ekegusii language as it is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> In the Swahili language the singular form of the word is Mkisii and the plural form is Wakisii which only make sense in the Swahili language and related coastal and Central Bantu languages of Kenya. The Swahili name for the Ekegusii language is Kikisii. The term is now popularly used in Kenya to refer to Abagusii people although that is not what they are called.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Among Abagusii the name Kisii is used to only mean [[Kisii town]] and not to the people. The original and correct name by the people for themselves is Omogusii in singular and  Abagusii in plural and the language spoken by the people is Ekegusii. The term gusii comes from Mogusii who was the founder of the community. However, the speculation that the term Gusii comes from Gwassi is incorrect as the Abagusii never lived near Gwassi hills of the modern [[Homa Bay]] county and Gwassi is a Luo-Abasuba name for one of their sub-groups.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii History |url=https://www.bluegecko.org/kenya/tribes/gusii/history.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii only lived shortly and passed through modern day [[Kisumu]] in the course of their migration and settlement in Nyanza. The terms \"Gwassi\" and \"Gusii\" don't really even sound or look alike as an ordinary ignorant person may assume. The two terms have distinct pronunciations and Etymology. The term \"Gwassi\" originates from the [[Suba language|Olosuba]] language spoken by Luo-Abasuba and is used to refer to one of their sub-groups and Gwassi hills. The term \"Gusii\" on the other hand, originates from the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]] and specifically from the name \"Mogusii\" who was the founder of the community. The term \"Gusii\" is not used as a reference to any geographical features such as hills in Gusiiland which is commonly referred to as Gusii highlands due to presence of several hills in the region. The terms \"Kisii\" and \"Gusii\" are also not synonyms as most people tend to assume and have distinct etymology and pronunciation just like the terms \"Gwassi\" and \"Gusii\". The Ekegusii language also does not have the \"SS\" but just \"S\" in their alphabet as people tend to ignorantly assume when spelling Gusii words.\n\n==Origins of the Abagusii==\nAccording to the oral literature of Abagusii, they migrated to present day Kenya from areas further North of [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya. This pre-Elgon homeland of Abagusii is referenced as Misiri and is a general area to the North of Mt. Elgon and does not state that Misiri is Egypt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> This Misiri homeland is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern day [[Ethiopia]] due to migration through the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] province of Kenya and settlement at the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya largely part of the Rift Valley.They migrated along a great mythical river called Riteru and passed through a desert land, Eroro. The Misiri homeland of Abagusii is unconnected to the so called popular Hamitic hypothesis by [[C.G. Seligman]] on the migration of hamites from North Africa that introduced advanced civilizations to Sub-Saharan Africa. The oral traditions similar to those of Abagusii are also found in the  [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]], [[Ameru]] and [[Kuria people|Abakuria]] that are most closely related to Abagusii with the Ameru and Abakuria being the closest.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> Similar oral traditions are also found in some [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] tribes some (especially Kipsigis) of who are related to Abagusii and/or migrated together with Abagusii despite being linguistically classified as Nilotic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref>  As these Bantu speakers migrated from their semi-mythical homeland(Misiri),they first settled at the [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya for several years before migrating to current homelands. From Mt. Elgon, these Bantu speakers split up into different groups with the Abagusii ending up in Nyanza Province near [[Lake Victoria]]. The [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]] settled in Western Kenya and the [[Ameru]] later migrated to the former upper Eastern province of Kenya where they later formed relationships with neighboring communities such as [[Borana people]] and communities in Central and lower Eastern provinces of Kenya. The other closely related [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking groups mostly settled in modern day [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Tanzania|Northwest Tanzania]]. In Kenya the Abagusii, are most closely related with the [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]], [[Kuria people|Abakuria]] and the [[Ameru]] of the former Upper Eastern Province.\n \nThe immediate neighbours of Abagusii include the [[Luhya people]], [[Luo people|Luo]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. A number of clans of these neighbouring communities especially the Kipsigis have Abagusii origins.  During the pre-colonial period the Abagusii and the neighbouring communities engaged in Barter trade some of which led to the formation of modern day [[Kisumu]] city of Nyanza Province.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii are naturally very industrious and resilient despite engaging in some minimal cattle rustling activities with their neighbours.  \n\nThere's strong evidence, however, the good relationships with neighbouring communities have led to intermarriages. This is evident in the greatly varied complexion and physique between Abagusii from different subregions of Gusii. Some clans of the Suba (Abasoba in ekegusii) are said to have been completely absorbed by the Luos(Abagere in ekegusii). The Bantu community with a great many similarities with the Abagusii is the Meru (Abameru in ekegusii) from the windward slopes of Mount Kenya, although the Kuria (Abatende in ekegusii) share a great deal in common with the Abagusii in language and culture as well, and a history of intermarriage has led to prohibition of marriage alliances for specific clans of the Abagusii with some Kuria clans. Additionally, intermarriages between members of the same clans are prohibited.The Kipsigis(Abasigisi in Ekegusii), the highland nilotes bordering the Abagusii on the northern and northeastern frontier affectionately refer to the Abagusii as ''kamama'' (an appellation connoting extensive marriage alliances between the two  neighbours). Indeed, many Kipsigis can easily point to someone in their lineage (especially a matriarch) from Abagusii.\n\n=== Abagusii origins and the Nile Valley.===\n\nThe Abagusii together with [[Luhya people]] tribes, [[Kalenjin people]], and some [[Cushitic]] speaking communities are among the earliest settlers of present day Kenya and the general [[Lake Victoria]] Basin which comprises modern day [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania|Northwest Tanzania]], [[Uganda]] and geographical western Kenya. The actual migrations and settlement of Abagusii in Kenya during the pre-colonial period can be tracked to the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya as well as the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]]. The Mt. Elgon region of Kenya is in fact the original point of dispersal of Abagusii to other regions of Kenya where they settled during the pre-colonial period as well as their current homeland in Nyanza province of Kenya. The oral literature of Abagusii indicate that prior to settlement at the Mt. Elgon region, they migrated from areas further North of [[Mt. Elgon]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> This pre-Elgon homeland is referenced as Misiri according to the oral literature of Abagusii and does not state that Misiri is Egypt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> In fact Egypt as a country did not exist in pre-colonial Africa and was created in the 1950s by European conquerors just like other present African countries and the naming of the modern country of [[Egypt]] was done by Europeans. Therefore the Abagusii like other Africans did not know Egypt as the name did not exist in pre-colonial Africa. In that sense, the Misiri homeland of Abagusii is not referring to Egypt which is a country that never existed in pre-colonial Africa. Although Misiri is sometimes automatically assumed to mean the modern Egypt country and the lost tribes of Israel, the Misiri homeland of Abagusii does not refer to [[Egypt]] and lost tribes of Israel. The Misiri homeland of Abagusii does not refer to a specific area to the North of Mt. Elgon, but rather a general area to the North of Mt. Elgon. This Misiri homeland to the North of Mt. Elgon is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] which lie to the North of Mt. Elgon. During migration and settlement in present day Kenya, the Abagusii passed through the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] and settled at the Mt. Elgon region which is part of the Rift Valley. This justifies the location of Misiri homeland of Abagusii at the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to [[Ethiopia]] which all lie to the North of Mt. Elgon.  Although the [[Nile Valley]] region is generally assumed to be a homeland of the [[Nilotic]] speaking and some [[Cushitic]] speaking communities, it is also a homeland to Abagusii and some [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking communities. This is supported by strong cultural similarities between Abagusii (as well as some other [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking communities) and some cushitic speaking and Nilotic speaking communities.\n\n==Abagusii People in Pre-colonial Kenya==\nAccording to the oral literature of Abagusii, the original progenitors of Abagusii migrated to their current homeland in Nyanza from areas further North of the [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya. This pre-Mt. Elgon homeland of Abagusii is referenced as Misiri according to their oral literature. This Misiri homeland is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] due to migration through the Rift Valley Province of Kenya. After migrating from Misiri, the Abagusii passed through the present day [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] province of Kenya and first settled at the Mt. Elgon region of present day Kenya where they stayed for several years before migrating to present day Nyanza province.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Mt.Elgon region of Kenya is the original point of dispersal of Abagusii to other regions of Kenya where they settled during the pre-colonial period as well as their current homeland in [[Nyanza Province]] of Kenya. In fact the actual migrations of Abagusii can be tracked to the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya as well as the Rift Valley province of Kenya. At the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya, the Abagusii came into contact with Luhya (with exception of Maragoli) tribes most of whom had migrated from [[Uganda]]  as well as [[Ogiek]] people. The Abagusii migrated together with some [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] groups and Luo as well as most other closely related tribes such as Abamaragoli, Abakuria, Ameru, Abasoga, Abatoro, and Abakiga who are very similar to Abagusii in some aspects.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The other closely related tribes later migrated to Uganda, Rwanda and Northwest Tanzania. During their stay at Mt. Elgon region, the Abagusii  were mainly herders that kept cattle, goats, sheep, with minimal crop cultivation of finger millet, sorghum and arrow roots among other local crops. The Abagusii also practised some hunting and gathering (a practise that was borrowed from the [[Ogiek]] people of Mt. Elgon) to supplement the food they obtained from their animals and crops. The land at the Mt. Elgon area became unfavorable for their animals and crops thus forcing the Abagusii to migrate in search of good land mainly for pasture and cultivation of crops. At this time, the Abagusii migrated to Nyanza region whereas, the Abamaragoli migrated to Western Kenya and related tribes migrated to Uganda, Rwanda, and Northwest Tanzania. \n\nDuring settlement in Nyanza, the Abagusii first settled close to the shores of lake Victoria at modern day [[Kisumu]] where they practised fishing activity at lake Victoria. At lake Victoria, the Abagusii came into contact with small pockets of Bantu tribes akin to Luhya possibly from Uganda who had already settled at the shores of lake Victoria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Most these earlier Bantu tribes were later assimilated by the Luo people who later settled in much of the shores of lake Victoria after Abagusii had migrated out of Kisumu. A good example of such Bantu tribes are the [[Suba language|Luo-Abasuba]] (not to be confused with Suba-Simbete and Suba/Suna-girango who are splinter groups from Abagusii) whose [[Suba language|Olosuba language]] is very different from [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]], [[Kuria language|Egikuria]], and [[Dholuo language]] as well as other languages spoken in Nyanza. The [[Suba language|Olosuba language]] is very similar to the [[Ganda language|Luganda language]] and some Luhya languages such as Lusamia and Lunyala. A majority of these earlier Bantu tribes at the shores of lake Victoria linguistically became extinct due language shift and assimilation mainly by the Luo people as well as Abagusii. The Luo-Abasuba are the only ones  left with their own language Olosuba still existent but spoken by few people as most of them speak Dholuo and most of them were completely assimilated by the Luo people. However, the Abagusii did not stay at this area for long and had to migrate out as the land was unfavorable for their animals and cultivation and there was frequent flooding in the area.  The abagusii then migrated to present day [[Kericho]] county where they also stayed for several years before migrating to their current homeland in Gusii highlands of Nyanza. At Kericho, the Abagusii built fortified walls with thick thorn fences and dug deep trenches around their homesteads as a defense against cattle theft and raids by the Maasai and Nandi who have always been their immediate neighbors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref>\n\nThe Abagusii and Siria-maasai indeed lived side by side for several years in Kericho before Abagusii migrated to Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> A number of clans from the Nandi and Tugen as well as other Kalenjin tribes later migrated to Kericho and this led to turmoil between them and Abagusii as well as the Siria-maasai.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> They first drove the Maasai out of Kericho before doing the same to the Abagusii who stayed at what came to be known as Kabianga. Their attempts to drive the Abagusii out of Kericho were unsuccessful as the Abagusii were more armed and had stronger warriors than the Maasai who raided them at night for that reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> Some of the Abagusii families/clans remained in Kericho merged with the Nandi, Tugen and other Nilotic Kalenjin clans  as well as Ogiek forming the modern day [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] tribe. However, A majority of the Abagusii had to migrate out of Kericho as the area was deeply forested and unfavorable for crop cultivation and pasture for the animals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abagusii named the region where they stayed in Kericho as \"Kabianga\" which means \"to refuse\" to imply that crops and pasture for their livestock refused to grow. In fact most Abagusii cattle died and crops failed which caused famine and death of members of the community and this forced them to migrate to modern day Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> At this point the Abagusii and Abakuria split into two distinct tribes with the Abakuria migrating to Migori and eventually to Northwest Tanzania where most of them reside today.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abakuria  group that settled in Northwest Tanzania particularly the Mara and lake Victoria regions of Tanzania formed other tribes that populated much of Mara and lake Victoria region of Tanzania. A good example of such other closely related tribes include; Zanaki, Ngurimi, Ikoma and Haya among other related tribes in Northwest Tanzania. The other group originally part of the Abakuria group later migrated to modern Rwanda and Southern Uganda in the case of Abakiga and Abatoro who are linguistically and culturally similar to Abagusii. Indeed the oral traditions of Abakiga indicate migration from Northern Rwanda to Southern Uganda. From Kericho, the Abagusii migrated to their current homeland of Gusii highlands in Nyanza which was also originally forested just like Kericho. The Abagusii gradually cleared the forests in Gusii highlands for settlement and herding as well as crop cultivation. The forest cover on Gusii highlands has since then continued to decline as the Abagusii population became more and more dense as it is today. Some of the forests were cleared for tea plantations just like neighboring Kericho and Bomet counties of today. The Abagusii were originally organized into family units analogous to clans. The major Abagusii clans included, Abagetutu, Ababasi, Abanyaribari, Abanchari, Abagirango and others. However, during the 19 century with the introduction of maize, tea and coffee as well as other crops, the Abagusii now largely practise crop cultivation alongside keeping animals despite originally being predominantly pastoralists.\n\n==The Abagusii People today.==\nThe Abagusii are regarded as one of the most economically active communities in Kenya, with rolling tea estates, coffee, and banana groves. However, Kisii district has a very high population density. It is one of the most densely populated areas in Kenya (after the two cities of Nairobi and Mombasa), and the most densely populated rural area. It also has one of the highest fertility and population growth rates in Kenya (as evidenced by successive census and demographic surveys). In fact the fertility rate of Kisii ranks among the highest in the world, (see ''Kenyan Conundrum: A Regional Analysis of Population Growth and Primary Education (Paperback) by '''Juha I. Uitto [Author]''')''. These factors have ensured the Abagusii to be among the most geographically widespread communities in East Africa. A disproportionately large number of Abagusii have gone abroad in search of education.The Abagusii are some of the most heavily represented Kenyans in foreign (usually Indian and American) universities and a few in the United Kingdom.\nTheir lands are currently overpopulated despite their rolling fertile hills, spurring immigration to other cities in Kenya and a substantial representation in the [[United States]], especially in major hub cities like [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Jersey City]], [[Dallas]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]]. The hard cash that flows from the diaspora has spawned significant economic prosperity in a locale lacking in politically motivated 'hand-me downs'.\n\nThe Abagusii people have as a result moved out of their two counties and can be found virtually in any part of Kenya and beyond. In [[Nairobi]], Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu and many other towns in Kenya, they run most businesses. For example, the \"matatu\" business in Nairobi estates like Utawala, kawangware, Dandora, Embakasi, Kitengela, Matasia, etc. They have bought land and are residents in most of these Nairobi estates like Utawala, Ruai, Joska, Kamulu, Kitengela, Rongai, Ngong, etc. They are generally, by nature, independent and thorough in their pursuits whether in education, professional practices, or even religious belief(Islam,  Christianity or Traditional African religions); making them more visible that their absolute numbers.The Abagusii people are very diverse in terms of culture, religion and appearance(ranging from caucasoid like to negroid like features). Abagusii people are not related to the Kissi people of West Africa or to the Kisi people of Malawi\n\n==Abagusii Relationship with Nilotic and Cushitic speakers.==\n\nThe division of indigenous African peoples into; Nilotic, Bantu, Niger-Congo, Cushitic, Sudanic, West Sudanic (West Africans), Nilo-saharan, Afro-asiatic, Chadic and Khoisan linguistic groups was a purely European concept that never existed in pre-colonial Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> These linguistic classifications began in 1900s with [[ Joseph Greenberg]] and other European scholars and conquerors pioneering the idea of dividing African into different linguistic groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> The creation of all these linguistic groups made colonization of Africa easier as Africa was divided into regions based on the created linguistic groups. For instance, Southern African was defined as [[Khoisan]] area, Eastern Africa as a [[Cushitic]] area, Central Africa (and sometimes West Africa) as a [[Bantu]] area, Sahelian region and Nile valley as a Nilo-saharan area and West Africa as a West Sudanic area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> After creation of all these linguistic groups, collective histories for each group were created that assumed common origin of each linguistic group. For example, the Nilotic speaking communities were assumed to be from [[South Sudan]], the Cushitic speaking communities were assumed to be from [[Ethiopia]] and the Bantu speaking communities were assumed to be from the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> These linguistic groups were also associated with specific economic activities regardless of what they practised. For instance, the Cushitic and Nilotic speaking communities were assumed to be all herders, and the Bantu speaking communities were assumed to be all farmers. Each of these linguistic group was assumed to be all genetically homogeneous and DNA haplogroups such as E1b1a, E1b1b, BM60, A3 and A1b1 were created for each group.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=E |title=Contrasting patterns of Y chromosome and mtDNA variation in Africa: evidence for sex-biased demographic processes.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Filippo |first1=C |title=Y-Chromosomal Variation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights Into the History of Niger-Congo Groups.

All these groups were polarized against each other depending on region and ethnic groups hence some of the conflicts and bitter relations witnessed today between different linguistic groups. Creation of these linguistic groups is one of the major contributing factor to the blanket stereotypes created against each of these linguistic groups in the modern African societies. In the context of [[Kenya]], the Abagusii relationship with the neighboring Nilotic speaking communities such as [[Maasai people]], [[Nandi people]], [[Kipsigis people]] and [[Luo people]] has always been painted as negative on social media and in public opinions of some people especially scholars and researchers. The Nilotic speaking communities have been stereotyped as hostile and warlike compared to the Abagusii people and the Bantu speaking African tribes in general. Despite these public opinions, the Abagusii indeed have had good relationships with the neighboring [[Nilotic]] speaking communities who have always been their neighbors since many years prior to colonization of Africa. Prior to colonization, the Abagusii engaged in barter trade with these communities especially the [[Luo people]] and at times worked together during cattle raids to defeat the raiders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> For instance, the Abagusii together with Luo and Maasai worked together to defeat the [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] cattle raiders. \n\nThe Abagusii and Maasai also lived side by side around Kericho for many years before the Abagusii migration to their current homeland of Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> The co-existence between the Abagusii and the neighboring [[Nilotic]] communities was largely peaceful despite these communities and Abagusii occassionally engaging in cattle rustling activities which were sometimes violent. The cattle rustling and raiding was mainly common among the [[Maasai people]] and to a lesser extent the [[Kalenjin people]] who believed that cattle were given to them by God to control and take care of them. The Abagusii have more in common with the Nilotic speaking communities in terms of culture as well as migration and settlement patterns compared to the [[Bantu]] speaking communities. For instance, the Abagusii were originally predominantly herders in pre-colonial Africa and farmers to a lesser extent which is very similar to the Nilotic communities. The migration routes and settlement patterns of Abagusii in present day Kenya are very similar to those of the [[Kalenjin people]], [[Ateker people]] including [[Maasai people]] and [[Luo people]]. For instance, the original point of dispersal to other regions of Kenya was [[Mt. Elgon]] for the Abagusii, [[Kalenjin people]], [[Luo people]] and [[Ateker people]]. A number of clans of the neighboring Nilotic communities especially the Kipsigis have Abagusii origins suggesting a very close relationship between Abagusii and neighboring Nilotic speaking communities. In terms of relationship with the cushitic communities, the Abagusii don't live in close proximity with the [[Cushitic]] speaking communities that are mostly found in geographical Eastern and Northern Kenya. However, there is similarity between the Abagusii cultures and cultures of some cushitic communities particularly the East Cushitic communities such as [[Konso people]] and [[Oromo people]]. For instance, a majority of the Cushitic communities are herders which was originally dominant among Abagusii though still practised to a lesser extent. The oral literature of Abagusii indicate migration from Misiri that lie at the North of [[Mt. Elgon]] prior to settlement at the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> This pre-Elgon homeland of Abagusii is the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] thus the many similarities between Abagusii and the Nilotic and Cushitic speaking communities. The general conclusion is that the Abagusii have more in common with the Cushitic and Nilotic communities than the Bantu speaking communities in several aspects. These similarities suggest that Abagusii share origins with some Cushitic and Nilotic communities. On the basis of the Abagusii history and migration routes, they could be more genetically related to some Nilotic and Cushitic communities than they are related to the Bantu speaking communities. Indeed a majority of Abagusii share physical appearance with the some Bantu and Nilotic speaking communities with some sharing physical appearance with some Cushitic speaking communities. For instance, an outsider will confuse a majority of Abagusii with the Cushitic speaking communities, Nilotic speakers and so being confused for the other Bantu speaking communities.\n\n==Abagusii Relationship with East Africa Bantu speakers==\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii mostly had contact with the luo, Nandi, Kipsigis and maasai who have always been their immediate neighbors as well as other tribes at the [[Lake Victoria]] region of East Africa. The Abagusii Engaged in Barter Trade with some of these communities such as Luhya, Luo, Nandi, Kipsigis and maasai as well as other Lake Victoria communities depending on proximity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abagusii had very limited contact with the Bantu speaking communities and led very independent and distinct life styles from a majority of the Bantu communities of East Africa and possibly the entire continent of Africa. Indeed even the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii language]] is significantly different from most East African as well as other Bantu languages of Africa in some structural elements.This supports the view that  Abagusii were originally separate from other East African Bantu tribes as well as the Bantu language group as whole, despite being linguistically classified as Bantu since the 1900s. In the context of Kenya, the Abagusii originally never had contact with the Bantu speaking communities in former central, Eastern and coastal provinces of Kenya. This is with the exception of [[Ameru]] that migrated to the former Upper Eastern province from geographical Western Kenya. Even in terms of linguistics, the Abagusii are closest to the Bantu communities at the Lake Victoria region as compared to communities in central, Eastern and Coastal provinces of Kenya as well as a large chunk of Tanzania which also borders lake Victoria. However, in the post-colonial period with the availability of modern transportation, the Abagusii have been able to contact the Bantu speaking communities in Central, Eastern and coastal provinces of Kenya with who they originally had no contact with. The Abagusii have also been able to learn of other Bantu communities they never knew before such as those far away from the lake region of Tanzania, Uganda and other African countries through modern Education on African linguistic groups.  A majority of the tribes now labelled Bantu barely knew each other during the precolonial period as they were originally very scattered and didn't have the concept of the term Bantu as a linguistic marker denoting hundreds of diverse tribes in Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> In the precolonial period the term Abantu (The term Abantu is a Nguni term and has distinct versions in other Bantu languages) out of which the term Bantu was coined, was only used to mean people with no Bantu as a linguistic group in mind.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The tribes now labelled as Bantu never had a sense of unity or belonging together during the precolonial period as they were very scattered and led very distinct and independent life styles having no knowledge of each other.\n\n\n===Etymology of Bantu and Relevance to Abagusii.===\n\nThe term \"Bantu\" originates from the Nguni languages of Southern Africa from the term \"Abantu\" which means people and was coined by [[Wilhelm Bleek]] in 1850s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The term was originally and initially used in South Africa during the apartheid rule to refer to non-Khoisan South Africans and was later used as a linguistic marker denoting hundreds or thousands of unrelated tribes in Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The term \"Bantu\" has no grammatical meaning in the Nguni languages out of which it was coined. The singular form of the word Abantu is Umuntu which lenders the term Bantu meaningless as it makes no grammatical sense. The term Bantu as well as the so called Bantu speakers did not exist in precolonial Africa. Prior to colonization of Africa, the term \"Abantu\" as well as its other distinct versions in other so called Bantu languages was used to simply mean people and nothing more than just that. However, beginning 1900s with classification of indigenous African peoples into; Bantu, Niger-Congo, Nilotes, Nilo-saharan, Sudanic, West Sudanic(West Africans), Cushites, Afro-Asiatic, Hamites,and Khoisan,the term Bantu started being used in reference to tribes that occupy Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref>, <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref>These thousands of tribes were assumed to be the same and having a common origin on the basis of using words similar to Abantu in reference to people. The languages spoken by these tribes were also assumed to be the same and having a common origin on the basis of possessing words similar to Abantu.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The assumption that these very diverse and unconnected tribes share a common origin on the basis of the terms similar to Abantu contributed to them being lumped up together into one collective group called Bantu. The assumption that the Bantu languages are the same is not necessarily right given that these languages have very minimal structural similarities and lack mutual intelligibility. The speakers of these languages don't understand each other and were originally unconnected to each other. In precolonial Africa, these tribes barely knew each other and were very scattered with very little to no contact with each other. These tribes also never had a sense of unity or belonging together and led very independent and distinct life styles with no prior knowledge of each other. \n\nAfter creation of the Bantu linguistic group, a collective history was coined that assumed that all these thousands of tribes originated at the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]] and expanded from their to other parts of Africa where they are found.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> The assumption that these very diverse tribes that were originally very scattered and disunited expanded together from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon is rather absurd.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> This raises the question of when these originally unconnected tribes learnt about each other and  decided to expand together from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon where they are absent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> This leads to conclusion that the so called Bantu expansion never occurred and the expansion was just used to justify land dispossession from the black South Africans during apartheid as well as other Africans during the colonial period. The assumption that thousands of the so called Bantu speaking tribes expanded from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon and are genetically and linguistically homogeneous is rather absurd and inaccurate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> The Bantu speaking tribes are in fact the most diverse in Africa in terms of genetics, culture, appearance, origins, history and linguistics. The general assumption that belonging to the Bantu linguistic group automatically makes people genetically related is also quite absurd as these thousands of tribes lack a common origin and were randomly labelled Bantu on the basis of the simple term Abantu. Speaking a Bantu language does not necessarily mean that one cannot be related to people from other linguistic groups given that all these groups were also randomly lumped up together. For instance, the Bantu speaking tribes in Southern Africa are genetically more related to [[Khoisan]] than they are related to East African Bantu tribes and other regions. The Bantu speaking tribes in East Africa especially [[Kenya]] are also genetically more related to the [[Nilotic]] and [[Cushitic]] speaking communities than to the Central African Bantu speaking tribes that are also more related to Southern African Bantu speaking communities. Therefore the term Bantu has no genetic meaning other than just being a linguistic marker of several thousands of unrelated tribes. The over 600 Bantu languages are distinct from each other enough to be treated as distinct languages that don't belong to one collective linguistic group. In terms of importance, the term Bantu only has meaning to the Nguni languages out of which it was coined as well as other tribes with the exact spellings of the term \"Abantu\". The term is of no meaning and importance to Abagusii as it is a mere linguistic marker and not a genetic marker of several diverse African tribes.\n\n==Agriculture and biodiversity in Gusiiland.==\n\nIn the past, Gusiiland was a heavily forested area, with old indigenous broadleaf rainforest trees and other flora. It was part of the old Congo Basin forests. The only remnant of this old forest in Kenya is the Kakamega Forest, which is the westernmost tip of the Equatorial rainforest. The two ancient forest areas were linked through Nandi and Kericho, before the Nandi and Kericho areas were cleared for tea farming and settlement. Now most of the tree life in Gusiiland consists of members of 4 tree families, all of them introduced from outside the continent. The most common trees in Gusiiland are the ''Eucalyptus spp.'' family (blue gum/eucalyptus), ''Grevillea robusta'' and Black Wattle (Acacia mearnsii). All these three species are native to Australia. Finally, there is the ''Cupressus spp.'' family (cypress) native to South America. Other plant life forms are cultivated tea, bananas, maize, coffee and napier grass, with very little remaining of indigenous biodiversity.\n\nIt has been theorized that in future Gusiiland will increasingly be 'colonized' by the above few species of plants, as there is little awareness or even desire to re-plant the slow-growing and less economically valuable indigenous plant forms. This is aggravated by land shortage and reduced need for traditional herbal medicine, that has now been surpassed by modern hospitals and medical care.\n\n==Abagusii Economic Activities.==\n\n===Subsistence Agriculture and Herding.===\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii cultivated finger millet, sorghum, root crops and bananas as well as other local crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> By 1920s with introduction of maize to Gusiiland, finger millet and sorghum were largely replaced by maize as a staple and cash crop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Other crops cultivated by Abagusii today include cassava, potatoes, tomatoes, bananas, beans, onions, tropical fruits and peas as well as several other crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> By 1930s, coffee and tea had reached Gusiiland and were being cultivated as major cash crops. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> During the pre-colonial period as well as early colonial period, the Ox-drawn plows and iron hoes were used in the cultivation of crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today the same cultivation tools are used alongside modern cultivation tools. During the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii were predominantly herders that kept cattle, goats and sheep as well as kept poultry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today, the Abagusii still keep livestock and poultry alongside farming.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The high population density of Abagusii has contributed to utilization of available land for agriculture to satisfy subsistence and commercial needs thus making farming a dominant activity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> In addition to agriculture, the Abagusii also carry out business activities in major towns and cities in Kenya and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also participate in white collar jobs in Kenya and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial Activities===\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, Abagusii produced iron tools, weapons, decorations, wooden implements, and baskets for diverse uses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also made pottery products such as pots and imported some from the neighboring Luo community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The most respected and highly valued activity was smelting of iron ore and manufacture of iron tools.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The blacksmiths were highly respected, wealthy and influential members of Abagusii society, but did not form a special caste as the Abagusii society was not based on caste stratifications.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Smithing activities were mainly carried out by men.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Trade===\nThe form of trade carried out on pre-colonial Gusiiland was barter trade and mostly took place within homesteads as well as with neighboring communities especially the Luo people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The major products exchanged included tools, weapons, crafts, livestock, and agricultural products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The cattle served as a form of currency among Abagusii for the products exchanged and goats were used as a currency for lower valued products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The barter trade between Abagusii and Luo took place at border markets and at Abagusii farms and was mainly carried out by women.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today with advent of modern concept of trade, the Abagusii have established shopping centers, shops and markets which have connected them with other regions of Kenya beside the neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> These markets are increasing exponentially and the Abagusii are getting more and more connected to the rest of Kenya as opposed to the pre-colonial Kenya where they only had contact with neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Division of Labor.===\nIn the traditional Abagusii society, labor was divided between males and females. The women specific duties included cooking, crop cultivation and processing, fetching water and firewood, brewing, and cleaning while the men specific duties included herding, building houses and fences, and clearing cultivation fields, and other duties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Men were also involved in crop cultivation but with more responsibilities than women. Herding was primarily carried out by boys and unmarried men in the grazing fields and girls and unmarried young women helped with crop cultivation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today the division of labor between males and females has significantly changed and is now disadvantageous to women as they perform most of the duties traditionally meant for men. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> There is no longer equal distribution of labor between men and women as it was traditionally.\n\n==Language==\nThey speak the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]] (also called omonwa Bwekegusii). However, some older texts refer to this community as ''Kosova''. This language and some other [[Great Lakes Bantu languages]] have some similarities in structure but not mutually intelligible. They are markedly similar to the Bakiga of south western Uganda in culture, industry and choice of terrain. The LuTooro language of Western Uganda shares a great many words with Ekegusii. For instance, \"''omoiseke''\" is the Ekegusii for 'girl' and the word in LuTooro is just the same save for a slight difference in inflection.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Abagusii play a large bass [[lyre]] called ''[[obokano]]''. They are also known by their world-famous soapstone sculptures \"chigware\" mostly concentrated in the southern parts of Kisii County around Tabaka town. Circumcision of boys at around age of 10 as a rite of passage without anesthesia is common among the Abagusii. The girls also underwent clitoridectomy as a form of circumcision at an earlier age than boys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> This ritual takes place annually in the months of November and December followed by a period of seclusion during which the boys are led in different activities by older boys and girls are led by older girls, and is a great time of celebration indeed for families and communities at large. Family, friends and neighbors are invited days in advance by candidates to join the family. During this period of seclusion only older circumcised boys and girls are allowed to visit the secluded initiates and any other visitor could cause a taboo. Its during this period that initiates were taught their roles as young men in the community and the do's and the don'ts of a circumcised man. The initiated boys and girls were also taught the rules of same (\"Chinsoni\") and respect (\"Ogosika\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\nSome of the notable musicians from the Abagusii community include Nyashinski, Rajiv Okemwa Raj, Ringtone, Mwalimu Arisi O'sababu, Christopher Monyoncho, Sungusia, Riakimai '91 Jazz, Embarambamba, Bonyakoni Kirwanda junior band, Mr Ong'eng'o, Grandmaster Masese, Deepac Braxx (The Heavyweight Mc), Jiggy, Mr. Bloom, Virusi, Babu Gee, Brax Rnb, Sabby Okengo, Machoge One Jazz,among others.\n\n==Abagusii Religion, faith and beliefs==\n\nPrior to Introduction of Christianity and Islam to Africa, the Abagusii people believed in a supreme God called Engoro. This same God is also popularly called Nyasae among Abagusii. The Abagusii believe that Engoro also known as Nyasae created the Universe and was the source of all life. Death and disease was considered unnatural events brought on by witchcraft. The Abagusii also believed in medicine men and the spirits of their ancestors called \"Ebirecha\". The displeasure of ancestor spirits was evidenced by disease, death of people and livestock as well as destruction of crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> However, today a majority of Abagusii people practise Christianity with the Adventist protestant Christianity being the most dominant and a few practising Catholicism. A minority of Abagusii still adhere to their traditional religion and some being dual religion observing Christianity alongside their traditional religion. The practise of Islam among Abagusii is very little to absent.\n\n==Marriage==\n\nAmong the Abagusii community, traditional marriage was arranged by the parents, using intermediaries called \"chisigani\", who also acted as referees for the bride and groom to be. The parents negotiated the dowry and organised a traditional wedding. The traditional wedding ceremony involved a mentor called \"omoimari\" who could provide continuing support to the newly married couple. Currently, civil and Christian marriages are recognized among the Abagusii. It is essential to note that traditions within the Abagusii community prohibit marriages between members of the same clan. Marriage was officially established through payment of dowry in the form of cattle to the wife's family.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Payment of dowry allowed man and woman to be considered husband and wife and gave room for a traditional marriage ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Divorce is traditionally not allowed among Abagusii as marriage is considered a permanent union that is only disrupted by death.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Living Conditions===\n\nTraditionally, a typical Gusii family is polygamous with one man having more than one wife that live in the same homestead. The polygamous family was divided into two constituents namely the homestead called \"Omochie\" and the cattle camps called \"Ebisarate\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The married man and his wives and their unmarried daughters and uncircumcised boys lived in the \"Omochie\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The \"Ebisarate\" were situated in the grazing fields and were protected by male warriors against theft by cattle rustlers and raiders.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The traditional Gusii compound also had elevated granaries for storage of crop harvests such as millet and other crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii traditionally built fortified walls around their homesteads and villages for protection against cattle rustling wars,and raids by neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also dug trenches around their homesteads for the purposes of protection against raids. The fortified walls built around homesteads and villages as well as trenches also served as a protection against dangerous wild animals. However, the cattle camps were abolished in 1913 by the British forcing Abagusii to live in dispersed homesteads as compared to traditional homestead set up.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> A typical traditional Gusii house is mad-walled with a conical grass thatched roofs that is mainly round and sometimes rectangular in shape.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The modern houses are still mad-wall with round and rectangular shapes but the roofs have corrugated iron sheets and grass thatched.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also built stone-walled houses today.\n\n==Food and Nutrition==\n\nTheir staple meal is Obokima (dish of millet flour, or Sorghum flour cooked with water to a hardened dough-like consistency). It is often served with ''rinagu, chinsaga, rikuneni, enderema,emboga,omotere, risosa, egesare'' among other locally available green leaves consumed as vegetables. It can also be served with any other stew. The word for ''\"having a meal\" [ragera]'' usually connotes a meal involving ''[obokima]'' at the centre. However, by 1920s maize had been introduced to Gusiiland and had overtaken finger millet and sorghum as staple crops and cash crops which ensured that maize became the new dominant staple crop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> As a result, maize flour is now largely used to prepare Obokima although millet and sorghum flour is still used to a lesser extent. The Obokima was also served with milk particularly sour milk from livestock.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Although frequently associated with \"ritoke\" (plural \"amatoke\", cooked and flavoured bananas), this is usually supplemental and not considered to be a proper meal, but a popular snack.\n\n==Notable Abagusii People==\n* [[David Kenani Maraga]], President of the [[Supreme Court of Kenya]].\n* [[Zachary Onyonka]], Former Education and Foreign Affairs Minister\n* [[Sam Ongeri]], Former Minister of Foreign Affairs and current Senator of Kisii County\n* [[Fred Matiang'i]],  Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Interior  and Coordination of National Security\n* [[Simeon Nyachae]], Former Cabinet Minister\n* [[James Ongwae]], First Governor of Kisii County\n* [[Caspal Maina Momanyi]],Assistant Education Permanent Secretary\n* [[Janet Ong'era]], Kisii County Woman Member of [[National Assembly (Kenya)|The National Assembl]]<nowiki/>y\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n1.

The Abagusii are also found in other regions of geographical Western Kenya. The Abagusii speak [[Gusii language|Ekegusii language]] which is classified together with the [[Great Lakes Bantu languages]].  Mogusii is culturally identified as their founder and patriarch. The Abagusii are however, unrelated to the [[Kisi people]] of Malawi and the [[Kissi people]] of West Africa, other than the three very distinct communities having similar sounding tribal names.\n\n[[Kisii, Kenya|Kisii town]] - known as [[Kisii, Kenya|Bosongo]] or Getembe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ekegusiiencyclopedia.com/towns-urban-centres|title=Urban centres in Gusii|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> by the locals - is located in [[Nyanza Province]] to the southwest of Kenya and is home to the Abagusii people. However, the term Kisii refers to the town and not to the people. The name Bosongo is believed to have originated from Abasongo (to mean the Whites or the place where white people settle(d)) who lived in the town during the colonial times.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritative Ekegusii-English Dictionary|last=Bosire|first=Kennedy|publisher=Ekegusii Encyclopedia Project|year=2013|isbn=|location=Nairobi|pages=}}</ref>\nAccording to the 1979 census, Kisii District had a population of 588,000. The AbaGusii increased to 2.2 million in the latest Kenya Census 2009.\n\n==Etymology of the Word Kisii==\nThe term Kisii is a Swahili name that is used by Swahili speakers to refer to the Abagusii people. The term was also popularly used during the colonial period by the British administration in reference to Abagusii as it was much easier to pronounce.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The term Kisii however has no meaning in Ekegusii language as it is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> In the Swahili language the singular form of the word is Mkisii and the plural form is Wakisii which only make sense in the Swahili language and related coastal and Central Bantu languages of Kenya. The Swahili name for the Ekegusii language is Kikisii. The term is now popularly used in Kenya to refer to Abagusii people although that is not what they are called.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Among Abagusii the name Kisii is used to only mean [[Kisii town]] and not to the people. The original and correct name by the people for themselves is Omogusii in singular and  Abagusii in plural and the language spoken by the people is Ekegusii. The term gusii comes from Mogusii who was the founder of the community. However, the speculation that the term Gusii comes from Gwassi is incorrect as the Abagusii never lived near Gwassi hills of the modern [[Homa Bay]] county and Gwassi is a Luo-Abasuba name for one of their sub-groups.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii History |url=https://www.bluegecko.org/kenya/tribes/gusii/history.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii only lived shortly and passed through modern day [[Kisumu]] in the course of their migration and settlement in Nyanza. The terms \"Gwassi\" and \"Gusii\" don't really even sound or look alike as an ordinary ignorant person may assume. The two terms have distinct pronunciations and Etymology. The term \"Gwassi\" originates from the [[Suba language|Olosuba]] language spoken by Luo-Abasuba and is used to refer to one of their sub-groups and Gwassi hills. The term \"Gusii\" on the other hand, originates from the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]] and specifically from the name \"Mogusii\" who was the founder of the community. The term \"Gusii\" is not used as a reference to any geographical features such as hills in Gusiiland which is commonly referred to as Gusii highlands due to presence of several hills in the region. The terms \"Kisii\" and \"Gusii\" are also not synonyms as most people tend to assume and have distinct etymology and pronunciation just like the terms \"Gwassi\" and \"Gusii\". The Ekegusii language also does not have the \"SS\" but just \"S\" in their alphabet as people tend to ignorantly assume when spelling Gusii words.\n\n==Origins of the Abagusii==\nAccording to the oral literature of Abagusii, they migrated to present day Kenya from areas further North of [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya. This pre-Elgon homeland of Abagusii is referenced as Misiri and is a general area to the North of Mt. Elgon and does not state that Misiri is Egypt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> This Misiri homeland is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern day [[Ethiopia]] due to migration through the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] province of Kenya and settlement at the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya largely part of the Rift Valley. The Misiri homeland of Abagusii is unconnected to the so called popular Hamitic hypothesis by [[C.G. Seligman]] on the migration of hamites from North Africa that introduced advanced civilizations to Sub-Saharan Africa. The oral traditions similar to those of Abagusii are also found in the  [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]], [[Ameru]] and [[Kuria people|Abakuria]] that are most closely related to Abagusii with the Ameru and Abakuria being the closest.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> Similar oral traditions are also found in some [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] tribes some (especially Kipsigis) of who are related to Abagusii and/or migrated together with Abagusii despite being linguistically classified as Nilotic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref>  As these Bantu speakers migrated from their semi-mythical homeland(Misiri),they first settled at the [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya for several years before migrating to current homelands. From Mt. Elgon, these Bantu speakers split up into different groups with the Abagusii ending up in Nyanza Province near [[Lake Victoria]]. The [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]] settled in Western Kenya and the [[Ameru]] later migrated to the former upper Eastern province of Kenya where they later formed relationships with neighboring communities such as [[Borana people]] and communities in Central and lower Eastern provinces of Kenya. The other closely related [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking groups mostly settled in modern day [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Tanzania|Northwest Tanzania]]. In Kenya the Abagusii, are most closely related with the [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]], [[Kuria people|Abakuria]] and the [[Ameru]] of the former Upper Eastern Province.\n \nThe immediate neighbours of Abagusii include the [[Luhya people]], [[Luo people|Luo]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. A number of clans of these neighbouring communities especially the Kipsigis have Abagusii origins.  During the pre-colonial period the Abagusii and the neighbouring communities engaged in Barter trade some of which led to the formation of modern day [[Kisumu]] city of Nyanza Province.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii are naturally very industrious and resilient despite engaging in some minimal cattle rustling activities with their neighbours.  \n\nThere's strong evidence, however, the good relationships with neighbouring communities have led to intermarriages. This is evident in the greatly varied complexion and physique between Abagusii from different subregions of Gusii. Some clans of the Suba (Abasoba in ekegusii) are said to have been completely absorbed by the Luos(Abagere in ekegusii). The Bantu community with a great many similarities with the Abagusii is the Meru (Abameru in ekegusii) from the windward slopes of Mount Kenya, although the Kuria (Abatende in ekegusii) share a great deal in common with the Abagusii in language and culture as well, and a history of intermarriage has led to prohibition of marriage alliances for specific clans of the Abagusii with some Kuria clans. Additionally, intermarriages between members of the same clans are prohibited.The Kipsigis(Abasigisi in Ekegusii), the highland nilotes bordering the Abagusii on the northern and northeastern frontier affectionately refer to the Abagusii as ''kamama'' (an appellation connoting extensive marriage alliances between the two  neighbours). Indeed, many Kipsigis can easily point to someone in their lineage (especially a matriarch) from Abagusii.\n\n=== Abagusii origins and the Nile Valley.===\n\nThe Abagusii together with [[Luhya people]] tribes, [[Kalenjin people]], and some [[Cushitic]] speaking communities are among the earliest settlers of present day Kenya and the general [[Lake Victoria]] Basin which comprises modern day [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania|Northwest Tanzania]], [[Uganda]] and geographical western Kenya. The actual migrations and settlement of Abagusii in Kenya during the pre-colonial period can be tracked to the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya as well as the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]]. The Mt. Elgon region of Kenya is in fact the original point of dispersal of Abagusii to other regions of Kenya where they settled during the pre-colonial period as well as their current homeland in Nyanza province of Kenya. The oral literature of Abagusii indicate that prior to settlement at the Mt. Elgon region, they migrated from areas further North of [[Mt. Elgon]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> This pre-Elgon homeland is referenced as Misiri according to the oral literature of Abagusii and does not state that Misiri is Egypt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> In fact Egypt as a country did not exist in pre-colonial Africa and was created in the 1950s by European conquerors just like other present African countries and the naming of the modern country of [[Egypt]] was done by Europeans. Therefore the Abagusii like other Africans did not know Egypt as the name did not exist in pre-colonial Africa. In that sense, the Misiri homeland of Abagusii is not referring to Egypt which is a country that never existed in pre-colonial Africa. Although Misiri is sometimes automatically assumed to mean the modern Egypt country and the lost tribes of Israel, the Misiri homeland of Abagusii does not refer to [[Egypt]] and lost tribes of Israel. The Misiri homeland of Abagusii does not refer to a specific area to the North of Mt. Elgon, but rather a general area to the North of Mt. Elgon. This Misiri homeland to the North of Mt. Elgon is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] which lie to the North of Mt. Elgon. During migration and settlement in present day Kenya, the Abagusii passed through the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] and settled at the Mt. Elgon region which is part of the Rift Valley. This justifies the location of Misiri homeland of Abagusii at the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to [[Ethiopia]] which all lie to the North of Mt. Elgon.  Although the [[Nile Valley]] region is generally assumed to be a homeland of the [[Nilotic]] speaking and some [[Cushitic]] speaking communities, it is also a homeland to Abagusii and some [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking communities. This is supported by strong cultural similarities between Abagusii (as well as some other [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking communities) and some cushitic speaking and Nilotic speaking communities.\n\n==Abagusii People in Pre-colonial Kenya==\nAccording to the oral literature of Abagusii, the original progenitors of Abagusii migrated to their current homeland in Nyanza from areas further North of the [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya. This pre-Mt. Elgon homeland of Abagusii is referenced as Misiri according to their oral literature. This Misiri homeland is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] due to migration through the Rift Valley Province of Kenya. After migrating from Misiri, the Abagusii passed through the present day [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] province of Kenya and first settled at the Mt. Elgon region of present day Kenya where they stayed for several years before migrating to present day Nyanza province.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Mt.Elgon region of Kenya is the original point of dispersal of Abagusii to other regions of Kenya where they settled during the pre-colonial period as well as their current homeland in [[Nyanza Province]] of Kenya. In fact the actual migrations of Abagusii can be tracked to the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya as well as the Rift Valley province of Kenya. At the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya, the Abagusii came into contact with Luhya (with exception of Maragoli) tribes most of whom had migrated from [[Uganda]]  as well as [[Ogiek]] people. The Abagusii migrated together with some [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] groups and Luo as well as most other closely related tribes such as Abamaragoli, Abakuria, Ameru, Abasoga, Abatoro, and Abakiga who are very similar to Abagusii in some aspects.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The other closely related tribes later migrated to Uganda, Rwanda and Northwest Tanzania. During their stay at Mt. Elgon region, the Abagusii  were mainly herders that kept cattle, goats, sheep, with minimal crop cultivation of finger millet, sorghum and arrow roots among other local crops. The Abagusii also practised some hunting and gathering (a practise that was borrowed from the [[Ogiek]] people of Mt. Elgon) to supplement the food they obtained from their animals and crops. The land at the Mt. Elgon area became unfavorable for their animals and crops thus forcing the Abagusii to migrate in search of good land mainly for pasture and cultivation of crops. At this time, the Abagusii migrated to Nyanza region whereas, the Abamaragoli migrated to Western Kenya and related tribes migrated to Uganda, Rwanda, and Northwest Tanzania. \n\nDuring settlement in Nyanza, the Abagusii first settled close to the shores of lake Victoria at modern day [[Kisumu]] where they practised fishing activity at lake Victoria. At lake Victoria, the Abagusii came into contact with small pockets of Bantu tribes akin to Luhya possibly from Uganda who had already settled at the shores of lake Victoria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Most these earlier Bantu tribes were later assimilated by the Luo people who later settled in much of the shores of lake Victoria after Abagusii had migrated out of Kisumu. A good example of such Bantu tribes are the [[Suba language|Luo-Abasuba]] (not to be confused with Suba-Simbete and Suba/Suna-girango who are splinter groups from Abagusii) whose [[Suba language|Olosuba language]] is very different from [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]], [[Kuria language|Egikuria]], and [[Dholuo language]] as well as other languages spoken in Nyanza. The [[Suba language|Olosuba language]] is very similar to the [[Ganda language|Luganda language]] and some Luhya languages such as Lusamia and Lunyala. A majority of these earlier Bantu tribes at the shores of lake Victoria linguistically became extinct due language shift and assimilation mainly by the Luo people as well as Abagusii. The Luo-Abasuba are the only ones  left with their own language Olosuba still existent but spoken by few people as most of them speak Dholuo and most of them were completely assimilated by the Luo people. However, the Abagusii did not stay at this area for long and had to migrate out as the land was unfavorable for their animals and cultivation and there was frequent flooding in the area.  The abagusii then migrated to present day [[Kericho]] county where they also stayed for several years before migrating to their current homeland in Gusii highlands of Nyanza. At Kericho, the Abagusii built fortified walls with thick thorn fences and dug deep trenches around their homesteads as a defense against cattle theft and raids by the Maasai and Nandi who have always been their immediate neighbors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref>\n\nThe Abagusii and Siria-maasai indeed lived side by side for several years in Kericho before Abagusii migrated to Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> A number of clans from the Nandi and Tugen as well as other Kalenjin tribes later migrated to Kericho and this led to turmoil between them and Abagusii as well as the Siria-maasai.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> They first drove the Maasai out of Kericho before doing the same to the Abagusii who stayed at what came to be known as Kabianga. Their attempts to drive the Abagusii out of Kericho were unsuccessful as the Abagusii were more armed and had stronger warriors than the Maasai who raided them at night for that reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> Some of the Abagusii families/clans remained in Kericho merged with the Nandi, Tugen and other Nilotic Kalenjin clans  as well as Ogiek forming the modern day [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] tribe. However, A majority of the Abagusii had to migrate out of Kericho as the area was deeply forested and unfavorable for crop cultivation and pasture for the animals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abagusii named the region where they stayed in Kericho as \"Kabianga\" which means \"to refuse\" to imply that crops and pasture for their livestock refused to grow. In fact most Abagusii cattle died and crops failed which caused famine and death of members of the community and this forced them to migrate to modern day Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> At this point the Abagusii and Abakuria split into two distinct tribes with the Abakuria migrating to Migori and eventually to Northwest Tanzania where most of them reside today.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abakuria  group that settled in Northwest Tanzania particularly the Mara and lake Victoria regions of Tanzania formed other tribes that populated much of Mara and lake Victoria region of Tanzania. A good example of such other closely related tribes include; Zanaki, Ngurimi, Ikoma and Haya among other related tribes in Northwest Tanzania. The other group originally part of the Abakuria group later migrated to modern Rwanda and Southern Uganda in the case of Abakiga and Abatoro who are linguistically and culturally similar to Abagusii. Indeed the oral traditions of Abakiga indicate migration from Northern Rwanda to Southern Uganda. From Kericho, the Abagusii migrated to their current homeland of Gusii highlands in Nyanza which was also originally forested just like Kericho. The Abagusii gradually cleared the forests in Gusii highlands for settlement and herding as well as crop cultivation. The forest cover on Gusii highlands has since then continued to decline as the Abagusii population became more and more dense as it is today. Some of the forests were cleared for tea plantations just like neighboring Kericho and Bomet counties of today. The Abagusii were originally organized into family units analogous to clans. The major Abagusii clans included, Abagetutu, Ababasi, Abanyaribari, Abanchari, Abagirango and others. However, during the 19 century with the introduction of maize, tea and coffee as well as other crops, the Abagusii now largely practise crop cultivation alongside keeping animals despite originally being predominantly pastoralists.\n\n==The Abagusii People today.==\nThe Abagusii are regarded as one of the most economically active communities in Kenya, with rolling tea estates, coffee, and banana groves. However, Kisii district has a very high population density. It is one of the most densely populated areas in Kenya (after the two cities of Nairobi and Mombasa), and the most densely populated rural area. It also has one of the highest fertility and population growth rates in Kenya (as evidenced by successive census and demographic surveys). In fact the fertility rate of Kisii ranks among the highest in the world, (see ''Kenyan Conundrum: A Regional Analysis of Population Growth and Primary Education (Paperback) by '''Juha I. Uitto [Author]''')''. These factors have ensured the Abagusii to be among the most geographically widespread communities in East Africa. A disproportionately large number of Abagusii have gone abroad in search of education.The Abagusii are some of the most heavily represented Kenyans in foreign (usually Indian and American) universities and a few in the United Kingdom.\nTheir lands are currently overpopulated despite their rolling fertile hills, spurring immigration to other cities in Kenya and a substantial representation in the [[United States]], especially in major hub cities like [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Jersey City]], [[Dallas]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]]. The hard cash that flows from the diaspora has spawned significant economic prosperity in a locale lacking in politically motivated 'hand-me downs'.\n\nThe Abagusii people have as a result moved out of their two counties and can be found virtually in any part of Kenya and beyond. In [[Nairobi]], Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu and many other towns in Kenya, they run most businesses. For example, the \"matatu\" business in Nairobi estates like Utawala, kawangware, Dandora, Embakasi, Kitengela, Matasia, etc. They have bought land and are residents in most of these Nairobi estates like Utawala, Ruai, Joska, Kamulu, Kitengela, Rongai, Ngong, etc. They are generally, by nature, independent and thorough in their pursuits whether in education, professional practices, or even religious belief(Islam,  Christianity or Traditional African religions); making them more visible that their absolute numbers.The Abagusii people are very diverse in terms of culture, religion and appearance(ranging from caucasoid like to negroid like features). Abagusii people are not related to the Kissi people of West Africa or to the Kisi people of Malawi\n\n==Abagusii Relationship with Nilotic and Cushitic speakers.==\n\nThe division of indigenous African peoples into; Nilotic, Bantu, Niger-Congo, Cushitic, Sudanic, West Sudanic (West Africans), Nilo-saharan, Afro-asiatic, Chadic and Khoisan linguistic groups was a purely European concept that never existed in pre-colonial Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> These linguistic classifications began in 1900s with [[ Joseph Greenberg]] and other European scholars and conquerors pioneering the idea of dividing African into different linguistic groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> The creation of all these linguistic groups made colonization of Africa easier as Africa was divided into regions based on the created linguistic groups. For instance, Southern African was defined as [[Khoisan]] area, Eastern Africa as a [[Cushitic]] area, Central Africa (and sometimes West Africa) as a [[Bantu]] area, Sahelian region and Nile valley as a Nilo-saharan area and West Africa as a West Sudanic area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> After creation of all these linguistic groups, collective histories for each group were created that assumed common origin of each linguistic group. For example, the Nilotic speaking communities were assumed to be from [[South Sudan]], the Cushitic speaking communities were assumed to be from [[Ethiopia]] and the Bantu speaking communities were assumed to be from the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> These linguistic groups were also associated with specific economic activities regardless of what they practised. For instance, the Cushitic and Nilotic speaking communities were assumed to be all herders, and the Bantu speaking communities were assumed to be all farmers. Each of these linguistic group was assumed to be all genetically homogeneous and DNA haplogroups such as E1b1a, E1b1b, BM60, A3 and A1b1 were created for each group.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=E |title=Contrasting patterns of Y chromosome and mtDNA variation in Africa: evidence for sex-biased demographic processes.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Filippo |first1=C |title=Y-Chromosomal Variation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights Into the History of Niger-Congo Groups.

All these groups were polarized against each other depending on region and ethnic groups hence some of the conflicts and bitter relations witnessed today between different linguistic groups. Creation of these linguistic groups is one of the major contributing factor to the blanket stereotypes created against each of these linguistic groups in the modern African societies. In the context of [[Kenya]], the Abagusii relationship with the neighboring Nilotic speaking communities such as [[Maasai people]], [[Nandi people]], [[Kipsigis people]] and [[Luo people]] has always been painted as negative on social media and in public opinions of some people especially scholars and researchers. The Nilotic speaking communities have been stereotyped as hostile and warlike compared to the Abagusii people and the Bantu speaking African tribes in general. Despite these public opinions, the Abagusii indeed have had good relationships with the neighboring [[Nilotic]] speaking communities who have always been their neighbors since many years prior to colonization of Africa. Prior to colonization, the Abagusii engaged in barter trade with these communities especially the [[Luo people]] and at times worked together during cattle raids to defeat the raiders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> For instance, the Abagusii together with Luo and Maasai worked together to defeat the [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] cattle raiders. \n\nThe Abagusii and Maasai also lived side by side around Kericho for many years before the Abagusii migration to their current homeland of Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> The co-existence between the Abagusii and the neighboring [[Nilotic]] communities was largely peaceful despite these communities and Abagusii occassionally engaging in cattle rustling activities which were sometimes violent. The cattle rustling and raiding was mainly common among the [[Maasai people]] and to a lesser extent the [[Kalenjin people]] who believed that cattle were given to them by God to control and take care of them. The Abagusii have more in common with the Nilotic speaking communities in terms of culture as well as migration and settlement patterns compared to the [[Bantu]] speaking communities. For instance, the Abagusii were originally predominantly herders in pre-colonial Africa and farmers to a lesser extent which is very similar to the Nilotic communities. The migration routes and settlement patterns of Abagusii in present day Kenya are very similar to those of the [[Kalenjin people]], [[Ateker people]] including [[Maasai people]] and [[Luo people]]. For instance, the original point of dispersal to other regions of Kenya was [[Mt. Elgon]] for the Abagusii, [[Kalenjin people]], [[Luo people]] and [[Ateker people]]. A number of clans of the neighboring Nilotic communities especially the Kipsigis have Abagusii origins suggesting a very close relationship between Abagusii and neighboring Nilotic speaking communities. In terms of relationship with the cushitic communities, the Abagusii don't live in close proximity with the [[Cushitic]] speaking communities that are mostly found in geographical Eastern and Northern Kenya. However, there is similarity between the Abagusii cultures and cultures of some cushitic communities particularly the East Cushitic communities such as [[Konso people]] and [[Oromo people]]. For instance, a majority of the Cushitic communities are herders which was originally dominant among Abagusii though still practised to a lesser extent. The oral literature of Abagusii indicate migration from Misiri that lie at the North of [[Mt. Elgon]] prior to settlement at the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> This pre-Elgon homeland of Abagusii is the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] thus the many similarities between Abagusii and the Nilotic and Cushitic speaking communities. The general conclusion is that the Abagusii have more in common with the Cushitic and Nilotic communities than the Bantu speaking communities in several aspects. These similarities suggest that Abagusii share origins with some Cushitic and Nilotic communities. On the basis of the Abagusii history and migration routes, they could be more genetically related to some Nilotic and Cushitic communities than they are related to the Bantu speaking communities. Indeed a majority of Abagusii share physical appearance with the some Bantu and Nilotic speaking communities with some sharing physical appearance with some Cushitic speaking communities. For instance, an outsider will confuse a majority of Abagusii with the Cushitic speaking communities, Nilotic speakers and so being confused for the other Bantu speaking communities.\n\n==Abagusii Relationship with East Africa Bantu speakers==\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii mostly had contact with the luo, Nandi, Kipsigis and maasai who have always been their immediate neighbors as well as other tribes at the [[Lake Victoria]] region of East Africa. The Abagusii Engaged in Barter Trade with some of these communities such as Luhya, Luo, Nandi, Kipsigis and maasai as well as other Lake Victoria communities depending on proximity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abagusii had very limited contact with the Bantu speaking communities and led very independent and distinct life styles from a majority of the Bantu communities of East Africa and possibly the entire continent of Africa. Indeed even the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii language]] is significantly different from most East African as well as other Bantu languages of Africa in some structural elements.This supports the view that  Abagusii were originally separate from other East African Bantu tribes as well as the Bantu language group as whole, despite being linguistically classified as Bantu since the 1900s. In the context of Kenya, the Abagusii originally never had contact with the Bantu speaking communities in former central, Eastern and coastal provinces of Kenya. This is with the exception of [[Ameru]] that migrated to the former Upper Eastern province from geographical Western Kenya. Even in terms of linguistics, the Abagusii are closest to the Bantu communities at the Lake Victoria region as compared to communities in central, Eastern and Coastal provinces of Kenya as well as a large chunk of Tanzania which also borders lake Victoria. However, in the post-colonial period with the availability of modern transportation, the Abagusii have been able to contact the Bantu speaking communities in Central, Eastern and coastal provinces of Kenya with who they originally had no contact with. The Abagusii have also been able to learn of other Bantu communities they never knew before such as those far away from the lake region of Tanzania, Uganda and other African countries through modern Education on African linguistic groups.  A majority of the tribes now labelled Bantu barely knew each other during the precolonial period as they were originally very scattered and didn't have the concept of the term Bantu as a linguistic marker denoting hundreds of diverse tribes in Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> In the precolonial period the term Abantu (The term Abantu is a Nguni term and has distinct versions in other Bantu languages) out of which the term Bantu was coined, was only used to mean people with no Bantu as a linguistic group in mind.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The tribes now labelled as Bantu never had a sense of unity or belonging together during the precolonial period as they were very scattered and led very distinct and independent life styles having no knowledge of each other.\n\n\n===Etymology of Bantu and Relevance to Abagusii.===\n\nThe term \"Bantu\" originates from the Nguni languages of Southern Africa from the term \"Abantu\" which means people and was coined by [[Wilhelm Bleek]] in 1850s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The term was originally and initially used in South Africa during the apartheid rule to refer to non-Khoisan South Africans and was later used as a linguistic marker denoting hundreds or thousands of unrelated tribes in Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The term \"Bantu\" has no grammatical meaning in the Nguni languages out of which it was coined. The singular form of the word Abantu is Umuntu which lenders the term Bantu meaningless as it makes no grammatical sense. The term Bantu as well as the so called Bantu speakers did not exist in precolonial Africa. Prior to colonization of Africa, the term \"Abantu\" as well as its other distinct versions in other so called Bantu languages was used to simply mean people and nothing more than just that. However, beginning 1900s with classification of indigenous African peoples into; Bantu, Niger-Congo, Nilotes, Nilo-saharan, Sudanic, West Sudanic(West Africans), Cushites, Afro-Asiatic, Hamites,and Khoisan,the term Bantu started being used in reference to tribes that occupy Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref>, <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref>These thousands of tribes were assumed to be the same and having a common origin on the basis of using words similar to Abantu in reference to people. The languages spoken by these tribes were also assumed to be the same and having a common origin on the basis of possessing words similar to Abantu.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The assumption that these very diverse and unconnected tribes share a common origin on the basis of the terms similar to Abantu contributed to them being lumped up together into one collective group called Bantu. The assumption that the Bantu languages are the same is not necessarily right given that these languages have very minimal structural similarities and lack mutual intelligibility. The speakers of these languages don't understand each other and were originally unconnected to each other. In precolonial Africa, these tribes barely knew each other and were very scattered with very little to no contact with each other. These tribes also never had a sense of unity or belonging together and led very independent and distinct life styles with no prior knowledge of each other. \n\nAfter creation of the Bantu linguistic group, a collective history was coined that assumed that all these thousands of tribes originated at the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]] and expanded from their to other parts of Africa where they are found.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> The assumption that these very diverse tribes that were originally very scattered and disunited expanded together from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon is rather absurd.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> This raises the question of when these originally unconnected tribes learnt about each other and  decided to expand together from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon where they are absent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> This leads to conclusion that the so called Bantu expansion never occurred and the expansion was just used to justify land dispossession from the black South Africans during apartheid as well as other Africans during the colonial period. The assumption that thousands of the so called Bantu speaking tribes expanded from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon and are genetically and linguistically homogeneous is rather absurd and inaccurate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> The Bantu speaking tribes are in fact the most diverse in Africa in terms of genetics, culture, appearance, origins, history and linguistics. The general assumption that belonging to the Bantu linguistic group automatically makes people genetically related is also quite absurd as these thousands of tribes lack a common origin and were randomly labelled Bantu on the basis of the simple term Abantu. Speaking a Bantu language does not necessarily mean that one cannot be related to people from other linguistic groups given that all these groups were also randomly lumped up together. For instance, the Bantu speaking tribes in Southern Africa are genetically more related to [[Khoisan]] than they are related to East African Bantu tribes and other regions. The Bantu speaking tribes in East Africa especially [[Kenya]] are also genetically more related to the [[Nilotic]] and [[Cushitic]] speaking communities than to the Central African Bantu speaking tribes that are also more related to Southern African Bantu speaking communities. Therefore the term Bantu has no genetic meaning other than just being a linguistic marker of several thousands of unrelated tribes. The over 600 Bantu languages are distinct from each other enough to be treated as distinct languages that don't belong to one collective linguistic group. In terms of importance, the term Bantu only has meaning to the Nguni languages out of which it was coined as well as other tribes with the exact spellings of the term \"Abantu\". The term is of no meaning and importance to Abagusii as it is a mere linguistic marker and not a genetic marker of several diverse African tribes.\n\n==Agriculture and biodiversity in Gusiiland.==\n\nIn the past, Gusiiland was a heavily forested area, with old indigenous broadleaf rainforest trees and other flora. It was part of the old Congo Basin forests. The only remnant of this old forest in Kenya is the Kakamega Forest, which is the westernmost tip of the Equatorial rainforest. The two ancient forest areas were linked through Nandi and Kericho, before the Nandi and Kericho areas were cleared for tea farming and settlement. Now most of the tree life in Gusiiland consists of members of 4 tree families, all of them introduced from outside the continent. The most common trees in Gusiiland are the ''Eucalyptus spp.'' family (blue gum/eucalyptus), ''Grevillea robusta'' and Black Wattle (Acacia mearnsii). All these three species are native to Australia. Finally, there is the ''Cupressus spp.'' family (cypress) native to South America. Other plant life forms are cultivated tea, bananas, maize, coffee and napier grass, with very little remaining of indigenous biodiversity.\n\nIt has been theorized that in future Gusiiland will increasingly be 'colonized' by the above few species of plants, as there is little awareness or even desire to re-plant the slow-growing and less economically valuable indigenous plant forms. This is aggravated by land shortage and reduced need for traditional herbal medicine, that has now been surpassed by modern hospitals and medical care.\n\n==Abagusii Economic Activities.==\n\n===Subsistence Agriculture and Herding.===\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii cultivated finger millet, sorghum, root crops and bananas as well as other local crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> By 1920s with introduction of maize to Gusiiland, finger millet and sorghum were largely replaced by maize as a staple and cash crop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Other crops cultivated by Abagusii today include cassava, potatoes, tomatoes, bananas, beans, onions, tropical fruits and peas as well as several other crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> By 1930s, coffee and tea had reached Gusiiland and were being cultivated as major cash crops. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> During the pre-colonial period as well as early colonial period, the Ox-drawn plows and iron hoes were used in the cultivation of crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today the same cultivation tools are used alongside modern cultivation tools. During the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii were predominantly herders that kept cattle, goats and sheep as well as kept poultry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today, the Abagusii still keep livestock and poultry alongside farming.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The high population density of Abagusii has contributed to utilization of available land for agriculture to satisfy subsistence and commercial needs thus making farming a dominant activity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> In addition to agriculture, the Abagusii also carry out business activities in major towns and cities in Kenya and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also participate in white collar jobs in Kenya and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial Activities===\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, Abagusii produced iron tools, weapons, decorations, wooden implements, and baskets for diverse uses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also made pottery products such as pots and imported some from the neighboring Luo community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The most respected and highly valued activity was smelting of iron ore and manufacture of iron tools.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The blacksmiths were highly respected, wealthy and influential members of Abagusii society, but did not form a special caste as the Abagusii society was not based on caste stratifications.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Smithing activities were mainly carried out by men.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Trade===\nThe form of trade carried out on pre-colonial Gusiiland was barter trade and mostly took place within homesteads as well as with neighboring communities especially the Luo people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The major products exchanged included tools, weapons, crafts, livestock, and agricultural products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The cattle served as a form of currency among Abagusii for the products exchanged and goats were used as a currency for lower valued products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The barter trade between Abagusii and Luo took place at border markets and at Abagusii farms and was mainly carried out by women.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today with advent of modern concept of trade, the Abagusii have established shopping centers, shops and markets which have connected them with other regions of Kenya beside the neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> These markets are increasing exponentially and the Abagusii are getting more and more connected to the rest of Kenya as opposed to the pre-colonial Kenya where they only had contact with neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Division of Labor.===\nIn the traditional Abagusii society, labor was divided between males and females. The women specific duties included cooking, crop cultivation and processing, fetching water and firewood, brewing, and cleaning while the men specific duties included herding, building houses and fences, and clearing cultivation fields, and other duties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Men were also involved in crop cultivation but with more responsibilities than women. Herding was primarily carried out by boys and unmarried men in the grazing fields and girls and unmarried young women helped with crop cultivation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today the division of labor between males and females has significantly changed and is now disadvantageous to women as they perform most of the duties traditionally meant for men. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> There is no longer equal distribution of labor between men and women as it was traditionally.\n\n==Language==\nThey speak the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]] (also called omonwa Bwekegusii). However, some older texts refer to this community as ''Kosova''. This language and some other [[Great Lakes Bantu languages]] have some similarities in structure but not mutually intelligible. They are markedly similar to the Bakiga of south western Uganda in culture, industry and choice of terrain. The LuTooro language of Western Uganda shares a great many words with Ekegusii. For instance, \"''omoiseke''\" is the Ekegusii for 'girl' and the word in LuTooro is just the same save for a slight difference in inflection.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Abagusii play a large bass [[lyre]] called ''[[obokano]]''. They are also known by their world-famous soapstone sculptures \"chigware\" mostly concentrated in the southern parts of Kisii County around Tabaka town. Circumcision of boys at around age of 10 as a rite of passage without anesthesia is common among the Abagusii. The girls also underwent clitoridectomy as a form of circumcision at an earlier age than boys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> This ritual takes place annually in the months of November and December followed by a period of seclusion during which the boys are led in different activities by older boys and girls are led by older girls, and is a great time of celebration indeed for families and communities at large. Family, friends and neighbors are invited days in advance by candidates to join the family. During this period of seclusion only older circumcised boys and girls are allowed to visit the secluded initiates and any other visitor could cause a taboo. Its during this period that initiates were taught their roles as young men in the community and the do's and the don'ts of a circumcised man. The initiated boys and girls were also taught the rules of same (\"Chinsoni\") and respect (\"Ogosika\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\nSome of the notable musicians from the Abagusii community include Nyashinski, Rajiv Okemwa Raj, Ringtone, Mwalimu Arisi O'sababu, Christopher Monyoncho, Sungusia, Riakimai '91 Jazz, Embarambamba, Bonyakoni Kirwanda junior band, Mr Ong'eng'o, Grandmaster Masese, Deepac Braxx (The Heavyweight Mc), Jiggy, Mr. Bloom, Virusi, Babu Gee, Brax Rnb, Sabby Okengo, Machoge One Jazz,among others.\n\n==Abagusii Religion, faith and beliefs==\n\nPrior to Introduction of Christianity and Islam to Africa, the Abagusii people believed in a supreme God called Engoro. This same God is also popularly called Nyasae among Abagusii. The Abagusii believe that Engoro also known as Nyasae created the Universe and was the source of all life. Death and disease was considered unnatural events brought on by witchcraft. The Abagusii also believed in medicine men and the spirits of their ancestors called \"Ebirecha\". The displeasure of ancestor spirits was evidenced by disease, death of people and livestock as well as destruction of crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> However, today a majority of Abagusii people practise Christianity with the Adventist protestant Christianity being the most dominant and a few practising Catholicism. A minority of Abagusii still adhere to their traditional religion and some being dual religion observing Christianity alongside their traditional religion. The practise of Islam among Abagusii is very little to absent.\n\n==Marriage==\n\nAmong the Abagusii community, traditional marriage was arranged by the parents, using intermediaries called \"chisigani\", who also acted as referees for the bride and groom to be. The parents negotiated the dowry and organised a traditional wedding. The traditional wedding ceremony involved a mentor called \"omoimari\" who could provide continuing support to the newly married couple. Currently, civil and Christian marriages are recognized among the Abagusii. It is essential to note that traditions within the Abagusii community prohibit marriages between members of the same clan. Marriage was officially established through payment of dowry in the form of cattle to the wife's family.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Payment of dowry allowed man and woman to be considered husband and wife and gave room for a traditional marriage ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Divorce is traditionally not allowed among Abagusii as marriage is considered a permanent union that is only disrupted by death.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Living Conditions===\n\nTraditionally, a typical Gusii family is polygamous with one man having more than one wife that live in the same homestead. The polygamous family was divided into two constituents namely the homestead called \"Omochie\" and the cattle camps called \"Ebisarate\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The married man and his wives and their unmarried daughters and uncircumcised boys lived in the \"Omochie\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The \"Ebisarate\" were situated in the grazing fields and were protected by male warriors against theft by cattle rustlers and raiders.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The traditional Gusii compound also had elevated granaries for storage of crop harvests such as millet and other crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii traditionally built fortified walls around their homesteads and villages for protection against cattle rustling wars,and raids by neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also dug trenches around their homesteads for the purposes of protection against raids. The fortified walls built around homesteads and villages as well as trenches also served as a protection against dangerous wild animals. However, the cattle camps were abolished in 1913 by the British forcing Abagusii to live in dispersed homesteads as compared to traditional homestead set up.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> A typical traditional Gusii house is mad-walled with a conical grass thatched roofs that is mainly round and sometimes rectangular in shape.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The modern houses are still mad-wall with round and rectangular shapes but the roofs have corrugated iron sheets and grass thatched.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also built stone-walled houses today.\n\n==Food and Nutrition==\n\nTheir staple meal is Obokima (dish of millet flour, or Sorghum flour cooked with water to a hardened dough-like consistency). It is often served with ''rinagu, chinsaga, rikuneni, enderema,emboga,omotere, risosa, egesare'' among other locally available green leaves consumed as vegetables. It can also be served with any other stew. The word for ''\"having a meal\" [ragera]'' usually connotes a meal involving ''[obokima]'' at the centre. However, by 1920s maize had been introduced to Gusiiland and had overtaken finger millet and sorghum as staple crops and cash crops which ensured that maize became the new dominant staple crop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> As a result, maize flour is now largely used to prepare Obokima although millet and sorghum flour is still used to a lesser extent. The Obokima was also served with milk particularly sour milk from livestock.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Although frequently associated with \"ritoke\" (plural \"amatoke\", cooked and flavoured bananas), this is usually supplemental and not considered to be a proper meal, but a popular snack.\n\n==Notable Abagusii People==\n* [[David Kenani Maraga]], President of the [[Supreme Court of Kenya]].\n* [[Zachary Onyonka]], Former Education and Foreign Affairs Minister\n* [[Sam Ongeri]], Former Minister of Foreign Affairs and current Senator of Kisii County\n* [[Fred Matiang'i]],  Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Interior  and Coordination of National Security\n* [[Simeon Nyachae]], Former Cabinet Minister\n* [[James Ongwae]], First Governor of Kisii County\n* [[Caspal Maina Momanyi]],Assistant Education Permanent Secretary\n* [[Janet Ong'era]], Kisii County Woman Member of [[National Assembly (Kenya)|The National Assembl]]<nowiki/>y\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n1.
