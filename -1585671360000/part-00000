Limmy frequently breaks the [[fourth wall]] by directly talking to viewers through the camera.

Several of the characters seen in ''Limmy's Show'' were originally created through this podcast, including Jacqueline McCafferty, Wee Gary and Dee Dee.  The first series, which was approved following a successful pilot in February 2009, first aired on 11 January 2010 and ran weekly for six episodes.

These sketches range from short pieces of satire to dancing and complete non-sequitur jokes. On several occasions, he criticises ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performances, with himself keyed in over the footage. \n* '''Jacqueline McCafferty''' \u2013 An ex-junkie who spent three years of her life on heroin and a further five years on a methadone treatment programme. Jacqueline tries her hardest to fit in with the middle and upper classes and is very bitter about people looking down their nose at her. \n* '''Falconhoof''' \u2013 The humble, soft-spoken and consistently well-intentioned costumed host of \"Adventure Call\", a live televised [[call-in show]] in which he guides players through a fantasy [[role-playing game]] in order to win cash prizes. He regularly has to deal with angry, unexpected and sometimes misleading or threatening callers and situations.\n* '''Derek \"Dee Dee\" Durie''' \u2013 A spaced-out waster who spends his time doing absolutely nothing but over-analysing trivial things. He prefaces each monologue with \"Fockin'...\"\n* '''Raymond Day''' '''''(series 2-3)''''' \u2013 A smug television psychic medium based on [[Colin Fry]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} who imparts devastatingly terrible information on particular members of his otherwise happy crowd. He (as well as the other members of the audience) seems to be completely oblivious as to the emotional horror he is putting those members through.\n* '''Larry Forsyth Experiments''' '''''(series 2-3)''''' \u2013 These sketches are a series of experiments which the title character \"Larry Forsyth\" conducts with fictional drugs, which often have strange hallucinatory effects, and always end up with a nurse coming into the room and subduing him. The sketch is presented as a black and white TV show from the 1950s, modelled on an infamous unaired episode of ''Panorama'' in which [[Christopher Mayhew]] carried out a similar experiment using [[mescaline]].\n* '''Mr. Mulvaney''' '''''(series 1 & special)''''' \u2013 A mischievous 60-year-old businessman constantly thinking of ways to avoid the law as he struggles with his desires to engage in acts of petty crime.\n* '''Wee Gary''' '''''(series 1)''''' \u2013 A primary schooler who spends his breaks and lunch times trying to capitalise upon his fellow pupils with manipulative tact and by selling anything and everything.\n* '''Supercomputer''' '''''(series 1)''''' \u2013 Limmy controls a supercomputer to wreak havoc on the things he hates in society and cause mischief in everyday life.\n* '''John Paul''' '''''(series 1)''''' \u2013 A teenage working class [[Ned (Scottish)|ned]] and all-round trouble maker who terrorises and humiliates his victims, behaving in a loutish way. He has a persistent, negative social media presence.\n* '''The Spies''' '''''(series 2)''''' - Two inept spies who are intent on 'getting something' on the other one, yet foiled by their inability to predict one another's actions.\n\n== Honours ==\n''Limmy's Show!'' has won a [[BAFTA Scotland|Scottish BAFTA]] award for Best Entertainment Programme twice, the first time in November 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeclyde.com/news--events/news/clyde-at-scottish-baftas |title=Winners at Scottish BAFTA\u2019s: Creative Clyde members win awards |publisher=Creativeclyde.com |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> and the second one in 2013 <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/film/scottish-baftas-for-those-in-peril-wins-big-1-3191997 |title=Scottish Baftas: For Those In Peril wins big |first=Brian |last=Ferguson |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=17 November 2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{BBC programme}}\n* {{IMDb title|1495848}}\n* {{British Comedy Guide|tv|limmys_show}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[Category:BBC Scotland television programmes]]\n[[Category:BBC television comedy]]\n[[Category:BBC Scotland television sketch shows]]\n[[Category:2010 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2010 establishments in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Surreal comedy television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Limmy's Show!\n| image                    = Limmy's-Show-Title-Screen.jpg\n| caption                  = ''Limmy's Show!'' title card\n| runtime                  = 30 minutes\n| company                  = [[The Comedy Unit]]\n| creator                  = [[Limmy|Brian Limond]]\n| starring                 = Brian Limond<br />[[Paul McCole]]<br />[[Alan McHugh]]<br />[[Kirstin McLean]]<br />[[Raymond Mearns]]<br />Tom Brogan<br />Debbie Welsh\n| director                 = Brian Limond\n| writer                   = Brian Limond\n| producer                 = Rab Christie\n| executive_producer       = Jacqueline Sinclair\n| country                  = Scotland\n| language                 = [[Scots language|Scots]], [[English language|English]]\n| network                  = [[BBC Two Scotland]]\n| num_series               = 3\n| num_episodes             = 20 (+pilot and one special)\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2010|1|11|df=y}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|2013|12|22|df=y}}\n}}\n\n'''''Limmy's Show!''''' is a Scottish [[comedy]] [[sketch show]] broadcast on [[BBC Two Scotland]], written and directed by [[Limmy|Brian Limond]].

Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]] was joined by three other justices in asserting that the Eleventh Amendment was nothing more than a reflection of common law sovereignty that could be swept aside by Congress; [[Justice Scalia]] was also joined by three other justices in taking the opposite view; and Justice [[Byron White]] wrote a separate opinion holding that Congress had such power, but stating his disagreement with Brennan's opinion (but not his own rationale).\n\nNow, the Supreme Court was once again presented with the question of whether Congress has the power to abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states, pursuant to the powers granted to it in Article One.\n\n==Supreme Court==\n===Arguments===\n===Opinion of the Court===\n[[File:William Rehnquist.jpg |thumb |left |200px |alt=photograph of Chief Justice William Rehnquist|Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], author of the opinion]]\nThe Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], struck down this abrogation as unconstitutional and further held that the doctrine of ''Ex parte Young'' does not apply in this situation.\n\nThe Court began by repudiating the precedential value of ''Union Gas'', noting that there was no single majority rationale, and characterizing it as a major departure from the 19th century case of ''[[Hans v. Louisiana]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Hans v. Louisiana|volume=134|page=1|pin=|year=1890}}.</ref> which had established the modern doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Court suggested that allowing Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity improperly expanded the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond what [[Article Three of the U.S. Constitution]] permitted. The Eleventh Amendment, it contended, had further protected the states' sovereign immunity; the Fourteenth Amendment placed limitations on the Eleventh Amendment, but only with respect to the rights guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Court also found that the doctrine of ''Ex parte Young'' did not apply, invoking the rationale of an earlier case, ''[[Schweiker v. Chilicky]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Schweiker v. Chilicky|volume=487|page=412|pin=|year=1988}}.</ref> for the proposition that where Congress had provided a remedial scheme, the Courts would not [[implied cause of action|imply]] the existence of additional remedies.\n\n===Dissenting Opinions===\n[[Justice Souter]] wrote a lengthy dissent in which he was joined by Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]]. Souter's dissent focuses on the language of the Eleventh Amendment, which only appears to eliminate [[diversity jurisdiction]] between states and citizens of ''other'' states. He rejects the \"critical errors\" in ''Hans'', which had read common law sovereign immunity to extend the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment to suits between states and their ''own'' citizens. Souter discounts the importance of the common law in interpreting the Constitution because the Constitution itself was such a new and unprecedented device at the time of its creation that it was clearly intended as a rejection of the common law that came before it. As support for this contention, Souter notes that the framers of the U.S. Constitution did not include language adopting the common law that had already been adopted by many of the states in their own constitutions. Souter also notes that Congress had rejected proposed language for the Eleventh Amendment which would clearly have barred suits between states and their own citizens, and which would clearly have prevented Congress from abrogating this bar.\n\nSouter also disagrees with the Court's rejection of ''Ex parte Young'', noting that where ''Chilicky'' was a rejection of the extra-statutory remedy proposed, ''Young'' was merely a jurisdictional device. Souter found it implausible that Congress would wish to see their statute made ''completely'' unenforceable simply because they had included a remedy for those injured by the failure of states to abide by it.\n\nJustice Stevens dissented separately, agreeing with the points raised in Souter's dissent, but adding some additional observations. In particular, Stevens noted that neither Justice Iredell's dissent in ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'',<ref name=Chisholm>{{ussc|name=Chisholm v. Georgia|link=|volume=2|page=419|pin=|year=1793|reporter=Dall.|reporter-volume=2}}.</ref> nor the majority opinion in ''Hans'' had addressed situations in which Congress had specifically authorized a lawsuit against a state and suggested that both opinions had in fact presumed that such a suit was possible.\n\n==Subsequent developments==\nThe decision in ''Seminole Tribe'' was described as having \"exemplified the Court's increasingly adamant refusal to countenance the headlong expansion of Congress's regulatory power under the Constitution's Commerce Clause\".<ref name=\"Waltenburg 121\">Eric N. Waltenburg, Bill Swinford, ''Litigating Federalism: The States Before the U.S. Supreme Court'' (1999), p. 121.</ref> In ''[[Alden v. Maine]]'' (1999), the Court clarified:\n\n{{quote|[S]overeign immunity derives not from the Eleventh Amendment but from the structure of the original Constitution itself....

Maine]]'', 527 U.S. at 732 (1999).</ref>}}\n\nIn ''[[Central Virginia Community College v. Katz]]'' (2006), the Court narrowed the scope of its ruling in ''Seminole Tribe v. Florida''.

The statute provided that if a state failed to enter into such negotiations, or to negotiate in [[good faith]], the Tribes could sue the state in [[United States federal court|federal court]] in order to compel the states to negotiate. If the states still refused, the statute provided that the matter would ultimately be referred to the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Congress had asserted its power under the part of the [[Commerce Clause]] relating to commerce with Indians to pass such a statute, abrogating the immunity of states pursuant to its express powers.\n\n===Case history===\n\n====Facts of the case====\nThe [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]] requested that the state enter into such a negotiation. When the state refused, the Tribe filed suit,<ref>{{Smallcaps|Eric N. Waltenburg and Bill Swinford}}, {{Smallcaps| Litigating Federalism: The States Before the U.S. Supreme Court}} 1-2 (1992) (hereinafter cited as \"{{Smallcaps|Waltenburg, Litigating Federalism}}\").</ref> as allowed by the statute, against both the state of Florida and the governor, [[Lawton Chiles]].

Bitzer]]'', the Court had held that Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment, which clearly contemplates limiting the power of the states.<ref>''Fitzpatrick'', 427 U.S. at 456.</ref> In ''[[Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.]]'', the Court had held that Congress could also abrogate sovereign immunity under the [[Commerce Clause]] \u2013 but there was no majority in that decision.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants= Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.|vol=491|reporter=U.S.|opinion=1|pinpoint=|court=|date=1989 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/491/1/|quote=}}</ref> [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]] was joined by three other justices in asserting that the Eleventh Amendment was nothing more than a reflection of common law sovereignty that could be swept aside by Congress; [[Justice Scalia]] was also joined by three other justices in taking the opposite view; and Justice [[Byron White]] wrote a separate opinion holding that Congress had such power, but stating his disagreement with Brennan's opinion (but not his own rationale).\n\nNow, the Supreme Court was once again presented with the question of whether Congress has the power to abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states, pursuant to the powers granted to it in Article One.\n\n==Supreme Court==\n===Arguments===\n===Opinion of the Court===\n[[File:William Rehnquist.jpg |thumb |left |200px |alt=photograph of Chief Justice William Rehnquist|Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], author of the opinion]]\nThe Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], struck down this abrogation as unconstitutional and further held that the doctrine of ''Ex parte Young'' does not apply in this situation.\n\nThe Court began by repudiating the precedential value of ''Union Gas'', noting that there was no single majority rationale, and characterizing it as a major departure from the 19th century case of ''[[Hans v. Louisiana]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Hans v. Louisiana|volume=134|page=1|pin=|year=1890}}.</ref> which had established the modern doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Court suggested that allowing Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity improperly expanded the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond what [[Article Three of the U.S. Constitution]] permitted. The Eleventh Amendment, it contended, had further protected the states' sovereign immunity; the Fourteenth Amendment placed limitations on the Eleventh Amendment, but only with respect to the rights guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Court also found that the doctrine of ''Ex parte Young'' did not apply, invoking the rationale of an earlier case, ''[[Schweiker v. Chilicky]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Schweiker v. Chilicky|volume=487|page=412|pin=|year=1988}}.</ref> for the proposition that where Congress had provided a remedial scheme, the Courts would not [[implied cause of action|imply]] the existence of additional remedies.\n\n===Dissenting Opinions===\n[[Justice Souter]] wrote a lengthy dissent in which he was joined by Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]]. Souter's dissent focuses on the language of the Eleventh Amendment, which only appears to eliminate [[diversity jurisdiction]] between states and citizens of ''other'' states. He rejects the \"critical errors\" in ''Hans'', which had read common law sovereign immunity to extend the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment to suits between states and their ''own'' citizens. Souter discounts the importance of the common law in interpreting the Constitution because the Constitution itself was such a new and unprecedented device at the time of its creation that it was clearly intended as a rejection of the common law that came before it. As support for this contention, Souter notes that the framers of the U.S. Constitution did not include language adopting the common law that had already been adopted by many of the states in their own constitutions. Souter also notes that Congress had rejected proposed language for the Eleventh Amendment which would clearly have barred suits between states and their own citizens, and which would clearly have prevented Congress from abrogating this bar.\n\nSouter also disagrees with the Court's rejection of ''Ex parte Young'', noting that where ''Chilicky'' was a rejection of the extra-statutory remedy proposed, ''Young'' was merely a jurisdictional device. Souter found it implausible that Congress would wish to see their statute made ''completely'' unenforceable simply because they had included a remedy for those injured by the failure of states to abide by it.\n\nJustice Stevens dissented separately, agreeing with the points raised in Souter's dissent, but adding some additional observations. In particular, Stevens noted that neither Justice Iredell's dissent in ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'',<ref name=Chisholm>{{ussc|name=Chisholm v. Georgia|link=|volume=2|page=419|pin=|year=1793|reporter=Dall.|reporter-volume=2}}.</ref> nor the majority opinion in ''Hans'' had addressed situations in which Congress had specifically authorized a lawsuit against a state and suggested that both opinions had in fact presumed that such a suit was possible.\n\n==Subsequent developments==\nThe decision in ''Seminole Tribe'' was described as having \"exemplified the Court's increasingly adamant refusal to countenance the headlong expansion of Congress's regulatory power under the Constitution's Commerce Clause\".<ref name=\"Waltenburg 121\">Eric N. Waltenburg, Bill Swinford, ''Litigating Federalism: The States Before the U.S. Supreme Court'' (1999), p. 121.</ref> In ''[[Alden v. Maine]]'' (1999), the Court clarified:\n\n{{quote|[S]overeign immunity derives not from the Eleventh Amendment but from the structure of the original Constitution itself.... Nor can we conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause or otherwise, the incidental authority to subject the States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers.<ref>''[[Alden v. Maine]]'', 527 U.S. at 732 (1999).</ref>}}\n\nIn ''[[Central Virginia Community College v. Katz]]'' (2006), the Court narrowed the scope of its ruling in ''Seminole Tribe v. Florida''. It held the Bankruptcy Clause of Article I abrogated state sovereign immunity.<ref>''[[Central Va. Community College v.

She almost immediately started doing well on the pro circuit but it was not until 1999 that she won her first title. In the now discontinued Dual Slalom down hill event of that year's ESPN Winter Extreme Games (also known Winter \"X\" Games), Tara took a Gold medal. She would go on to win a further 14 medals in the next seven years of her career including five championships. During this time she also suffered numerous injuries including punctured lungs and a broken foot. Then in September 2007, the most devastating of all; a crash that left her paralyzed from the waist down. She is in rigorous rehabilitation and despite physician's diagnosis of her never being able to walk again, she is determined to not only walk again, but to return to riding a bicycle and even competing.

I can't because you know doctors can come in, and they can walk in... and say, \"you're never going to walk again.\" But, you know what, to me so much of it is mind over matter. They do a test the first week that you're here in Craig and in the test they deemed me \"complete\". What complete means is that basically you're not going to walk again. You know what?

When Molotov is killed by a [[fox]], an enraged Allan gets revenge by blowing up the fox using [[dynamite]], which prompts the authorities to move him to a retirement home in [[Malmk\u00f6ping]]. On the same day as his [[centenary]] celebration, Allan climbs out of the window and disappears, walking to the bus station intending on travelling as far as he can. Whilst waiting for his bus, a young skinhead ([[Simon S\u00e4ppenen]]) angrily demands Allan watch his suitcase whilst he uses the toilet. When the bus arrives, Allan leaves with the suitcase, and travels to the remote location of [[Byringe]]. By the time he leaves Malmkoping, his caretakers have informed the police of his disappearance, and Inspector Aronsson ([[Ralph Carlsson]]) is investigating, unaware of the suitcase in Allan's possession.\n\nIn Byringe, Allan is helped by recluse Julius Jonsson, who helps him fight off the pursuing gangsters to whom the money belongs. While fleeing the scene, Allan and Julius cadge a lift from Benny, an insecure young man, and all three find their way to a smallholding where Gunilla lives with her pet elephant, Sonja. The gangsters meet their individual deaths through misadventure, apart from G\u00e4ddan, their violent boss, who loses his memory after an accident and becomes part of the group.\n\nParts of the film co-exist with the main story as a series of flashbacks in Allan's life. In his childhood, Allan's father invents the [[condom]], an invention that was seen by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish monarchy]] as blasphemous. Enraged, Allan's father travels to [[Russia]] to set up his own republic and support his invention, only to be executed by [[firing squad]]. Whilst still young, Allan's sick mother eventually dies, but her final words to him are never to think or talk too much. In her words, she tells Allan that \"That is what it is, and that it will be what it will be\".\n\nIn his youth, Alan is sent to a mental hospital after accidentally blowing up a local butcher who swindled his mother. Upon being released as an adult, Allan finds work at a cannon foundry, where he befriends Esteban, a [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish revolutionary]]. The talkative Esteban convinces Allan to go with him to Spain to fight the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] regime under [[Francisco Franco]]. Esteban is immediately killed, reminding Allan of his mother's warnings about talking too much. Allan's expertise in [[explosives]] makes his job of blowing up bridges crucial to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] forces. However, moments before destroying a bridge, Allan's love of explosives suddenly palls and he decides to leave. General Franco's staff car approaches the bridge he was supposed to demolish, the explosion taking place seconds after Allan waves down the car, making Allan appear a hero. Franco invites Allan to a dinner, where he presents his favorite pistol to him for saving his life.\n\nYears after the Civil War, Allan sells the pistol to buy a work permit to travel to America. When informed that the [[Manhattan Project|world's biggest bomb is being assembled]], Allan's passion for explosives is re-ignited and he helps [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Robert Oppenheimer]] ([[Philip Rosch]]) in successfully developing the [[atomic bomb]]. For his work, Allan receives praise from U.S. Vice President [[Harry S. Truman]] ([[Kerry Shale]]) for 'building a bomb that will stop all wars'. During a drunken dinner, Truman is informed by telephone that [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], then President of the United States, has died, and Truman is immediately sworn in as President.\n\nAllan returns to Sweden, but on touching down he is met by representatives of the Swedish government, seeking to make use of his knowledge of the atomic bomb. However, they are totally unconvinced that Allan, who never attended a university, could have any vital role in its development of the bomb and they abandon any attempt to interrogate him further. A man named Popov later befriends Allan, gets him drunk and leads him to [[Moscow]]. During a drunken party with [[Josef Stalin]], Allan accidentally admits that he saved Franco's life, causing the infuriated Stalin to imprison Allan in a Siberian [[Gulag|Gulag labor camp]].\n\nThe story continues through other countries and wild adventures, with Allan \"coincidentally\" meeting new people, both famous and ordinary, and causing world changing events, in a way that has been compared with ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/06/the-100-year-old-man-who-climbed-out-of-the-window-review|title=The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared review \u2013 laughs are lost in translation|author=Mark Kermode|date=6 July 2014|website=The Guardian|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> The two storylines of Allan's life in the past, and his adventures since he climbed out of the window, eventually merge.

When Molotov is killed by a [[fox]], an enraged Allan gets revenge by blowing up the fox using [[dynamite]], which prompts the authorities to move him to a retirement home in [[Malmk\u00f6ping]]. On the same day as his [[centenary]] celebration, Allan climbs out of the window and disappears, walking to the bus station intending on travelling as far as he can. Whilst waiting for his bus, a young skinhead ([[Simon S\u00e4ppenen]]) angrily demands Allan watch his suitcase whilst he uses the toilet. When the bus arrives, Allan leaves with the suitcase, and travels to the remote location of [[Byringe]]. By the time he leaves Malmkoping, his caretakers have informed the police of his disappearance, and Inspector Aronsson ([[Ralph Carlsson]]) is investigating, unaware of the suitcase in Allan's possession.\n\nIn Byringe, Allan is helped by recluse Julius Jonsson, who helps him fight off the pursuing gangsters to whom the money belongs. While fleeing the scene, Allan and Julius cadge a lift from Benny, an insecure young man, and all three find their way to a smallholding where Gunilla lives with her pet elephant, Sonja. The gangsters meet their individual deaths through misadventure, apart from G\u00e4ddan, their violent boss, who loses his memory after an accident and becomes part of the group.\n\nParts of the film co-exist with the main story as a series of flashbacks in Allan's life. In his childhood, Allan's father invents the [[condom]], an invention that was seen by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish monarchy]] as blasphemous. Enraged, Allan's father travels to [[Russia]] to set up his own republic and support his invention, only to be executed by [[firing squad]]. Whilst still young, Allan's sick mother eventually dies, but her final words to him are never to think or talk too much. In her words, she tells Allan that \"That is what it is, and that it will be what it will be\".\n\nIn his youth, Alan is sent to a mental hospital after accidentally blowing up a local butcher who swindled his mother. Upon being released as an adult, Allan finds work at a cannon foundry, where he befriends Esteban, a [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish revolutionary]]. The talkative Esteban convinces Allan to go with him to Spain to fight the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] regime under [[Francisco Franco]]. Esteban is immediately killed, reminding Allan of his mother's warnings about talking too much. Allan's expertise in [[explosives]] makes his job of blowing up bridges crucial to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] forces. However, moments before destroying a bridge, Allan's love of explosives suddenly palls and he decides to leave. General Franco's staff car approaches the bridge he was supposed to demolish, the explosion taking place seconds after Allan waves down the car, making Allan appear a hero. Franco invites Allan to a dinner, where he presents his favorite pistol to him for saving his life.\n\nYears after the Civil War, Allan sells the pistol to buy a work permit to travel to America. When informed that the [[Manhattan Project|world's biggest bomb is being assembled]], Allan's passion for explosives is re-ignited and he helps [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Robert Oppenheimer]] ([[Philip Rosch]]) in successfully developing the [[atomic bomb]]. For his work, Allan receives praise from U.S. Vice President [[Harry S. Truman]] ([[Kerry Shale]]) for 'building a bomb that will stop all wars'. During a drunken dinner, Truman is informed by telephone that [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], then President of the United States, has died, and Truman is immediately sworn in as President.\n\nAllan returns to Sweden, but on touching down he is met by representatives of the Swedish government, seeking to make use of his knowledge of the atomic bomb. However, they are totally unconvinced that Allan, who never attended a university, could have any vital role in its development of the bomb and they abandon any attempt to interrogate him further. A man named Popov later befriends Allan, gets him drunk and leads him to [[Moscow]]. During a drunken party with [[Josef Stalin]], Allan accidentally admits that he saved Franco's life, causing the infuriated Stalin to imprison Allan in a Siberian [[Gulag|Gulag labor camp]].\n\nThe story continues through other countries and wild adventures, with Allan \"coincidentally\" meeting new people, both famous and ordinary, and causing world changing events, in a way that has been compared with ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/06/the-100-year-old-man-who-climbed-out-of-the-window-review|title=The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared review \u2013 laughs are lost in translation|author=Mark Kermode|date=6 July 2014|website=The Guardian|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> The two storylines of Allan's life in the past, and his adventures since he climbed out of the window, eventually merge. The police call off the search for Allan, not realising he has anything to do with the loss of the suitcase and money. With the help of Popov's son Oleg, Allan his friends settle down to a life of leisure in Bali.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Gustafsson]] as Allan Karlsson\n* [[Iwar Wiklander]] as Julius\n* [[David Wiberg]] as Benny\n* [[Mia Sk\u00e4ringer]] as Gunilla\n* [[Jens Hult\u00e9n]] as G\u00e4ddan\n* [[Bianca Cruzeiro]] as Caracas\n* [[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]] as Pim\n* [[Sven L\u00f6nn]] as Hinken\n* [[David Shackleton (actor)|David Shackleton]] as Herbert Einstein\n* [[Georg Nikoloff]] as Popov\n* [[Sibylle Bernardin]] as Amanda Einstein\n* [[Kerry Shale]] as [[Harry S.
